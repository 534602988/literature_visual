One of the biggest problems of business practice is how to provide these financial means. Among many other methods, business practice is using factoring as a method of financing. Factoring, as a special method of financing, is realised in practice by factoring contracts. Factoring contract is a legal transaction based on the institute of assignment, under which the creditor assigns its receivables to factor (generally specialized companies). Factoring has some common functions, first and most important of these functions is the, function of financing (of the supplier). Other functions of factoring like advance payment, book keeping, regarding claims, collecting of the claims, protection against failures of payment are also very important. Commercial practice has developed numerous forms of factoring agreements. In spite of their diversity, all kind of factoring agreements have certain common characteristics in terms of their subject mater, conclusion, effect, termination etc. The factoring contracts are not fully encompassed by existing provisions of the law, but are regulated under the UNIDROIT Convention on International Factoring. In this article, the autors are analizing characteristics of factoring and the factoring contract.","[Spasic, Ivanka; Bejatovic, Milorad; Dukic-Mijatovic, Marijana] Univ Business Acad, Fac Law, N Sad, Serbia",,"Spasic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Business Acad, Fac Law, N Sad, Serbia.",ivanka.spasic@sbb.rs; bejatovic@pravni-fakultet.info; marijana.dukic.mijatovic@gmail.com,,"Dukic Mijatovic, Marijana/0000-0003-1327-0889",,,,,101,0,2,1,12,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The methodology is similar to the standard tariff-calculation method used in Brazil. The approach combines the concepts of time-of-use tariffs and Ramsey prices. The process, initially designed for energy consumers, can be used to establish tariffs for micro-generation units. The resulting regulated distribution tariffs, for both consumer and generation units, has an hourly signal associated with long-run marginal costs. Moreover, while minimizing any loss of social benefits, the tariffs comply with the revenue reconciliation constraint. The proposed approach is applied to a real Brazilian distribution system and compared to the current procedure used by the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A linear demand based on the utility function of a representative consumer is assumed, and three game scenarios(Manufacturer Stackelberg, Retailer Stackelbeg and Vertical Nash) are examined under symmetric and asymmetric related channel status. It is shown that no power structure is always the best for the entire supply chain though all members on supply chain have incentive to lead the Stackelberg game. Meanwhile, the vertical Nash game is an equilibrium for the members, however, a Prisoner's dilemma necessarily incurs for the entire supply chain because the Retailer Stackelberg or the Manufacturer Stackelberg can gain the better performance than that in vertical Nash for the entire supply chain when the product substitutability is moderate or higher and the asymmetric relative channel status is moderate, while consumers always get the most welfare from the vertical Nash game.

This paper shows that this uncertainty is a central cause of secession, using a model which incorporates both policies to appease secessionist aspirations and informational asymmetries. In a situation of asymmetric information, in which the policy-maker is better informed about the consequences of separation than the minority leader, signaling incentives make secession the unique equilibrium outcome, whether mutually advantageous compromises exist or not. We also show that the ruling majority may seek to maintain political unity by pre-committing to minority protection rules which prevent bluffing by the informed policy-maker. Additionally, the model generates comparative statics results on the question of which states are most likely to adopt constitutional rules protecting the minorities living within their borders.

Introducing this heterogeneity raises theoretical challenges since (i) earned income becomes an imperfect indicator of underlying ability and (ii) relative concerns may be inadmissable in the social objective. A new behavioural model is developed in which only relatively-concerned individuals choose work effort strategically. Linear tax/transfer systems schemes are then characterized and simulated for a series of welfarist and non-welfarist social objectives, and for different degrees of preference heterogeneity. A key result is that a government which understands the extent of relative consumption concernsbut places no social weight on individuals with such preferencesnevertheless sets a significantly more progressive tax system than a government which ignores relative consumption motivations altogether.","Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",University of Winnipeg,"Dodds, S (通讯作者)，Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.",s.dodds@uwinnipeg.ca,,,,,,,25,7,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

There is a wage decreasing substitution effect, but in contrast, there is a wage increasing effect via labor demand elasticity and effort so that outsourcing and employment effects are also ambiguous.

With this background, this research performed quantitative analysis after collecting and utilizing log data of 346 companies and classing the firms into 6 representative sectors. It will he used for data mining analysis based on Google Analytics in order to measure the performance of the search engine marketing of small and medium exporting companies. For a more reliable qualitative analysis, the research also implemented verification by business sector through a survey about the performance of search engine marketing for 98 companies. The result of the analysis on overseas marketing performance using search engine optimization by 6 representative business sectors has empirically proved that optimizing the company's homepage appropriately on search engines brought an increase of visitors and page views. Consequently, there was an increase in inquiries, which is the actual expression of purchase intent, and this was a great help to the export marketing of SMCs.","[Kang, Hyo-won] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Sang-Jin] Konkuk Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Konkuk University,"Kang, HW (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea.",cas-tle@kku.ac.kr; hwkang@wm.cau.ac.kr; jasonch@dankook.ac.kr,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,30,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

In a welfare-based setting, we estimate by Bayesian methods a number of variants of a New Keynesian macroeconomic model and use both the model odds and posterior densities to design robust interest rate rules consisting of an inflation-forecast-based rule and a wage-targeting one. Each are shown to have distinct robustness qualities and distinct implications for the probability-models approach.

The second and third tests evaluate efficient risk sharing when the hypothesis of homogeneous risk preferences is rejected. We use this method to test efficient risk sharing in rural India. Using the first test, we strongly reject the hypothesis of identical risk preferences.

In particular, we analyze whether non-charitable expenditures for administration, management and fundraising depend on the intensity of competition among NGOs and on the degree to which they are refinanced by governments. We control for NGO heterogeneity in various dimensions as well as major characteristics of recipient countries. We find that fiercer competition is associated with more efficient foreign aid activities of NGOs, rather than leading to excessive fundraising. Official funding tends to increase administrative costs. Nevertheless, officially financed NGOs spend relatively more on charitable activities since they are less concerned with collecting private donations through fundraising efforts.","[Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24100 Kiel, Germany; [Oehler, Hannes] Univ Heidelberg, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Nunnenkamp, P (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24100 Kiel, Germany.",peter.nunnenkamp@ifw-kiel.de; hannes.oehler@awi.uni-heidelberg.de,,,,,,,31,31,48,1,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2012,65.0,1,,,,,81,110,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.201.00528.x,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,882EA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299543200005,0

Two for-profit hospitals compete to attract patients and to affiliate doctors. The numbers of patients and doctors determine an hospital's quality level which is valued on both sides. Quality can be enhanced by doctors through a (costly) effort. We first consider pure salary, case payment or fee-for-service schemes on the doctors' side. Then, we study schemes that mix fee-for-service with either salary or case payments. We show that case payment schemes (either pure or in combination with fee-for-service) are more patient friendly than (pure or mixed) salary schemes. This comparison is exactly reversed on the doctors' side. Quite surprisingly, patients always lose when a fee-for-service scheme is introduced (pure or mixed). This is true even though the fee-for-service is the only way to induce the doctors to exert effort, and whatever the patients' valuation of this effort. In other words, the increase in doctors' effort brought about by the fee-for-service is more than compensated by the increase in fees faced by patients.","[Cremer, Helmuth] Toulouse Sch Econ, IDEI, IuF, Toulouse, France; [Lozachmeur, Jean-Marie] Toulouse Sch Econ, CNRS, IDEI, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,,david.bardey@gmail.com; helmuth.cremer@tse-fr.eu; Jean-Marie.Lozachmeur@TSE-fr.eu,,,,,,,21,2,2,1,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

To tackle this issue, we propose a two-step procedure in which we first endogenously identify groups of regions that converge to the same steady state level, and in a second step we investigate the role of starting conditions and structural characteristics for a region's club membership. Our sample comprises 206 European NUTS2 regions between 1990 and 2002. The results strongly support the existence of convergence clubs, indicating that European regions form six separate groups converging to their own steady state paths. Moreover, estimates from an ordered logit model reveal that the level of initial conditions such as human capital and per capita income plays a crucial role in determining the formation of convergence clubs among European regions.

We consider public facilities that do not suffer from congestion and are non-excludable. We characterize the class of rules satisfying Pareto-efficiency, object-population monotonicity and sovereignty. Each rule in the class is a priority rule that selects locations according to a predetermined priority ordering among interest groups. We characterize the subclasses of priority rules that respectively satisfy anonymity, avoid the no-show paradox, strategy-proofness and population-monotonicity. In particular, we prove that a priority rule is strategy-proof if and only if it partitions the set of agents into a fixed hierarchy. Any such rule can also be viewed as a collection of generalized peak-selection median rules, that are linked across populations, in a way that we describe. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This evidence is in contrast to that from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) which registers a sharp increase in the early 2000s. We investigate whether adjusting measures based on our sources to more closely match the characteristics of the PSID can reconcile this divergence in trends, but do not find a clear explanation for the divergence. We also find little evidence of a rise over this period in the components of volatility: volatility among job leavers, volatility among job stayers, and the fraction of workers who are job leavers.","[Celik, Sule] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Juhn, Chinhui] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Juhn, Chinhui] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [McCue, Kristin] US Bur Census, Washington, DC USA; [Thompson, Jesse] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Houston Branch, Dallas, TX USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University; University of Houston System; University of Houston; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Celik, S (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",suleaytaskin@yahoo.com; cjuhn@uh.edu; KRISTIN.MCCUE@CENSUS.GOV; jesse.thompson@dal.frb.org,,,,,,,36,25,31,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The paper argues that such an approach can effectively tackle the problems of self-selection and multicollinearity. Contrary to previous findings, empirical results based on OLS and 3SLS reveal that travel demand is highly elastic to certain smart-growth features, if they are measured at different spatial scales. The results are robust against alternative sequencing of the hierarchical choice process. An analysis of the quantitative impact of a change in the smart-growth and fuel-tax policies reveals significant returns under both policies. Finally, a simulation based on California suggests that smart growth policies substantially reduce household travel demand.","[Chattopadhyay, Sudip; Taylor, Emily] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Chattopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",sudip@sfsu.edu; etay1210@yahoo.com,,,,,,,20,2,3,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We exploit these changes in a difference-in-differences framework using data from the 1993-2001 waves of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and show that the increase in EITC benefits yielded a significant decline in the likelihood of being a current smoker among unmarried mothers with less than a college degree.

Despite the number and the variety of studies, the evidence on the defence-growth relationship is still far from conclusive. Rather surprisingly, very limited work has been published in the relevant literature for the European Union despite the continuous discussions for a Common European Defence Policy that would require an assessment of the economic effects of defence in this region. To fill in the gap in the literature, this paper employs an augmented Solow-Swan model and estimates it both with panel and time series methods to provide empirical evidence on the economic effects of defence spending in the EU15 over the period 1961-2007. Overall, evidence derived from both panel and time series methods is consistent and suggests that military burden does not promote economic growth in this region.","[Nikolaidou, Eftychia] Univ Sheffield, Int Fac, CITY Coll, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Nikolaidou, Eftychia] Univ Cape Town, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Dunne, John Paul] Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of Cape Town; University of West England,"Nikolaidou, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Int Fac, CITY Coll, Thessaloniki, Greece.",enikolaidou@city.academic.gr,"Dunne, John Paul/K-9455-2019","Dunne, John Paul/0000-0001-6150-7663; Nikolaidou, Eftychia/0000-0001-8685-4442",,,,,34,47,47,3,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

While there will always remain some controversy about the authorship, it is relatively straightforward to find the direct causes that enabled the discovery. We claim the Torrens-Ricardo principle of comparative advantage was a by-product of Napoleonic wars and the resulting continental blockade.

We use detailed information on friends in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Survey (Add Health) to construct two network definitions that are less ad hoc than the school-grade cohorts commonly used in the educational peer effects literature. We demonstrate that accurate definitions of the network seriously impact estimation of peer effects. In particular, we show that peer effects estimates on educational achievement, smoking and drinking are substantially larger with our more detailed measures than with the school-grade cohorts. These results highlight the need to further understand how friendships form in order to fully understand implications for policy that alters the peer group mix at the classroom or cohort level.","[Halliday, Timothy J.; Kwak, Sally] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Halliday, Timothy J.] Inst Study Labor, Bonn, Germany",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kwak, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, 2424 Maile Way,531 Saunders Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kwaks@hawaii.edu,"Halliday, Timothy/F-5032-2010",,,,,,28,25,35,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In addition, we find that long run causality runs in both directions, suggesting that an increase in aid reduces private investment and that, in turn, higher private investment leads to lower aid inflows.","[Herzer, Dierk] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Appl Econometr & Int Econ Policy, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Grimm, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands",Goethe University Frankfurt; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Herzer, D (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Appl Econometr & Int Econ Policy, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",DierkHerzer@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,66,21,22,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Extending the conceptual link among these variables proposed by Hussels et al. (2005), we find that there is an equilibrium relationship between demand, financial development and economic growth. In the short run, economic growth Granger causes insurance demand, and financial development Granger causes economic growth. In other words, financial development does promote real GDP growth, and a change in real GDP leads to deviation in real insurance demand in Taiwan.

The principle 'one size fits all' behind European Central Bank policy activates centrifugal forces. Diverging trends in unit labour costs, external competitiveness and external balances follow. German policy actively supports this. 'Excessive external surplus procedures' against countries generating large surpluses at the expense of domestic consumption (and the partners' rising debt) should be instituted. The Stability and Growth Pact needs modification. The 3% fiscal deficit/GDP mark may prevent automatic stabilisation. Insistence on the budgetary positions being 'close to balance or in surplus' lacks rationale.

This article examines this question by considering a directed policy effort by Syria an economy in transition from both economic centralization and resource dependence to liberalize its trade between 2001 and 2008. In addition to documenting the patterns of diversification at the aggregate level since the implementation of the policy, we also examine factors that are related to diversification at the sectoral level. Our findings suggest that, while Syria has achieved reasonably rapid export diversification, this may to a large extent be the result of structural transformations in the economy, and that further diversification may require continued policy reform designed to strengthen Syria's weak institutional and business environment.","[Lim, Jamus Jerome] World Bank, Dev Prospects Grp, Washington, DC USA; Int Monetary Fund, Strategy Policy & Review Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",The World Bank; International Monetary Fund,"Lim, JJ (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Prospects Grp, Washington, DC USA.",jlim@worldbank.org; csaborowski@imf.org,,"Lim, Jamus/0000-0002-7665-9173",,,,,28,4,7,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Drawn from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research (NHIR) database, a sample of 32 285 Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC) surgery cases performed in all 18 medical centres during the period 1998 to 2004 is analysed. All the medical centres in Taiwan are Not-For-Profit (NFP) in nature. This study thus provides a clear-cut delineation of the learning differences between public and private hospitals. The individual-based approach creates surgeon-specific learning distributions within each institution through a parametric estimation of the hyperbolic model, after controlling for patients' heterogeneity. Investigation of the within- and between-hospital learning differences is accomplished through two nonparametric tests. The results indicate both within- and between-organization learning differences. Compared to senior surgeons, an overall dominance of learning effects among junior surgeons is found. Furthermore, the between-organization comparisons indicate junior surgeons affiliated with private hospitals learn faster than their peers in public hospitals. This suggests potential learning differences in terms of hospital costs may result from hospital ownership.","[Luh, Yir-Hueih; Huang, Fung-Mey; Chien, Yu-Ning] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Lo, Chen-Chih] Danee Silk Int Co, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Huang, FM (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",fmhuang@ntu.edu.tw,,"HUANG, FUNG-MEY/0000-0001-7617-9535",,,,,9,0,0,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Employing a model with endogenous capacity, capacity mix, operations and with uncertain demand we show that 'underinvestment' is due to the rational (non-abusive) behavior of profit-seeking producers and other market participants. Instead of building new capacity that will be idle during most of the year, electricity producers let the electricity price spike (price spikes 'substitute' for capacity). These results hold true when each electricity producer is allowed to construct and operate only one (base or peaking) generation technology or both, although capacity mix, industry profits and consumer surplus may differ substantially between these two market structures. We also show, for both market structures, how CO2 taxes affect consumer surplus and the industry's optimal capacity, capacity mix and profits, and demonstrate that total welfare gains from the CO2 tax may be substantial. Finally, we provide the regulator with easy-to-use tools to decide which market structure is to be preferred in terms of social welfare. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Biases in the estimated elasticities are related to both transitory earnings variation and life-cycle measurement error; the former appear to be more important than the latter.

The interaction of supply and demand is not explicitly modeled, which might lead to biased estimates of potential labor market outcomes. This paper proposes a straightforward method to remedy this shortcoming. We use information on firms' labor demand behavior and feed them into a structural labor supply model, completing the partial analysis of the labor market on the microdata level. We show the performance and relevance of our extension by introducing a pure labor supply side reform, the workfare concept, in Germany and simulating the labor market outcome of the reform. We find that demand effects offset about 25% of the positive labor supply effect of the policy reform. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, allowing for larger sets of admissible weights might lead to increasingly different admissible rankings. In this paper we introduce an axiomatically characterized ranking distance function that is used to explore the pace at which the dissimilarity between different admissible rankings increases as the set of admissible weights that the decision-makers are willing to accept becomes gradually large. This can be very useful in many areas of the social sciences to assess the reliability and robustness of any ranking derived from the values of composite indices when the choice of a specific weighting scheme is controversial.","Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Permanyer, I (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, W Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ip52@cornell.edu,"Permanyer, Inaki/M-3571-2015","Permanyer, Inaki/0000-0002-7051-5144",,,,,14,15,15,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The economic neoliberalism that diffused worldwide after the collapse of the Gold Exchange Standard and the economic crisis of the mid 1970s challenged the European project. Could a specific European model of social market economy help to forge the solidarity and discipline required to meet this challenge? It turned out that members had different understandings of the European model, especially regarding the role of central government. Meanwhile, in all forced adjustments of the European Union (EU) to a more open and competitive world, be it enlargements, new treaties or new institutions, the German conception of social market economy prevailed, mainly because Germany was in a better position than its partners in most cases. A rising discontent progressively eroded the faith in the EU project, even in Germany where a difficult reunification became a major national source of worries. By the end of the 1990s when the euro was finally created, the EU project had lost its momentum. The relative success of the euro in the early 2000s was much linked with the weakness of the dollar.

In this paper we examine whether firms respond differently to positive commodity price shocks than to negative commodity price shocks; that is, whether commodity price volatility alters market power. We exploit recent volatility in food commodity prices over the period 2007-2010 to investigate how commodity price shocks translate into market power in two different vertically-structured food product industries: potatoes and fluid milk. For potatoes, we find both wholesale and retail market power decreases (increases) during periods of rising (falling) commodity prices. Moreover, price-cost margins widen a substantially greater degree in response to negative shocks than margins narrow in response to positive shocks, indicating that commodity price volatility increases market power. For fluid milk, we find that market power likewise declines during periods of rising commodity prices; however, market power does not significantly change during periods of falling commodity prices, suggesting that commodity price volatility decreases market power.

The dynamic conditional correlation model is found to fit the data the best and generates results showing that the stock prices of clean energy companies correlate more highly with technology stock prices than with oil prices.

For this purpose, we analyse the issue in a variety of ways. First, a long-run linkage of real output of the countries is tested using the cointegration analysis. Results suggest that real output of most of the countries in the region is cointegrated and move together in the long-run. To analyse the issue in detail, we focus on the impact of three different shocks, namely global, regional and country-specific, on real output of the countries. Results of impulse response and variance decomposition analysis reveal that regional shocks do not dominate in the sample countries, which is an indication of unfavourable condition to form an optimal currency area (OCA) in the region. These results are further confirmed by the outcome of computation of the modified Bayoumi and Eichengreen's Indices. Finally, we employ the concept of Generalized Purchasing Power Parity (G-PPP), which however reveals that the bilateral real exchange rate of ESEA countries move together in the long-run and share a common stochastic trend, which in turn provides some empirical support for an OCA in the region.","[Sharma, Chandan] Natl Inst Financial Management, Dept Econ, Faridabad 121001, Haryana, India; [Mishra, Ritesh Kumar] GGS Indraprastha Univ, Dept Econ, New Delhi, India",GGS Indraprastha University,"Sharma, C (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Financial Management, Dept Econ, Sect 48, Faridabad 121001, Haryana, India.",chandanieg@gmail.com,"Sharma, Chandan/AAC-4084-2019","Sharma, Chandan/0000-0002-0625-5237; Kumar Mishra, Ritesh/0000-0001-9275-0383",,,,,46,2,2,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

This paper is about his contribution to our field. The Nobel Memorial prize to Thomas J. Sargent and Christopher A. Sims has been awarded for the empirical research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy or, more broadly, for macroeconometrics. One often likes to distinguish between theorists, on the one hand, and empiricists and econometricians, on the other. Thomas J. Sargent holds a unique position in between. A key theme in a large part of his work has been to put the agents in his model on equal footing with the econometrician who is observing data from the model (i.e., to assume that agents are themselves empirical macroeconomists or macroeconometricians). In this paper, I use this theme to examine his work and his contributions to the study of economics.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Uhlig, H (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",huhlig@uchicago.edu,"Uhlig, Harald/C-1717-2014","Uhlig, Harald/0000-0003-0918-032X","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0922550] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,69,2,3,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

A substantial retreat into protectionism may be generated. Huge current account surpluses and deficits have caused economic and financial dislocations in both emerging and advanced economies. In this paper, we argue that such global problem is a result of domestic political pressures that generate strong incentives for governments to postpone needed policy adjustments and the inability of international power relationships to force such adjustments prior to the outbreak of crises. Our analysis leads to the pessimistic conclusion that the pressures from both the public and private sector to bring about substantial policy adjustments before a crisis breaks out are quite weak. In the case of U.S.-China economic imbalances, we find that although China does not have a major policy objective to maintain large current account surpluses as would be implied by the frequent charges that China is practicing mercantilism, political polarization in the USA might make it almost impossible to secure agreement on effective actions. In the case of euro crisis, nor are we optimistic that euro zone will undertake any time soon the types of forceful policy actions necessary to bring the euro crisis under control.","[Willett, Thomas D.] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont Inst Econ Policy Studies, Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA USA; [Willett, Thomas D.; Chiu, Eric M.

The system of Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) is estimated for both quintile income shares and mean income growth by controlling for macroeconomic variables, and Kendall's tau statistics are derived for income dependence. Results from less restrictive copula models corroborate the regression-based results. However, income growth models do not support the common claim that the rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer. Income dependence patterns do not appear to be affected by business cycles, but Democratic and Republican presidential administrations have drastically different income dependence results.","[Zimmer, David M.; Kim, H.

Our proxy for capabilities is the distance from the technological frontier. Estimation is carried out with System Generalized Methods of Moments and is robust to various specifications. Our identification strategy is limited to the average (reduced form) effect. We find a strong effect of capabilities on the amount invested in R&D, after controlling for demand pull, technology push, size, and cash constraints. The latter ones are the main variables used in the literature on the determinants of innovative expenditure, of which R&D is one of the components. The elasticity of the distance from the technological frontier is 10%, of similar magnitude (but opposite sign) with regard to the effect of internal resources. When we allow for heterogeneous impact, clustering the industries according to their technological level, we see that the effect of capabilities is robust, but concentrated in Medium and Low Tech sectors. Moreover, the effect is stronger in the upswings of the business cycle and is concentrated in peripheral countries. These latter stylized facts may suggest that the divergence induced by lack of capabilities is somehow nonlinear and increases when a critical mass is missing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The paper presents a political economy model of bailouts, where the conditions, their implementation, and market reception are considered as forms of a social dilemma. In such situations, expectations about the actions of other actors approximated by the concepts of trust or distrust play a critical role.

J,"Krabec, T",,,,"Krabec, Tomas",,,ASSET VALUATION STANDARDS: A FUNCTIONAL-INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH,PRAGUE ECONOMIC PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,valuation standards; market value,,"The article focuses on the elaboration and research of the real nature of standards of value. The methodology chosen for this paper is mainly based on the late institutional economics and European theories of the economic and legal order, such as the German ordoliberalism. It is argued that standards (International Valuation Standards, European Valuation Standards, IDW S 1 etc.) are not determined by the stage of development of economic theory, but rather by valuation best practices. The standards of value, which are normatively defined, first enable us to connect the valuation and the valuation purpose. The value standard or the contained value basis establishes the connection between the value and the valuation purpose, and make the estimated value relevant, or subject to the valuation purpose. Further, the purpose of the standards as a set of rules is examined, and the entities involved in the formulation of the standards and its influence are closely connected. There were identified three driving forces shaping the current scope and status of both international and national valuation standards: firstly, the state and legislation (hard and soft law), secondly, science providing a methodological background, and lastly, joint interest groups, such as appraisers and appraisers' associations who are generally responsible for the final versions of the standards. Since Czech commercial law does not precisely address all possible market transactions and applicable standards of value, it is argued that the International Valuation Standards can and should also be applied in the Czech Republic, since their purpose would show its effect in the Czech Republic, too. Other inspiration for business valuation can be found in the German IDW S 1 standard.","[Krabec, Tomas] Univ Econ, W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Krabec, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",krabec@yahoo.com,,,Research Project of the Faculty of Finance and Accounting of University of Economics [IP100040],Research Project of the Faculty of Finance and Accounting of University of Economics,This paper was written with the support of the Research Project of the Faculty of Finance and Accounting of University of Economics within the framework of an institucional support No. IP100040.,,28,8,8,3,11,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In this experimental study, the participants share a loss in a Nash bargaining game, but waiting time, instead of monetary losses, serves as an incentive. Further, we assume that the participants prefer less, rather than more, waiting time. Our experiment consists of four versions of the Nash bargaining game to allow for a comparison of four classical negotiation concepts (Nash, equal loss, equal gain, and Kalai-Smorodinsky) and an equal split of the overall waiting time. Our experimental evidence shows that an equal split better predicts the outcome of a Nash bargaining game involving losses than classical concepts do. Furthermore, the findings support that the participants resort to equal splits at the cost of their overall welfare. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using plot-season level survey data, we test the existence of a technology gap between the two types of production, and calculate their environmental efficiency scores based on the level of pure nitrogen use, which is considered as an environmentally detrimental input within the framework of the stochastic frontier analysis. Our analysis reveals that organic farming loses its environmental performance at high nitrogen levels and that during the initial conversion period to organic farming newly converted organic farmers increase the use of external nutrients such as nitrogen to compensate for potential yield losses. These results highlight the uncertainty with which conventional farmers initially tend to view organic farming. However, we find that the experience gained by organic farmers over time helps them increase and maintain the environmental efficiency. We warn against the rapid expansion of organic farming and recommend more technical support and strict nutrient regulation to foster the environmental efficiency of organic farming.

To remedy this situation, this study provides a set of detailed estimated fiscal reaction functions (or fiscal rules) governing these responses for a panel of twenty OECD countries. A number of commonalities and differences emerge. In general, the countries in the panel adjust tax revenues strongly in response to the public debt, and they adjust tax revenues and transfer payments but, interestingly, not tax rates or government purchases, strongly in response to output. Furthermore, a high rate of transfer payments is associated in the cross-section with reduced output volatility. These results support some recent developments in the theoretical literature, namely, an increased emphasis on the effects of countercyclical transfer payments as an anti-cyclical fiscal policy instrument.

In particular, the paper tries to answer if the correlations between these important variables change abruptly in high volatile periods and if they do, is this change temporary or permanent? In that manner, we first estimate the dynamic correlations between these variables using the VAR(p)-FIAPARCH(1,d,1)-cDCC(1,1) approach. Then, we endogenously detect the volatility shift dates by a novel method of penalized contrast functions and investigate the relation between the dynamic correlations and the high volatile periods. Results reveal that volatility shocks create abrupt changes in the dynamic correlations, however this effect is only short term and do not sustain between consecutive high volatility regimes.

We use plant-level data on exporters' export intensity to identify the changes in iceberg costs over this period. Given this change in iceberg costs, we find that a GE model with heterogeneous establishments and dynamic exporting decision from a sunk cost of starting to export is consistent with both aggregate U.S. export growth and the changes in the number and size of U.S. exporters. The model also captures the gradual response of U.S. exports to the cut in iceberg costs. A model with a static exporting decision generates substantially less trade growth and misses out on the timing of export growth. We also study the interplay between changes in the structure of manufacturing and trade. We find that the growth in trade contributed little to the contraction in U.S. manufacturing while changes in the structure of manufacturing from changes in sectoral productivity, capital intensity, idiosyncratic shocks, and corporate taxation reduced U.S. export growth by as much as 10%.

The main finding of this paper is that the focus on the primacy of legal and political institutions may be misplaced and that business-friendly economic policies (proxied for here by the World Bank's Doing Business indicator) are the key determinant of the level of income per capita. We find that a country's Doing Business rank dominates a range of measures of legal and political institutional quality as an explanatory variable for income per capita.

What accounts for California's apparent savings? Some credit the strict energy efficiency standards for buildings and appliances enacted by California in the mid-1970s. They argue that the growing gap between California and other states demonstrates that other states and countries could replicate California's gains by adopting California-style regulations, and that California should build on its own success by tightening its standards further. Skeptics might point to three long-run trends that differentiate California's electricity demand from other states: (1) shifting of the U.S. population toward warmer climates of the South and West; (2) relatively small income elasticity of energy demand in California's temperate climate; and (3) evolving differences between the demographics of households in California and other states. Today, differences in climate and demographics account for almost 90 percent of the difference between California's and other states' residential electricity use. That difference thus provides no lessons for other states or countries considering adopting or tightening their own energy efficiency standards. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show that international trade increases the conflict of interest between CEO/owners and middle managers within firms and these eventually lead to decentralized corporate hierarchies.

A rolling horizon has the effect of removing the scarcity consideration of resource owners when stocks are large. Hence, extraction will be non-decreasing and resource prices non-increasing for a long period of time and there will be no connection between the price growth and the interest rate - in line with the trends of a majority of exhaustible resources in the last century. A calibration of the model to the oil market yields a price which closely fits the gradually falling real oil price after WWII and the sharply increasing price after 1998. This suggests that, while long run scarcity was not an important parameter on the oil market in the 20th century, it has been important in shaping the oil price from around 1998 and onwards.

Therefore, the effective evaluation of the quality of bank websites is a point of concern for customers, owners, and researchers. The primary goal of the study is to propose a hybrid model of AHP and COPRAS-G methods for evaluating the website quality of banks. Furthermore, this study sheds light on understanding weights of evaluation criteria related to quality of bank websites. In this study, the weights of the evaluation criteria are computed by AHP method. Next, COPRAS-G is used to assess the quality levels of the websites and to rank them. A case study of evaluating the quality of bank websites of seventeen banks in Turkey is used to demonstrate the applicability and the effectiveness of this model. Empirical findings show that banks in Turkey utilize the Internet to its full potential to improve their websites. Furthermore, Garanti Bankasi has the best overall performance, followed by TEB, and Ziraat Bankasi. Additionally, the top-five evaluation criteria in order of importance are relevance, richness, understandability, navigability, and response time. Overall, the results show that this model provides a comprehensive and systematic approach that quantitatively measures a website's quality.","Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-03030 Afyon, Turkey",Afyon Kocatepe University,"Ecer, F (通讯作者)，Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, ANS Campus, TR-03030 Afyon, Turkey.",fecer@aku.edu.tr,"Ecer, Fatih/AAE-8455-2020","Ecer, Fatih/0000-0002-6174-3241",,,,,88,62,63,0,35,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

It tests the hypothesis that the degree of capital mobility can be estimated by measuring the reaction intensity of capital flows to shocks in interest rates on a sample of eight European post-transition economies. This hypothesis can be derived from the Mundell-Fleming open economy model, the implications of which are essentially based on the assumption of a close link between the degree of capital mobility in a country and the reaction of its capital flows to changes in domestic and external interest rates. Precisely because of this interrelationship, policy makers, in theory, face the policy 'trilemma' or the 'impossible trinity', i.e. the inability to achieve the following three objectives simultaneously - a stable exchange rate, financial openness and an independent monetary policy. Using impulse response and historical decomposition analysis in a VAR framework, the results show a significant increase in the explanatory power of interest rates for the movement of capital flows shortly before and after the accession of post-transition economies to the European Union. On the other hand, the recent financial crisis made capital flows less sensitive to interest rates owing to increased risk aversion on international capital markets. Results suggest that the degree of capital mobility, i.e. the level of financial integration with EU-15, is highest in Bulgaria, Latvia and Lithuania and least pronounced in Poland and Croatia. Results are verified by a number of robustness checks, with three separate alternative measures of capital mobility confirming the results obtained from the econometric model.","Univ Zagreb, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Globan, T (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",tgloban@efzg.hr,"Globan, Tomislav/H-7550-2018","Globan, Tomislav/0000-0001-5716-2113",,,,,43,5,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,OCT 2,2014,26.0,4,,,,,459,476,,10.1080/14631377.2014.964459,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AR8LT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343827400002,0

In particular, a flexible exchange rate is required for an independent monetary policy. Capital controls may help a country with a fixed exchange rate to gain some policy space but the effect of capital controls is leaky and often short-lived. We revisit these conventional wisdoms and find no strong evidence supporting them in practice. In particular, a flexible exchange rate does not reliably deliver monetary policy independence, but capital controls do. This is consistent with the view that most (developing) countries dislike either depreciation or appreciation of their currencies, and therefore would choose to follow US monetary policy moves even if they are on a flexible exchange rate regime. In other words, to build resilience to international monetary policy shocks, capital controls are a necessarily component.","[Han, Xuehui; Wei, Shang-Jin] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Han, XH (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines.",xuehuihan@adb.org,,"Han, Xuehui/0000-0003-2152-798X",,,,,15,8,8,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

To this end, I develop a macroeconometric model where the capital adequacy ratio, lending rates, asset prices and credit interact with each other and with the real economy. The empirical results suggest that changes in capital requirements are primarily transmitted via lending rates to the other variables in the model. The proposed increases in capital requirements under Basel III are found to have significant effects especially on house prices and credit. I also derive optimal paths for the counter-cyclical capital buffer in response to various shocks. The buffer is found to equal its imposed ceiling of 2.5% in response to most of the shocks considered while its duration varies in the range of 1-12 quarters depending on the shock and its persistence.

We find that gender quotas are associated with an increase in the quality of elected politicians, with the effect ranging from 0.12 to 0.24 years of education. This effect is due not only to the higher number of elected women, who are on average more educated than men, but also to the lower number of low-educated elected men.

Individual peasants' labour is often split (typically over different times of the year) into two or more parts as a result of institutional factors. Individuals work both as peasants on the land and as temporary migrant workers in urban areas (or in rural non-agricultural sectors). We examine this issue using province-level panel data. The present study provides a new interpretation of the phenomenon of labour shortages in coastal cities and rising rural migrant wages in China in recent years, and discusses whether the Lewisian turning point has been reached. Under part migration, the rural labour supply to urban areas is smaller than would be the case with full migration of workers to urban areas, so that the Lewisian turning point occurs earlier. This finding has important policy implications for China's future development.","[Cai, Yinyin] Southeast Univ, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ng, Yew-Kwang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore",Southeast University - China; Nanyang Technological University,"Cai, YY (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jiulonghu Campus, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yyincai@126.com,"Ng, Yew-Kwang/AAM-1664-2021","Ng, Yew-Kwang/0000-0001-5669-9883",,,,,25,9,9,0,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

This wisdom is based on the observation that social security pays benefits as life annuities and therefore appears to complete the market. However, we argue that common wisdom is based on a benefit-only analysis that ignores a fundamental cost social security crowds out the bequests that households leave (and receive) in general equilibrium. We conduct a general equilibrium cost-benefit analysis of the longevity insurance role of social security. and we show that under certain conditions this decline in bequest income offsets any possible gains from access to a public annuity pool. We abstract from distortions to national income and factor prices to show that the equilibrium bequest channel is all that is needed to reach this conclusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Uncertainty in subsidies for green technologies is considered as an example. Technological progress is exogenous and modeled as a jump process with a drift. The analytical solution is presented for cases when there is no subsidy uncertainty and when the subsidy changes once. The case when the subsidy follows a time invariant Markov process is analyzed numerically. The results show that improving the innovation process raises the investment thresholds. When technological jumps are small or rare, this improvement reduces the expected time before technology adoption. However, when technological jumps are large or abundant, this improvement may raise this expected time.","Univ Tehran, Fac Econ, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran,"Dehghani, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Fac Econ, N Kargar Ave, Tehran, Iran.",dehghani@utexas.edu,"Dehghani, Mohammad/N-2748-2017","Dehghani, Mohammad/0000-0002-7763-9940",,,,,18,2,2,2,27,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We find that increases in the SEC's resources both improve compliance and lead to an increased activity level of the SEC.

Before 1971 spouses were taxed jointly. This meant that the wife's financial gain of working was a function of the husband's income. The higher income of the husband, the lower was the wife's work incentive ceteris paribus. After the reform, the link between the husband's income and the wife's participation tax rate was, in principle, abolished. This paper exploits a rich longitudinal register data source and the large variation provided by the individual tax reform to analyze the evolution of female employment in Sweden in the years surrounding the 1971 reform. I provide clear evidence that employment grew considerably more among women married to high-income earners in the years following the announcement of the reform, especially among households with kids.

I propose a quantitative life-cycle model with college enrolment. Altruistic parents provide financial support to their children. Using counterfactual experiments, I find that 24 percent of all households are financially constrained in their college decision. Constraints become more severe over time. I show that my model is consistent with a narrow college enrolment gap between students from rich and poor families, as previously reported in the empirical literature. The estimation of enrolment gaps is a popular reduced-form approach for measuring the fraction of constrained households. My results suggest that these reduced-form estimates are misleading, and that a structural model of parental transfers is needed to correctly identify constrained households. Further, I show that parental transfers are an important driver behind the changing role of family income as a determinant of college entry, a fact that is well documented for the US economy.","Univ Zurich, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Winter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",christoph.winter@econ.uzh.ch,,,,,,,76,7,9,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

The two-tier system of wage bargaining provides microeconomic efficiency and wage compression. Combined with a vintage approach to the process of creative destruction we show how wage compression fuels investments, enhances average productivity and increases the mean wage by allocating more of the work force to the most modern activities.

Our analyses utilize membership data from 32 consortia in wireless telecommunication technology subfields from 2000 to 2005 and prior art citations in standard-essential patents. We find that connections among firms in informal and technically-oriented consortia significantly increase the likelihood that firms cite each other's patents in subsequent patents essential for the UMTS wireless telecommunication standard. Inventions that are likely to become part of the UMTS system tend to build on inventions by firm peers who were members of the same consortia, controlling for patent or firm fixed effects, technology class, and other characteristics. Consortia may enhance productivity of invention and increase the incentives to invest in R&D by internalizing potential externalities. They may also enhance efficiency of standardization by facilitating the interaction of committee and market processes. Consortia thus structure and constrain the process of innovating standardized technologies. This is problematic if consortia are not truly accessible for all the relevant parties. Policymakers thus need to balance these effects. For managers, the results show that participation in a variety of technical consortia enables influencing peers' innovation strategies related to compatibility standards. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, we first use different indicators of environmental pollution along with a measure of energy use intensity in a panel dataset consisting of 152 countries over the period 1999-2009 and empirically examine the relationship between pollution and the shadow economy. The estimation results show that there is an inverse-U relationship between the size of the informal economy and environmental pollution, that is, small and large sizes of the informal economy are associated with lower environmental pollution and medium levels of informality are associated with higher levels of environmental pollution. Next, we build a two sector dynamic general equilibrium model to suggest an economic mechanism for this observation. Our model identifies two channels through which informality might affect environmental pollution: The scale effect, whereby a larger (smaller) informal economy size is associated with a lower (higher) level of environmental pollution, and the deregulation,effect, whereby a larger (smaller) informal economy is associated with higher (lower) pollution levels. As these two effects work in opposite directions, the changing relative strength of one with respect to the informal sector size creates the inverted-U relationship between pollution indicators and informality.

In a dynamic, heterogeneous firms model, trade policy uncertainty will delay the entry of exporters into new markets and make them less responsive to applied tariff reductions. Policy instruments that reduce or eliminate uncertainty, such as binding trade policy commitments at the WTO, increase entry. The predictions are tested on disaggregated, product-level Australian imports with model-consistent measures of uncertainty. The estimates show that growth of exporter-product varieties would have been 7% lower between 1993 and 2001 without the binding commitments implemented after the WTO was formed in 1996. If Australia reduced all its tariffs and bindings to zero, more than half of predicted product growth is accounted by removing uncertainty. These results illuminate and quantify an important new channel for trade creation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Financial regulation policy uncertainty (FRPU) is quantified with a news-based index developed by Baker et al. (2013). Particular attention is paid to the reaction of corporate credit spreads to FRPU shocks. The linear VAR results suggest that exogenous increases in the FRPU index trigger increases in the cost of external finance as well as a persistent negative impact on the real economy. By using a nonlinear (Smooth-Transition) VAR model, I then show that these effects are asymmetric over the business cycle, i.e., credit spreads are estimated to rise three times more during recessions than in non-recessionary periods. Importantly, in both the linear and nonlinear models, FRPU shocks account for large shares of the variability of unemployment and credit spreads. My findings are supported by various robustness checks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, its environment is being plundered at all levels, local, national, and global. The stresses that result raise the fundamental question of whether the aspirations of Indians for greater material comfort can ever be fulfilled. The current 5-year plan aims for 'Faster and More Inclusive Sustainable Growth' but it is clear that the emphasis of the Plan is mostly on growth and inclusion, rather than sustainability. A modelling exercise reported here suggests that a 'visionary development' growth scenario with major social and environmental benefits is possible for India at low cost. However, combining that scenario with a low-carbon growth trajectory consistent with international aspirations to limit climate change would be significantly more expensive. As it is not clear that the Indian people would be willing to bear these extra costs, some combination of accelerated low-carbon innovation, technology transfer from developed countries, and climate finance from outside the country will be needed if green growth is to take root in India.","Integrated Res & Act Dev IRADe New Delhi, New Delhi, India",,"Parikh, KS (通讯作者)，Integrated Res & Act Dev IRADe New Delhi, New Delhi, India.",kparikh@irade.org,,,,,,,23,4,5,1,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Since these two series are cointegrated during the sample period (January 1961-June 2013), a short-run dynamic model is thus estimated for each country in which all coefficients and the error-variance terms can freely switch over time between two values prevailing in Regimes 0 and 1. Previous studies indicate that the price of crude oil does not currently affect the aggregate CPI as much as it did in the 1970s. This finding is not disputed in this paper. However, the sequentially-determined break date as well as the time-varying regime-switching probabilities point to two new findings. First, the marginal effects of changes in oil price on consumer energy prices (not the aggregate CPI) have consistently increased and become more instantaneous for both countries after the Western U.S. Energy Crisis of 2000. Second, the speed of adjustment (proxied by different error-correction coefficients) has also risen, particularly for the U.S. Therefore, oil prices exert far more positive and immediate impacts on energy costs in the post- rather than pre-1999 periods.

Offshoring an intermediate is only profitable when it has matured sufficiently and the savings in production cost outweigh the underinvestment due to incomplete contracts abroad. We derive how equilibrium sourcing decisions of different intermediates depend on one another. In particular, we demonstrate that the maturity threshold to offshore additional parts is higher when some other parts are already sourced from the low-wage country. This prediction is robust to an alternative way of modeling the bargaining process, but it only holds if foreign suppliers are held sufficiently close to their reservation wage. If suppliers are able to capture most of the rents, the prediction reverses. Using information on U.S. imports of automotive parts, we illustrate that for most countries the price at which they first export a part tends to be higher for parts that are only exported later, consistent with offshoring becoming gradually more difficult.

We investigate the stationarity of per capita real GDP from the nonlinear point of view and provide robust evidence that clearly indicates that real output is well characterised by a nonlinear, mean-reverting process, namely Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Senegal, Sierra Leone and South Africa. Our evidence points that these seven countries are nonlinear stationary, implying that per capita real GDP follows a steady rate of growth, and policy innovations then have temporary effects.

The article addresses them by highlighting three main characteristics of the Spanish economy in the pre-crisis period: (1) a composition of economic activity increasingly biased towards construction, real state, and other non-tradeable sectors, (2) a banking system that was able to satisfy the huge increase in credit demand arising from households and firms, in a context of very low real interest rates, excessive optimism about growth, and large facilities for using real assets as loan collateral, and (3) the recourse to external funding that originated an unprecedented increase in liabilities with respect to the rest of the world.","[Jimeno, Juan F.] Banco Espana, Div Res, Madrid, Spain; [Santos, Tano] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA",Banco de Espana; Columbia University,"Jimeno, JF (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Div Res, Madrid, Spain.",juan.jimeno@bde.es; js1786@columbia.edu,"Jimeno, Juan F/AAF-6141-2020",,,,,,24,30,31,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

After deriving general results, the analysis is further extended by considering the steady state distribution in three cases of a normally distributed error process, a non normally (exponentially) distributed steady-state process and a switching random walk with a fairly general lid error process.

This evidence suggests that for-profit hospitals extract some indirect benefit when providing uncompensated care. Our article investigates how physician board membership affects uncompensated care provision. With data for hospitals in California from 1997 to 2010, we estimate a fixed-effect model where uncompensated care is a function of physician board membership, other board attributes, as well as hospital characteristics. Our results indicate that physician board membership in for-profit hospitals relates positively with uncompensated care provision. Prior evidence, such as Goldstein and Ward (2004) and Molinari et al. (1995), has shown that involving physicians in strategic decisions improves hospitals' financial performance. Our results reinforce the notion that having physicians in leadership or strategic positions benefits for-profit hospitals. In these hospitals, physicians seem to understand the strategic component of providing uncompensated care, possibly due to their closer assessment of patients' needs.","Univ Vale do Rio Sinos UNISINOS, BR-93022000 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil",,"Costa, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Vale do Rio Sinos UNISINOS, Ave Unisinos 950, BR-93022000 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil.",landradec@unisinos.br,,"De Andrade Costa, Luciana/0000-0002-7575-2405",,,,,39,5,6,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main functions of the innovation system of developing countries are capture, imitation, learning by doing and diffusion of knowledge, to reduce technology gaps with technology frontiers. Hence, the purpose of measuring innovation performance in a developing geographical area should be the evaluation on its success in technological learning and catching-up. Using the learning and technology gap concepts, in this paper we develop a novel model of measuring innovation performance of developing countries/regions, based on common regional statistics. In the virtual absence of mandatory firm level surveys, this model can provide a useful method to compare the innovation behaviour of regions for policymaker. Running the model with the data from the Iranian provinces, the paper concludes each province has its own specific innovation behaviour stemming from different historical development paths and geographical characteristics.","[Ghazinoory, Sepehr; Riahi, Parisa; Azar, Adel] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Tehran, Iran; [Miremadi, Tahereh] Iranian Res Org Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University,"Ghazinoory, S (通讯作者)，Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Tehran, Iran.",ghazinoory@modares.ac.ir,"Ghazinoory, Sepehr/D-6543-2011; Ghazinoory, Sepehr/AGA-3874-2022; Riahi, Parisa/ADN-2072-2022; Miremadi, Tahereh/ABF-3926-2021; Ghazinoory, Sepehr/M-3915-2019; azar, adel/ABC-3067-2021","Ghazinoory, Sepehr/0000-0002-6761-4694; Riahi, Parisa/0000-0001-7740-2831; azar, adel/0000-0003-2123-7579",,,,,41,15,17,1,42,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We analyze the relationship between dropping out of high school and the probability of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Previous studies on the relationship between dropout status and sexual outcomes have not empirically addressed unobserved heterogeneity at the individual level. Using fixed effects estimators, we find evidence supporting a positive relationship between dropping out of high school and the risk of contracting an STI for females. Furthermore, we present evidence that illustrates differences between the romantic partners of dropouts versus enrolled students. These differences suggest that female dropouts may be more susceptible to contracting STIs because they partner with significantly different types of people than do nondropouts. Our results point to a previously undocumented benefit of encouraging those at risk of dropping out to stay in school longer.","[Anderson, D.

The theory predicts an inverted-U relation between guilds and market size: for small markets, firm profits are insufficient to cover the fixed cost of adopting the new technology, and hence, specialized workers have no reason to form guilds; for intermediate sized markets, firm profits are large enough to cover the higher fixed costs, but not large enough to defeat workers' resistance, and so workers form guilds and block adoption; and for large markets, these profits are sufficiently large to overcome worker resistance and so guilds disband and the more productive technology diffuses throughout the economy.

As a result, the size distribution of firms is visibly distorted: there are many firms with exactly 49 employees. We model the regulation as the combination of a sunk cost that must be paid the first time the firm reaches 50 employees and a payroll tax that is paid each period thereafter when the firm operates with more than 50 employees. We estimate the model using indirect inference by fitting the discontinuity of the size distribution. The key finding is that the regulation is equivalent to a combination of a sunk cost approximately equal to about 1 year of an average employee salary and a small payroll tax of 0.04%. Our structural model fits well the discontinuity in the size distribution. Removing the regulation improves labor allocation across firms, leading in steady state to an increase in output per worker slightly less than 0.3%, holding the number of firms fixed. However, if firm entry is elastic, the steady-state gains are an order of magnitude smaller.","[Gourio, Francois] Boston Univ, Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Gourio, Francois] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Roys, Nicolas] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; Boston University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Gourio, F (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",francois.gourio@chi.frb.org; nroys@ssc.wisc.edu,"Roys, Nicolas/K-6863-2016","Roys, Nicolas/0000-0001-5404-7240",,,,,23,56,71,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Yet, this simple and attractive property is violated by virtually all multidimensional poverty indices proposed in the literature so far because they stick to the so-called 'Strong Focus' axiom. This paper characterizes a class of multidimensional poverty indices that allows for certain trade-offs between deprived and non-deprived attributes when measuring individuals' deprivation. The empirical results based on 'Demographic and Health Surveys' from 54 countries suggest that our assessments of multidimensional poverty can differ dramatically when the overly restrictive Strong Focus is abandoned in favor of weaker versions of the axiom.

The advantage of this model lies in its incorporation of the re-exported CO2 emissions component embodied in trade and its ability to differentiate domestic-sourced CO2 emissions from foreign-sourced CO2 emissions in trade. The results show that carbon emissions embodied in both China's exports and imports increased significantly during 1995-2009. One important reason for this is that the re-exported carbon emissions embodied in China's imported intermediate inputs increased substantially during this period. Our research reveals that accelerating the transformation of trade pattern and upgrading processing trade should be emphasized in the formulation of policy to prompt CO2 emissions abatement in China.","[Zhao, Yuhuan; Zhang, Zhonghua; Wang, Song; Wang, Shaojun] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology,"Zhao, YH (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",zhaoyuhuan@bit.edu.cn; zhangzhonghua@bit.edu.cn; bitsmewangsong@gmail.com; wwshjj@126.com,"Wang, Song/P-8816-2015; Wang, Song/AFR-4964-2022","Wang, Song/0000-0002-7790-6527; Wang, Song/0000-0002-7790-6527; ZHANG, Zhonghua/0000-0003-2788-6350",,,,,36,28,30,6,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2014,22.0,4,,,,,102,120,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12077.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AN4YU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340596700006,0

We then introduce two alternative measures of implicit off-balance sheet liabilities related to the risk of a systemic bank crisis. The first one relies on microeconomic data at the bank level. The second one is based on econometric estimations of the probability and the cost of a systemic banking crisis. The former approach provides an upper evaluation of the fiscal cost of systemic banking crises, whereas the latter one provides a lower one.

The model is only appropriate for determining whether pay differences between, for example, whites and non-whites doing job assignment A are attributable to prejudice ('within-assignment discrimination'). It is inappropriate, however, for determining whether pay differences between whites in job assignment A and non-whites in job assignment B reflect discriminatory behaviour ('cross-assignment discrimination'). We test the model of such cross assignment discrimination developed by Bodvarsson and Sessions (2011) using data on Major League Baseball hitters and pitchers for four different seasons during the 1990s, a decade during which monopsony power fell.

The key idea is that a fair society should produce outcomes that depend on individuals' effort and not on their external circumstances such as gender, socioeconomic background, etc. We propose measuring inequality of opportunity as the welfare loss attributed to the outcome differences among individuals who exert a similar level of effort. Our results are in line with those aspects of fairness literature that give priority to the ex post compensation approach to equality of opportunity. Finally, we present an empirical application for the measurement of the welfare loss in the income distribution in Europe. We have observed a high degree of heterogeneity among European countries. The welfare loss due to inequality of opportunity ranges in those, from basically zero to almost one fifth of their potential welfare.","[Calo-Blanco, Aitor] Univ A Coruna, Dpto Anal Econ & Admon Empresas, La Coruna 15071, Spain; [Ignacio Garcia-Perez, J.] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain",Universidade da Coruna; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Calo-Blanco, A (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dpto Anal Econ & Admon Empresas, Campus Elvina S-N, La Coruna 15071, Spain.",aitorcalo@gmail.com,"Garcia Perez, J Ignacio/JWP-2410-2024; Calo-Blanco, Aitor/J-2784-2017; Garcia Perez, Jose Ignacio/D-2755-2009","Calo-Blanco, Aitor/0000-0003-3957-4741; Garcia Perez, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-9074-7313",,,,,34,4,4,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

We observe a wide variation in program effectiveness across different interventions depending on outcomes, types of beneficiaries, and country context. Overall, entrepreneurship programs have a positive and large impact for youth and on business knowledge and practice, but no immediate translation into business setup and expansion or increased income. At a disaggregate level by outcome groups, providing a package of training and financing is more effective for labor activities.

Most authors therefore consider linear demands and constant marginal costs. However, within this framework, the non-negativity constraint on prices (and quantities) has not been properly dealt with and the correct calculation of all Bayesian Nash equilibria is more complicated than expected. Moreover, multiple symmetric and interior Bayesian equilibria may exist for an open set of parameters. The reason for this is that linear inverse demand is not really linear, since there is a kink at zero price: P(Q)=max{a-bQ,0} rather than P(Q)=a-bQ.","[Hurkens, Sjaak] CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Barcelona, Spain; [Hurkens, Sjaak] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Hurkens, Sjaak] Univ Navarra, IESE Business Sch, Publ Private Sect Res Ctr, Navarra, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Barcelona School of Economics; University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Hurkens, S (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Barcelona, Spain.",sjaak.hurkens@iae.csic.es,"Hurkens, Sjaak/H-6287-2015","Hurkens, Sjaak/0000-0002-8472-5740",,,,,25,3,4,1,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

Claims of outperforming the random walk in terms of the root mean square error are false because they are typically based on the introduction of dynamics, hence a random walk component, commonly without testing for the statistical significance of the difference between root mean square errors. And even if proper hypothesis testing reveals that a dynamic model outperforms the random walk, this amounts to beating the random walk by a random walk with the help of some explanatory variables.

The analysis makes two contributions. First. I examine the consequences of preference uncertainty for the information aggregation problem and show that the relative attractiveness of allowing a given agent to cast the decisive vote is increasing in the stability of his preferences. Second, I analyze the costs and benefits of pre-communication disclosure of the realized biases. I find that, conditional on the decision structure, disclosing the bias of the decisive agent is never optimal while disclosing the bias of the other agent is always optimal. This result makes an asymmetric treatment of the agents in terms of disclosure policies often optimal, despite the additional benefit of disclosure, which is the ability to condition the decision-making structure itself on the disclosed biases.

The long-run equilibrium relationships tend to be stronger across instruments within each market and generate economically insignificant portfolio adjustment weights.

This study confirms some of the negative effects of motherhood on wages as found in the previous literature. The effect of a first child is on average 8.1 % at age 23, 22 % at age 33, 4.8 % at age 42 and 0 % at age 51. The effect of a second child is 16 % on average at age 33 only.

Firms produce the same good by means of a polluting technology which uses fossil energy. However, these firms can adopt clean technology which uses renewable energy, having lower costs. Interestingly, opening markets to international competition increases the per-unit emission-tax and decreases the per-unit production subsidy. The socially optimal adoption date under a common market better internalizes transboundary pollution than that under autarky. In autarky (resp. a common market), firms adopt the clean technology earlier (resp. later) than what is socially optimal and, therefore, regulators induce clean technology adoption at the socially optimal adoption date by firms postponing (resp. speeding up) adoption subsidies. Opening markets to international trade speeds up socially optimal adoption dates and reduces global flow of pollution.","[Ben Jebli, Mehdi] Univ Tunis El Manar, FSEG Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia; [Ben Jebli, Mehdi] Univ Jendouba, ISI Kef, Jendouba, Tunisia; [Ben Youssef, Slim] Manouba Univ, ESC Tunis, Manouba, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Universite de Jendouba; Universite de la Manouba,"Ben Youssef, S (通讯作者)，Manouba Univ, ESC Tunis, Manouba, Tunisia.",benjebli.mehdi@gmail.com; slim.benyoussef@gnet.tn,,"Ben Jebli, Mehdi/0000-0001-6248-7094; Ben Youssef, Slim/0000-0002-4297-3367",,,,,29,5,5,0,17,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 15,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201419.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-19,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1MS,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339611000001,0

This article uses a linearization method to derive the sampling variances for recently introduced distributionally sensitive richness measures when estimated from survey data. The results are derived for two cases: (1) when the richness line is known and (2) when it has to be estimated from the sample. The proposed approach enables easy consideration of the effects of a complex sampling design. Monte Carlo results suggest that the proposed approach allows for reliable inference in case of 'concave' richness indices, but that it is not satisfactory in case of 'convex' richness measures. The standard bootstrap methods give similar results for 'concave' measures, but they are also unreliable for 'convex' indices. The performance of the bootstrap inference can be improved in some cases using a semi-parametric approach. The variance formulae are illustrated with a comparison of wealth richness in Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.","Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Brzezinski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",mbrzezinski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Brzezinski, Michal/N-3365-2013","Brzezinski, Michal/0000-0002-7704-3805",,,,,39,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

According to this representation an event is at least as likely as another if and only if there is a consensus among all the priors that this is indeed the case.

Results show that, on average, the health insurance coverage increases nonmedical-related consumption by more than 5%. This insurance effect is observed even in households with no out-of-pocket medical spending. In addition, the insurance effect is stronger in households with worse self-reported health status. These results are consistent with the precautionary savings argument. The insurance effect also varies by household experience with the program. In particular, the effect is significant only in villages where some households have actually obtained reimbursement from the insurance program. The program within these villages stimulates less consumption among new participants than among households that have participated in the program for more than a year.

This paper develops and uses a high-resolution monthly forest clearing database for 74 tiger habitat areas in ten countries to investigate habitat threats for Bengal, Indochinese, Malayan and Sumatran tigers. The econometric model links forest habitat loss and forest clearing to profitability calculations that are affected by market expectations, environmental conditions and evolving patterns of settlement, among others. It uses new spatial panel estimation methods that allow for temporal and spatial autocorrelation. The econometric results emphasize the role of short-run market variables, including the exchange rate, real interest rate and prices of agricultural products in forest clearing, with considerable variation in the estimated timing for response and impact elasticities across countries. The results highlight a critical message for the conservation policy community: Changes in world agricultural-product markets and national financial policies have significant, measurable effects on tropical forest clearing, with variable time lags and degrees of responsiveness across countries. Measuring these effects and pinpointing areas at risk can provide valuable guidance for policymakers, conservation managers, and donor institutions. (C) 2014 The World Bank.

What has contributed to China's trade surplus has been a puzzle. Many researchers have attempted to discover the determinants that are responsible for China's trade imbalance but their findings are inconclusive or debatable. This paper offers new insights into the determinants of China's trade balance. In this study, the re-export role of Hong Kong in the trade of China's mainland is examined and the actual level of bilateral trade flows between China and each of its major trading partners is then re-estimated. Both these treatments are the first time employed in the literature, representing a major innovation in studying China's trade balance. The analysis with re-estimated trade data reveals that labour costs, income, foreign direct investment (FDI) and the exchange rate are all important determinants of China's trade surplus. However, the low labour cost has a much greater impact on China's trade surplus, followed by FDI. The exchange rate is also important but not as critical as many others have claimed.","[Gu, Xin] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xin; Zhou, Zhang-Yue; Beg, A.

From this novel flexible framework, our main findings are threefold. First, monetary policy rules change gradually, pointing to the importance of applying a time-varying estimation framework. Second, the interest-rate smoothing parameter is much lower than typically reported by previous time-invariant estimates of policy rules. External factors matter for all countries, although the importance of the exchange rate diminishes after the adoption of inflation targeting. Third, the response of interest rates to inflation is particularly strong during periods when central bankers want to break a record of high inflation, such as in the United Kingdom or Australia at the beginning of the 1980s. Contrary to common perceptions, the response becomes less aggressive after the adoption of inflation targeting, suggesting a positive anchoring effect of this regime on inflation expectations. This result is supported by our finding that inflation persistence typically decreased after the adoption of inflation targeting.","[Baxa, Jaromir; Horvath, Roman] Charles Univ Prague, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Baxa, Jaromir] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vasicek, Borek] Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech National Bank,"Horváth, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",roman.horvath@gmail.com,"Horvath, Roman/AAX-8903-2020; baxa, Jaromir/K-3195-2019; Horvath, Roman/AAD-8248-2019","Horvath, Roman/0000-0002-9036-9746; baxa, Jaromir/0000-0002-9768-209X;",,,,,66,17,19,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This job upgrade was associated to a 0.7% increase in native wages for a doubling of the immigrants' share. These results are robust to the use of an IV strategy based on past settlement of immigrants across European countries. The job upgrade slowed but did not come to a halt during the Great Recession. We also document the labor market flows behind it: the complexity of jobs offered to new native hires was higher relative to the complexity of lost jobs.

Moreover, this inequality gap has further widened during this period as the U.S. has experienced a large increase in wage inequality, whereas the CEU has seen only modest changes. This article studies the role of labour income tax policies for understanding these facts, focusing on male workers. We construct a life cycle model in which individuals decide each period whether to go to school, work, or stay non-employed. Individuals can accumulate human capital either in school or while working. Wage inequality arises from differences across individuals in their ability to learn new skills as well as from idiosyncratic shocks. Progressive taxation compresses the (after-tax) wage structure, thereby distorting the incentives to accumulate human capital, in turn reducing the cross-sectional dispersion of (before-tax) wages. Consistent with the model, we empirically document that countries with more progressive labour income tax schedules have (i) significantly lower before-tax wage inequality at different points in time and (ii) experienced a smaller rise in wage inequality since the early 1980s. We then study the calibrated model and find that these policies can account for half of the difference between the U.S. and the CEU in overall wage inequality and 84% of the difference in inequality at the upper end (log 90-50 differential). In a two-country comparison between the U.S. and Germany, the combination of skill-biased technical change and changing progressivity of tax schedules explains all the difference between the evolution of inequality in these two countries since the early 1980s.","[Guvenen, Fatih] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Guvenen, Fatih] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kuruscu, Burhanettin] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Ozkan, Serdar] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Toronto; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Guvenen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,"Guvenen, Fatih/GSN-2353-2022","Ozkan, Serdar/0000-0001-6364-9606","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1024786] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,52,54,74,2,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

It analyses whether the monetary authority reacts to changes in economic activity, financial markets, monetary conditions, the foreign exchange market and the commodity price. We assess the importance of nonlinearity using a smooth transition regression (STR) model. Using quarterly data over the time period 1990:1 to 2008:4, we find that considerations about the output gap and the real effective exchange rate (in the case of Brazil), and the inflation rate (for China) explain the nonlinear adjustment of the central bank rate. Moreover, the results suggest that central banks pursue a target range for the threshold variable rather than a specific point target. In the case of China, the McCallum rule shows that the GDP growth, the interest rate and the commodity price drive the response of the growth rate of the relevant monetary aggregate.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, Evry, France; [Jawadi, Fredj] FBS Campus Amiens, Evry, France; [Mallick, Sushanta Kumar] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England; [Sousa, Ricardo Magalhaes] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Sousa, Ricardo Magalhaes] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universite Paris Saclay; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universidade do Minho,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@france-bs.com,"Sousa, Ricardo/N-9015-2019; Sousa, Ricardo/F-8013-2010","Mallick, Sushanta/0000-0003-3851-3680; Sousa, Ricardo/0000-0002-8279-5753; JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,38,33,34,0,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Since a consumer is subject to temptation in the period that he signs a contract, banks might exploit his desire for instant gratification even as they help him to commit for the future. Without banking, savings decisions and welfare are not monotonic in the degree of time-inconsistency. Consequently, commitment savings will lower welfare for moderately time-inconsistent agents. If loan contracts are enforceable, pure commitment savings will disappear. This will further lower welfare if the lender is a profit-maximizing bank, but raise welfare if the lender is a welfare-maximizing NGO. Finally, I consider the coexistence of a bank and NGO. There will be zero takeup of NGO-provided commitment savings if there is competition from a moneylender. But the NGO's offer will raise the agent's reservation utility, thus reducing the surplus that can be extracted by the moneylender. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It suggests that the leverage cycle played a central role in the recent American and European financial crisis. In the leverage cycle, asset prices and leverage rise when volatility is low and then fall as volatility rises. Sometimes asset prices fall so far below debt levels that it would be better for everybody if debt were partially forgiven. The paper recommends that central banks regularly monitor and forecast the whole credit surface, and in extreme cases intervene to regulate risky interest rates and impose partial debt forgiveness.

A distinctive feature of reallocations is that, by definition, they involve no augmentation of resources and, as such, leave the marginal distribution of the reallocated input unchanged. Nevertheless, if the production technology is nonseparable, they may alter average output. An example is the reallocation of teachers across classrooms composed of students of varying mean ability. We focus on the effects of reallocating one input, while holding the assignment of another, potentially complementary, input fixed. We introduce a class of such reallocationscorrelated matching rulesthat includes the status quo allocation, a random allocation, and both the perfect positive and negative assortative matching allocations as special cases. We also characterize the effects of small changes in the status quo allocation. Our analysis leaves the production technology nonparametric. Identification therefore requires conditional exogeneity of the input to be reallocated given the potentially complementary (and possibly other) input(s). We relate this exogeneity assumption to the pairwise stability concept used in the game theoretic literature on two-sided matching models with transfers. For estimation, we use a two-step approach. In the first step, we nonparametrically estimate the production function. In the second step, we average the estimated production function over the distribution of inputs induced by the new assignment rule. Our methods build upon the partial mean literature, but require extensions involving boundary issues and the fact that the weight function used in averaging is itself estimated. We derive the large-sample properties of our proposed estimators and assess their small-sample properties via a limited set of Monte Carlo experiments. Our characterization of the large-sample properties of estimated correlated matching rules uses a new result on kernel estimated 'double averages,' which may be of independent interest.","[Graham, Bryan S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Graham, Bryan S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Imbens, Guido W.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ridder, Geert] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University; University of Southern California,"Graham, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bgraham@econ.berkeley.edu; imbens@stanford.edu; ridder@usc.edu,"imbens, guido/P-2333-2019; Graham, Bryan S/H-4515-2011","Graham, Bryan/0000-0002-9637-5282",,,,,58,14,16,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

First, municipalities with higher income inequality or higher median income allocate less of a revenue shock to education and are less likely to expand public school enrollment. They are more likely to invest in public infrastructure that is broadly enjoyed, like parks and roads, or to save the shock. Second. I find no evidence that the quality of public education suffers as a result. If anything, unequal and high-income areas are more likely to improve public school inputs and test scores following a revenue shock, given their heavy use of private education.I further provide evidence that an increase in public sector revenue lowers private school enrollment.

It can be seen-as an extension of the paired comparison techniques for the simultaneous presentation of several items together to respondents. A respondent identifies the best and the worst ones and estimation of utilities is performed using a multinomial-logit (MNL) model in numerical nonlinear estimations. The main contribution of this paper consists in finding an analytical closed-form solution producing an approximation of the results for utilities and choice probabilities that are obtained using MNL models. The analytical formulae permit the inference of the characteristics of the model's quality, including standard errors of the utilities and choice probabilities, the residual deviance and pseudo-R-2. This approach enriches the BWS methods and is useful for theoretical descriptions and practical applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The secondary objective of this paper is to explain how and why the famous credit default swaps (CDSs) markets expanded and why they contributed to the recent financial crisis. In addition, I propose a new financial instrument to hedge default risk (credit default sharing) based on the principles of risk-sharing and Islamic insurance, takaful (sharing responsibility and mutual cooperation), as a substitute for CDSs.

We use annual time-series to estimate dynamic panel data models that exploit all sample information (i.e., we do not only use 5-year averages as is standard in the literature). We find the rate of conditional convergence to be around 4, and the growth impact of FDI and DI to be greater the greater is the change in the degree of economic openness. We also find a net crowding out effect between both types of capital so that larger amounts of FDI reduce the impact of DI on economic growth (and vice versa). These results are obtained through the estimation of multiplicative interaction models which allows us to evaluate the interactions between changes in openness, DI and the net flows of FDI. This constitutes a novelty in the appraisal of the globalisation and investment impact on economic growth.","[Sala, Hector; Trivin, Pedro] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Bellaterra, Spain; [Sala, Hector] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",Autonomous University of Barcelona; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Sala, H (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Bellaterra, Spain.",hector.sala@uab.es,"Sala, Hector/K-6370-2017","Sala, Hector/0000-0002-3043-2790; Trivin, Pedro/0000-0003-2277-0279",,,,,32,19,19,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

However, the future income that will repay this debt is uncertain, so risk can be inefficiently distributed. This paper shows that when debt contracts are written in terms of money, a monetary policy of nominal GDP targeting improves the functioning of financial markets. By insulating households' nominal incomes from aggregate real shocks, this policy effectively achieves risk sharing by stabilizing the ratio of debt to income. The paper also shows that when there is price stickiness, the objective of improving risk sharing should still receive considerable weight in the conduct of monetary policy relative to stabilizing inflation.","London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sheedy, KD (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,"Sheedy, Kevin/0000-0002-0247-6323",,,,,59,19,20,0,14,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Characteristics, roles and determinants of trade with RE system components remain blurred. Policies are important in promoting RE utilization and innovation. Yet, their effect on determining exports remains ambiguous. The Porter hypothesis and the lead-market literature argue that environmental regulation leads to comparative export advantages. Empirical studies, however, reach diverging conclusions, rarely focus on the RE-sector and use broad proxies of environmental regulation.Focusing on solar energy technology components (SETCs), we believe this is the first study describing structure and development of international trade and estimating the role of RE policies on determining trade flows. We empirically estimate a gravity trade model using Poisson-Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood (PPML) estimation to test the role of RE policies and trade barriers on SETC exports. We use panel data representing annual bilateral trade flows of 21 OECD countries exporting SETCs to 118 importing countries between 1999 and 2007.We find a rapidly growing market with trade dominated by Europe. The study supports the Porter and the lead-market hypotheses as early adopters of RE policies gained a comparative advantage. Analysing the importer side, the study suggests that regulatory policies and import tariffs determine SETC export flows.","German Inst Econ Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Groba, F (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",Felix.Groba@gmx.net,,,,,,,84,26,28,2,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To do so, we conducted an experiment in which graders are offered a bribe to report a better grade. Three treatments are conducted by framing economically equivalent contracts as menus of bonuses, penalties, or bonuses and penalties. We find that graders are more corrupt when incentives are framed as a combination of bonuses and penalties, while no difference is found between the bonus and the penalty contracts.

These models ignore the possibility that freer trade also alters the firm-size distribution via international firm migration (offshoring); firms must, by assumption, produce in their birth nation. We show that when firms are allowed to switch locations, new productivity effects arise. Freer trade induces the most efficient small-nation firms to move to the large nation. The large country gets an extra helping of the most efficient firms while the small nation's firm-size distribution is truncated on both ends. This reinforces the large-nation productivity gain while reducing or even reversing the small-nation productivity gain. The small nation is nevertheless better off allowing firm migration.","[Okubo, Toshihiro] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; [Baldwin, Richard E.] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",Keio University,"Baldwin, RE (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",okubo@econ.keio.ac.jp,,"baldwin, richard/0000-0002-1965-4157","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22243023, 25285080] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,29,10,12,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Institutions such as collective bargaining, minimum wages, employment protection and unemployment benefits affect the way in which wages respond to labor supply shocks, and, hence, the labor market effects of immigration. We employ a wage-setting approach which assumes that wages decline with the unemployment rate, albeit imperfectly. We find that the wage and employment effects of immigration depend on wage flexibility and the composition of the labor supply shock. In Germany immigration involves only moderate wage, but large unemployment effects, since immigrants are concentrated in labor market segments with low wage flexibility.

Technological innovation and territorial restructuring have also deeply modified cities' emerging socio-economic systems. At the centre of change are the three major global cities - New York, Tokyo and London (Sassen, 1993). Other cities that have been affected by the liberalization and creation of a global economy are found mainly in newly industrializing Asian countries such as Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong. Bombay, Mexico City and cities in South America are among countries in the developing world that have experienced some change in their economies in response to changing world conditions, but are still constrained by protectionist policies.

Productivity gains in US manufacturing increase US consumption and investment vis-a-vis foreign countries, resulting in a trade deficit and higher international prices of US goods, despite the rise in their supply. Financial adjustment works via a higher global value of US equities, real dollar appreciation, and an expansion of US gross foreign liabilities as well as assets. Positive demand shocks to US manufacturing also increase investment and cause a real dollar appreciation, but have limited effects on the trade balance and net foreign assets.

Political institutions are the key determinant of which regime an economy belongs to, while economic institutions have a direct impact on growth rates within each regime.

However, second movers reward conformity less when it is common knowledge that opinions can be manipulated strategically. Introducing a monetary cost for changing opinion reduces ingratiation. Introducing performance-related pay for the second mover makes ingratiation less rewarding but does not eliminate it completely. Reducing the noise in the measurement of ability has little effect.

I assume that banks can use sovereign bonds for repurchase agreements with a common central bank, and that their sovereign partially backs up any losses should the banks not be able to repurchase the bonds. I argue that regulators in risky countries have an incentive to allow their banks to hold home risky bonds and risk defaults, whereas regulators in other safe' countries will impose tighter regulation. As a result, governments in risky countries get to borrow more cheaply, effectively shifting the risk of some of the potential sovereign default losses on the common central bank.","[Uhlig, Harald] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Uhlig, Harald] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Uhlig, H (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 East 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",huhlig@uchicago.edu,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017; Uhlig, Harald/C-1717-2014","Uhlig, Harald/0000-0003-0918-032X","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1227280] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,9,28,33,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The obtained results show a relatively optimistic outlook on yield, production and trade toward 2050. The outcomes of calorie availability suggest that China will be able to maintain a level of at least 3,000 kilocalories per day through 2010 to 2050. Overall, Chinese agriculture is relatively resilient to climate change. It is unlikely that Chinese food security by 2050 will be compromised in the context of climate change.

However, this alternative direction of the causality of demand for money-credit and economic activity has been present in the heterodox economic thought since the 1930s and should be reconsidered in the current situation. In this context, the numerous episodes of housing bubbles, which have been taking place since 2007, create the perfect environment to explore the notion of dynamic monetized production economy. Our theoretical framework is estimated econometrically by using a sample of 6 developed economies which spans from 1970 to 2011. The non-stationary nature of our data recommends the use of cointegration techniques (Soren Johansen 1995) in order to estimate our models.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Arestis, Philip] Univ Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain; [Gonzalez, Ana Rosa] Cambridge Econometr, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge; University of Basque Country,"González, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",pa267@cam.ac.uk; ar.gonzm@gmail.com,,"Gonzalez-Martinez, Ana Rosa/0000-0002-1198-9681",,,,,38,4,5,0,17,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2014,61.0,2,,,,,145,160,,10.2298/PAN1402145A,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AE2CI,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333780500001,0

The opposite is true for Japan, Germany, and China. Moreover, I document the emergence from the mid-nineties of a strong negative relation between specialization in the export of services and the current account balances of a large sample of OECD and developing countries. Starting from these new stylized facts, I propose in this paper a service hypothesis for global imbalances, a new explanation based on the interplay between the U.S. comparative advantage in services and the asymmetric trade liberalization process in goods trade versus service trade that took place starting in the mid-nineties. First. I use a structural gravity model to show that service trade liberalization lagged behind goods trade liberalization, and I quantify the extent of this asymmetry. Second.! show that a simple two-period model can rationalize the emergence of current account deficits in the presence of such asymmetric liberalization. The key inter-temporal mechanism is the asymmetric timing of trade policies, which affects saving decisions. Finally, I explore the quantitative relevance of this explanation for global imbalances. I introduce trade costs in an otherwise standard 2-sector 2-country international real business cycle model. When fed with the asymmetric trade liberalization path found in the data, the model generates a trade deficit of about 5% of GDP. I conclude that the service hypothesis for global imbalances is quantitatively relevant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We study the change in equilibrium behavior from the addition of another audience as well as from varying the degree of conflict between the sender's and receivers' preferences. We find that, as in cheap talk games with just one receiver, information transmission is higher in games with a separating equilibrium, than in games with only a babbling equilibrium. More interestingly, we find clear evidence that the addition of another audience alters the communication between the sender and the receiver in a way consistent with the theoretical predictions. There is evidence of the presence of agents that are systematically truthful as senders and trusting as receivers: deviations from the theoretical predictions, however, tend to disappear with experience, and learning is faster precisely in the games where deviations are more pronounced.

We study a two-sector (i.e., tradable and non-tradable) small open economy. The tradable sector is the engine of growth, and productivity growth is increasing with the amount of labor employed by firms in the tradable sector. A period of large capital inflows, triggered by a fall in the interest rate, is associated with a consumption boom. While the increase in tradable consumption is financed through foreign borrowing, the increase in non-tradable consumption requires a shift of productive resources toward the non-tradable sector at the expenses of the tradable sector. The result is stagnant productivity growth.

First we calculate the forward and backward linkages of FDI. Then through empirical estimation, we find that only private firms have financing constraints and that the incoming FDI alleviates this situation. Private firms with more foreign capital shares or having stronger vertical linkage with FDI can get financial resources easily. Furthermore, industries hosting a large amount of FDI are favorite clients of the financial institutions because they are usually much more competitive in the world. As a result, the private firms in these industries also have easier access to financial resources. In the financial market, FDI is a helping hand that reduces the information asymmetry between firms and financial institutions. Financial resources go where FDI goes, which to some extent improves the allocation efficiency.","[Chen, Lin] E China Normal Univ, Sch Business, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Luo, Changyuan] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; Fudan University,"Luo, CY (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",chyluo@fudan.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,7,7,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Healthier and wealthier. Pl Are health gains arising from wealth growth? Or, has a healthier population enabled substantial growth in wealth? We contribute to understanding the dynamic links between wealth and health by examining for causal, rather than associative, links between health (as measured by infant mortality rate) and wealth (as measured by GDP per capita) for a panel of 58 developing countries using quinquennial data covering the period 1960-2005. Estimating as a panel allows us to account for unobserved heterogeneity, as well as permitting heterogeneous causal effects. We test for panel and country-specific noncausality, and we explore robustness of outcomes to level of economic development (as measured by national income), whether we account for bias in least squares estimators, and to our heterogeneity assumption on the causal coefficients. Overall, our panel tests detect bidirectional links between wealth and health, compatible with other research. However, our country-specific work suggests that the panel results arise from the dominance of a few countries, as there is evidence of noncausality between health and wealth for a majority of countries. These findings contrast with earlier research, and likely arise from different metrics being used to measure the health of a nation. Our work highlights the usefulness of panel causality tests accompanied by unit specific analysis and the importance of examining different metrics for health.","[Chen, Weichun] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Clarke, Judith A.; Roy, Nilanjana] Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Victoria,"Clarke, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC, Canada.",jaclarke@uvic.ca,"Dutta Roy, Nilanjana/AAC-7347-2022",,,,,,64,18,19,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The current account deficit also narrowed sharply, turning into a surplus in the first part of 2013 for the first time in the past 24 years, before reaching a record-low of 1 percent of GDP at end-2013. We show that in Romania the cumulated exports-to-cumulated imports index signals the closing (opening) of a deflationary (contractionary) GDP gap when it starts decreasing (increasing).

Risk and uncertainty are rendered indistinguishable on the subjectivist approach insofar as an individuals subjective estimate of the probability of any event can be elicited from the odds at which she would be prepared to bet for or against that event. The risk/uncertainty distinction has however never quite gone away and is currently under renewed theoretical scrutiny. The purpose of this article is to show that de Finettis understanding of the distinction is more nuanced than is usually admitted. Relying on usually overlooked excerpts of de Finettis works commenting on Keynes, Knight and interval valued probabilities, we argue that de Finetti suggested a relevant theoretical case for uncertainty to hold even when individuals are endowed with subjective probabilities. Indeed, de Finetti admitted that the distinction between risk and uncertainty is relevant when different individuals sensibly disagree about the probability of the occurrence of an event. We conclude that the received interpretation of de Finettis understanding of subjective probability needs to be qualified on this front.","[Feduzi, Alberto] SOAS Univ London, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Feduzi, Alberto; Runde, Jochen] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Feduzi, Alberto] Univ Rome III, Rome, Italy; [Zappia, Carlo] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Cambridge; Roma Tre University; University of Siena,"Feduzi, A (通讯作者)，SOAS Univ London, Dept Financial & Management Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",af19@soas.ac.uk,,"ZAPPIA, CARLO/0000-0003-2471-5839; Runde, Jochen/0000-0001-9596-5144",,,,,73,17,18,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We develop a model that provides a new explanation for this behavior: office holders undertake debt-financed public projects, but postpone the timing of part of the output to the next term. This makes it difficult to replace them. As a consequence, the office holders' reelection chances rise-as does public debt. As a potential remedy for this inefficiency, we allow candidates for public office to offer government debt-threshold contracts. Such a contract contains an upper limit for government debt and the sanction that an office holder violating this limit cannot stand for reelection. We show that such competitively offered contracts contain low debt levels that limit debt financing and improve the citizens' welfare. When negative macroeconomic events occur, government debt-threshold contracts may be violated, and the economy is stabilized.","[Gersbach, Hans] ETH, CER, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gersbach, Hans] CEPR, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Gersbach, H (通讯作者)，ETH, CER, Zuerichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hgersbach@ethz.ch,,,,,,,19,1,1,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Based on the series of Hausman post-estimation test, result from the PMG is upheld. The saving-retention coefficient, showing the level of international capital mobility, reads 0,89; 0,93 and 0,16 for the high-income group, OECD category and non-OECD category respectively. This suggests lower capital mobility in high-income as a whole and OECD countries, and higher capital mobility in the non-OECD countries. The contradictory findings confirmed that the Feldstein-Horioka saving-retention coefficient is unlikely, a viable option of measuring cross-border capital mobility. Further researches therefore need to re-observe the qualification of saving-retention coefficient in explaining international capital mobility.","[Hassan, Ibrahim Bakari; Azali, Mohamed; Lee, Chin] Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Hassan, IB (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",ibrahimbakari@yahoo.com; azali@putra.upm.edu.my; leechin@econ.upm.edu.my,"MOHAMED, AZALI/ABA-2000-2021; Lee, Chin/AAR-5222-2020","Lee, Chin/0000-0002-8651-2204; Hassan, Ibrahim Bakari/0000-0003-0219-9845",,,,,28,5,5,0,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The baseline search and matching model with stochastic labour productivity fails to match the Okun's coefficient, because it generates a too low unemployment volatility and a too high correlation between labour productivity and unemployment. The model is capable of matching the coefficient if it is extended with an addition of employment separation shocks plus a high calibrated value of nonmarket activities.

This paper focuses on the problem of inequality of direct payments distribution that exists between large farms and small farms in the Czech Republic. The paper analyses the impact of proposed progressive capping scenario on the viability of large farms and assesses the effectiveness in reaching the reduction of inequality pursued by this measure. With the use of a CGE model, it is shown that there could be expected significant structural changes that will be accompanied by a decline in number of large farms in favour of smaller groups of farms. This result suggests that large farms in the Czech Republic do not seem to benefit from the economies of scale and they are equally dependent on subsidies as other farms. With respect to the distributional changes, the paper demonstrates that the progressive capping could moderately reduce the inequality in direct payment distribution but it can create another inequality if it comes to the distribution of direct payments per employee.","[Kristkova, Zuzana] Ceska Zemedelska Univ Praze, Fak Provozne Ekon, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Ratinger, Tomas] Technol Ctr AV CR, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences,"Krístková, Z (通讯作者)，Ceska Zemedelska Univ Praze, Fak Provozne Ekon, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",kristkova@pef.czu.cz; ratinger@tc.cz,,,,,,,33,3,3,0,19,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The model predicts a number of stylized facts observed in the U.S. labor market, including persistent aggregate wage inequality, prevalent within-firm wage equality, overlapping wage distributions for different worker types, and some, but imperfect, job sorting/segregation. Numeric simulations are offered to illustrate some of the model's predictions. These include a counterintuitive relationship between wage inequality and equal wage policies that can arise in special cases: under specific assumptions equal wage policies can actually increase the steady-state level of market discrimination.

In this paper, we show that a standard flexible price model with labor market frictions that allows hiring costs to depend on technology shocks may also lead to the same negative impact on labor inputs.

The first group consisted of the entities that have previously executed an initial public offering (IPO), the second one included the entities that considered doing so in the past or are IPO candidates. The survey results can be summarized as follows. First, raising external capital as a reason for IPO received a strong support from the respondents of both groups of companies. Next, more than 50 % of respondents in each group believe that IPO will have a positive effect on its image and publicity. Most of the respondents also believe that IPO will improve the company valuation, strengthen the management's bargaining position in negotiations with providers of external capital, and increase the attractiveness of the company as an employer. Thirdly, the respondents do not see debt reduction as a reason to go public. Low level of support was given to other reasons, which include withdrawal from the venture capital fund, diversification of the existing shareholders' portfolios, and solution to the succession problem. The results of this survey made it possible to formulate new insights as contributions towards a better understanding of corporate financing strategies under the specific conditions of the CEE region.","[Meluzin, Tomas; Zinecker, Marek] Brno Univ Technol, CZ-61200 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Meluzin, T (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, CZ-61200 Brno, Czech Republic.",meluzint@fbm.vutbr.cz; zinecker@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Zinecker, Marek/AAL-5760-2021","Meluzin, Tomas/0000-0001-5238-5166",,,,,29,12,15,1,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Given such phenomenon, the existence of transparency related to accounting information in financial markets is a significant issue. IFRS standards have some prerequisite to get the maximum output in terms of getting quality reports. These prerequisites include investor protection, strictly enforced laws, transparency, and active stock market. This study investigates the economic consequences of mandatory IFRS reporting in the domain of value relevant of accounting information in Pakistan. We used panel data methodologies by incorporating the Ohlson (1995) price and product valuation model. The Study has utilized the data of one hundred and seventy (170) firms listed on the Karachi stock exchange from 2006-2010. The overall results show that both earnings per share and book value have positive and significant influence on the share price. Furthermore, the relationship between share price, book value, and earnings per share signifies that relationship tends to deteriorate with the passage of time following IFRS implementation. The study further finds that book value is more relevant than earning per share in pooled, fixed, and random effect.","[Rehman, Ijaz Ur] Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Shahzad, Faisal] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Attock, Pakistan",Universiti Malaya; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Rehman, IU (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",ejaaz.1983@gmail.com; faisal_shahzad@comsats.edu.pk,"Rehman, Ijaz/E-1783-2011","Rehman, Ijaz/0000-0003-2181-0929",,,,,50,11,13,1,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Moving towards the competition on quality, the knowledge and technology are increasingly becoming the drivers for competitiveness and sustainable growth while the competition on lower costs is facing difficulties due to the rising costs of labour and other resources. The research study examines the structure of Lithuanian origin exports by the quality elasticity, factor inputs and labour skills modes, which characterise the quality peculiarities of exports. The competitiveness of Lithuanian exports is based on employing lower costs rather than on creating quality advantages. Thus, the analysis of the structure of Lithuanian origin exports by commodities sensitivity to price versus sensitivity to quality is a significant research problem facing the tendencies of rising resource and labour costs and losing lower costs advantages. Policy makers monitoring the industrial structure have to focus on the structural upgrading within sectors on the basis of exports quality. The core aim of the research study is to reveal the exports structure by Revealed Quality Elasticity (RQE), Factor inputs and Labour skills of Lithuanian manufacturing industries. The study is intended to analyse the main changes in exports structure aiming to answer the question what shifts have occurred in the long run and how the exports have been affected by economic integration and globalization processes. The relevance of the empirical study is denoted by the lack of the detailed research on the quality of Lithuanian exports as well as the changes in exports quality by different modes. The main scientific problem raised in this empirical study is the disclosure of what shifts have occurred in the exports quality during the period of 2003-2012 and how these shifts will affect the future exports development. From an individual country's perspective, it is important to identify the internal and external factors which affect the upgrading quality of exports. This empirical study employs the RQE, Factor inputs and Labour skills taxonomies to classify the Lithuanian exports by different dimensions, and illustrates the solutions of the raised research problem. Altogether, the taxonomies make a profile of Lithuanian origin exports structure regarding the quality dimension and serve as a measure to forecast the long-term trend of export development. The results of the empirical study have revealed that Lithuanian origin exports share taken by high RQE industries declined during the period of 2003-2012, and was twice as low as the average of EU-27, where High RQE accounts for nearly a half of the total exports. The largest exports share was made by Medium RQE industries, and this confirms the fact that a certain share of Lithuanian exports remains price-sensitive and competes on the basis of lower costs. The analysis of Lithuanian exports by Factor inputs taxonomy revealed the low share of technology driven and marketing driven industries. Nevertheless, by improving the quality of exports, Lithuanian producers can expand their trade markets in high-income countries, which tend to import more high quality commodities, establish long term relations with purchasers and attract knowledge-intensive foreign direct investment.","Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Saboniene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.saboniene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,27,3,3,0,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The global economic crisis that emerged in 2008 gave a new impetus to this research because numerous scientific studies appeared in which inequalities were given as one of the key causes of the crisis from which the world is slowly recovering. This is especially true in Europe, whose recovery is barely discernible. This paper analyzes the trends of economic inequality and points to the impact of inequality on economic growth. The central question in this paper, however, is whether the economic inequalities caused the economic crisis. Although opinions differ as to inequality's impact on the occurrence of the crisis, the fact is that enormous economic inequalities, and especially their permanent growth, could have many negative effects, such as increasing poverty, increasing social stratification and causing global economic crises. As many authors have pointed out, escalating inequality is not an inevitable price of progress.

Findings obtained are three-fold. First, there is significant evidence that estimated simultaneous correlations among different commodities' prices (e. g. soybean spot and soybean meal futures) attain different values along the time series. Second, there is a substantial reduction in margin variance provided by the optimal multiproduct time-varying hedge ratios over single time-varying and naive hedge ratios, for both in-and out-of-sample data.

Next, it specifies a convergence model in which interpersonal fiscal flows are used as a key independent variable. Before further proceeding, the paper applies a filtering technique to remove spatial autocorrelation from raw data and, then, it estimates the model by GMM. The main conclusion is that interpersonal fiscal flows are an important policy instrument to promote both growth and, above all, convergence across Spanish provinces. Therefore, it seems that the typical trade-off between efficiency and equity does not hold in this case.","[Villaverde, Jose; Maza, Adolfo; Hierro, Maria] Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain; [Villaverde, Jose] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",Universidad de Cantabria; University of Limerick,"Villaverde, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain.",villavej@unican.es; mazaaj@unican.es; hierroma@unican.es,"Maza, Adolfo/H-5265-2019","Maza, Adolfo/0000-0002-7299-3449; Villaverde, Jose/0000-0002-5393-091X",,,,,41,1,1,0,9,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2014,,209,,,,,151,170,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.14.2.4,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AW1FY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346036900004,0

Results suggest that investors' perception about the worth of these two forms of state ownership may have suffered a reversal, thus bringing to light value-related consequences ensuing from protective schemes usual in China and elsewhere.

Yet, where the focus is on health, most of this work has centered on one or two measures of health outcomes or on certain health behaviors such as smoking or alcohol use and has often failed to include those who cohabit as a separate relationship status. In this paper, we extend the research on the links between health and relationship status in three important ways. First, we consider a wide array of health indicators including self-reported health, chronic conditions, physical limitations, a measure of mental health, body mass index (BMI), and a number of health-related behaviors. Second, we use data from eight waves of the Canadian National Public Health Survey between 1994 and 2008 which allows us to estimate the effect of relationship status on health in a setting in which health insurance is not dependent on marriage. Third, we incorporate cohabitation as a separate relationship status. After controlling for time-invariant factors related to selection into and out of marriage, we find that marriage confers health benefits in the form of improved mental health, and lower levels of alcohol use. Marriage, however, is not without its cost. Similar to studies using U.S. data, marriage results in higher BMI, greater incidence of overweight and obesity and lower probabilities of regular exercise. These benefits and costs accrue to those who marry, and often to cohabiters.","[Averett, Susan L.; Sorkin, Julia] Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Argys, Laura M.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80217 USA",Lafayette College; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Averett, SL (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",Averetts@lafayette.edu; Laura.Argys@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,,52,47,54,1,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

To assess whether individuals are successful in smoothing their well-being across the transition to retirement we analyse measures of subjective well-being (SWB) in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. Specifically, this research examines retirees' current standard of living, financial security and overall happiness relative to their pre-retirement levels. It is found SWB either improves or remains constant for the large majority of individuals as they retire from the labour force. However, there are significant disparities in changes in well-being with retirement among the group of retirees. In particular, the subset of individuals who are forced to retire early due to job loss or their own health, and who find their income in retirement to be much less than expected, report marked declines in their SWB with retirement.","[Barrett, Garry F.] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Kecmanovic, Milica] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Fac Business, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Barrett, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",garry.barrett@sydney.edu.au,,"Barrett, Garry/0000-0002-7669-7110",,,,,19,19,24,1,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

If we account for unobservable differences, we find a wage gap for immigrant men from English-speaking backgrounds, in contrast with previous research which has found no wage gap. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity also seems important for finding cohort effects. Immigrants that arrived before 1985 faced a larger wage gap compared to native-born Australians than subsequent cohorts. Confirming other research, we find wage gaps for immigrant men and women from non-English-speaking backgrounds (NESBs).

This relationship induces a cost channel for monetary policy transmission. Although the empirical literature provides ample evidence for a cost channel, studies that evaluate the welfare gains from monetary policy commitment have so far entirely ignored its presence. This study shows that, overlooking the cost channel, one significantly underestimates the welfare gains from monetary policy commitment. I find that there is a robust positive relationship between the size of the cost channel and welfare gains from monetary policy commitment. Using a version of the new Keynesian model calibrated to the US economy, I find that failure to take into account the presence of a cost channel leads to an understatement of the gains from monetary policy commitment by an amount equivalent to a 0.48 percentage points permanent cut in quarterly inflation.

The setup is framed within the standard Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) model of monopolistic competition. Optimal technology choice is made here either by final goods producers or the representative household which holds the shares of (differentiated) intermediate goods producers. These two cases have different implications for the distribution of output but they yield the same aggregate level of output, the same aggregate production function and equivalent macroeconomic dynamics. Thanks to this property, the proposed framework can be used as a building block in a variety of embedding structures, including those which require to be solved recursively (separately for the dynamics of aggregate variables and for the distribution in each time period).

For the analysis, we develop a New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (NK DSGE) model with parameters estimated to fit the Korean conditions. The role of banks is subsequently examined by classifying monetary policy transmission channels (real rate channel, nominal debt channel, financial accelerating channel, and banking attenuator channel). A notable part of this analysis is the inclusion of the banking sector in the model specifically with the intent to study transmissions from the financial sector to the real economy. This paper follows this line of inquiry with recent research in mind. Empirical analysis verifies the existence of the banking attenuator effect in Korea, which means banks act to reduce the effect of monetary policies. This indicates that if financial intermediaries strengthen arbitrary adjustment behaviors of lending and deposit rates, the effect of the monetary policy intended to relieve volatility in the business cycle may not be as high as expected.","[Ha, Jongrim] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [So, Inhwan] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Cornell University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Ha, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Jh2272@cornell.edu,"So, Inhwan/HTP-3721-2023","So, Inhwan/0000-0001-6938-8080",,,,,8,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

There is no eBay, Amazon, New York Stock Exchange, or Kelley's Blue Book equivalent for patents, and when buyers and sellers do manage to find each other, they usually negotiate under enormous uncertainty: prices of similar patents vary widely from transaction to transaction and the terms of the transactions (including prices) are often secret and confidential. Inefficient and illiquid markets, such as the one for patents, generally create profit opportunities for intermediaries. We begin with an overview of the problems that arise in patent markets, and how traditional institutions like patent brokers, patent pools, and standard-setting organizations have sought to address them. During the last decade, a variety of novel patent intermediaries has emerged. We discuss how several online platforms have started services for buying and selling patents but have failed to gain meaningful traction. And new intermediaries that we call defensive patent aggregators and superaggregators have become quite influential and controversial in the technology industries they touch. The goal of this paper is to shed light on the role and efficiency tradeoffs of these new patent intermediaries. Finally, we offer a provisional assessment of how the new patent intermediary institutions affect economic welfare.","[Hagiu, Andrei; Yoffie, David B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Strategy Unit, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Hagiu, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Strategy Unit, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",ahagiu@hbs.edu; dyoffie@hbs.edu,,,,,,,47,80,98,5,83,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We compare the actual investment behaviour with normative benchmarks of the net present value and the real options approach. Furthermore, we look at order and learning effects. The results show that the price floor has no significant impact on the willingness to invest, whereas the effects of order were statistically significant. The investment reluctance arising from an abolishment is stronger than the investment stimulation arising from the introduction of a price floor. Furthermore, neither the net present value nor the real options approach is appropriate to predict the investment behaviour in general. Nevertheless, the predictions of the real options approach enable an approximation of the participants' investment behaviour if the individuals have an adequate chance to learn from personal experience.","[Maart-Noelck, Syster C.; Musshoff, Oliver; Maack, Moritz] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Maart-Noelck, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",syster.maart@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,42,8,8,3,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We consider three alternative sources of technological progress: disembodied and factor-embodied technical change both to capital and labor. The contribution to growth of each of these sources is evaluated using both traditional and equilibrium growth accounting techniques. We find that capital accumulation is the main determinant of GDP growth in Australia, Japan and the U.S., whereas the main contribution in South Korea is given by Total Factor Productivity (neutral technology). In general, about a half of the contribution to growth of capital-embodied technical change comes from Information and Communication Technology in all the considered economies. We conclude that the higher growth of South Korea, due to Total Factor Productivity change, can be explained by changes in the intensity in the capital/labor use. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By exploiting a reduction in the lower age limit for early retirement as a source of exogenous variation in individual eligibility I obtain robust difference-in-differences and triple differences estimates indicating that more than two out of three pensioners would still be working at the age of 63 had the age limit been 64 rather than 62. Hence, although successful in creating a more dignified exit route for early leavers, the programme also generated substantial costs in terms of inducing others to retire earlier.

Whereas, historically, the state had been used by elites to extract as much from producers as possible, with democratization of the franchise, the state became the sole instrument that could limit - or potentially end - this extraction. In principle, once control of the state is democratized by the ballot box, the fortunes of elites largely depend upon controlling ideology. In 1955, Simon Kuznets offered the highly influential conjecture that, while rising inequality characterizes early economic development, advanced development promises greater equality. However, rising inequality in most wealthy countries over the past four decades has challenged this hypothesis. What those who embraced Kuznets's conjecture failed to recognize is the dynamics by which the rich inevitably regain control over ideology - and thereby the state with their far greater command over resources, education, and status. In the course of history, only the very severe crisis of the 1930s discredited the elites' ideology sufficiently to enable a sustained period of rising equality. However, by 1980, they had regained ideological ascendancy. This article examines how this struggle over ideology has unfolded in the US since the democratization of the franchise in the nineteenth century. It concludes with reflections on whether the current crisis holds promise of de-legitimating the elites' hold on power once more and of ushering in another period of rising equality.","Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Wisman, JD (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,"Wisman, Jon D./0000-0001-7563-3150",,,,,116,13,13,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

While the empirical research testing the implications of these models involves a broad array of experts ranging from lawyers to physicians to real estate agents, we are not aware of any empirical research that focuses on how the level of an agent's expertise affects outcomes. This paper contributes to the empirical research on delegation to experts by considering agents representing football players in contract negotiations with National Football League (NFL) teams. Using whether and for how long an agent is certified with the NFL Players' Association as a proxy for expertise, we find that the monetary terms of the contract do not vary with an agent's expertise, conditional on the contract structure. However, we do find that an agent's expertise does affect the contract structure - specifically, contract duration and incentive clauses. These results suggest that while minimal expertise is required to understand the appropriate monetary compensation associated with a given contract structure, expertise is required to fully grasp the tradeoffs when negotiating the contract structure.

We use the Canadian Tax and Credit Simulator (CTaCS) and detailed information on the structure of income at the household level to compute the marginal tax rates faced by each individual. We then use these marginal tax rates to compute net own-wage, spouse-wage, and nonlabour income. We show how the magnitude of the estimated elasticities varies depending on whether net or gross wages and income are used in the estimation procedure, and quantify biases caused by using average tax rates instead of marginal tax rates. Finally, because marginal tax rates vary significantly over the sample, we use quantile regressions to compare elasticities at different points of the hours distribution. Overall, our results show that public policies now have, on average, less scope for influencing hours of work than 10 years ago.

J,"Goldar, B; Mitra, A",,,,"Goldar, Bishwanath; Mitra, Arup",,,Small versus large manufacturing units: how efficient are they?,JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,technical efficiency; informal sector; small units,GROWTH,"Keeping in mind the much discussed huge employment potential of small manufacturing units, this study examines the performance of enterprises across organised or formal and unorganised or informal sector enterprises. The analysis tends to offer little evidence in favour of positive links between sectors in terms of performance index, i.e. technical efficiency. The formal sector units obviously are better performers than their informal sector counterparts. The informal sector units are not able to benefit in the process of rapid overall growth, suggesting that growth is not inclusive. The demand side factor or agglomeration-specific factor also does not seem to impact on the performance of the informal sector enterprises favourably. On the other hand, the organized manufacturing sector, covered by ASI (annual survey of industries) is responsive to increases in income, which possibly can be explained in terms of the quality differences in the products manufactured by the formal and the informal sectors. The infrastructure variables also do not show a positive effect on the informal sector, while the formal sector efficiency improves with a rise in the availability of infrastructure. On the whole, the informal sector enterprises exist only to provide means of survival; they seem to lack all dynamism.","[Goldar, Bishwanath; Mitra, Arup] Delhi Univ Enclave, Inst Econ Growth, Delhi 110007, India",University of Delhi,"Goldar, B (通讯作者)，Delhi Univ Enclave, Inst Econ Growth, Delhi 110007, India.",bng@iegindia.org,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

A structural VAR approach,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Oil price shocks; Stock returns; Sign-restrictions; Structural vector autoregression,MACROECONOMY; MARKET; EMPLOYMENT; OUTPUT; US,"In this paper, we investigate the dynamic relationship between different oil price shocks and the South African stock market using a sign restriction structural VAR approach for the period 1973:01 to 2011:07. The results show that for an oil-importing country like South Africa, stock returns only increase with oil prices when global economic activity improves. In response to oil supply shocks and speculative demand shocks, stock returns and the real price of oil move in opposite directions. The analysis of the variance decomposition shows that the oil supply shock contributes more to the variability in real stock prices. The main conclusion is that different oil price shocks affect stock returns differently and policy makers and investors should always consider the source of the shock before implementing a policy and making investment decisions.

This paper examines Tanzania's flagship COD program and provides new evidence on the mechanisms by which the demand-driven components of the program may undermine the goal of pro-poor funding allocations. We exploit two data sources for the analysis: a census of wards for mainland Tanzania and a census of households in 100 program villages. These data paint a consistent picture at both levels: wealth, education, access to media, and political engagement are positively correlated with the likelihood to apply for the program at the national level, and to be aware of it at the local level. Centrally dictated features of the program- namely predetermined funding allocations to districts and eligibility rules combine with the decentralized selection process within districts to counteract this initially regressive application pattern and produce a program that is, like many other CDD programs, only mildly pro-poor. Our results suggest that sensitization and outreach prior to the application process will be a critical dimension in making CDD programs more progressive. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, I examine the pricing strategies and regulation of multiple monopolies that produce products which consumers view as perfect complements. I show that collusion by the firms increases total social welfare and that the collusion problem can be reinterpreted as a problem of provision of public goods from the point of view of the firms. I take this insight further and derive the familiar concepts of the Samuelson marginal condition and the ratio equilibrium for the firms. I compare these outcomes to the first best solution and then apply incentive-compatible mechanisms to strategically implement the Pareto superior ratio-equilibrium outcome and the optimal marginal-cost pricing outcome. Finally, I show how this methodology can be applied to the more familiar Cournot model of oligopoly.","Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Van Essen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, 200 Alston Hall,361 Stadium Dr,Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",mjvanessen@cba.ua.edu,,"Van Essen, Matt/0000-0003-2420-5038",,,,,33,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

However, the welfare losses associated to fiscal instability are also an important challenge for many countries, as it typically implies an inefficient allocation of resources, higher sovereign risk premium and an inadequate provision of public services. In this paper, we empirically analyze the political, institutional, and economic sources of public deficit volatility. Using the system-generalized method-of-moments (GMM) estimator for linear dynamic panel data models and a sample of 125 countries analyzed from 1980 to 2006, we show that higher public deficit volatility is typically associated with higher levels of political instability and less democracy. In addition, public deficit volatility tends to be magnified for small countries, in the outcome of hyper-inflation episodes and for countries with a high degree of openness.","[Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Agnello, Luca] Univ Palermo, Fac Econ, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; University of Palermo,"Agnello, L (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Fac Econ, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",luca.agnello01@unipa.it; rjsousa@eeg.uminho.pt,"Sousa, Ricardo/N-9015-2019; Sousa, Ricardo/F-8013-2010","Sousa, Ricardo/0000-0002-8279-5753",,,,,33,11,11,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Supply partner selection is one of the most appealing issues for agile supply chain management, which have recently been studied by academicians and practitioners. Due to a large number of factors to be considered, supplier selection process is a difficult task for every company. Therefore, supplier selection process can be viewed as a multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. In this paper, a novel hybrid MADM method is proposed for agile supplier selection based on four criteria including performance, cost, flexibility and technology. Two MADM methods, including step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) are applied in decision-making process. More precisely, SWARA is used for determining the importance of each criterion and calculating their weights and VIKOR is applied for evaluating alternatives as well as ranking supplier alternatives from the best to the worst. More precisely, the first phase of the proposed methodology step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA), is useful for determining the importance of each criterion and calculating the weight of each criterion, and the second phase with Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) is useful for evaluating alternatives as well as ranking supplier alternatives from the best to the worst. Finally, a real case-study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. As a result, the model can help managers to evaluate and select the best supplier regarding own company strategies, resources, policies and etc. for their organization.","[Alimardani, Maryam] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Tehran Polytech, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Futures Studies Res Inst,Technol Foresight Grp, Tehran, Iran; [Aghdaie, Mohammad Hasan] Shomal Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Amol, Mazandaran, Iran; [Tamosaitiene, Jolanta] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Tehran; Amirkabir University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Tamosaitiene, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",jolanta.tamosaitiene@vgtu.lt,"Tamošaitienė, Jolanta/E-9278-2012; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani/AAA-9918-2021","Tamošaitienė, Jolanta/0000-0003-4692-6821;",,,,,49,91,93,0,56,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

These expectations can vary significantly over time as a result of perfectly rational scapegoat effects.

We show that, in spite of significant increases in the labour supply, the demand for university graduates outweighed this and increased the rates of return in the early period of transition (1994-2001), while in the later period (2001-08) the opposite was the case. We also provide evidence of considerable heterogeneity in rates of return between genders, levels and fields of study, with particularly large (low) returns to the fields that were suppressed (favoured) during socialism.

It is found that oil price uncertainty makes a major contribution to overall variations in the output level. Results also show that higher oil price uncertainty significantly decreases both output and price levels, resembling an adverse demand shock. Oil price uncertainty causes output to decline in most of the sub-sectors including durable and non-durable manufacturing.

The first one assumes that there exists an order of acquisition of durable goods and access to services. The second one applies correspondence analysis to the same data and uses the first factor to evaluate the extent of poverty. While these two methodologies provide a ranking of the households according to their long-run economic status, they correspond to two different ways of using and summarizing the information provided by the observed indicators of the households' living conditions. The empirical investigation covers three countries, Egypt, Morocco and Turkey, and is based on the Demographic and Health Surveys. The application of these two methodologies, separately for the whole sample and for urban and rural areas, gives interesting results that show important differences within and between countries. These results seem to indicate that the order of acquisition approach and correspondence analysis provide complementary and useful information on the extent of the deprivation experienced by households in these three countries.

This exploration is done in the context that Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan's choice of corporate governance regulations is heavily influenced by Anglo-Saxon approach, whereas de-facto realities of Pakistani corporate environment are quite in contrast. Using a panel data of 119 firms for the period of 8 years i.e. 2003 to 2010, and using a multidimensional performance framework i.e. financial performance and technical efficiency, we find that the extent of compliance has increased since the issuance of code in 2002. After controlling for firm size, growth, dividend payout, age and leverage, we find significant positive impact of compliance on firm's performance (ROA, ROE and ROCE). We also find a weak positive relationship between compliance and technical efficiency. We suggest that compliance is not linearly related with financial performance and we find that high compliant firms are less profitable than average or low compliant firms. This implies that one-size-fit all approach along with mandatory compliance is a questionable approach for Pakistani firms. This study is first in Pakistan in providing empirical evidence on efficacy of the rule-based Code of Corporate Governance and also adds to growing but underdeveloped literature on compliance and firm performance in emerging/developing economies. Further, this study offers insight to policy makers on the efficacy of current corporate governance regulations and offers a research framework for assessing the extent of compliance, effectiveness and economic impact of code of corporate governance.

These shares have varied systematically over the post-World War II period, rising until the late 1970s and then falling until now. Explanations for the decline in labor's share include technical progress, globalization and a decline in labor's bargaining power, but none of these explanations can account for both the rise and the decline of labor shares over time and for the similar pattern in developed and developing countries. However, movements in oil prices can account for these movements if energy is included in the production function.

By eliminating an outside residual claimant with control over the firm, these alternatives to investor ownership reduce the incentive of the firm to offer such terms. However, customers who are unaware of their behavioral biases may fail to recognize this advantage of non-investor-owned firms. We present evidence from the consumer financial services market that supports our theory. Comparing contract terms, we find that mutually owned firms offer lower penalties, such as default interest rates, and higher up-front prices, such as introductory interest rates, than do investor-owned firms. However, consumers most vulnerable to these penalties are no more likely to use mutually owned firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Studies in the former group confirm that a range of fees affect the behavior of applicants and suggest that a patent is an inelastic good. Studies in the latter group provide grounds for both low and high application (or pre-grant) fees and renewal (or post-grant) fees, depending on the structural context and policy objectives. The paper also presents new stylized facts on patent fees of 30 patent offices worldwide. It is shown that application fees are generally lower than renewal fees, and renewal fees increase more than proportionally with patent age.","[de Rassenfosse, Gaetan] Univ Melbourne, MIAESR, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [de Rassenfosse, Gaetan] Univ Melbourne, IPRIA, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [de la Potterie, Bruno van Pottelsberghe] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Brussels, Belgium",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Solvay SA,"de Rassenfosse, G (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, MIAESR, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,"de Rassenfosse, Gaétan/A-3051-2009; de Rassenfosse, Gaétan/HJB-1549-2022; VAN POTTELSBERGHE, Bruno/AAN-4779-2020; van Pottelsberghe, Bruno/A-3073-2009","de Rassenfosse, Gaétan/0000-0002-7862-0918; van Pottelsberghe, Bruno/0000-0001-7720-1685",,,,,63,51,51,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The institutional design of the Federal Reserve System was aimed at preventing banking panics, primarily due to the permanent presence of the discount window. This new system was successful at preventing a panic in the early 1920s, after which the Fed began to discourage the use of the discount window and intentionally create stigma for window borrowing-policies that contributed to the panics of the Great Depression. The legislation of the New Deal era centralized Fed power in the Board of Governors, and over the next 75 years the Fed expanded its role as a supervisor of the largest banks. Nevertheless, prior to the recent crisis the Fed had large gaps in its authority as a supervisor and as lender of last resort, with the latter role weakened further by stigma. The Fed was unable to prevent the recent crisis, during which its lender of last resort function expanded significantly. As the Fed begins its second century, there are still great challenges to fulfilling its original intention of panic prevention.","[Gorton, Gary; Metrick, Andrew] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gorton, Gary; Metrick, Andrew] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gorton, G (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",gary.gorton@yale.edu; andrew.metrick@yale.edu,"Metrick, Andrew/B-9296-2008","Metrick, Andrew/0000-0002-7930-9830",,,,,66,25,28,0,20,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We find that (a) presence of children is associated with a loss of spousal love; (b) loss of spousal love is associated with loss of overall happiness; but (c) presence of children is not associated with significant loss of overall happiness. If children reduce feelings of being loved by the spouse but do not reduce reported happiness even though spousal love induces happiness, then it must be the case that children contribute to parental happiness by providing other benefits. After ruling out some competing compensation mechanisms we infer that loss of spousal love is compensated with altruistic feelings towards children.","[Grossbard, Shoshana] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Grossbard, Shoshana] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain; [Grossbard, Shoshana] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Mukhopadhyay, Sankar] Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Zaragoza; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Grossbard, S (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",shosh@mail.sdsu.edu,"Grossbard, Shoshana/I-7038-2012; Grossbard, Shoshana/IWV-0194-2023","Grossbard, Shoshana/0000-0002-4884-8225; Grossbard, Shoshana/0000-0002-4884-8225",,,,,36,10,11,4,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

In doing so, we can clearly identify how many and which series in the panel are stationary processes. Empirical results from the SPSM using the Panel KSS unit root test (Ucar and Omay, 2009) with a Fourier function indicate that PPP holds true for most of these transition countries studied.

The model incorporates factors of sectoral differences in productivity, non-homothetic preference characteristics of consumers, and institutional barriers of labor mobility. Moreover, the model considers changes in the scale of the public sector as an important driving force. We find that there are two effects of changes in the scale of the public sector in declining public sector output on labor reallocation. First, enterprises will increase the share of capital input to labor, resulting in relative expansion of non-agricultural production. Second, residents' income will also increase, together with the relative increase in demand towards non-agricultural goods due to non-homothetic preference characteristics of consumers. Therefore the non-agricultural production will further expand. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that time pressure evokes intuitive reasoning and reduces the focal attraction of choosing higher (and per se more profitable) numbers in the game. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The model is used to examine the impact of population ageing on the labour market. More specifically, it is used to evaluate the effects of labour force decline and labour force ageing on key macro-economic variables. The second effect is assumed to operate through age-specific productivity and labour force participation. In the analysis, particular attention is paid to how population ageing impinges on the government expenditure constraint. The basic structure of the model follows the Auerbach and Kotlikoff tradition. However, the model takes into consideration directly age-specific mortality. This is analogous to building in a cohort-component population projection structure to the model, which allows more complex and more realistic demographic scenarios to be considered.

One of the results given by Fishburn (The theory of social choice. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1973) allows us to characterize anonymous, neutral and monotonic voting systems by means of functions satisfying adequate conditions. From among all kinds of functions, the class of affine functions is highly interesting because from them it is possible to obtain the voting systems most used in practice. In this paper we analyze the structure of the set of these functions and we show that this set is convex and its extreme points are the functions that generate the following voting systems: simple majority, absolute majority, unanimous majority and Pareto majority. Moreover, we suggest a simple method for choosing a voting system when two alternatives are under consideration.","Univ Valladolid, Inst Matemat IMUVA, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Llamazares, B (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Inst Matemat IMUVA, Dept Econ Aplicada, Avda Valle Esgueva 6, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.",boni@eco.uva.es,"Llamazares, Bonifacio/A-2526-2013","Llamazares, Bonifacio/0000-0002-7538-4833",,,,,23,4,6,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

We show in the Chamley-Judd result of zero income capital taxation is robust to the presence of endogenous capital utilization. The result even extends to the short-run as long as there are no depreciation allowances, but breaks if those are present. Our policy simulations show that steady state level of capital utilization is not affected by changes in income tax, but its reduced on impact to accommodate for the constance of capital stock Our numerical simulations also show important differences in the time adjustment followed by key variables, as a response to tax policy.

We conduct a conjoint analysis of consumer stated preferences for the settings of air conditioners, refrigerators, and the standby power of electrical appliances, based on a web questionnaire survey administered in the areas supplied by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and Kansai Electric Power Company (KEPCO). The main findings of this paper are as follows. First, we observe awareness of voluntary electricity conservation among the households in both the TEPCO and KEPCO areas after the disasters. Second, awareness of voluntary power saving is higher in the TEPCO area, which has been directly affected by the electric power shortages, in comparison with the KEPCO area, where there was no such direct impact. Third, if power prices are to be further raised, the consumer responses to the price changes would be small in both areas. Furthermore, we show that the potential voluntary reduction in electric power consumption of a household in the TEPCO area is 26% more than that in the KEPCO area during the summer peak periods.

One reason why governments are efficient facilitators of coordinated action, in addition to their ability to force compliance or tax, is that they are typically endowed with more information than the individuals they govern. This advantage creates a dilemma for them, however, since it forces them to decide on how they should distribute the information in their possession to the population. This paper investigates this question. We investigate the Announcement Game defined by the government and those it governs and focus on communication strategy that government uses to communicate private information to the citizens. This communication strategy involves (1) partitioning the state space in an attempt to mask the true state of the world and (2) choosing what type of language to use in order to communicate elements of this partition.

Political connection has been alleged as valuable in popular press in this mid-income economy studied, so it is worth an investigation. Significant share price increases of 4% or more abnormal returns accrue to connected firms relative to unconnected firms when identical political events occur. The impact is very pronounced during a severe economic crisis, when the stakes were high about an incumbent government being re-elected. Our finding of higher value of politically connected firms is due to the expected value of preferential treatments, preference in project selections and access to state benefits. Thus, share prices of politically connected firms react with greater impacts than non-politically connected firms to announcements of identical political events.","[Chen, Chow-meng; Ariff, Mohamed; Hassan, Tuafiq] Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia; [Ariff, Mohamed] Bond Univ, Southport, Qld 4229, Australia",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Bond University,"Ariff, M (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.",mariff@bond.edu.au,"Ariff, Mohamed/U-6072-2019",,,,,,47,8,8,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Applied to the MENA region, the objective of this article is to estimate the likely impact of the dynamics of liberalization on the financial stability. The theoretical context is linked with the debate on the optimal sequence of liberalization. The economic intuition behind this analysis relies on the fact that the dynamics of liberalization matters more than the sequence of liberalization. It means that the effect financial instability of the process of liberalization appeared only during the process of financial liberalization. We provide empirical evidence from a sample of 9 MENA countries over the period 1980 to 2011. From a methodological point of view, we use the panel threshold regressions. The threshold regressions support the interrelationship between the banking and currency crises. The structural changes are estimated using the econometric procedure elaborated by Hansen (1999). The results suggest that the dynamics of liberal reforms may constitute a determinant of financial stability. More precisely, our estimations show that an increase in domestic credits significantly stimulates speculative pressures. This empirical evidence supports the twin crisis argument proposed by Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) which suggests a high correlation between currency and banking crises. The dynamics of liberalization plays a key role in explaining why currency and banking crises are so closely entwined. Finally, as a contribution to Edwards (2009), this note advocates the preeminence of threshold models relatively to classical linear models in sizing the effects of financial liberalization on speculative pressures.

We cope with stock market endogeneity and industry heterogeneity, and circumvent omitted variables bias, so that this finding is unlikely to be driven by misspecification problems. The estimation results are interpreted, arguing that stronger shareholder protection may depress rather than encourage the most valuable corporate productions, because it enables small and diversified shareholders to play opportunistic actions against undiversified stockholders, after specific investments are undertaken by the company; innovative activity, largely based on specific investing, is particularly exposed to this problem.","[Belloc, Filippo] Univ G dAnnunzio, I-65127 Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Belloc, F (通讯作者)，Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ Studies, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.",f.belloc@unich.it,,,,,,,68,28,29,5,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using a theoretical model with downstream firms exhibiting different levels of productivity, we show that lower input tariffs may increase the export sales of high-productivity firms at the expense of low-productivity firms and may decrease the probability of firms entering foreign markets. We compare the predictions of the theoretical model with firm-level data from the French agrifood sector by developing a two-stage estimation procedure that uses an equation for selection into export markets in the first stage and an export's equation in the second stage. The liberalization of agricultural trade appears to favor the reallocation of market share from low- to high-productivity agrifood firms. In addition, our results suggest that, whether lower input tariffs increase total export sales (and jobs), a large fraction of the least productive exporting firms may lose from an additional decrease in agricultural input tariffs.

Using a standard new open economy macroeconomics (NOEM) model, we show that the fiscal multiplier and spillover are contrary to textbook economics. For the country where government expenditure takes place, the fiscal multiplier exceeds one, the currency depreciates, and the terms of trade worsen. The fiscal spillover is negative if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption is less than one, and positive if it is greater than one. Incomplete stabilization of marginal costs due to the existence of the zero lower bound is critical in understanding the effects of fiscal policy in open economies. These results remain unchanged even if we incorporate incomplete markets or endogenous capital into the model, but local currency pricing yields positive fiscal spillover irrespective of the size of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

Because agents arrive randomly over time, and only those who invest are observed, later agents face a more complicated inference problem than in the standard model, as the absence of investment might reflect either a choice not to invest, or a lack of arrivals. We show that, as in the standard model, learning is complete if and only if signals are unbounded. If signals are bounded, cascades may occur, and whether they are more or less likely than in the standard model depends on a property of the signal distribution. If the hazard ratio of the distributions increases in the signal, it is more likely that no one invests in the standard model than in this one, and welfare is higher. Conclusions are reversed if the hazard ratio is decreasing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The inherent variability of wind speeds and solar radiation affects the price that VRE generators receive on the market (market value). During windy and sunny times the additional electricity supply reduces the prices. Because the drop is larger with more installed capacity, the market value of VRE falls with higher penetration rate. This study aims to develop a better understanding on how the market value with penetration, and how policies and prices affect the market value. Quantitative evidence is derived from a review of published studies, regression analysis of market data, and the calibrated model of the European electricity market EMMA. We find the value of wind power to fall from 110% of the average power price to 50-80% as wind penetration increases from zero to 30% of total electricity consumption. For solar power, similarly low value levels are reached already at 15% penetration. Hence, competitive large-scale renewable deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than as many anticipate.

In this model the cost of technology adoption is endogenous and varies across heterogeneous agents. Agents in the model vote on the proportion of revenues allocated towards such expenditures. In the early stages of development, the political-economy outcome of the model ensures that a sub-optimal proportion of government revenue is used to finance adoption-cost reducing expenditures. This sub-optimality is due to the presence of inequality; agents at the lower end of the distribution favor a larger amount of revenue allocated towards redistribution in the form of lump-sum transfers. Eventually all individuals make the switch to the better technology and their incomes converge. The outcomes of the model therefore explain why public choice is more likely to be conservative in nature; it represents the majority choice given conflicting preferences among agents. Consequently, the transition path towards growth and technology adoption varies across countries depending on initial levels of inequality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

(2006) model can match the magnitude of wage dispersion, as measured by the ratio of the average and the lowest wage the so-called mean-min ratio of Hornstein et al. (2011). I find that the workers' bargaining power is a crucial parameter: the mean-min ratio strictly decreases in the bargaining power up to a point near 1/2 and is essentially flat thereafter, generating the same amount of wage dispersion as the canonical wage ladder model, which is a special case of the CPVR model. Consequently, this model can yield large wage dispersion only for low bargaining power on the workers' side. I show that the share of job-to-job transitions with wage drops is decreasing in the bargaining power, calibrate the latter to the former, and demonstrate that the CPVR model generates an empirically plausible amount of wage dispersion. I also show that negative wages arise when workers have no bargaining power, and discuss the implications for the empirical findings of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002b). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The basic model shows that the change of skilled-unskilled wage inequality is determined by the comparison of the capital-labor distributive shares between the two sectors. The extended model finds that when the output of the monopolistically competitive sector is non-tradable, the mechanism in the basic model fails to work. Thus, we should pay special attention to the role that the non-tradable feature of final-good production plays. In addition, the welfare effects of an FDI inflow are also examined by the basic and extended models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We introduce a dynamic school choice problem that consists in assigning positions to overlapping generations of teachers. From one period to another, teachers can either retain their current positions or choose a preferred one. In this framework, a solution concept that conciliates the fairness criteria with the individual rationality condition is introduced. It is then proved that a solution always exists and that it can be reached by a modified version of the deferred acceptance algorithm of Gale and Shapley. We also show that the mechanism is dynamically strategy-proof, and respects improvements whenever the set of orders is lexicographic by tenure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

While various discrete poverty measures can be applied directly to data in this limited form, they typically require an arbitrary approach to within-group interpolation. This problem can be overcome by fitting either a parametric income distribution or a Lorenz curve to the grouped data and computing the required quantities from estimated parameters. The Lorenz curve approach is widely used by the World Bank, but can encounter problems. As an alternative, in this article we show how to calculate several poverty measures from parameters of the generalized beta income distribution, and its popular special cases.

The aim is to explore internal changes in the Mexican economy as a result of the impact of trade and financial liberalization to identify factors contributing to or deterring migration flows. Internal migration is modelled using extended spatial gravity models that are then properly estimated using Poisson estimation techniques. The findings suggest a structural break in terms of a reduction of interstate migration flows in the post-NAFTA period. The evidence suggests that much of this effect could be attributed to higher levels in the indicators of trade liberalization, which appear to also offset the expected effects of wage differentials.","[Flores, Miguel] Univ Texas San Antonio, Inst Demog & Socioecon Res, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Zey, Mary; Hoque, Nazrul] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Demog, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Flores, M (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Inst Demog & Socioecon Res, 501 West Durango Blvd,Monterey Bldg,4th Floor, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",miguel.flores@utsa.edu; Mary.Zey@utsa.edu; Nazrul.Hoque@utsa.edu,"Flores, Miguel/B-7611-2014",,,,,,35,11,12,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

Because the subject matter is similar, contemporary evolutionary thought has much to offer to economics. In recent decades theoretical biology has progressed faster than economics in understanding phenomena like hierarchical processes, cooperative behavior, and selection processes in evolutionary change, This paper discusses three very old cosmologies in Western thought, how these play out in economic theory, and how evolutionary biology can help evaluate their validity and policy relevance. These cosmologies are: (1) natural man as a rational, self-sufficient, egotistical individual, (2) competition among individuals can lead to a well-functioning society, and (3) there exists an ideal optimal state of nature. These correspond to Colander et al. (2004) holy trinity of orthodox economics, rationality, greed, and equilibrium.

Despite the programme objective to stimulate non-farm activity, the results of empirical estimations drawing on household and community-level data suggest that Imidugudu households differ surprisingly little from other rural households in terms of diversification into non-farm income sources. Moreover, the slightly greater participation in non-farm income-generating activities observed among the Imidugudu households can be attributed to regional variation and household characteristics mattering for selection into the programme, rather than to asset endowments and improved service access. The results, thus, provide very little indication that the programme has achieved its objective of stimulating diversification into non-farm income-generating activities. Rather, they highlight the need to carefully monitor the earning opportunities of resettled households that have been disrupted from their familiar productive environment.","[Isaksson, Ann-Sofie] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Isaksson, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",ann-sofie.isaksson@economics.gu.se,,"Isaksson, Ann-Sofie/0000-0003-2447-3665",,,,,50,10,12,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We look at the skilled-unskilled wage differential. When better educated societies open up their economies, increased trade is likely to induce less inequality on impact because the supply of skills better matches demand. But greater international exposure also brings about technological diffusion, further raising skilled labour demand. This may raise wage inequality, in contrast to the initial egalitarian level effect of human capital. We attempt to measure these two opposing forces. We also employ a broad set of indicators to measure trade liberalization policies as well as general openness, which is an outcome, and not a policy variable. We further examine what type of education most reduces inequality. Our findings suggest that countries with a higher level of initial human capital do well on the inequality front, but human capital which accrues through the trade liberalization channel has inegalitarian effects. Our results also have implications for the speed at which trade policies are liberalized, the implication being that better educated nations should liberalize faster.","[Mamoon, Dawood] Pakistan Inst Trade & Dev, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Murshed, Syed Mansoob] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Murshed, Syed Mansoob] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Birmingham,"Murshed, SM (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",Murshed@iss.nl,"Murshed, Syed Mansoob/AAY-3622-2020","Murshed, Syed Mansoob/0000-0002-8360-033X",,,,,34,10,13,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

There are, however, theoretical arguments suggesting that the effect of falling fertility on effective labor supply can be offset by associated behavioral changes. We formalize these arguments by setting forth a dynamic consumer optimization model that incorporates endogenous fertility as well as endogenous education and health investments. The model shows that a fertility decline induces higher education and health investments that are able to compensate for declining fertility under certain circumstances. We assess the theoretical implications by investigating panel data for 118 countries over the period 1980 to 2005 and show that behavioral changes partly mitigate the negative impact of declining fertility on effective labor supply.

To this end, a post Keynesian endogenous growth model is presented, in which: (1) the desired rate of capital accumulation is assumed to be a nonlinear function of external indebtedness as a share of capital stock; (2) an endogenous country risk premium is assumed to be an increasing (linear) function of external indebtedness (as a share of capital stock); (3) there is a fixed exchange rate regime and perfect capital mobility in the sense of Mundell and Fleming. The main theoretical result of the model is the existence of two long-run equilibrium positions, one of which has a high level of external indebtedness (as a ratio of capital stock) and a low profit rate and the other has a low level of external indebtedness and a high profit rate. This means that excessive external indebtedness can result in stagnant growth due to its negative effect on the rate of profit. To test the effects of external indebtedness on the rate of economic growth in emerging economies, a dynamic panel is estimated to evaluate whether external debt has an effective negative influence on economic growth in emerging countries. An empirical test of demand-led growth equations with a dynamic panel for fifty-five emerging countries confirms the potential negative effects of external debt on long-term growth rates in the sample countries.","[Rocha, Marcos] Inst Appl Econ Res IPEA, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Oreiro, Jose Luis] Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Oreiro, Jose Luis] CNPq, Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (IPEA); Universidade de Brasilia,"Rocha, M (通讯作者)，Inst Appl Econ Res IPEA, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",,"Oreiro, José Luis Da Costa/HRC-2082-2023","da Costa Oreiro, Jose Luis/0000-0001-8955-8868",,,,,32,4,7,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The main objective of this study was to determine whether selected constructs impact on value and whether value impacts on loyalty amongst customers of a firm operating in the South African supermarket industry. The findings indicate that satisfaction has the strongest relationship with utilitarian value, which, in turn, has a strong relationship with customer loyalty. More loyalty will not result from an increase in the hedonic value that a supermarket customer experiences, regardless of an enhanced shopping experience.","[Terblanche, Nic S.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Business Management, Mkt Focus Area, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Terblanche, NS (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Business Management, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",nst@sun.ac.za,"Terblanche, Nic/JXL-7749-2024","Terblanche, Nic/0000-0002-8526-1562",,,,,69,2,2,0,30,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Higher employment among the older segments of the population will only materialize if firms are willing to employ them. Although several economists have started considering the demand side of the labour market for older individuals, few have considered its gender dimension properly; despite evidence that lifting the overall senior employment rate in the EU requires significantly raising that of women older than 50. In this paper, we posit that labour demand and employability depend to a large extent on how the age/gender composition of the workforce affects firm's profits. Using unique firm-level panel data we produce robust evidence on the causal effect of age/gender on productivity (value added per worker), total labour costs and gross profits. We take advantage of the panel structure of data and resort to first differences to deal with a potential time-invariant heterogeneity bias. Moreover, inspired by recent developments in the production function estimation literature, we also address the risk of simultaneity bias (endogeneity of firm's age-gender mix choices in the short run) by combining first differences with i) the structural approach suggested by Ackerberg, Caves and Frazer (2006), ii) alongside more traditional IV-GMM methods (Blundell and Bond, 1998) where lagged values of labour inputs are used as instruments. Results suggest no negative impact of rising shares of older men on firm's gross profits, but a large negative effect of larger shares of older women. Another interesting result is that the vast and highly feminized services industry does not seem to offer working conditions that mitigate older women's productivity and employability disadvantage, on the contrary. This is not good news for older women's employability and calls for policy interventions in the Belgian private economy aimed at combating women's decline of productivity with age and/or better adapting labour costs to age-gender productivity profiles.

In the 1990s, this strategy led to the development of me too' products, which currently represent the largest share of store brand products. Since the early 2000s, retailers have widened the range of their store brands by introducing high-quality products. The aim of this study was to estimate consumers' attachment to me-too' and niche PLs respectively, as compared to NBs. We captured the degree of maturity of these PLs through their price-elasticities, computed for three staple goods offered by three mass retail companies. It was found that price sensitivity does not differ much between the me-too' PLs and the corresponding NBs. This result confirms that me-too' products are now considered reliable quality brands. However, in the high quality segment, consumers remain more sensitive to the price of PLs than to that of NBs, a characteristic which may relate to their recent introduction on the market.","[Berges, Fabian; Hassan, Daniel; Monier-Dilhan, Sylvette] Toulouse Sch Econ Gremaq Inra, Toulouse, France; [Berges, Fabian] IDEI, Toulouse, France",INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Bergès, F (通讯作者)，TSE MF 217,21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",Fabian.Berges@toulouse.inra.fr,,,,,,,38,3,5,2,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

However, intense sector competition and the economic downturn following the global financial crisis erased profit margins to a large extent. As a result, the former fad stocks have recently turned into losers, loading negatively on price momentum and delivering significantly negative Carhart four-factor alphas.

Such models are estimated by applying a recursive regression methodology to quarterly data for the period 1995-2009. Estimations are performed based on an innovative trend-gap data disaggregation methodology, and an error-correction specification to contrast short vs. long run prediction performance, which is evaluated up to eight periods ahead for all model specifications. Different from previous results, forecasts provided by most specifications in the very short run (up to 2 quarters ahead), particularly the BEER specification, consistently outperform those obtained from the random walk model.","[Eduardo Castillo-Maldonado, Carlos; Perez-Macal, Fidel] Econ Res Dept, Ciudad Real, Spain",,"Castillo-Maldonado, CE (通讯作者)，Econ Res Dept, 7A Ave 22-01 Zona 1 Guatemala, Ciudad Real, Spain.",cecm@banguat.gob.gt; fipm@banguat.gob.gt,,,,,,,44,2,2,0,13,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,,,J APPL ECON,J.

Many arguments have been advanced as to why and how more open or liberalised economies might grow faster, but the specific channels this process uses have begun to be investigated only recently. We continue these efforts by including a variable identifying the date of trade liberalisation in a system of equations that captures the determinants of growth in per capita income. Four channels' are considered: capital formation, the share of government, the economy's openness to trade and its price distortions. We include the liberalisation variable in the equation explaining each channel, and allow for thresholds on its coefficient depending on the years since liberalisation'. These estimated coefficients can also differ by region. In this way, we can identify the channels through which trade liberalisation affects growth and uncover the timing of the adjustments involved.","[Falvey, Rod; Khalid, Ahmed] Bond Univ, Sch Business, Gold Coast, Australia; [Falvey, Rod; Khalid, Ahmed] Bond Univ, Globalisat & Dev Ctr, Gold Coast, Australia; [Foster-McGregor, Neil] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Vienna, Austria",Bond University; Bond University; Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Falvey, R (通讯作者)，Bond Univ, Sch Business, Gold Coast, Australia.",rfalvey@bond.edu.au,"Falvey, Rodney/F-6944-2013",,,,,,21,8,8,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

J,"Findlay, R",,,,"Findlay, Ronald",,,Coastal-inland interactions in Burmese history: a long-term perspective,ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The history of Burma, like that of many Southeast Asian countries, can be viewed in terms of the interaction between coastal regions and kingdoms, on the one hand, and more densely populated inland agrarian states on the other. In the case of Burma this division also largely coincides with ethnic differences between the Mon and the Arakanese in the former category and the Burmans and the Shans in the latter. External influences have typically been transmitted through overseas contact, with India and Ceylon as in the case of the pervasive cultural force of Buddhism, and later with the impact of firearms introduced by the Portuguese during the 16th century, that formed the background to the protracted conflicts between the Burmese Toungoo, Ava and Konbaung kingdoms and the Thai kingdom of Ayuthia. The beginning of the 19th century saw the start of the three wars between the Konbaung Dynasty and India-based British imperialism in which the major role was played by disputes over trade and the Bengal-Arakan frontier. British rule in Lower Burma after 1826 and 1854 transformed the economic system of the country even before the complete occupation after 1885 by integrating it with the expanding world economy through rice and teak exports. Between 1885 and the Japanese invasion of 1942 the impact of international trade, foreign direct investment and immigration was the major force of both expansion and contraction of the economic system, as well as of social and political change and instability, eventually culminating after 1945 in the achievement of independence. The economic policy of independent Burma, during both the civilian and subsequent military regimes, was largely shaped by the fraught legacy of overseas contact in Burmese history as noted above. The recent change of the capital from the commercial port of Rangoon to the new inland city' of Naypyidaw is thus of more than merely symbolic significance since it may reflect a desire to return to the apparently safe isolation of the interior heartland' over the vicissitudes of international trade and overseas contacts. But is that a wise choice in the increasingly globalized world of the 21st century?","Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Findlay, R (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

In this article, I estimate the effects of headquarters' proximity to plants on plant-level investment and productivity. Using the introduction of new airline routes as a source of exogenous variation in proximity, I find that new airline routes that reduce the travel time between headquarters and plants lead to an increase in plant-level investment of 8% to 9% and an increase in plants' total factor productivity of 1.3% to 1.4%. The results are robust when I control for local and firm-level shocks, that could potentially drive the introduction of new airline routes, when I consider only new airline routes that are the outcome of a merger between two airlines or the opening of a new hub, and when I consider only indirect flights where either the last leg of the flight (involving the plant's home airport) or the first leg of the flight (involving headquarters' home airport) remains unchanged. Moreover, the results are stronger in the earlier years of the sample period and for firms whose headquarters is more time-constrained. In addition, they also hold at the extensive margin, that is, when I consider plant openings and closures.

Although there has been considerable discussion about how these shortcomings can be put right, relatively little has been said about the role EU social policy can play in making the eurozone more stable and sustainable. The purpose of this paper is to address this shortcoming. It is argued that that some form of EU social union is urgent, for without it the immediate financial problems facing the members of the eurozone cannot be resolved. The paper seeks to explain what role EU social policies can play in the construction of an adequate federal framework for the monetary union. It is argued that a fully fledged social union is unlikely to emerge that involves massive transfers from the European core to the periphery. At the same time, it is envisaged that EU social policy will need to be strengthened considerably, with interventions focusing on employment creation and on the capacity of national governments to maintain domestic social safety nets.","[Grahl, John] Middlesex Univ, London N17 8HR, England; [Teague, Paul] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland",Middlesex University; Queens University Belfast,"Teague, P (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, Riddel Hall,185 Stramillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland.",P.Teague@qub.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,7,9,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The persistence of an inherited standard, when a superior alternative is available, is usually regarded as market failure. However, if the transition costs to the new standard are such that the net gains from the transition are insufficient, the situation is unfortunate, but not market failure. The situation may change over time. If the net gain from the alternative standard increases, or transition costs to new alternative decrease, or both, the situation turns into one in which entrepreneurs can profit by making the transition. Where appropriate, an institutional reform may lower transition costs substantially. This paper suggests an additional possibility of technological changes that make the transition unnecessary. In the case of the Korean keyboard, changes in auxiliary technologies have rendered the disadvantages of the inherited standard innocuous. The case provides a cautionary tale against the temptation to drastically alter a seemingly hopelessly inferior inherited standard. The lesson of the Korean keyboard applies to Japanese and Chinese keyboards with even greater force. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Findings show that the survival of terrorist groups is bolstered by diversifying attacks, having multiple home bases, locating in the Middle East, locating in a democratic country, and limiting reliance on transnational terrorist attacks. Moreover, larger groups have better survival prospects. Religious fundamentalist terrorist groups face better survival prospects than other terrorist groups.

When people do break the rules, what can standard data sources tell us about their behavior? Standard economic models of crime typically assume that individuals are indifferent to dishonesty, so that they will cheat or lie as long as the expected pecuniary benefits exceed the expected costs of being caught and punished. We investigate this presumption by studying the response to a change in tax reporting rules that made it much more difficult for taxpayers to evade taxes by inappropriately claiming additional dependents. The policy reform induced a substantial reduction in the number of dependents claimed, which indicates that many filers had been cheating before the reform. Yet, the number of filers who availed themselves of this evasion opportunity is dwarfed by the number of filers who passed up substantial tax savings by not claiming extra dependents. By declining the opportunity to cheat, these taxpayers reveal information about their willingness to pay to be honest. In our analysis, we develop a novel method for inferring the characteristics of taxpayers in the absence of audit data. Our findings indicate both that this willingness to pay to be honest is large on average and that it varies significantly across the population of taxpayers.","[LaLumia, Sara] Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Sallee, James M.] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Williams College; University of Chicago,"LaLumia, S (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",Sara.Lalumia@williams.edu; sallee@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,56,12,14,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

According to social identity theory, members of low-status groups with permeable group boundaries often use the strategy of individual upward mobility to achieve a positive self-concept. As they strive to move into higher status groups, they do not identify with in-group members and do not favour the in-group over the out-group. It is therefore assumed that due to the low status of the unemployed in society, they negatively evaluate their in-group and do not identify with other in-group members. Results indicate that the unemployed indeed perceived a lower status of their category and identified less with their category than various occupational categories. Moreover, the unemployed did not show in-group favouritism, whereas most occupational categories did: the unemployed evaluated the in-group just as negatively as it was evaluated by the out-group (self-insight perspective). Moreover, they even evaluated the in-group more negatively than they evaluated the out-group, i.e., they displayed an out-group favouritism (social comparison perspective). Poor identification with the in-group and a lack of in-group favouritism could explain why the unemployed do not have a strong lobby to represent and jointly defend their interests in society.

Although they belong to the same type of community (poor), they differ in the composition of their social network.

The Czech Republic is no exception. Demographic ageing is caused by the fact that mortality is dropping, especially infant mortality, and this expectation of life at birth. At the same time the birth rate is declining and subsequently total fertility rate drops below the preservation level of simple reproduction, which means that there are less children and more persons in particular in the older and oldest age-groups. It is very important to realise that the changes in the level of mortality bring with them positive impacts in lengthening of life expectancy on the one hand, but on the other hand, there is significant demographic ageing of the population. In this contribution we would like to show how the life expectancy has developed in the Czech Republic in a historical context and how it might develop in the coming years. For professionals the application of the tee-Carter method will certainly be interesting this is a method commonly used in the world by demographers and actuaries for modelling the future development of mortality and it is also the basic method used for stochastic demographic projections.","[Arltova, Marketa; Langhamrova, Jitka; Langhamrova, Jana] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Arltová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",arltova@vse.cz; langhamj@vse.cz; xlanj18@vse.cz,"Vrabcová, Jana/G-6312-2015; Langhamrová, Jitka/Z-2115-2019; Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018","Arltova, Marketa/0000-0001-7313-6927; Langhamrova, Jitka/0000-0002-8127-6433",,,,,24,26,26,0,10,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Connecticut in 1965; and second, the expansion of federal funding for local family planning programs from 1964 to 1973.

The aim of this paper is to revisit the economic voting phenomenon by investigating the asymmetric cointegration between government popularity and economic conditions in Taiwan over the period from 1992 to 2007. We employ an advanced threshold autoregressive model and find strong evidence of threshold cointegration relationships between our observed variables. Furthermore, an asymmetric error correction model indicates that voters use different economic indicators to evaluate government popularity in different regimes and the speed of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium is more rapid in the lower regime and slower in the higher regime. Finally, the evidence shows that the economic voting behavior is supported by the presence of the threshold effects. Based on the nonlinear, asymmetric and threshold effects, we are able to provide several critical implications concerning the governance of the incumbent political party, particularly, in relation to the promotion of economic policy aimed at improving its popularity.","[Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",Shih Chien University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,74,3,3,0,10,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

This study presents a quantitative estimate of the rebound effect for an air traffic network including the 22 busiest airports, which serve 14 of the highest O-D cities within the domestic U.S. aviation sector. To satisfy this objective, passenger flows, aircraft operations, flight delays and the resulting energy use are simulated. Our model results indicate that the average rebound effect in this network is about 19%, for the range of aircraft fuel burn reductions considered. This is the net impact of an increase in air transportation supply to satisfy the rising passenger demand, airline operational effects that further increase supply, and the mitigating effects of an increase in flight delays. Although the magnitude of the rebound effect is small, it can be significant for a sector that has comparatively few options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Starting in April 2002, the utility replaced prepayment meters with advanced meters that allow the consumer to track usage in real-time. We rely on this event, account for the endogeneity of price and payment plan with consumption through a plan selection correction term, and find that the provision of information is associated with a decline in electricity consumption of 11-17%. We find that the reduction is robust to different specifications, selection-bias correction methods and subsamples of the original data. The advanced metering program delivers reasonably cost-effective reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, even under the most conservative usage reduction scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

One of the sweeping suggestions of the NBP is to convert all incumbent local exchange carriers from rate-of-return (RoR) regulation to price cap regulation. Most of these RoR carriers are small Rural Local Exchange Carriers (RLECs) operating in sparsely populated, isolated territories of the US. Since AT&T's divestiture they have participated in revenue and cost sharing pools which have served as an effective mechanism for reducing unsystematic business risk. We stress that pooling makes both rate of return and price cap regulation operational in RLEC territories and has to be considered in the policy debates. Using cost and demand data from RLECs, we show that if FCC's suggestion was implemented under current price cap rules, many RLECs would likely face financial distress within 3 years of the regulatory regime change. We further show that allowing pooling arrangements under any regulatory regime could improve market efficiency. We suggest that potential efficiency gains are greatest when RLECs within a pooling arrangement have the option of remaining under RoR regulation or volunteering to move to a form of incentive regulation.

When there is sufficient commitment to expectation-based goals, goal-setting attenuates the present-biased agent's tendency to stop too early, and may even lead an agent to wait longer than the first-best. In particular, reference dependence is strictly worse for a time-consistent agent. Notably, none of the effects of goal-setting require loss aversion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This research is important because it observes and compares the results of those two efficiency measurement methods which former researches did not encompass. The research includes the banking industry and the insurance sector in the Republic of Croatia due to their relatively high asset share of about 83% in total financial sector asset. The main difference in results between DEA approach and accounting approach was remarked in sense of accounting approach efficiency measurement scores lag in the crisis period. DEA efficiency scores had the lowest values in the year 2007 for insurance industry and for banks in 2008 but with visible lower values already in 2007. The lowest ROA and ROE accounting ratios in the year 2009 could be explained by the fact that although financial institutions operate more efficiently in the crisis period in sense of expense and income results, accounting ratios cannot achieve as good scores as in period of a boom, due to the deteriorated market conditions, and more reserved business policy.","[Jurcevic, Branka; Zaja, Maja Mihelja] Univ Zagreb, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Jurcevic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",bjurcevic@efzg.hr; mmihelja@efzg.hr,"Zaja, Maja Mihelja/H-7872-2018","Zaja, Maja Mihelja/0000-0003-1111-3345",,,,,36,21,21,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We first obtain evidence of a fairly strong long-run equilibrium relationship among them. Second, we find that insurance market development has positive effects on real output and that banking activities have an unfavorable, if not negative, effect on real output. In fact, insurance market activity is much more productive than banking sector activity.

We exploit a series of reforms to the income-tax and payroll-tax schedules affecting individuals who earn less than twice the minimum wage. Our estimate for the elasticity of gross labor income with respect to the marginal net-of-income-tax rate is around 0.2, while we find no response to the marginal net-of-payroll-tax rate. The elasticity with respect to the average net-of-tax rate is not significant for the income-tax schedule, while it is close to -1 for the payroll-tax schedule. A plausible explanation is the existence of significant labor supply responses to the income-tax schedule, combined with sticky posted wages (i.e., the gross labor income minus payroll taxes divided by hours worked).

Two sets of unit root tests are applied first to check whether the variables of energy intensity and urbanization are heterogeneous with and without structural breaks. respectively. Cointegration tests are then applied to determine whether long-term relationships are present when structural breaks are or aren't accounted for. The asymmetric adjustment analyses are finally applied to examine how the variables in time-series respond to the deviations from the equilibrium through an integration of threshold vector error correction model (TVECM), and to examine how they respond to the co-existence of TVECM and the threshold. The findings of the systematic tests and analyses confirm the existence of non-linear causal relationships between the energy intensity and urbanization in China. Energy intensity has an asymmetric adjusting effect to urbanization in the whole country and the Central belt An asymmetric adjustment running from the energy intensity to urbanization is also identified when structural breaks are accounted for, which occurred in 1988, 1993, 2000 and 2006. Furthermore, the two-regime threshold vector error correction model shows that the adjustment process of the energy intensity toward equilibrium is highly persistent when a threshold is reached. There exists a mean-reverting behavior, indicating that the energy intensity grows faster than the urbanization in China when the threshold is reached. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, focus is placed on the erection of monuments and creation of national pantheons. National cultures were promoted in the Russian Empire at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th century. This promotion took a radical turn under Communism, when Soviet authorities set up institutes for this purpose. The former elites, few in number before 1917, who were not liquidated were integrated in the new elites who, in larger numbers, were formed under Communism. Since the collapse of the USSR, the survivors who represent these elites determine cultural policies in the nations born from the breakup. An essential characteristic of both Soviet and post-Soviet policies for the making of a national culture is the determination to totally control the process, as in a totalitarian or authoritarian system.","[Rumyantsev, Sergey] Humboldt Univ, Hist Inst, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,,sergnovator@yandex.ru,,,,,,,95,0,0,0,7,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

The politician obtains utility from net income that comes from his wage income, tax embezzlements and bribe-taking, and he also has incentives for tax re-distribution. The higher the tax embezzlements and the more bribes the politician takes the lower his citizens' trust and the less likely will he be re-elected. We support the evolution of trust with an econometric investigation. We analyze the necessary and sufficient conditions, and find that withholding taxes and taking bribes may be complements or substitutes for a politician, depending on the politician's incentives for tax re-distribution. Without these incentives, tax embezzlement and bribe taking are necessarily substitutes. With sufficiently strong incentives, we find re-distribution and bribe-taking may become complements. Complements implies that the politician, at least partly, increases bribe-taking because this allows him to increase re-distribution, which aids his additional motives for tax re-distribution. Based on comparative statics at steady state we also find that the higher the politician's wage the lower the bribe-taking and the higher the trust; stronger social capital leads to less bribe-taking and higher levels of trust; improvements in electoral accountability induce a decrease in bribing while trust increases.

The moving lineup of forces is examined that has presided over the arrangements made between church and state under President Chevardnadze (1992-2003) and since the Rose Revolution in 2003. The constitutional agreement signed in 2002 between the government and the Georgian Orthodox Church endows the latter, unlike other religious denominations, with symbolic, administrative and financial prerogatives.

The research of the impact of bidirectional self-employment factors on self-employment direction has been encouraged by several reasons. Firstly, the scientific literature lacks of the research to focus on the factors motivating self-employment sustainability. The more abilities a person has to sustain self-employment activity, the more benefits he brings to the country (GDP creation, increase of employment, taxes paid) and his personal environment (ensured material well-being, good psychological state, realized objectives). Secondly, realising the impact of self-employment factors on self-employment duration, the government of the country can start application of the targeted business regulation measures that can help to increase the employment rate in the country Using the methods of expert evaluation and correlation analysis, the impact of the highlighted self-employment factors on self-employment duration in the country with transition economy (Lithuanian case) has been evaluated: self-employment development is positively influenced by financial and non-financial business promotion measures, decreasing gross domestic product (GDP), extraversion, low level of neuroticism, openness, younger people, education andmarital status defined by having older children; it is negatively influenced by inflexible labour market, high unemployment rate, high income taxes and the immigrants.

An examination of developed economies This paper explores different possible factors that have impacted business cycle synchronization across industrialized countries in the past quarter century. We employ a comprehensive model that includes as the main determinants of output co-movements not only trade and financial integration, but also similarities of economic policies and political preferences across countries. Focusing on 14 developed countries from 1980 to 2010, our main finding is that economic policies and the political environment have strong influences on business cycles in each country and their correlations across countries. In particular, we find that having differing political parties between two countries lowers business cycles correlations, but only when we allow for partisan effects to dissipate several quarters after political elections. Our results hold while also controlling for economic determinants of business cycle correlations, including trade, finance, geography and measures of policy convergence. Our findings therefore demonstrate a more comprehensive link between these factors and business cycle synchronization than prior studies. Journal of Comparative Economics 41 (1) (2013) 212-226.

We investigate how different combinations of age and skill groups in the labor input and the ICT content of the capital input are related to TFP in the manufacturing industries of some OECD countries. We find that among the low-skilled the aging process is a negative driver of productivity, but among the high-skilled it is a positive driver. We also examine how the interactions of ICT intensity and worker age/skill combinations are related to TFP. We suggest labor and ICT indexes which tell how much the development of age/skill group shares would have affected TFP without increase in ICT use, or how much ICT would have affected TFP without changes in work force composition.

The ARMA models were initially used to obtain uncorrelated residuals, which were later used for the analysis of extreme values. The GARCH, EGARCH and GJR-GARCH models, by including past volatility, are particularly useful both in instability and calm periods. Moreover, the asymmetric models GJR-GARCH and EGARCH handle differently the impact of positive and negative shocks in the market. The importance of the IPC in the Mexican economy raises the need to study its variations, particularly its downward movement; so, we propose to use VaR to calculate the maximum loss that IPC may have, at a certain level of reliability, in a given period of time, using more efficient models to dynamically quantify volatility. The Riskmetrics approach was parallelly used as a way to compare the methodology proposed. The results indicate that the ARMA-GARCH-EVT methodology showed a better performance than Riskmetrics, because of the simultaneous adjustment of ARMA-GARCH models for returns and variances respectively. Although estimates of the EGARCH models had fewer violations of VaR, the estimates of the three models used for volatility were more accurate than the others, evaluated at the same error and reliability levels through the Kupiec Likelihood Ratio test.","[Aguirre Salado, Alejandro Ivan; Vaquera Huerta, Humberto; Ramirez Guzman, Martha Elva; Valdez Lazalde, Jose Rene] Colegio Posgrad, Texcoco, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Aguirre Salado, Carlos Arturo] Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Fac Ingn, San Luis Potosi, Mexico",Colegio de Postgraduados - Mexico; Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi,"Salado, AIA (通讯作者)，Colegio Posgrad, Campus Montecillo, Texcoco, Estado De Mexic, Mexico.",aleaguirre84@colpos.mx; hvaquera@colpos.mx; martharg@colpos.mx; valdez@colpos.mx; carlos.aguirre@uaslp.mx,"valdez-lazalde, jose rene/AAR-6007-2021; Huerta, Humberto Vaquera/B-4758-2010; Aguirre-Salado, Carlos Arturo/E-4499-2012","Aguirre-Salado, Carlos Arturo/0000-0003-3422-7193",,,,,34,0,0,0,7,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

Dynamic equilibria, where the bequest motive is occasionally operative, cannot emerge. This paper studies bequest-giving behavior and out-of-steady-state bequest and growth dynamics in a Ak model with intra- and inter-generational consumption externalities. These externalities, by their very presence, do not destroy Ricardian equivalence. They may, however, give rise to deviant generations-generations that do not leave a bequest having received an inheritance, and vice versa-and that seals the fate for Ricardian equivalence. Consumption externalities may also generate interesting indeterminacies and endogenous growth cycles that did not exist otherwise.","[Barnett, Richard C.] Drexel Univ, Dept Econ, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bhattacharya, Joydeep; Bunzel, Helle] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50014 USA",Drexel University; Iowa State University,"Bhattacharya, J (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50014 USA.",joydeep@iastate.edu,,"Bhattacharya, Joydeep/0000-0002-3148-4592",,,,,32,6,7,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Stewart (1997) noted that human capital includes the dynamics of an intelligent (learning) organization in a changing competitive environment, its creativity, and innovativeness (Stewart, 1997, p. 13). However, the dynamics of an organization can be affected by differences in locations, time zones, cultural and societal differences, as well as many more factors. The key to addressing these items is constant communication, as well as applying a continuous improvement program. While many companies may seek to expand, they may only focus on the profits as an immediate reward. However, they also need to consider the value of their employees and what they can bring to the table, as well as how the employer can help develop their employees to their fullest extent. Thus, many organizations are starting to realize the importance of having a learning organization that constantly monitors and tries to improve upon its current practices and strategies, as well as reflecting on lessons learned. According to Senge (1990), learning organizations [are] organizations where people continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are continually learning to see the whole together. (p. 3) However, in many organizations, employees may be tied to specific performance requirements and set methods of modus operandi, which may limit their own personal development. If the employees are not considered in terms of their value and potential, then the organizations starts to fail in their capacity as a learning organization. In particular, some learning organizations may only be seen as valuable in terms of helping their employees in or near the main location. Expatriates may feel distanced from the main organization and lacking in proper attention and/or training for their jobs. On the other hand, many of these organizations who are now expanding globally are realizing the need to keep a close connection to the expatriate and the main headquarters. One way that many learning organizations are connecting employees and showing a personal interest in their employees is through the creation of mentoring program. While many people think of mentoring relationships as being on an one-on-one basis and in the same physical location, this is changing with modern technology. Thus, this paper will focus on the importance and need to create mentoring program as another lay of commitment in which management and employees can connect and help develop the organization's intellectual capital both locally and globally.","Amer Publ Univ, Charles Town, WV 25414 USA",American Public University System; American Public University,"Barrett, B (通讯作者)，Amer Publ Univ, Charles Town, WV 25414 USA.",docjob00@msn.com,,,,,,,17,0,4,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,47,53,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000006,0

Unlike as in the case of weak or no network externalities, owners of firms do not face a Prisoners' Dilemma type of situation while deciding incentive schemes - sales-oriented vis-a-vis based on profits only - for managers in the presence of strong network externalities.

With the increasing popularity of regime switching and time-varying parameter models for predicting power prices, the multi model and evolutionary considerations that usually support the combining of simpler time series methods may be less applicable when the individual models incorporate these features. We address this question with a backtesting analysis on British day-ahead prices. Furthermore, given the volatility of power prices and concerns about accurate forecasting under extreme price excursions, we evaluate the results using various error metrics including expected shortfall. The comparisons are furthermore carefully simulated to consider model selection uncertainty in order to realistically test the value of combining as an ex ante policy. Overall, our results support combining for both accurate operational planning and risk management. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The results of the EFA revealed unidimensionality for the measurement of IC and performance variables. The analysis of hierarchical multiple regressions allowed us to support the hypothesis that measurement of IC explained a significant additional proportion of variance in performance above and beyond that of number of hotel rooms and hotel ranking.

A switch from capital income taxes to labor income taxes reduces the long-run welfare coming from lower leisure and increases the long-run welfare originated from higher economic growth and higher consumption. Because the representative agent's learning time and human capital are inseparable and thus affect learning activities at the same degree, we find that based on the current US income tax code, it is optimal to first tax capital income, and to resort to taxing labor income only when tax revenue is insufficient to cover government expenditure.

We built textual-based indicators of disclosure, by applying the content analysis technique to financial and accounting reports provided by the companies prior to the events. We also use financial measures, as proxies for the existence of intangibles, to compare their explanatory power for growth and corporate profitability, the analytical dimensions for financial performance. Using Structural Equations Modeling, via Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS), we find positive relationships among these indicators. Best results were achieved by models developed with variables of semantic origin, in comparison to those with financial indicators only. The results obtained lead to the conclusion that the strategic choice for business growth via M&A transactions favors the acquisition of intangible assets by companies in search of improved performance, validating the strategic option for the M&A.","[Cruz Basso, Leonardo Fernando; Bido, Diogenes; Kimura, Herbert] Univ Presbiteriana Mackenzie, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Seligmann-Feitosa, Evelyn] Univ Fed Piaui, Teresina, Brazil",Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie; Universidade Federal do Piaui,"Basso, LFC (通讯作者)，Univ Presbiteriana Mackenzie, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",leonardobasso@mackenzie.br; evsf@globo.com; dbido@mackenzie.com; herbert.kimura@gmail.com,"Bido, Diogenes Souza/F-7112-2012; Basso, Leonardo Fernando Cruz/N-3925-2019","Bido, Diogenes Souza/0000-0002-8525-5218; Basso, Leonardo Fernando Cruz/0000-0002-3064-0194",,,,,35,0,0,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,63,73,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000008,0

A first composite good may be used for consumption or investment on a one-to-one basis, while a second good is only used for accumulation, solely capital inputs being part of the production process. This framework is first considered from the allocative standpoint through the derivation of the frontier of the production possibility set. Having defined the perfect foresight competitive equilibrium that also describes a Pareto optimum over time, attention is then given to the potential for unbounded steady growth solutions. Under interiority, summability, and expansivity restrictions, there is a unique optimal steady growth rate. For unitary depreciation rates of both capital goods, locally there exists a unique convergent sequence to this steady growth solution that exhibits a saddlepoint structure. However, as soon as one of the depreciation rates of the capital goods is non-unitary and the profit share accruing to the first capital stock is greater in the second pure accumulation industry than in the first composite good industry, the steady growth solution shows a loss of stability, and competitive equilibrium growth cycles emerge through the occurrence of a flip bifurcation in its neighborhood. This is the first optimal cycles result based upon a production set that does not explicitly incorporate any exogenously determined primary labor input in its definition.","CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Drugeon, JP (通讯作者)，CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Maison Sci Econ,Bur 307,106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",jpdrug@asterix.univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Two institutional patterns are investigated. Ownership separation entails full unbundling between upstream and downstream activities. Legal separation allows a downstream firm to own the upstream monopolist but requires the two entities to be legally unbundled so that each service is stand-alone profitable and only upstream profits are regulated. Under regulatory limited information about upstream costs, the legally separated monopolist exhibits countervailing incentives to manipulate costs. This alleviates the regulator's control problem and yields higher welfare than ownership separation.","Humboldt Univ, Inst Econ Theory 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Fiocco, R (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Econ Theory 1, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",raffaele.fiocco@staff.hu-berlin.de,"Fiocco, Raffaele/AAE-1027-2020","Fiocco, Raffaele/0000-0002-8078-3222",,,,,26,1,1,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The RA indicators use the data from the Property Composite Index (PCI) and the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSECI). The empirical result shows that investors involved in the real estate security market have lower RA compared to those in the general security market. Particularly, RA indicators for both indices started to fall markedly in early 2008 and even more so after September 2008. The changes in RA suggest that the overall investors' attitudes nowadays towards China's stock market are never as pessimistic as before.","[Zheng, Xian] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hui, Eddie Chi-man; Wang, Hui] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon 852, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Zheng, X (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jeremy.zheng@hotmail.com,"Zheng, Xian/B-4625-2010; Hui, Eddie Chi Man/L-2037-2016; zheng, xian/HJJ-1413-2023","Hui, Eddie Chi Man/0000-0002-6974-891X; zheng, xian/0000-0001-6197-1220",,,,,20,11,11,2,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Model Distraction: A Comment on Daveri and Tabellini. Econ Journal Watch 10(1): 15-24. An article by Francesco Daveri and Guido Tabellini (2000) combines empirics and a general-equilibrium overlapping-generations model to recommend the reduction of labor taxation and pension expenditures. I demonstrate that, in the model, unemployment would be zero if unemployment benefits remained between zero and a certain value that is dependent on the level of wage taxation. My demonstration leads to two questions: (1) Why should the government introduce unemployment benefits in an economy that otherwise would always operate at full employment? (2) Why is the reader led to believe that the reduction of labor taxation and pension expenditure are the main economic policy indications that derive from the model? Since, in the Daveri and Tabellini model, unemployment benefits are a waste of resources, the reduction of unemployment benefits is the best way to reduce unemployment.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Imperia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",andrea.imperia@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,8,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

It is not sufficient to evaluate past performance of a company but it is necessary to determine planned values and specify ways of achievement and measurement of these values. Currently, traditional methods of measuring company performance are widely used but they are not sufficient because they do not allow a conclusive analysis of causal relationships. Therefore, it is necessary to involve new methods and models that assess the company performance not only from the quantitative, but also the qualitative perspective. For this purpose, new or modified Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are used. The main aim of this article Is to analyse If companies use particular methods of performance measurement and if so, which methods. The subsidiary objective consists in finding differences between various types of companies. First part provides a short summary of theoretical aspects of company performance measurement, including some definitions of the term performance. After that, a short description of the role of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems In the environment of a company is given.

Yet, countries continually choose to restrict the flow of capital both into and out of the country. Why is this done? Is it done to protect the domestic banking system, to control the domestic money supply, to manage the exchange rate, to provide stability for internal markets or to avoid wide swings in the availability of capital? Are these controls effective in precluding wide swings in a country's international trade balance? This article uses panel data in a logit model to analyse policy choice with respect to an international trade and/or investment regime.

We use UK industry data, which covers both manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries, and identify productivity shocks using long-run restrictions and structural vector autoregression methodology. Our findings show that the unconditional correlation between growth rates of productivity and hours is negative in almost all the industries, and the correlation conditional on productivity shocks is negative in over three-quarters of the industries. After a positive productivity shock, hours fall in 26 of the 31 industries. The findings at the aggregate level are consistent with those at industry level. We note some striking differences in comparison to the recent US literature. Significantly larger capital adjustment costs in the UK help account for the UK-US differences. Moreover, UK industries with higher investment elasticities (lower capital adjustment costs) have less negative impact effects of hours.","[Tsoukalas, John] Univ Glasgow, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Glasgow G12 8RT, Lanark, Scotland; [Khan, Hashmat] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",University of Glasgow; Carleton University,"Tsoukalas, J (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8RT, Lanark, Scotland.",john.tsoukalas@glasgow.ac.uk,"Khan, Hashmat/AAE-9991-2020","Khan, Hashmat/0000-0002-9625-7251",,,,,34,0,0,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

A foreign subsidiary sharing a parent firm's technology will invest more if it has more foreign-educated labor, since it can utilize this labor more productively because of the country-specific human capital.

This article centers on providing a new regression specification that can help better gauge the CPI's reliability. More specifically, based on the stochastic approach to index numbers, we argue that the conventional treatment of the systematic changes in relative prices should be made time variant. We therefore propose a more comprehensive regression specification by including additional dummies that represent different general inflation rate levels and business cycle phases. Under this framework, we are more capable of avoiding possible misspecifications in the regression equation, as was experienced by Clements and Izan (1987). It also allows us to better answer the 'Keynes' critic' regarding the stochastic approach to index numbers. The empirical results of Australia and the US are used to validate the merit of our specification.","[Liang, Kuo-Yuan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Liang, Kuo-Yuan; Yen, Chen-Hui] Polaris Res Inst, Taipei 10488, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Liang, KY (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",Kyliang@yuanta.com,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using data from 1990s Indonesia, where minimum wages increased in a varied way, I develop a difference in spatial differences estimator which weakens the common trend assumption of difference in differences. Estimation reveals strong trends in support of a big push: formal employment increases and informal employment decreases in response to the minimum wage. Local product demand also increases, and this formalization occurs only in the non-tradable, industrializable industries suggested by the model (while employment in tradable and non-industrializable industries also conforms to model predictions).

The second methodology employs SFA to estimate and analyse TE scores. Two federal milk policies are considered in this research: marketing policy and milk income loss policy. Federal milk marketing program has shown a significant and negative impact on TE with both methods. Payments under the milk income loss program have shown a positive significant impact in SFA analysis.

However, this sort of Public support, has ended in a material rise in Public Deficit. Paradoxically, Europe rather than the US has approached this issue by applying restrictive expense rules, reducing national sovereignty.

We show that, if the efficiency of knowledge to reduce emissions is sufficiently high, a higher output is compatible with lower emissions in both levels and growth rates. Additionally, if the two instruments are used together the economy may achieve a higher output and lower emissions since the subsidy may offset, at least partially, the negative tax effects.

The class of scale-invariant (SI) ambiguity-averse preferences, in a broad sense, is uniquely characterized by a multiple-prior utility representation. Adding a weak certainty-independence axiom is shown to imply either unit co-efficient of relative risk aversion (CRRA) toward roulette risk or SI maxmin expected utility. Removing the weak independence axiom but adding a separability assumption on preferences over pure horse-race bets leads to source-dependent constant-relative-risk-aversion expected utility with a higher CRRA assigned to horse-race uncertainty than to roulette risk. The multiple-prior representation in this case is shown to generalize entropic variational preferences.

Chari et al. (2002) refer to the inability of models to replicate the previous stylized fact as the consumption-RER anomaly. In this article, it is shown that an International Real Business Cycle (IRBC) model, similar to the one proposed by Chari et al. but extended by considering nontraded goods and an incomplete asset market structure, can solve the anomaly. Nontradable goods amplify wealth effects arising from the incomplete assets market structure, generating a negative co-movement between the RER and relative consumption. Adding Distribution Services (DS) improves the performance of the model in some other dimensions. In particular, DS help to generate countercyclical net exports.","Pontificia Univ Catolica, Dept Finance, CENTRUM Catolica & Prima AFP, Lima 33, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Tuesta, V (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica, Dept Finance, CENTRUM Catolica & Prima AFP, Lima 33, Peru.",vtuesta@pucp.edu.pe,"Tuesta, Vicente/HTR-5134-2023",,,,,,36,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The paper also deals with the quantitative coding of authorial intentions, which enables to convert the variables used in the narratives and qualitative research such as interviews into quantitative variables and compare them to the variables used in quantitative research or to make their analysis using the quantitative methods. This methodology is based on the combination of Romanticist, Phenomenological, Dialectical, Critical, and Post-structural hermeneutic systems of interpretation described by Demeterio III. These systems allowed describing the phenomena of knowledge producing which is important in selecting the right hermeneutical coding construct. In this methodology the hermeneutical coding consists of four structural elements: text, interpreter, reality and variables. In order to ensure the repeatability of coding results the special coding sequence was designed. It combines six stages of content processing and coding: reading the text and understanding its overall meaning (based on selection and use of hermeneutic systems), identification of text's logical structure (based on Wilkinson's Key and Hook technique), dividing the text into logical passages, comparative analysis of the logical passages and their conflation into coherent logical sequence, operationalization of the logical passages (based on operationalization technique of Merkys and Six unit coding sequence given by Weber), and dichotomous coding (based on Whicker & Lynn dichotomous coding).","Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Vaitkevicius, S (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",sigitas.vaitkevicius@ktu.lt,,,,,,,25,5,6,0,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Together with intangibles, family firms are the most important wealth-creation agents. Their resources and capabilities can make a considerable difference between family and non-family organisations. These firms possess idiosyncratic resources of an intangible and tacit nature that are inherent to them because they have been generated throughout the firms' history. Precisely for their condition as 'family' firms, these firms are a source of intangible assets which can provide the basis for their later achievement of competitive advantages. Based on the literature devoted to family firms, the human capital theory and the intellectual capital-based view of the firm, the present paper has as its aim not only to identify the most important human capital intangibles owned by family firms but also to show a series of indicators that can help measure them. For this purpose, the paper firstly refers to the most important human resources practices that permit the maximum capitalisation of human resources available to the firm; it secondly identifies 12 intangibles which characterise the human capital of family firms; and finally, 32 indicators have been created to measure all human capital intangibles identified in family firms. Our main motivation stems from the fact that individuals represent the most important input for knowledge work, which is structured around people's skills and competences rather than around the execution of programmed tasks and work routines. The human capital theory states that individuals own skills, experience and knowledge which provide economic value to firms. Therefore, knowing the human capital intangibles of family firms -as well as the indicators which can be used to measure them-will surely help improve the management of those intangibles, thus making the most of intellectual capital.","[Zaragoza-Saez, Patrocinio; Claver-Cortes, Enrique; Molina-Manchon, Hipolito] Univ Alicante, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Zaragoza-Sáez, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",Patrocinio.zaragoza@ua.es; Enrique.claver@ua.es; Hipolito.molina@ua.es,"Claver-Cortés, Enrique/AAC-5901-2020",,,,,,37,0,1,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,477,484,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000055,0

The development of advertising on social networks has led to a new way of communicating between business entities and consumers. Social networks have replaced the traditional media. Groups based on a common interest are formed on social networks, so business entities can attract both the current and potential consumers by having a profile on a network (Facebook, Twitter, You Tube, Linkedin). Experiences from all over the world indicate the increasing role of platform use in marketing. According to the latest relevant research results, the key benefits of social networks include building of a recognized name, increasing turnover and making new business partnerships. In line with the above trend, properties of using social groups for business entities in Croatia should be identified. Forrester, an American company, classifies social network users by the following types: Creators, Conversationalists, Critics, Collectors, Joiners, Spectators and Inactives. Accordingly, business entities should create their profiles on different social networks with multimedia content that can be offered to social network users, i.e. consumers sharing a common interest. Web 2.0 technology contributes to the development of collective awareness. Business entities should therefore increase their use of social networks that have a great effect on our culture, which will consequently lead to their recognizability on the Internet and creation of competitive advantages.","[Bilos, Antun; Kelic, Ivan] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Bilos, A (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",abilos@efos.hr; ikelic@efos.hr,"Biloš, Antun/AAF-9709-2020","Biloš, Antun/0000-0003-1676-5959",,,,,24,6,7,3,86,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Analyzing the tradeoff is much more challenging than often presumed because the value of electricity is extremely dependent on the time and location at which it is produced, which is not very controllable with some renewables, such as wind and solar. Likewise, the pollution benefits from renewable generation depend on what type of generation it displaces, which also depends on time and location. Without incorporating these factors, cost-benefit analyses of alternatives are likely to be misleading. Other common arguments for subsidizing renewable power-green jobs, energy security, and driving down fossil energy prices-are unlikely to substantially alter the analysis. The role of intellectual property spillovers is a strong argument for subsidizing energy science research, but less persuasive as an enhancement to the value of installing current renewable energy technologies.","[Borenstein, Severin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Borenstein, Severin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Borenstein, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",borenste@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,52,235,278,4,61,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

To motivate the empirical work, we adapt Besley and Case's model (American Economic Review, 1995) to a model of yardstick competition 'from the top'. In this model, the central government (rather than local voters) creates competition among local officials by rewarding or punishing them on the basis of relative performance in providing public services. Our theoretical framework predicts that, in this context, the central government spurs strategic interactions among governors with similar environments as voters do in democratic countries. Then, for the first time in our knowledge, by estimating a spatial lag dynamic model for a panel data of 29 Chinese provinces from 1980 to 2004, we provide empirical evidence of the existence of such public spending interactions. We propose a rigorous empirical framework which takes into account heterogeneity. endogeneity problems and spatial error dependence. The results tend to confirm the existence of strategic interactions among geographically and economically close Chinese provinces, operating in a vertical bureaucratic control system.

For every US$1000 dollar of Chinese exports in 2007 (2002), DVA and employment are estimated to be US$591 (US$466) and 0.096 (0.242) person-year, respectively. To implement these estimations, we use hitherto unpublished Chinese government data to construct several completely new datasets, including an input-output table with separate input-output and employment-output coefficients for processing exports, non-processing exports, and output for domestic use. We hypothesize that, in comparison with the export sector, China's domestic sector would be relatively autarkic due to China's history of central planning. We expect that exports would generate less OVA and employment than output for domestic use. Processing exports, which are highly dependent on imported inputs, would similarly generate less DVA and employment than non-processing exports. Our findings support these expectations. For both 2002 and 2007, the OVA and employment effects of domestic final demand were higher than those of non-processing exports, which were in turn higher than those of processing exports. However, with the progress of economic reforms, we found that the total DVAs of exports and domestic final demand have converged from 2002 to 2007. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We find that farms are asymmetrically credit constrained with respect to inputs. Farm use of variable inputs and capital investment increases up to 2.3% and 29%, respectively, per 1000 EUR of additional credit. Our estimates suggest also that farm access to credit increases the total factor productivity up to 1.9% per 1000 EUR of additional credit, indicating that an improved access to credit results in adjusting the relative input intensities on farms. This finding is further supported by a negative effect of better access to credit on labour, suggesting that these two are substitutes. Interestingly, farms are found not to be credit constrained with respect to land.","[Ciaian, Pavel] European Commiss DG JRC, Seville 41092, Spain; [Falkowski, Jan] Univ Warsaw, Ctr Econ Analyses Publ Sector, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland; [Kancs, D'Artis] European Commiss, DG Joint Res Ctr IPTS, Brussels, Belgium; [Kancs, D'Artis] Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Kancs, D'Artis] Econ & Econometr Res Inst, Brussels, Belgium",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); University of Warsaw; European Commission Joint Research Centre; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Ciaian, P (通讯作者)，European Commiss DG JRC, Edificio Expo,C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",pavel.ciaian@ec.europa.eu; jfalkowski@wne.uw.edu.pl; d'artis.kancs@ec.europa.eu,"Kancs, d'Artis/K-3374-2014; Fałkowski, Jan/ABE-9726-2020; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Fałkowski, Jan/0000-0001-6921-6342; Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850; Kancs, d'Artis/0000-0002-8514-725X",,,,,46,4,4,0,32,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We find that young Australians from non-English-speaking-background (NESB) immigrant families have an educational advantage over their English-speaking-background (ESB) immigrant and Australian-born peers. The educational advantages associated with immigrant parents higher educational attainment are counterbalanced by the disadvantages associated with immigrant families greater socioeconomic disadvantage, making endowment effects overall relatively unimportant in explaining the gap. Instead, most of the educational gap associated with immigration background stems from differences in the educational attainment of immigrant and native-born youths with the same characteristics. While immigrant parents do not have an enhanced ability to transmit their own educational advantage to their children, they are more effective in shielding their children from some of the negative educational consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage. Finally, immigrant youths residential patterns convey substantial educational advantages to them.","[Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Inst Study Labor IZA, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Trong-Ha Nguyen] Univ Queensland, Ctr Natl Res Disabil & Rehabil Med, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Queensland,"Cobb-Clark, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Inst Study Labor IZA, Level 7,Alan Gilbert Bldg,161 Barry St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",d.cobb-clark@unimelb.edu.au,"Nguyen, Ha/GWQ-7088-2022; Cobb-Clark, Deborah/H-1153-2013","Nguyen, Ha/0000-0002-2240-8942; Cobb-Clark, Deborah/0000-0003-2895-7886",,,,,47,10,15,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

The basis of their challenge is the 'selection effect' - re-setting firms are not selected at random, they are those firms whose prices are furthest from the optimal reset price. Because of this the aggregate price level is sufficiently flexible for monetary neutrality. In this paper I add price review costs to an otherwise standard Golosov and Lucas model.

Our results suggest that entrepreneurship has a significant positive effect on economic growth and this finding is robust even after we control for other demographic and institutional variables.

The success of economic catch-up development depends essentially on the interconnection between pre-existing informal constraints on the one hand and novel, imported institutions on the other. Hence culture, understood as the interplay between legal rules and non-legal constraints, has to be considered as an important determinant of economic development and growth. In order to adapt economic policies and thereby prevent institutional traps, which may otherwise hinder economic reforms, it is essential to understand culture and the ways in which different cultural factors support or constrain the functioning of formal institutional settings. Applying a cultural approach to economics in the case of Indonesia's economic development allows for the inclusion of complex cultural conditionality of economic behavior and puts special emphasis on the role of politicians as public and cultural entrepreneurs. Altogether, the example of Indonesia demonstrates once more the necessity to apply a cultural approach to the study of catch-up development in a globalized world.","[Spranz, Roger] Leibniz Ctr Marine Trop Ecol ZMT, Bremen, Germany; [Lenger, Alexander] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Goldschmidt, Nils] Munich Univ Appl Sci, Freiburg, Germany; [Goldschmidt, Nils] Walter Eucken Inst, Freiburg, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT); Goethe University Frankfurt,"Spranz, R (通讯作者)，Leibniz Ctr Marine Trop Ecol ZMT, Bremen, Germany.",nils.goldschmidt@hm.edu,,,,,,,109,12,12,0,33,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The empirical results of this study, based on the dynamic panel models, provide new evidence that highlights the nonlinear U-shaped relationship between financial deepening and income distribution. It implies the narrowing of the income-inequality gap at the early stage of financial development of the countries. This improvement, however, will only be sustainable dynamically below a certain threshold level. Further deepening above that level will lead to a reverse effect, which deteriorates income inequality. This reflects the inefficiency of financial markets in improving economic inequality when the threshold level is overshot.","[Tan, Hui-Boon] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Semenyih 43500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Law, Siong-Hook] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Serdang 43400, Selangor Darul, Malaysia",University of Nottingham Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Tan, HB (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Univ Nottingham Malaysia Campus,Jalan Broga, Semenyih 43500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",hui-boon.tan@nottingham.edu.my,"Law, Siong Hook/AAF-6672-2020","Law, Siong Hook/0000-0002-6058-4883",,,,,24,51,54,2,34,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

By taking these breaks into account, results of the present study reveal that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between imports and exports over the sample period, 1960-2007.

This paper uses household survey data from Eritrea to estimate the effect of exposure to the 1998-2000 Eritrea-Ethiopia war on children's health. The identification strategy exploits exogenous variation in the conflict's geographic extent and timing and the exposure of different birth cohorts to the fighting. The unique survey data include details on each household's migration history, which allows us to measure a child's geographic location during the war and without which war exposure would be incorrectly classified. War-exposed children have lower height-for-age Z-scores, with similar effects for children born before or during the war. Both boys and girls who are born during the war experience negative impacts due to conflict. Effects are robust to including region-specific time trends, alternative conflict exposure measures, and mother fixed effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, relatively large groups of people have become ethnic minorities in other countries. They may conserve their ethnic identities, and therefore their children may accumulate ethnic human capital (e.g., language, culture, and religion) in addition to the general human capital of the country. Therefore, they can get access to an appropriate occupation linked by tradition or other factors to their ethnic group. This paper uses estimates from a selection model with an endogenous switch among three broad types of occupational groups to analyze the composition of the wage gap between Romanians and ethnic Hungarians in Romania before and during the transition from a planned to a market economy. The results suggest that the institutional settings of the controlled economy allowed Romanians to work in occupations that gave them the best returns, while the changes during the transition years allowed ethnic Hungarians to work in occupations that gave them the best returns.

This is possible only if we contest the vulgate that, after Sraffa, we have to accept a surplus approach which is mutilated from the labour theory of value. The connection between value and labour must be argued differently than in the old and new interpretations of Marx, according to the method of positing the presuppositions. To do this, some debates of the 1960s and 1970s are reviewed. Then, the shifting interpretations of Marx by Sraffa are considered, taking into account the (conflicting) views among Sraffian interpreters. Sraffa's normalisations may be interpreted as implying that national income is nothing but a monetary exhibition of (the objectification of) living labour. This, together with Sraffa's redefinition of the rate of surplus value at prices of production rather than at labour values, allows the building of a bridge with the new interpretation of Marx. The paper, however, stresses also some differences: between Sraffa and the new interpretation, and between the two and Marx. The labour theory of value is non-redundant in the inquiry about the constitution of the 'givens' in Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities, because those 'givens' are traced back to a social relation of production. Moreover, the value of labour power is interpreted from a macroclass monetary perspective, akin to the circuitist and post-Keynesian approaches.","[Bellofiore, Riccardo] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy",University of Bergamo,"Bellofiore, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Sci Econ Hyman P Minsky, Bergamo, Italy.",riccardo.bellofiore@unibg.it,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The results show that the consumer price formation in Latvia is a combination of both state-dependent and time-dependent behaviours. On the one hand, frequency of price changes depends on inflation, demand conditions, and the size of last price changes. On the other hand, we observe some elements of time-dependent price setting like price truncation and strong seasonal pattern. We also find several important differences in the price setting behaviour in cases of price increases and decreases. The fact that frequency of price changes in Latvia depends on inflation as well as demand and supply conditions allows for faster price adjustment process in the event of high distortions in the economy.

Four global tax scenarios are examined using the integrated assessment model WITCH. Taxes are levied on all greenhouse gases (GHGs) and lead to global GHG concentrations equal to 680, 560, 500 and 460 ppm CO2-eq in 2100. Investments in the power sector increase with respect to the Reference scenario only with the two highest taxes. Investments in energy-related R&D increase in all tax scenarios, but they are a small fraction of GDP. Investments in oil upstream decline in all scenarios. As a result, total investments decline with respect to the Reference scenario. Carbon tax revenues are high in absolute terms and as share of GDP. With high carbon taxes, tax revenues follow a carbon Lifter curve. The model assumes that tax revenues are flawlessly recycled lump-sum into the economy. In all scenarios, the power sector becomes a net recipient of subsidies to support the absorption of GHGs. In some regions, with high carbon taxes, subsidies to GHG removal are higher than tax revenues at the end of the century. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The reason is that only an internal labor market can exploit higher tier rents for incentive provision on lower tiers. Given unobservable heterogeneity of workers, relying on an internal labor market has the further advantage of improving the selection of high ability workers for higher ranks, which is complemented by rent-based incentive schemes. However, observable worker heterogeneity gives rise to a trade-off between incentive and selection issues and may lead to ports of entry on higher tiers of the hierarchy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the combined impacts of mobile phone use and personal networks by using panel data from 856 households in 94 communities in rural Uganda, where the number of communities with mobile network coverage increased from 41 to 87 communities over a 2-year period between the first and second surveys, conducted in 2003 and 2005, respectively. We find first that the possession of mobile phone handsets at the household level increases an individuals chance of leaving his or her rural village to find a job, and second, that mobile phone use increases the chance that an individual will choose migration to a greater degree for individuals who belong to a smaller ethnic group than to a larger group in the capital city, Kampala.","[Muto, Megumi] Japan Int Cooperat Agcy, Tokyo, Japan",,"Muto, M (通讯作者)，5-25 Niban Cho,Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1028012, Japan.",Muto.Megumi@jica.go.jp,,,,,,,26,15,16,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

In tourism also, it is believed that the competitiveness of enterprises to a great extent depends upon their innovation activity. Surprisingly, in tourism the research on innovation has so far received poor attention from scholars, especially in empirical research. This article aims at filling that gap. It will present results from an empirical study of innovation activity carried out during the spring/summer 2010 in the hotel sector in Croatia. Due to the problem of empirical measurement of innovation and the specific characteristics of hotel sector, the CIS IV1 questionnaire design was used and adapted for this purpose. CIS questionnaire has been criticized by scholars for its deficiencies in measuring innovation in services. Still, after an extensive literature and research review, it has been concluded that with the adaptations made, it is the best available tool for this purpose. The research preliminary results suggest that Croatian hotels can be portrayed as only moderately innovative and with different innovation activity according to innovation type and newness. Furthermore, parallels, where possible, are drawn to other similar research carried out in other countries (Spain and Austria) as to be able to benchmark the innovation activity of Croatian hotels. Based upon the empirical results, recommendations and guidelines for hotel practice as well as for activities of regulatory bodies are given.","[Pivcevic, Smiljana; Pranicevic, Daniela Garbin] Fac Econ, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Pivcevic, S (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Matice Hrvatske 31, Split 21000, Croatia.",smipi@efst.hr; daniela@efst.hrz,"Pivcevic, Smiljana/F-7947-2017; Praničević, Daniela Garbin/E-1315-2017","Pivcevic, Smiljana/0000-0002-8517-5779;",,,,,52,21,25,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The model analyzes optimal pricing when consumers are loss averse in the sense that an unexpected price hike lowers their willingness to pay. The main message of the Heidhues-KAszegi model, namely that this form of consumer loss aversion leads to rigid price responses to cost fluctuations, carries over. I demonstrate the usefulness of this cover version of the Heidhues-KAszegi-Rabin model by obtaining new results: (1) loss aversion lowers expected prices; (2) the firm's incentive to adopt a rigid pricing strategy is stronger when fluctuations are in demand rather than in costs.","[Spiegler, Ran] UCL, London, England; [Spiegler, Ran] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",University of London; University College London; Tel Aviv University,"Spiegler, R (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",r.spiegler@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,13,23,30,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Conventional economics predicts no substantive improvement from improvements to financial literacy. The errors and biases approach to behavioural economics suggests limited improvements to decision making from financial education as errors and biases are largely hardwired in the brain. Government and expert intervention affecting individual choice behaviour is recommended. The evidence suggests that the bounded rationality approach to behavioural economics, with its focus on smart decision makers and the importance institutional and environment constraints on decision making, is the most promising lense through which to analyse financial decision making. From this perspective, financial decision making can be improved by providing decision makers with better quality information presented in a non-complex fashion, an institutional environment conducive to good decisions, an incentive structure that internalize externalities involved in financial decision making, and financial education that will facilitate making the best use of the information at hand within a specific decision-making environment.

Convergence of viewpoints may reflect reasonable compromises, for example if jury deliberations reflect informational influences and social learning which allow individual jurors to correct biases, misunderstandings and/or imperfect recall of evidence. Conversely, some individuals may converge towards others' viewpoints because of normative influences including peer pressure and preferences for conformity and these can generate biases in the final jury judgements. This paper presents experimental data showing that groups do have a significant tendency to compromise in jury-like settings. Econometric evidence shows that group characteristics, including the presence of acquaintances and strangers within the jury group, affect the extent of compromise. The implications are that jury deliberations may be biased by factors not relevant to a specific case, limiting the objectivity of jury decisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Regressions and simulations suggest that players put too little weight on capacity vintages when making investment decisions. Different from the original cobweb design, adaptive price expectations do not suffice to eliminate fluctuations.

The alternative vision in which history does not matter is of a stationary, ergodic process driven by rational agents facing risk and producing stable trend growth and shorter term cycles caused by random disturbances. We use Carlaw and Lipsey's simulation model of non-stationary, sustained growth driven by endogenous, path-dependent technological change under uncertainty to generate artificial macro data. We match these data to the New Classical stylized growth facts. The raw simulation data pass standard tests for trend and difference stationarity, exhibiting unit roots and cointegrating processes of order one. Thus, contrary to current belief, these tests do not establish that the real data are generated by a stationary process. Real data are then used to estimate time-varying NAIRU's for six OECD countries. The estimates are shown to be highly sensitive to the time period over which they are made. They also fail to show any relation between the unemployment gap, actual unemployment minus estimated NAIRU and the acceleration of inflation. Thus there is no tendency for inflation to behave as required by the New Keynesian and earlier New Classical theory. We conclude by rejecting the existence of a well-defined a short-run, negatively sloped Philips curve, a NAIRU, a unique general equilibrium, short and long-run, a vertical long-run Phillips curve, and the long-run neutrality of money.","[Carlaw, Kenneth I.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Lipsey, Richard G.] Simon Fraser Univ, Vancouver, BC V0N 1G0, Canada",University of British Columbia; Simon Fraser University,"Carlaw, KI (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, 3333 Univ Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",kenneth.carlaw@ubc.ca; rlipsey@sfu.ca,,,,,,,32,9,9,2,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We report an experiment in which two groups compete in a weakest-link contest by expending costly efforts. Allowing intra-group communication leads to more aggressive competition and greater coordination than control treatments without any communication. On the other hand, allowing inter-group communication leads to less destructive competition. As a result, intra-group communication decreases while inter-group communication increases payoffs. Our experiment thus provides an example of an environment where communication can either enhance or damage efficiency. This contrasts sharply with experimental findings from public goods and other coordination games, where communication always enhances efficiency and often leads to socially optimal outcomes.

In the past, states fought different amounts of external conflicts, of various lengths and magnitudes. To raise the revenues to wage wars, states made fiscal innovations, which persisted and helped to shape current fiscal institutions. Economic historians claim that greater fiscal capacity was the key long-run institutional change brought about by historical conflicts. Using casualties sustained in pre-modern wars to instrument for current fiscal institutions, we estimate substantial impacts of fiscal capacity on GDP per worker.

I investigate the extent to which secondary and higher education supply constraints affected aggregate educational attainment in Colombia for cohorts born between 1945 and 1981. As was the case in many other countries after World War II, in Colombia, industrialization, urbanization and rapid population growth increased the demand for education and the return to schooling. Although educational expenditures from the central government and the states increased after the 1950s, secondary and tertiary schools per-pupil inputs declined. Using variation in cohort size within states and over time to proxy for changes in education demand, I find that for cohorts born after 1945, a 10% increase in cohort size reduced high school completion rate by 3%, the college completion rate by 4% and average years of schooling by 1%. Compared to women's educational attainment rates, changes in cohort size had greater negative effects on men's rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we consider the behavior of second movers in a trust game, assessing whether their decision to reciprocate is influenced by the observed reciprocity of others. In documenting the impact of an external shock to observed reciprocity, this paper shows that small increases in non-reciprocal behavior result in an unraveling of the norm of reciprocity. Survey data is used to explore mechanisms by which this occurred. Results are not consistent with learning effects, suggesting that preferences may be changed by observing others deviating from a norm of reciprocity.

Tax competition between countries for mobile capital has frequently been mentioned as an explanation for this development. A vast empirical literature dealing with tax competition for mobile capital has emerged. This paper categorizes and summarizes the existing empirical studies on this issue. Particular focus is placed on the isolation of the substantive implications the quantitative study outcomes convey. Given the empirical evidence surveyed, it appears that tax rates indeed decline due to tax competition between countries, and in particular due to competition for profits.

In a private value setting, we introduce a family of mechanisms, so-called Mechanism (alpha), that generalizes the standard first-price sealed-bid auction. In Mechanism (alpha), buyers are asked to submit a value which will then be multiplied by alpha to calculate the bids in the auction. When alpha = 1, Mechanism (alpha) is the standard first-price sealed-bid auction. We show that for any alpha, calculated bids should be identical across mechanisms. We conduct a laboratory experiment to test the behavioral equivalence of this class of mechanisms under different values of alpha. Even though the procedure and environment do not change across auctions, we do not observe the same bidding behavior across these strategically-equivalent mechanisms. Our research can inform mechanism design literature with respect to the design of optimal mechanisms.","[Masatlioglu, Yusufcan; Taylor, Sarah; Uler, Neslihan] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Uler, N (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",yusufcan@umich.edu; setay@umich.edu; neslihan@umich.edu,"Masatlioglu, Yusufcan/AAB-2440-2020; Uler, Neslihan/A-6150-2017","Masatlioglu, Yusufcan/0000-0002-9423-3272; Uler, Neslihan/0000-0002-7494-2143",,,,,35,3,3,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

In a previously published paper [Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 31 (2007), 1633-1671], we showed that by means of certain mathematical methods and results known as inverse limits theory it is possible to establish a correspondence between the backward dynamics of a noninvertible map and the forward dynamics of a related invertible map acting on an appropriately defined space of sequences, each of whose elements corresponds to an intertemporal equilibrium. We also proved the existence of different types of topological attractors for one-dimensional models of overlapping generations. In this paper, we provide an extension of those results, constructing a Lebesgue-like probability measure on spaces of infinite sequences that allows us to distinguish typical from exceptional dynamical behaviors in a measure-theoretical sense, thus proving that all the topological attractors considered in MR07 are also metric attractors. We incidentally also prove that the existence of chaos (in the Devaney-Touhey sense) backward in time implies (and is implied by) chaos forward in time.","[Medio, Alfredo] Univ Udine, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Raines, Brian] Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA",University of Udine; Baylor University,"Medio, A (通讯作者)，54 Route Pauvetta, F-06140 Tourrettes Sur Loup, France.",alfredomedio@gmail.com,"Raines, Brian E/F-9736-2011","Raines, Brian/0000-0002-6657-3181",,,,,33,1,1,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Universities are increasingly being asked to play incisive roles in the process of regional economic development. This paper assesses the extent to which university-industry collaboration, expressed in terms of private funding for university consulting research activities, is affected by the geographic proximity of an academic institution to an Industrial District (ID). Although the economic literature insists on the positive effects of proximity for these collaborations, empirical work on Italian ID so far shows no particular effects. This paper provides new insights into the effects of academic proximity to ID on university-industry collaboration, by presenting robust evidence that proximity to districts promotes the establishment of collaboration agreements. This sheds new light on the need for targeted policies to support local productive systems. The empirical evidence is based on an analysis of qualitative information and an econometric analysis of financial data for the whole population of Italian university departments engaged in research in the Engineering and Physical Sciences.

The population is partitioned into two groups of identical agents. Each player shares a common two-action strategy set and interacts pairwise with everyone else. Both symmetric profiles are Pareto-efficient strict equilibria, but the groups rank them differently. The profile where successful coordination occurs only within-group, with each group adopting their most preferred equilibrium action, is also an equilibrium provided the smaller group's preferences are sufficiently strong. In all dynamically stable long-run outcomes, players in the same group adopt the same action. Three properties, that do not matter for equilibrium selection in standard homogeneous agent models, do matter in the Language Game. These are: group size, strength of group preferences, and rates of group adaptiveness (group dynamism). A relative increase in group size and group dynamism is always weakly beneficial.

In this article, we study whether inefficiency is the price to be paid to improve equity, by assessing the distributive impact of housing taxation on households' well-being. We concentrate on the Personal Income Tax (PIT) on the main residence, and compare current provisions of the Tax Code with alternative approaches which consider the imputed rent (IR) from owner-occupied dwellings, and would make the tax system neutral with respect to the allocation of wealth among different assets. Holding revenues constant at the current level, we assess the distributional consequences of the IR approach in terms of several alternative scenarios. Our results suggest that the current tax system is as inefficient as it is inequitable. In particular, by including IR from owner-occupied dwellings as a component of the PIT gross income, we find that overall, inequality is reduced, while contemporaneously increasing efficiency in the allocation of wealth. Moreover, considering changes in tax liabilities for individual taxpayers, we show that taxing IRs will favour the young and penalize the elderly.

As a more equal endowment distribution attenuates the scope of merchants' price discrimination, we argue that inequity-averse preferences may lead to a higher utility of consumption and so survive evolutionary pressures. This effect arises from an opportunity to create and extract information rents.

Since school choice programs weaken the link between residential location and schooling options, they have the potential to affect both property values and residential location choices. Results derived from computable general equilibrium models suggest these effects could be large, but there is limited empirical evidence concerning whether they actually occur. This paper develops and tests predictions concerning the impact of inter-district choice programs on housing values and residential location decisions. Our empirical results strongly confirm our theoretical predictions and the findings of the computable general equilibrium literature: after their states adopt inter-district choice programs, districts with desirable nearby, out-of-district schooling options experience relatively large increases in housing values, residential income, and population density.

Depending on the reference level, some results indicate that it is possible for a capital income tax increase not to stimulate risk taking even if the tax code provides attractive full loss offset provisions. However, risk taking can be stimulated when investors compare their reference level with others. Risk taking can increase also if the investor interprets part of the tax as a loss instead as a reduced gain. Then the investor becomes risk seeking and moves away from the discomfort zone of relative losses.

Such nonlinear movement in the saving rate cannot be explained by the monotonic trend of population aging alone. First, vie statistically confirm the existence of such nonlinearity in aggregate data. Second, extending the life-cycle and the permanent income hypothesis (LCPIH), we exhibit that a significant decline in household income growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s plays a major role in creating the sharp saving rate decline in the same period. Third, using income and consumption data from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey, it is shown that different saving rate variations of different age groups, responding to heterogeneous income shocks, have contributed to generating the recent aggregate saving rate fluctuations. n particular, the income slow down in early 2000s of older working households provide a major contribution to aggregate saving rate decline.

A near-rational bubble component in the model equity price generates excess volatility in response to observed technology shocks. In simulations, intermittent equity price run-ups coincide with positive innovations in technology, investment and consumption booms, and faster trend growth, reminiscent of the U.S. economy during the late 1920s and late 1990s. The welfare cost of speculative bubbles depends crucially on parameter values. Bubbles can improve welfare if risk aversion is low and agents underinvest relative to the socially optimal level. But for higher levels of risk aversion, the welfare cost of bubbles is large, typically exceeding 1% of annual consumption. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we challenge this view and show that the communication structure crucially determines whether communication mitigates or intensifies rent-seeking for pure public goods. We observe the effect of different communication structures in the context of a finitely repeated intergroup contest and demonstrate that conflict expenditures are significantly higher if communication is restricted to one's own group as compared to a situation with no communication. However, expenditures are significantly lower if open communication within one's own group and between rivaling groups is allowed. We show that under open communication intergroup conflicts are avoided by groups taking turns in winning the contest.

The model restates the core of Minsky's financial instability hypothesis, focusing on the role of expectations. The hypotheses concerning the process of formation and revision of expectations are discussed in light of Keynes's epistemological view of the behavior of boundedly rational agents under conditions of strong uncertainty. These hypotheses are formalized by drawing on recent advances in complex dynamics, decision theory and behavioral economics. We show that widespread use of extrapolative expectations by economic agents produces a high degree of financial instability that may lead to a serious financial crisis, and that the use by economic agents of a mix of extrapolative and regressive expectations reduces the dynamical instability of the model but may give rise to complex dynamics.

We provide evidence on the microfoundation of this relation by use of an experimental design that enables us to disentangle preferences for cooperation from beliefs about others' cooperation. Our analysis suggests that the standard trust question used in the World Values Survey is a proxy for cooperation preferences rather than beliefs about others' cooperation. In contrast, the fairness question, a recently proposed alternative to the standard trust question, seems to operate through beliefs rather than preferences. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Estimating the returns to being a local official in rural China,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Village political economy; Public sector labor markets; Returns to political status; Rural China,INCOME INEQUALITY; MARKETS; STATE; POLITICS; EVOLUTION; GROWTH,"Zhang, Jian, Giles, John, and Rozelle, Scott - Does it pay to be a cadre? Estimating the returns to being a local official in rural China Recruiting and retaining leaders and public servants at the grass-roots level in developing countries creates a potential tension between providing sufficient returns to attract talent and limiting the scope for excessive rent-seeking behavior. In China, researchers have frequently argued that village cadres, who are the lowest level of administrators in rural areas, exploit personal political status for economic gain. Much existing research, however, compares the earnings of cadre and non-cadre households in rural China without controlling for unobserved dimensions of ability that are also correlated with success as entrepreneurs or in non-agricultural activities. The findings of this paper suggest a measurable return to cadre status, but the magnitudes are not large and provide only a modest incentive to participate in village-level public administration. The paper does not find evidence that households of village cadres earn significant rents from having a family member who is a cadre. Given the increasing return to non-agricultural employment since China's economic reforms began, it is not surprising that the return to working as a village cadre has also increased over time. Returns to cadre-status (such as they are) are derived both from direct compensation and subsidies for cadres and indirectly through returns earned in off-farm employment from businesses and economic activities managed by villages.

For economies with significant informal sectors, business cycle fluctuations and labor market policy interventions can have important effects not only on the unemployment rate, but also on the allocation of workers across regulated and unregulated jobs. In this paper, using worker flows data from Brazil, we build, calibrate, and simulate a two-sector search and matching labor market model, in which firms have the choice of hiring workers formally or informally. We show that our model can explain well the main cyclical patterns that lead to those cyclical reallocations. We also show how the effect of government interventions in the labor market depend on the magnitude of the reallocation of labor across regulated and unregulated sectors.

The model, which is based on the assumption that each country produces a level of output which is determined in a non-cooperative game of Cournot-type and that considers at the same time a coopetitive strategy regarding the low technologies, will suggest a solution that shows the convenience for each country to participate actively to a program of low carbon technologies within a coopetitive framework to address a policy of climate change, thus aiming at balancing the environmental imbalances.

We use monthly data from the residential sector of Xcel Energy's service territory in Colorado for the period January 1994 to September 2006. Based on a very general Autoregressive Distributed Lag model this paper uses a new approach to simulate the dynamic behavior of natural gas demand and obtain dynamic elasticities. Knowing consumers' response on a unit time basis enables one to answer a number of questions, such as, the length of time needed to reach demand stability. Responses to price and income were found to be much lower-even in the long run-than has been commonly suggested in the literature. Interestingly, we find that the long run equilibrium is reached relatively quickly, around 18 months after a change in price or income has occurred, while the literature implies a much longer period for complete adjustments to take place.

In all other cases, it is profitable to deter. In the comparative statics analysis, we find a non-monotonic relationship between the optimal level of deterrence and the degree of IPR protection in the economy.

This paper introduces the concept of such information projection and provides a simple but widely applicable model. The key application describes a novel agency conflict in a frictionless learning environment. When monitoring with ex post information, biased evaluators exaggerate how much experts could have known ex ante and underestimate experts on average. Experts, to defend their reputations, are too eager to base predictions on ex ante information that substitutes for the information jurors independently learn ex post and too reluctant to base predictions on ex ante information that complements the information jurors independently learn ex post. Instruments that mitigate Bayesian agency conflicts are either ineffective or directly backfire.

Though, if anything systematically happened after the introduction of the euro, wage restraint increased. This paper argues that an interdependency of wage setting under German dominance has emerged in Europe, which fuelled the transmission of mutual wage restraint. We will investigate wage and nominal unit labour cost spillovers in the European Monetary Union (EMU) exploring a panel of 13 manufacturing sectors from 1992 to 2005 and quantify the effects of different countries. Strong interdependencies across EMU member countries with regard to nominal wage growth are found. A leading role accrues to Germany, which is responsible for a cumulative reduction of trans-European wage growth rates of 0.62% by conservative estimates. Remarkably, the influence of Germany is strongest on Southern Europe with regard to wage growth interdependencies. However, the situation is inverted with regard to the development of nominal unit labour costs where the German influence on Southern Europe is substantially weaker than on neighbouring economies.","Oesterreich Nationalbank, Foreign Res Dept, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"Ramskogler, P (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Nationalbank, Foreign Res Dept, Otto Wagner Pl 3, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",paul.ramskogler@oenb.at,,,,,,,30,6,6,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We discuss the apparent impact of Voigt's now forgotten early argument for an ordinal approach to utility on later economists. Edgeworth cited Voigt's ordinal-cardinal distinction several times in the Economic Journal, bringing both the concept and the terminology into Anglophone economics. In 1927, Rosenstein-Rodan, too, cited Voigt's argument for ordinal utility. Since Hicks apparently learned the cardinal-ordinal terminology from Edgeworth, and discussed utility theory and complementarity with Rosenstein-Rodan, it appears that Voigt's 1893 article is the original source of ordinal utility in economics.

In addition, we analyse briefly the impact of other power market-related factors on the PTR of carbon costs to electricity prices. These include in particular the impact of ET-induced changes in the merit order of power generation technologies and the impact of pursuing other market strategies besides maximising generator profit, such as maximising market shares or sales revenues of power companies.

Recent published studies claim that gender imbalance increases competition among men in the marriage market, which has pushed Chinese, especially parents with a son, to buy houses as a signal of relative status in the marriage market; this marriage competition then causes high demand for houses and eventually leads to rising house prices in China. Empirical results in this paper, however, provide little support for this hypothesis and we find that a rise in the sex ratios for most age cohorts accounts for very small percentage variations in house price movements in China during 19982009. Further investigation suggests that excess demand driven by high monetary growth was a significant cause of the rising house prices in China during 19982009. Therefore, the impact of gender imbalance on house prices should not be exaggerated and monetary dynamics remains an important leading indicator for house price movements in China.","[Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [An, Guojun] China Acad Social Sci, Inst Finance & Banking, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Zhang, CS (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",Zhangcs@ruc.edu.cn; guojun.an@163.com; Xinyu@ruc.edu.cn,,,,,,,17,19,22,6,69,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2012,20.0,4,,,,,19,36,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01293.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,981VY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307001700002,0

This essay reviews the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of this work and documents the success of Goldin and Katz's framework in accounting for numerous broad labor market trends. The essay also considers areas where the framework falls short in explaining several key labor market puzzles of recent decades and argues that these shortcomings can potentially be overcome by relaxing the implicit equivalence drawn between workers' skills and their job tasks in the conceptual framework on which Goldin and Katz build. The essay argues that allowing for a richer set of interactions between skills and technologies in accomplishing job tasks both augments and refines the predictions of Goldin and Katz's approach and suggests an even more important role for human capital in economic growth than indicated by their analysis.,"[Acemoglu, Daron; Autor, David] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023; Vyacheslav, Gromyko/I-5054-2012",,,,,,38,153,190,12,134,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

A widespread view based on the tax-smoothing idea is that a prior consolidation of public finances is required to cope with the predicted trend deterioration in the primary budget balance. However, the smoothing argument cannot unconditionally be applied to the demographic problem. It is important to distinguish between increases in the dependency ratio driven by changes in fertility and longevity. For the former the smoothing argument may be appropriate, but not for the latter. In the case of longevity, a trade-off between consolidation and increasing retirement ages becomes relevant, and there are strong arguments why the latter should be pursued by e.g. linking statutory retirement ages to longevity. Both positive aspects in assessing the order of magnitude of sustainability problems and normative aspects of formulating policy strategies are addressed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It consists of sentiment investors, a single fundamental investor and a market maker. Sentiment investors live in a small world network and have limited liquidity. They trade based on their assessment of the future direction of the market. Consistent with the social learning literature, there are two types of sentiment investors; social learners and experts. Experts only consider private information while social learners also consider the views of neighbours. It is found that the interaction between the agents generate kurtosis and persistence characteristics of volatility in returns. In addition, the level of kurtosis and volatility depends on the inter-connectedness of the network as well as the number of experts and the number of connections from these experts to social learners. Cluster coefficient and characteristic path length analysis show that kurtosis and volatility are lowest within the small world region of the network.

We initially find that former British colonies trade more, on average, than do their French counterparts. This difference might be the result of the relative superiority of British institutions. However, a core concern is the non-random selection of colonies by the British. Historians argue that with Britain, trade preceded colonisation. Using an instrument based on colonisation history to control for this endogeneity, we find no evidence of a systematic difference between the British and French colonial legacies with respect to trade.

Our discussion of business opportunities for CR/SDR includes analysis of applicable spectrum access policies and identification of those of them, which would be most fertile for the development of future CR/SDR business.","[Fomin, Vladislav V.] Turiba Sch Business Adm, Riga, Latvia; [Medeisis, Arturas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-03227 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Vitkute-Adzgauskiene, Daiva] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44404 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Fomin, VV (通讯作者)，Turiba Sch Business Adm, Graudu 68, Riga, Latvia.",vvfomin@gmail.com; arturas.medeisis@vgtu.lt; d.vitkute-adzgauskiene@if.vdu.lt,"Fomin, Vladislav/CAI-5517-2022; Fomin, Vladislav/CAH-6568-2022","Fomin, Vladislav/0000-0001-8423-2500; Fomin, Vladislav/0000-0001-8423-2500; Vitkute-Adzgauskiene, Daiva/0000-0001-7923-1087; Medeisis, Arturas/0000-0003-1326-9407",,,,,39,3,3,0,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Our model features both age-dependent mortality and labour productivity. We model imperfect annuities by introducing a load factor on the annuity rate faced by finitely lived agents. Our main finding is that annuity market imperfections decrease economic growth because less assets are necessary for consumption late in life. In addition we find that both the quantitative and qualitative effects of annuity market imperfections are grossly overestimated in a partial equilibrium analysis because it disregards general equilibrium repercussions.

This paper examines the impact of spillovers from such activities by FIEs on two types of innovations by Chinese domestic firms: Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and invention patent application, using comprehensive industry and province-level data. We evaluate such spillovers according to FIEs' ownership structure, the origin of foreign funds and whether they are from the same industry or from other industries. We find an interesting asymmetry between spillovers to TFP and invention patent applications; while we do not find significant intra-industry spillovers from FIEs but find robust inter-industries spillover related to TFP, we find substantial intra-industry spillovers promoting invention patent applications but no evidence of inter-industries spillovers. Furthermore, whereas spillovers from FIEs to Chinese firms' TFP stem from their production activities, the source of spillovers related to invention patent applications is mostly through their R&D activity. Our findings indicate a need for multidimensional evaluation of the role of FDI in developing countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Conventional wisdom based on studies in the 1980s and 1990s has long held that the analysis of micro data leads one to conclude that aggregate labor supply elasticities are quite small. In this paper we argue that this conventional wisdom does not hold up to empirically reasonable and relevant extensions of simple life cycle models that served as the basis for these conclusions. In particular, we show that several pieces of conventional wisdom fail in the presence of human capital accumulation or labor supply decisions that allow for adjustment along both the extensive and intensive margin. We conclude that previous estimates of small labor supply elasticities based on micro data are fully consistent with large aggregate labor supply elasticities.","[Keane, Michael] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Rogerson, Richard] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; Princeton University,"Keane, M (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,"Keane, Michael/R-6329-2019; Keane, Michael/O-2840-2013","Keane, Michael/0000-0002-3918-1377","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0752853, 1261752] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,28,129,152,1,24,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,,,J ECON LIT,J.

Most job and worker flows imply that the answer is no, with one exception: occupational mobility, which increased substantially in the United States. This paper remedies the lack of comparable evidence by focusing on France for the years 1982 to 2009. After correcting for various statistical biases and discrepancies that affect the measurement of occupational mobility, it documents this reallocation process overall and in different subgroups. The data reveal that, over the period considered, the fraction of workers switching occupation exhibits no trend in the aggregate because changing demographics mask increases in mobility within several age and education groups. After taking these composition effects into account, occupational mobility increased sharply in France as well. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This article introduces methods to estimate equilibrium adjustment paths semiparametrically, and then sort how each of these components influences the dynamics of exchange rates. This is done in a dynamic panel setting by introducing novel local projections methods for cointegrated systems. Productivity shocks affect dynamics, and after adjusting for these factors, adjustment toward equilibrium is relatively rapid.","[Jorda, Oscar] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; Winona State Univ, Winona, MN USA; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Winona State University; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Virginia; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Jordà, O (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, MS 1130,101 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",oscar.jorda@sf.frb.org,,,,,,,49,37,46,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

It was not a political authority with the power to tax and regulate its members. The arrangements between the members of the Hanseatic League therefore had to be self-enforcing.

Mandating behavioral conformity, by centrally imposing a common, group-wide action, internalizes these coordination externalities, but also comes at a cost of restraining individuals' self-regarding goals. We explore a framework of social interaction among privately informed individuals with conformist preferences to examine when mandating behavioral conformity improves group welfare. Our analysis elucidates how the desirability of mandating behavioral conformity is shaped by the group's socio-economic structure. We find that mandating behavioral conformity is not desirable in social groups that are ex ante homogeneous-either with respect to members' contribution to group welfare or their innate conformist tendency. In contrast, mandating behavioral conformity can be beneficial in those ex ante heterogeneous social groups where the individuals who contribute most to group welfare also exhibit the strongest preference for conformity.

The key feature of the model, and the only source of heterogeneity, is that individuals differ in their ability to accumulate human capital. Therefore, wage inequality results only from differences in human capital accumulation. We examine the response of this model to skill-biased technical change (SBTC) theoretically. We show that in response to SBTC, the model generates behavior consistent with some prominent trends observed in the US data including (i) a rise in overall wage inequality both in the short run and long run, (ii) an initial fall in the education premium followed by a strong recovery, leading to a higher premium in the long run, (iii) the fact that most of this fall and rise takes place among younger workers, (iv) a rise in within-group inequality, (v) stagnation in median wage growth (and a slowdown in aggregate labor productivity), and (vi) a rise in consumption inequality that is much smaller than the rise in wage inequality. These results suggest that the heterogeneity in the ability to accumulate human capital is an important feature for understanding the effects of SBTC and interpreting the transformation of the US labor markets since the 1970s.","[Guvenen, Fatih] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kuruscu, Burhanettin] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Toronto,"Guvenen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",guvenen@umn.edu; kuruscu@gmail.com,"Guvenen, Fatih/GSN-2353-2022",,,,,,34,11,13,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Furthermore the findings also suggest that overall quality measure is a good indicator to effectively understand consumer reactions such as the satisfaction and behavioral intentions, the repurchase intention, and word of mouth.

Moreover, the equilibrium upstream R&D network may have the same architecture as the downstream R&D network or may differ from it.

Given that technical change in transport technology is biased in favor of long distances, this constitutes a challenge for existing theoretical models. In line with recent empirical evidence, this paper introduces a spillover effect from the number of exporters to the fixed costs of exporting into a trade model with heterogeneous firms. Since less firms export to remote markets, the equilibrium fixed costs are increasing in distance. This creates an additional effect of distance on aggregate trade flows: while the intensive margin of trade is unaffected, the extensive margin is magnified. This magnification leads to higher predicted distance effects. In addition, it offers a new perspective on non-decreasing distance effects: a relatively moderate strengthening of the spillover over time is sufficient to generate a constant distance elasticity.

The onset of such events depends on the coincidence of extreme environmental conditions and on the resource state (determining its resilience). When the former is uncertain and the latter evolves stochastically, the uncertainty regarding the event occurrence is the result of the combined effect of these two uncertain components. We study optimal management in this setting. The environmental threat renders the single-period discount factor policy-dependent and, as a result, the compound discount factor becomes history-dependent. Existence of an optimal Markovian-deterministic stationary policy is established and the optimal state process is shown to converge to a steady state distribution. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM.

The empirical analysis focuses on three main types of policy instruments, namely regulatory energy standards in buildings codes, energy taxes as captured by energy prices and specific governmental energy R&D expenditures. Technological innovation is measured using patent counts for specific technologies related to energy efficiency in buildings (e.g. insulation, high-efficiency boilers, energy-saving lightings). The estimates for seven European countries over the 1989-2004 period imply that a strengthening of 10% of the minimum insulation standards for walls would increase the likelihood to file additional patents by about 3%. In contrast, energy prices have no significant effect on the likelihood to patent. Governmental energy R&D support has a small positive significant effect on patenting activities.

Recent studies have heavily criticized the ability of the New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) to fit aggregate inflation (see, e.g., Rudd and Whelan, 2006). We challenge this evidence, showing that forward-looking behavior as implied by the New Keynesian model of price-setting is widely supported at the sectoral level. In fact, current and expected future values of the income share of intermediate goods emerge as an effective driver of inflation dynamics. Unlike alternative proxies for the forcing variable, the cost of intermediate goods presents dynamic properties in line with the predictions of the New Keynesian theory. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using a new panel dataset spanning 71 of the Russian regions over the years 1994-2006, I show that regions with new-elite governors whose rise to power was influenced by Putin ended up with significantly fewer small and medium enterprises (SMEs) than otherwise similar regions governed by old elites. One interpretation of this result is that Putin, in alliance with the oligarchs, sought to extend his power to the distant resource-abundant regions by promoting relatively inexperienced new elites to govern those regions. As the oligarchs of big business were allowed to monopolize the resources of the new-elite regions, entrepreneurial activity remained at depressed levels. The newcomers' lack of leadership experience may have also contributed to this result. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (2) (2012) 240-255. Wellesley College, 106 Central St., Wellesley, MA, USA.

However, the standard economic analysis has tended to take the region, and the government, as a given; that is, this work has neglected important distinctions and interactions between the geographic scope of different pollutants, the enforcement authority of various levels of government, and the fiscal responsibilities of the various levels of government. It typically ignores the possibility that the externality may be created and addressed by local governments, and it does not consider the implications of decentralization for the design of economic instruments targeted at environmental problems. This paper examines the implications of decentralization for the design of corrective policies; that is, how does one design economic instruments in a decentralized fiscal system in which externalities exist at the local level and in which subnational governments have the power to provide local public services and to choose tax instruments that can both finance these expenditures and correct the market failures of externalities?","[Alm, James] Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Banzhaf, H.

Long-term debt provides a hedge against future fluctuations in spreads, whereas short-term debt is more effective at providing incentives to repay.

International differences in labor market regulations affect how firms can adjust to idiosyncratic shocks. These institutional differences interact with sector specific differences in volatility (the variance of the firm-specific shocks in a sector) to generate a new source of comparative advantage. Other things equal, countries with more flexible labor markets specialize in sectors with higher volatility. Empirical evidence for a large sample of countries strongly supports this theory: the exports of countries with more flexible labor markets are biased towards high-volatility sectors. We show how differences in labor market institutions can be parsimoniously integrated into the workhorse model of Ricardian comparative advantage of Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977, American Economic Review, 67, 823839).

On its face, this seems inefficient-at least from the point of view of the groups. We explore this intuition in a model of nested lobbying in which interest groups first compete to influence a legislative agenda setter, then compete to influence legislative votes over the resulting agenda. If the resulting legislation grants discretion to the executive, the final prize is allocated in yet one more contest in the bureaucracy. We find that when the status quo is non-discretionary, competition over the agenda never results in an agenda that includes discretion. Surprisingly, however, a discretionary status quo can stand with probability 1 if the preferences of the bureaucracy, the legislature, and the agenda setter are arranged in an iron triangle. Specifically, the bureaucracy and agenda setter must be biased in favor of one group, while the legislature is biased in favor of the other.","[Meirowitz, Adam] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Jordan, Stuart V.] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY USA",Princeton University; University of Rochester,"Meirowitz, A (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",ameirowi@princeton.edu,,,,,,,15,5,5,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We focus on exclusive contracting in platform markets, which feature indirect network effects and thus are susceptible to an applications barrier to entry. Exclusive contracts in vertical relationships between the platform provider and software supplier can heighten entry barriers. We test these theories in the home video game market. We find that indirect network effects from software on hardware demand are present, and that exclusivity takes market share from rivals, but only when most games are nonexclusive. The marginal exclusive game contributes virtually nothing to console demand. Thus, allowing exclusive vertical contracts in platform markets need not lead to domination by one system protected by a hedge of complementary software. Our investigation suggests that bargaining power enjoyed by the best software providers and the skewed distribution of game revenue prevents the foreclosure of rivals through exclusive contracting.

These different patterns of investment behavior have been viewed as indicating convex adjustment costs at the aggregate level but non-convex adjustment costs at the firm level. This paper shows that financial frictions in the form of collateralized borrowing at the firm level (Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997) can give rise to convex adjustment costs at the aggregate level yet at the same time generate lumpiness in plant-level investment. In particular, our model can (i) derive aggregate capital adjustment cost functions identical to those assumed by Hayashi (1982) and (ii) explain the weak empirical relationship between Tobin's Q and plant-level investment.

Using panel data covering the periods 1865-1940 and 1980-2000 and 31 and 103 countries respectively, we find that the within variation in economic institutions (namely property rights and contracts) can be explained by trade liberalization. To address endogeneity concern we use export partner growth and rainfall as instruments for trade liberalization and log GDP per capita respectively and estimate our model using Limited Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML) Fuller estimation method. Our basic result holds after controlling for country fixed effects, time varying common shocks, and various additional covariates.

What has not been studied systematically are the sources of inefficiency. We approach this omission by analyzing the role of positive and negative externalities of link formation. This yields general results that relate situations of positive externalities with stable networks that cannot be too dense in a well-defined sense, while situations with negative externalities tend to induce too dense networks. Those results are neither restricted to specific assumptions on the agents' preferences (e. g. homogeneity), nor to a specific notion of stability or efficiency.","[Buechel, Berno] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany; [Hellmann, Tim] Univ Bielefeld, Inst Math Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Bielefeld,"Buechel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany.",berno.buechel@wiso.uni-hamburg.de; thellmann@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,"Hellmann, Tim/M-3913-2018","Hellmann, Tim/0000-0001-6168-2533; Buechel, Berno/0000-0001-8709-7877",,,,,21,14,17,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Competitor collaborations have recently been regarded as crucial issues by antitrust authorities. Although collaboration between competitors reduces their product distinctiveness, it may increase the distinctiveness between their products and a non-collaborator's product. Also, intensified competition between collaborators lowers their prices and imposes downward pressure on non-collaborator's pricing strategy. We demonstrated that the interaction between these effects yields rich antitrust implications for competitor collaborations and a new perspective on welfare consequences of partial ownership arrangements.

Consumption and capital paths are bounded away from zero with probability one if the initial stock is above this safe level, but are arbitrarily close to zero with positive probability if it is below. We derive verifiable sufficient conditions on technology and preferences under which the optimal policy generates such a critical stock. High risk aversion near zero, decreasing risk aversion and large spread of the technology shock are important factors behind this phenomenon.","[Mitra, Tapan] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Roy, Santanu] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Cornell University; Southern Methodist University,"Mitra, T (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tm19@cornell.edu,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1742-7355,,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

We find mixed results on the impact of energy consumption on real GDP, with greater evidence at the country level supporting energy consumption having a negative causal effect on real GDP. For the G6 panel of countries, we find significant evidence that energy consumption negatively Granger causes real GDP. This means that for countries where energy consumption has a negative long-run causal effect on real GDP, energy conversation policies should not retard economic growth. We identify these countries and regional panels. We argue that these countries/regions should play a greater role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this review, I assess whether thinking small with its associated policy regime of transfers, subsidies, and nudges, is both a practical and effective policy prescription for fighting poverty and whether the set of studies that have focused on populations that have not escaped poverty has improved our fundamental understanding of both the consequences and causes of poverty.

We suppose that there are two identical items, two small bidders, and one large bidder. The small bidders demand only one unit of the item, whereas the large bidder wants both units. Package bidding ensures that the large bidder faces no exposure problem and behaves truthfully. However, one of the small bidders stops bidding at the beginning in the equilibrium. Although small bidders generally face the free-rider problem and have incentives to underbid, once a bidder is the only small one remaining, he bids truthfully. Stopping early induces the remaining bidder to behave truthfully. Hence, each small bidder wants to be the first to stop bidding. The free-rider problem is considerably mitigated when there are many small bidders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that land reform has positive effects on both chemical fertilizer use and land productivity, but the level of influence is different between land privatization and land titling.

Its central insight is that bubbles tend to appear and expand in countries where productivity is low relative to the rest of the world. These bubbles absorb local savings, eliminating inefficient investments and liberating resources that are in part used to invest in high-productivity countries. Through this channel, bubbles act as a substitute for international capital flows, improving the international allocation of investment and reducing rate-of-return differentials across countries. This view of asset price bubbles could eventually provide a simple account of some real world phenomena that have been difficult to model before, such as the recurrence and depth of financial crises or their puzzling tendency to propagate across countries.

We argue that the Chinese Government established a sterilization cost-sharing mechanism among the People's Bank of China, commercial banks and the household sector. On the one hand, Chinese commercial banks have to assume some of the sterilization costs by purchasing low yield central bank bills and maintaining high levels of required reserves. On the other hand, Chinese households assume some of the sterilization costs by bearing negative real deposit interest rates. The cost-sharing mechanism under financial repression prevents a huge quasi-fiscal loss by the People's Bank of China as well as high inflation. However, Chinese households have become victims of this financial repression. Faced with the pressure of changing the growth model from investment-driven to domestic consumption-driven, the interest rate will have to be liberalized eventually, which will, in turn, make sterilized intervention unsustainable.","Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Zhang, M (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangming@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,23,14,15,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2012,20.0,2,,,,,41,58,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01279.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,919TT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302352700003,0

Our focus is on the interaction between the scarcity of resources and the incentives for war in the presence of limited commitment. We show that a key parameter determining the incentives for war is the elasticity of demand. Our first result identifies a novel externality that can precipitate war: price-taking firms fail to internalize the impact of their extraction on military action. In the case of inelastic resource demand, war incentives increase over time and war may become inevitable. Our second result shows that in some situations, regulation of prices and quantities by the resource-rich country can prevent war, and when this is the case, there will also be slower resource extraction than the Hotelling benchmark (with inelastic demand). Our third result is that because of limited commitment and its implications for armament incentives, regulation of prices and quantities might actually precipitate war even in some circumstances where wars would not have arisen under competitive markets.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Yale University; Columbia University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Tsyvinski, Aleh/T-3287-2019; Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023",,,,,,58,48,57,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Our results point to a highly significant, and sizable, impact of a negative reputation on the behavior of market participants and on market outcomes. Negative feedback is associated with a significant reduction in the number of bidders and a reduction in the probability of sale; negative feedback is also associated with a significant reduction in sale price.

We also establish that estimates from earlier studies failing to identify causal effects are likely to be positively biased (i.e., less negative).","[Dahlberg, Matz] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Econ Studies Ifo, Uppsala, Sweden; [Dahlberg, Matz] Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",Uppsala University,"Dahlberg, M (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Ctr Econ Studies Ifo, Uppsala, Sweden.",,,"Berg, Helene/0000-0002-4015-8780",,,,,22,170,182,0,35,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,,,J POLIT ECON,J.

A Time-varying Approach,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Existing empirical models fail to explain the surge in the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by emerging countries during the last decade. This paper provides an estimate of the demand for international reserves on a panel of emerging countries using a time-varying panel smooth transition regression (TV-PSTR) model to relax the assumption of coefficient stability in the relationship. Evidence is dound that the parameters are not constant. In addition, it is observed that the coefficients remained relatively stable until 2000 and then increased gradually and strongly thereafter. The specification provided here accounts for an acceleration that linear specifications fail to explain. Finally, it is found that mercantilist motives are the major driver of this acceleration.","[Delatte, Anne-Laure; Fouquau, Julien] Rouen Business Sch, F-76130 Mont St Aignan, France",,"Delatte, AL (通讯作者)，Rouen Business Sch, 1 Rue Marechal Juin, F-76130 Mont St Aignan, France.",ald@rouenbs.fr; jfq@rouenbs.fr,,,,,,,29,20,22,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We investigate the impact of Canada's means-tested and universal public pension programs on the mortality rates of age groups eligible for pension benefits for the period 19211966. We find that only the universal program significantly reduced pension eligible age group mortality rates. The implied social value of the mortality risk reduction from this program is one-tenth of the value per statistical life associated with contemporary government policy, meaning that Canadians did not need to place a high value on the life of a senior to justify the higher cost of the universal program.

The Austrian Household Survey on Housing Wealth includes information on socioeconomic characteristics of respondents and their parents. The results demonstrate strong persistence in educational attainment in Austria. Using uni- as well as multivariate econometric techniques and a Markovian approach we show that educational persistence decreased over time. Overall, Austria ranks third in terms of intergenerational educational attainment persistence among a number of european countries and the US.

Moreover, with the aim of enhancing such a technological transfer from academia to industry, the policy design of many OECD countries allows worthy academic ideas to be granted the same intellectual property rights (IPR) as industrial innovations. In distinguishing the stages of an R&D process within a dynamic general equilibrium model, this paper explicitly considers both industrial and government R&D efforts, with heterogeneous academic knowledge spillovers among industry lines. The results show that both the industrial R&D effort and the growth rate are spurred more by a softer IPR regime granted to academic ideas than by an increase in the industrial R&D subsidy.","Univ Rome, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Spinesi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Rome, Rome, Italy.",lspinesi@uniroma3.it,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Our empirical results based on long-run elasticities show that a 1% rise in national output leads to a decline in external debt by 1.52%, on average.

However, in general, a relatively average performance in most of the selected EEC is accomplished with too many inputs so that efficiency is quite low. In other words, the selected countries could use less resource to attain the same outcomes if they were fully efficient.

Bayesian specification tests provide evidence in favour of models incorporating heterogeneity and serial correlation.

We hypothesize that the use of a designated driver lowers the cost of drinking which, in turn, increases alcohol consumption. We examine the effect on drinking intensity (which incorporates low levels of alcohol use) and binge drinking (which measures greater alcohol use), using a proxy for designated driver usage. If workplace rules forbid alcohol use for safety or other reasons, a large potential Cost of drinking is the possible Job loss (or other penalty) incurred if an employed person tests positive for alcohol. We add variables to our model related to workplace policies on alcohol use by workers to ascertain if designated drivers still influence drinking. We test these hypotheses utilizing a large dataset from the 2006 and 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) which includes several measures of alcohol use, in addition to a host of other correlates. Findings reveal that our proxy for designated driver use increases the incidence of drinking and the results hold even after controlling for workplace alcohol testing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The bias in shorter-horizon forecasts is due to an inefficient use of information, while the bias in longer-horizon forecasts seems to reflect asymmetric loss. Further evidence indicates that the shorter-horizon (longer-horizon) forecasts are significantly less accurate than (as accurate as) those of the random walk. These forecasts, however, are not directionally accurate and are thus of no value to a user. The backward-looking nature of the forecasts may be due to reliance on simple forecasting rules (heuristics) since experts have great difficulty understanding the complex market dynamics.","[Baghestani, Hamid; Marchon, Cassia] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Management, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah,"Marchon, C (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Management, POB 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",cmarchon@aus.edu,,"Baghestani, Hamid/0000-0003-4568-1682",,,,,6,7,7,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This has led to increased efforts to recruit minority and mixed-race donors. There is strong evidence that members of racial minorities are less likely to find a match than those of European descent. Because the relevant sample sizes are small, direct estimation of the distribution of immunity types for mixed-race populations have not been available. We show how to estimate the distribution of HLA types for persons of mixed race indirectly, using simple principles of probability and the combinatorics of diploid reproduction. We show that recruitment of mixed race donors is cost-effective, but not for the expected reasons. While recruitment of mixed-race donors increases the welfare of patients with the same racial background, the benefits to the targeted recipients do not exceed the costs. However, when account is taken of the likelihood that a mixed-race registrant will be the only available match for a patient classified as being of a single race, the recruitment of mixed race donors turns out to be highly cost-effective.","[Bergstrom, Ted C.; Garratt, Rod] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Sheehan-Connor, Damien] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Wesleyan University,"Bergstrom, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",tedb@econ.ucsb.edu; garratt@econ.ucsb.edu; dsheehanconn@wesleyan.edu,"Bergstrom, Ted/AAG-3109-2019",,,,,,40,5,5,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The model is based on pricing rules from a firm's profit maximization and nests both oligopoly and oligopsony models. An empirical analysis for US beef processors and retailers suggests that processors tend to exercise oligopsony market power in procuring cattle, but they are unlikely to exercise market power on retailers. When retailers and processors are considered as one integrated sector, efficiency effects from the increased concentration in the US beef packing industry are slightly larger than market power effects. When processors' market power is considered separately from retailers' market power, the difference between cost saving and market power effects becomes greater. The cost elasticity estimate, 0.99, indicates that a further merger would result in little economies of scale in the future. Therefore, although we find that efficiency effects are currently larger than market power effects, a further increase in concentration in the US beef processing industry could narrow the gap between the two effects.","[Chung, Chanjin] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74075 USA; [Tostao, Emilio] Univ Eduardo Mondlane, Dept Agr Econ, Maputo, Mozambique",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Eduardo Mondlane University,"Chung, CJ (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 322 Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74075 USA.",chanjin.chung@okstate.edu,,,,,,,38,7,9,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper offers another explanation for how multiple channels may permit collective action: parties may be able to coordinate their actions when messages' arrivals at their destinations are sufficiently correlated events. Correlation serves to fill in information gaps that arise when players are uncertain of the source of message failure, effectively strengthening messages from one player. This asymmetry in message strength in turn permits cutoff equilibria, where players take action after receiving a minimum number of confirmations.","[Coles, Peter A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Coles, PA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",pacoles@gmail.com; rshorrer@hbs.edu,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

I & II, a series of Treasury Model (TM) forecasts of the percentage growth in real total consumers' expenditure are derived for the period 1967 to 1989. The one-, two-and three-step ahead forecasts examined cover an interesting period which includes major shocks to the UK economy, business cycle effects and changes in economic policy. Whilst a battery of forecast evaluation statistics and tests do not detect any evidence of forecast bias or irrationality over the whole sample, split-sample analysis provides evidence of a switch from overprediction to underprediction around 1977. In addition, the application of 'modified' versions of Holden-Peel (1990) tests provides evidence of the longest horizon forecasts failing to capture the full movement of changes in consumption growth. Using simple regression and a selection of forecast encompassing tests, shorter horizon forecasts are found to dominate longer horizon forecasts, a feature which might be expected logically, but need not occur in practice. Finally, forecast performance is related to changes in model specification and modelling methodology.","Univ Wales Swansea, Dept Econ, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Cook, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wales Swansea, Dept Econ, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",s.cook@swan.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The corresponding evidence when the counterpart to Spain is a large European economy is weaker, particularly in the case of Europe's medium-term technology cycles. The vehicles that facilitate the international transmission of U. S. medium-term cycles are based on both bilateral trade and FDI linkages.

Firms often use promotions both to sort workers across jobs and to provide them with incentives. However, the Peter Principle states that employees' output tends to fall after a promotion. Lazear (2004) suggests that self-selection may improve job allocation efficiency while preserving incentive effects. We reproduce this Peter Principle in the laboratory and compare the efficiency of a promotion standard with subjects self-selecting their task. We find no evidence of effort distortion, as predicted by theory. Furthermore, we find that when the Peter Principle is not severe, promotion rules often dominate self-selection efficiency of task assignment.

The magnitude of the effect is not smaller if the sample is limited to the more recent sub-period of comparatively low inflation volatility.","Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Feldmann, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",h.feldmann@bath.ac.uk,,"Feldmann, Horst/0000-0002-9402-3996",,,,,61,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find cross-border spillovers in returns to be non-existent, spillovers in absolute returns between Asia and the US to be strong in both directions, and spillovers in volatility to run from Asia to the US. Trading volume, especially on the Asian markets, depends on shocks in domestic and foreign returns as well as on volatility, especially those shocks originating in the US. However, only weak evidence is found for trading volume influencing other variables. In the light of the theoretical models, these results suggest sequential information arrivals, with investors being overconfident and applying positive feedback strategy. Furthermore, new information causes price volatility to rise due to differences in its interpretation among traders, but the subsequent market reaction takes the form of adjustment in price level, not volatility. Lastly, the intensity of cross-border spillovers seems to have increased following the 1997 crisis, which we interpret as evidence of increased noisiness in prices and diversity in opinions about news originating abroad. Our findings might also help to understand the nature of financial crises, to predict their further developments and consequences.","Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Gebka, B (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Ridley Bldg,3rd Floor, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",b.t.gebka@ncl.ac.uk,"Gebka, Bartosz/I-5189-2019","Gebka, Bartosz/0000-0003-4510-0374",,,,,77,22,24,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

The data refers to 44 of the most prominent companies of fixed telephony, mobile telephony and internet services and was compiled by means of interviews with the help of a questionnaire. Our descriptive analysis concluded that liberalization of the telecommunication market reduced its concentration degree, increased competition and induced price cuts. This conclusion is supported by other research studies concerning other countries of the EU, since Greece as an EU member country has also implemented the respective European policy in the specific industry. As far as the econometric level is concerned, we used panel Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS). FGLS is an appropriate tool for samples such as our own, composed by intersectoral data that extend to more than one time periods, and without correlation between the unobserved effects and the interpretative variables. Our econometric research showed that both private ownership and specialized personnel in the commercial and technical sector seem to positively influence the companies' market share. In turn, a large market share offers companies more freedom to cut down prices in their services. However, there is still considerable need for econometric research in this field.","[Georgopoulos, Antonios; Karamanis, Kostas] Univ Patras, Business Adm, Patras 26500, Greece",University of Patras,"Georgopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Business Adm, Univ Campus, Patras 26500, Greece.",georgop@upatras.gr,,,,,,,42,0,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

If survival is related to height, the increasingly common practice of using height as a measure of well-being may be misleading. We devise a novel method for disentangling the stunting from the selection effects of famine. Using data from the 1959-1961 Great Chinese Famine, we find that taller children were more likely to survive the famine. Controlling for selection, we estimate that children under the age of five who survived the famine grew up to be 1 to 2 cm shorter. Our results suggest that if a country experiences a shock such as famine, average height is potentially a biased measure of economic conditions during childhood. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, this number is no longer always in excess of the socially optimal level.

For some workers the informal sector is an attractive employment opportunity, whereas for others - rationed out of the formal sector - the informal sector is a strategy of last resort.

Although agricultural exports are less than 10% of merchandise trade, the high and variable protection in this sector appears to account for the majority of the cost of distortions in global merchandise trade. Within agriculture, most of the costs appear to arise from trade barriers levied on imports, because these barriers tend to be high and variable across products and over time and are levied by many countries that do not use subsidies. The diverse interests of participants resulted in very complex proposals and a tendency for countries to focus on the political costs of an agreement, rather than on the potential economic benefits. The negotiations faced a need for balance between discipline in reducing tariffs and flexibility in managing political pressures. Although the approach of providing flexibilities on a certain percentage of tariff lines is seriously flawed, the proposed modalities still appear to provide worthwhile market access. There need to be better ways of dealing with developing countries' concerns about food price volatility while reducing the collective-action problems resulting from price insulation.","[Laborde, David] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Martin, Will] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); The World Bank,"Laborde, D (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",D.Laborde@cgiar.org; wmartin1@worldbank.org,"Martin, William/E-6226-2011; Laborde, David/D-6408-2015","Laborde, David/0000-0003-3644-3498; Martin, William/0000-0002-2824-1303",,,,,54,6,8,0,26,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4704-8,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Our experimental data indicate precisely the opposite results for format comparisons: the first-price auction gives rise to larger levels of efficiency and revenue, but lower payoffs to the bidders. Despite the lower payoff, the likelihood of an ex post loss is also smaller under the first-price auction.

The gravity model serves as a general framework where the use of sectoral data allows obtaining a more accurate measure of the border effects. The econometric analysis applied to a gravity model that contains a high disaggregation in the data introduces heteroskedasticity problems together with the presence of zero values, therefore, in order to obtain consistent estimates, the use of the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood estimation method is recommended. Our results show that the bilateral trade flows depend upon the size and proximity of the trade partners, together with other variables as adjacency or language. Evidence in favour of a positive and diminishing border effect has been found for the period 1995-2006 and it accounts for 20% to 22% within the EU-19.","[Martinez San Roman, Valeriano; Sanchez-Robles Rute, Blanca] Univ Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain; [Bengoa Calvo, Marta] CUNY City Coll, Colin Powell Ctr Policy Studies, New York, NY USA",Universidad de Cantabria; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"San Román, VM (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain.",valeriano.martinez@unican.es; mbengoa@ccny.cuny.edu; blanca.sanchez-robles@unican.es,"Rute, Blanca/AAF-6983-2019; Sanchez-Robles, Blanca Rute/K-4224-2017; Martinez-San Roman, Valeriano/I-1257-2015","Sanchez-Robles, Blanca Rute/0000-0001-8528-9189; Martinez-San Roman, Valeriano/0000-0002-0508-9353",,,,,29,4,4,0,12,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Many scenarios which satisfy the threshold conditions (indicating a dominant firm exists) are consistent with high HHI numbers such that current US Department of Justice and European Commission guidelines (based on HHIs) for merger concerns will have been met.

Estimations of static and dynamic industry-level labour demand equations augmented by offshoring intensities do not reveal a significant impact of either materials or business services offshoring on total employment for Belgium between 1995 and 2003.

This risk arises due to the particular reasons related to the possibility to lose loans if the debtors are not able to meet their financial obligations. When making the decisions of financing the loan applicants, banks use the credit risk assessment models that allow estimating the probability of the potential borrowers to default on their loan commitments. The main goal of managing the credit risk in banks is to compound the loan portfolio of the acceptable risk level. According to Derelioglu and Gurgen (2011) the credit risk analysis aims to decrease future losses by estimating the potential risk and eliminating the new credit proposal if the risk is higher than a defined tolerance value. In this respect, it is essential to identify the main factors causing this risk in order to manage it. When assessing the credit risk of every company, banks usually analyze the financial data and some qualitative factors as the independent variables in the statistical credit risk assessment models. But in changing the credit policy in banks and pricing the credits, it is very important to predict the quality of loan portfolio in future. The problem can be summarized as finding the statistical methods that relates the proportion of doubtful and non-performing credits in the loan portfolio (dependent variable) with the set of explanatory variables (macroeconomic information of a country). The aim of this research is to find the macroeconomic determinants that significantly influence the changes of loan portfolio credit risk in banks and to develop the statistical model for prediction of the proportion of doubtful and non-performing loans. The scientific literature analysis results confirmed the influence of macroeconomic conditions on credit risk of debtors in banks and presented that the changes in quality of loan portfolio in banks depend on GDP, inflation, interest rates, money supply, industrial production index, current account balance and other. In empirical research 22 EU countries were grouped into 3 clusters according to their similarity in changes of the doubtful and non-performing loans percentage in banks. The set of 20 independent variables as factors determining the changes in amount of doubtful and non-performing loans was created. These variables were calculated from 9 macroeconomic indicators of 3 years. The model was developed to classify the countries into clusters applying the logistic regression, factor analysis and probit methods. The classification accuracy is 100 %. The predictions of doubtful and non-performing loans indexes are based on the analysis of the scores of extracted 5 factors as new independent variables. The multiple regression and polynomial regression methods were applied for the index predictions in clusters. The developed model in this research enables to predict the percentage of doubtful and non-performing loans in banks with the average 98,06% accuracy. The research has confirmed that the amount of doubtful and non-performing loans in banks highly depends on macroeconomic changes in a country. The model can warn the banks in advance if the significant increase in the loan portfolio credit risk after 2 years is highly possible.","Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Mileris, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Nemuno St 33, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania.",ricardas.mileris@ktu.lt,,,,,,,30,25,34,2,84,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This paper exploits a natural experiment in the U. S. brewing industry to identify the direction of change in welfare caused by the use of exclusive territories. On January 31, 1991, the state of Arkansas enacted legislation which mandated all beer manufacturers to have exclusive territory clauses in their agreements with distributors. To identify the effect, I employ brand-level sales data before and after the legal change both in Arkansas as well as in nearby Oklahoma and Texas. Results are broadly consistent with a positive relationship between the use of exclusive territories and welfare: the most credible results suggest that the legal mandate increased brand-level volume sales by 45%. I conduct several falsification exercises and robustness tests to rule out other possible explanations for this large effect.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Rojas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",rojas@isenberg.umass.edu,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We make standard assumptions about preferences and technologies, but in contrast to existing studies we assume that children and other consumption goods are gross substitutes. Consistent with the conventional Malthusian model, the present theory shows that productivity growth in agriculture has no effect on equilibrium income. More importantly, we also show that equilibrium income varies, not just with the death rate as has recently been demonstrated in the literature, but also with the level of productivity in the industrial sector.

Property owners suffer more from the debt burden and, thus, have a stronger preference for tax financing of government spending than tenants.

In order to understand the use of stock options as a prevailing compensation strategy in practice, we derive the optimal contract between a firm's shareholders and its manager, the latter of whom exerts unobservable effort and is privately informed about economic earnings as well as his own expertise in managing earnings. The optimal contract is characterized analytically in different corporate governance systems. The model indicates that the inactive region below a threshold in the compensation should be more economically significant when the corporate governance is weaker. The model suggests that, while the use of options leads to earnings management incentives, it is an optimal contract in the presence of reporting latitude and uncertainty over an executives' ability to manage earnings. The model result is in accordance with the observed positive association between the level of earnings management and the use of stock options in both time series and cross section. Empirical evidence on the changes in the intensity of option grants in executive compensation in response to corporate governance legislations also lends support to the model.","[Sun, Bo] Board Governors Fed Reserve, Div Int Finance, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Sun, Bo] Peking Univ, Dept Finance, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Peking University,"Sun, B (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve, Div Int Finance, Mail Stop 44,20th St & Constitut Ave, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",bo.sun@frb.gov,,,,,,,8,1,3,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A rising top share of income can potentially lead to increases in the incomes of low and middle-income families if economic growth is sufficiently responsive to increases in inequality. A substantial literature on the impacts of inequality on economic growth exists, but has failed to achieve consensus, with various studies finding positive impacts, negative impacts, and no impacts on growth from increased levels of income inequality. This paper departs from that literature by exploring the effect of inequality on the standard of living of middle-income and low-income families. In the context of rising inequality, increased overall growth is not necessarily a suitable proxy for overall standard of living, since growth patterns are not uniform for the entire income distribution. The results of this study indicate that increases in the top share of income (particularly the top one percent) are associated with declines in the actual incomes (and earnings) of middle income families, but have no clear impact on families at the bottom of the income distribution.","[Leight, Elias] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,,jeffrey.p.thompson@frb.gov; elias.leight@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,5,6,2,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.
