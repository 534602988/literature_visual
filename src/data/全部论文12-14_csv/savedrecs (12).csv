The government taxes capital income, firms' profits and labor income. In this context, taxation might distort the firms' decisions to participate in the formal sector (extensive margin) as well as their factor allocations once they decide to produce (intensive margin). We find that the government has incentives to subsidize costs to induce firms into the formal sector, making them taxable and completing the tax system. The optimal capital income tax is negative while the corporate tax rate is positive and the sign of labor income tax is ambiguous. We show numerically that following a Ramsey policy rather than actually observed taxes have significant effects on welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

First we show that when labor is inelastic and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption is large enough, for any configuration of the returns to scale, local indeterminacy is obtained if there is a capital intensity reversal between the private and the social levels. Second, we prove that when labor is infinitely elastic, saddlepoint stability is obtained if the investment good sector has constant social returns, whereas local indeterminacy arises if the investment good sector has increasing social returns and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption admits intermediate values. Finally, our main conclusion shows that local indeterminacy requires a low elasticity of labor when the investment good has constant social returns, but requires either a low enough or a large enough elasticity of labor when the investment good has increasing social returns.","[Garnier, Jean-Philippe] Univ Lille 3, F-59653 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Nishimura, Kazuo] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Venditti, Alain] CNRS GREQAM, F-13002 Marseille, France",Universite de Lille; Kyoto University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Venditti, A (通讯作者)，CNRS GREQAM, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France.",alain.venditti@univmed.fr,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21243021, 23000001] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,21,7,7,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Simple supply and demand models of changing wage differentials by education group are used, so as to consider the drivers of relative demand shifts in favour of the more educated that underpin rising wage inequality. The changing role of labour market institutions is also discussed, and in particular the decline of unionization and the importance of the introduction of the national minimum wage in 1999 for the evolution of lower-tail wage inequality.","[Lindley, Joanne] Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England; [Machin, Stephen] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Machin, Stephen] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",University of Surrey; University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lindley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England.",j.lindley@surrey.ac.uk; s.machin@ucl.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,21,7,7,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The question arises as to why this might be so. To the extent that individual characteristics such as abilities or tastes persist over time, these may also be the reason that individuals persist in poverty over time. In that case, one expects that once individual characteristics are controlled for, duration dependence in poverty becomes spurious. The alternative possibility is that the poverty experience itself has a causal impact on future poverty. This may be because of work disincentives, lack of investment in human capital and/or loss of motivation during the period of job search. The reasons for dependence in poverty are of interest for developing effective poverty-reducing policies. The estimation of a multiple-spell hazard model of transitions in and out of poverty, that allows for unobserved heterogeneity and a significant initial condition problem, supports the suggestion of true duration dependence in poverty. In Belgium the elderly unemployed are exempted from job search and lack any training or counselling from government agencies, while workers above 50 are given strong financial incentives to leave the labour market as soon as possible through different kinds of early retirement schemes.","[Maes, Marjan] HUBrussel, Brussels, Belgium; [Maes, Marjan] HUBrussel, Dept Econ, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",,"Maes, M (通讯作者)，HUBrussel, Brussels, Belgium.",marjan.maes@hubrussel.be,,,,,,,30,10,11,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The evidence favors career concerns. First, we find complementarity between institutional ownership and product market competition, whereas the lazy manager hypothesis predicts substitution. Second, CEOs are less likely to be fired in the face of profit downturns when institutional ownership is higher.

We present evidence that beliefs are typically very stable over time, yet argue that Brazil has recently undergone a dramatic shift in beliefs which we show is associated with a change in the country's social contract in the past thirty years. The transition from one social contract to another has taken place through a process which we call 'dissipative inclusion', where redistribution and social inclusion are effectively achieved but accompanied by distortions, inefficiencies and rent dissipation.

We explore the implications of changes in these parameters for entrepreneurial activity, measured by counts of firm births. The Swiss fiscal system offers sufficient intra-national variation in tax codes to allow us to estimate such effects with considerable precision. We find that high average taxes and complicated tax codes depress firm birth rates, while tax progressivity per se promotes firm births. The latter result supports the existence of an insurance effect from progressive corporate income taxes for risk-averse entrepreneurs. However, implied elasticities with respect to the level and complexity of corporate taxes are an order of magnitude larger than elasticities with respect to the progressivity of tax schedules.","[Bacher, Hans Ulrich] Credit Suisse AG, CH-8070 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bruelhart, Marius] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bruelhart, Marius] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England",University of Lausanne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Brülhart, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",hans.u.bacher@credit-suisse.com; Marius.Brulhart@unil.ch,"Brulhart, Marius/B-8633-2008","Brulhart, Marius/0000-0001-5483-0219",,,,,47,25,30,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Optimal monetary policy features positive inflation in the long run; the optimal annual long-run inflation rate for the U.S. economy is slightly below 1 percent with a money demand motive and around 2 percent otherwise. Positive inflation facilitates real wage adjustments and hence it eases job creation and prevents excessive increase in unemployment following adverse productivity shocks.

We also found that there are strong differences between domestic and international social networks.","[Aguayo-Tellez, Ernesto] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Dept Econ, Monterrey 64930, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Martinez-Navarro, Jose] Univ N Texas, Dept Econ, Denton, TX 76203 USA",Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Aguayo-Téllez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Dept Econ, Av Lazaro Cardenas 4600 Ote, Monterrey 64930, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.",ernestoaguayo@gmail.com,,"Aguayo Tellez, Ernesto/0000-0002-1961-7663",,,,,47,11,15,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We examine how the foreign exchange market reacts to sovereign credit events prior to (2000-2006) and during the crisis (2006-2010). The sample includes a broad set of countries in Europe and Central Asia in order to investigate spillover effects. We find that rating agencies' signals do affect the own-country exchange rate and we identify strong spillover effects to other countries' exchange rates in the region. In both cases, the impact of outlook and watch signals is stronger than the impact of actual rating changes. Market reactions and spillovers are far stronger during the financial crisis period than pre-crisis. Negative news from all three major agencies has an impact, whereas only Moody's positive news produces a reaction. Negative news from Fitch tends to have the strongest effect. The findings are important in enhancing understanding of the role of rating agencies and the market response to their signals. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We test these predictions using an original and unique data set containing information on sales, donations and real estate prices in 13 large Italian cities between 1993 and 2004. This period spans a major reform that first decreased and then abolished the inter vivos real estate donations tax and bequest tax in Italy.

The so-called Fisher effect suggests that changes in the nominal interest rate reflect the revised inflation expectations; and revised inflation expectations have an impact on the level of the nominal interest rate. Consequently, the monetary authorities should employ strategies that will prevent inflation from rising if nominal interest rates are to be kept at low levels in order to not discourage the borrowing. The aim of this paper is to empirically test the Fisher effect in Croatia using VEC (vector error correction) model. The results suggest that the full Fisher effect in Croatia may de facto hold only in the long-run. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 after the introduction, reviews the literature.

In this study, we examine whether previous bidder-target alliances mitigate the negative effect of information asymmetry. Further, in cases when the target firms in an acquisition are from the high technology or service industries or privately held firms, whereby the firms are composed of unique knowledge, intangible assets and less disclosed information, respectively, we test whether there are significantly more acquisitions when prior bidder-target alliances exist, as it is assumed that these alliances reduce the level of information asymmetry. We find on average the post acquisition stock performance is better when the purchasing firm acquires a prior alliance partner. Furthermore, when acquiring privately held target firms, the target firms are more likely to be previous alliance partners. Finally, when the target firms are 'more informed' (i.e. high technology, service or privately held firms), the post acquisition performance is disappointing.

But as real-time real GDP data is typically revised, we investigate if the decline in, and total output loss (severity) of, G-7 real GDP during the Great Recession is really so different from the past. We use a GDP weighted average of, as well as a dynamic common factor extracted from, real-time G-7 real GDP data to verify if this is the case. Furthermore, we use a Mincer and Zarnowitz [Mincer, J., and V. Zarnowitz. 1969. The Evaluation of Economic Forecasts. NBER Volume: Economic Forecasts and Expectations: Analysis of Forecasting Behaviour and Performance, pp. 1-46.] forecast efficiency regression to predict the revision to G-7 real GDP growth during the Great Recession, based on outturns of unrevised variables. In real-time data, the depth and intensity of the  Great Recession are similar to the mid-1970s recession. The Mincer and Zarnowitz model predicts significant revisions to G-7 real GDP for 2008Q4 and 2009Q1 of about 0.81% and 1.08%, respectively. Together these facts imply that G-7 real GDP growth during the  Great Recession may yet be revised to be in line with past deep recessions.","[Chiu, Adrian; Wieladek, Tomasz] Bank England, External MPC Unit, London EC2 8AHR, England",Bank of England,"Wieladek, T (通讯作者)，Bank England, External MPC Unit, Threadneedle St, London EC2 8AHR, England.",tomasz.wieladek@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Researchers are assumed to care about peer effects, their relative status within universities, and salary compensation. They differ in their concern for salary compensation as well as in their ability. We derive the unique stable equilibrium allocation of researchers and investigate the effects on the academic sector of changes in the outside option as well as the interaction between the outside option and the researchers' concern for relative status. In any equilibrium, the right-hand side of the ability distribution is allocated to the academic sector, while the left-hand side of the ability distribution is allocated to the outside sector, with possible overlap between sectors and within the academic sector. The universities' qualities are determined endogenously, and we show that an increase in the value of the outside option decreases the difference in quality between the higher and lower ranked universities. Furthermore, differences in average salaries between the institutions arise endogenously.","[Craig, Andrea; Viero, Marie-Louise] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, 94 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Viero, ML (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, 94 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",craiga@econ.queensu.ca; viero@econ.queensu.ca,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This paper shows that a SBTC can cause a rise in overeducation as firms looking for educated workers become more selective and turn down the less skilled candidates. This result, while consistent with the evidence, is in contrast with the implications of recent search and matching models of the labor market. Here we present a model of a segmented labor market, with imperfect correlation between the individual ability and the observed education of workers, and a fixed cost of setting up a job. A numerical illustration for the US in the period 1970-1990 demonstrates that overeducation rises and that it can in turn be significant for the response of unemployment rates and wage inequality to a SBTC.","[Cuadras-Morato, Xavier] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona 08015, Spain; [Cuadras-Morato, Xavier] Barcelona GSE Econ & Business, Barcelona 08015, Spain; [Mateos-Planas, Xavier] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E14NS, England",Pompeu Fabra University; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Cuadras-Morató, X (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08015, Spain.",xavier.cuadras@upf.edu; x.mateos-planas@qmul.ac.uk,"Cuadras-Morato, Xavier/A-6951-2013",,,,,,28,3,3,0,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Contrary to these predictions, we observe similar prices in baseline and advance production treatments, but lower profits given advance production. An inventory option reduces both prices and earnings. Results are driven by the treatments' effects on sellers' capacities to tacitly collude.

In order to provide relevant information to managers across all levels of supervision and in any corporate activity, a controller needs to have accurate knowledge of primary and secondary cost, direct and indirect overhead expenses as well as its allocation across the various divisions. The introduced topic is the objective of this contribution.","[Foltinova, Alzbeta; Dubcova, Gabriela] Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Podnikoveho Manazmentu, Katedra Podnikovohospodarska, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,,afoltin@euba.sk; gdubcova@euba.sk,,,,,,,3,1,1,0,2,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3636-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,121,126,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA8IJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338150300018,0

Participants are given information about the gender of the co-participant they are matched with, they then choose between a tournament or a piece rate payment scheme, and finally perform a real task. As already observed in the literature, we find that significantly more men than women choose the tournament. The gender of the co-participant directly influences men's choices (men compete less against other men than against women), but only when the gender information is made sufficiently salient. A higher predicted competitiveness of women induces more competition. Giving stronger tournament incentives, or allowing the participants to choose the gender of their co-participant, increases women's willingness to compete, but does not close the gender gap in competitiveness.

The result is substantial variation across states and over time in the earnings thresholds to which workers must adhere to maintain eligibility. Utilizing this variation, I identify the effects of Medicaid earnings thresholds on labor force behavior of low-income single mothers, examining both static and dynamic patterns.

Until recently such transfers were impeded by the rule against perpetuities, which prevented transfers to most potential not-yet-born beneficiaries. Many American states have recently repealed the rule against perpetuities, raising concerns that the combination of tax incentives and new legal rights encourages the devotion of vast wealth to perpetual trusts designed to benefit distant generations, avoid taxes, and maintain a degree of control over the financial affairs of descendants in perpetuity. This paper analyzes the incentives created by federal transfer taxes, finding the tax benefits from establishing perpetual trusts to be quite modest, in representative cases ranging from 9% to 25% of just one component of the cost. Contrary to popular claims, tax benefits decline as investment returns rise. While US states that have repealed the rule against perpetuities and adopted other policies to encourage trusts host substantial trust assets, evidence from tax returns suggests that perpetual trusts are unlikely to account for a significant portion of this business. Consequently, tax incentives may not be responsible for an important shift of assets into perpetual trusts.","[Hines, James R., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60 ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",1537-2650,,978-0-226-09779-4,TAX POL EC,,,2013,27.0,,,,,,101,124,,10.1086/671245,0.0,,,24,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJH56,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328232500005,0

These activities appear to follow a certain trajectory, whereby the successful completion of initial less-intensive activities stimulates a shift in focus to more demanding, long-term projects. The presented research verifies that clusters can pass through different stages of development, and examines in detail their preferences for jointly-undertaken activities. Research, conducted on a sample of clusters of different countries and ages, was carried out through the use of questionnaires and structured interviews with cluster managers. It is a sample of so-called organized clusters, which have their own internal structure and which are characterized by conscious development. The study identified common cluster activities in the following areas: networking, human resources, research and innovations, business cooperation and promotion, support activities, lobbying, etc. The preference of their implementation was also ascertained. In addition, the analyzed sample was divided into two categories according to cluster age, allowing for a comparison and differentiation of the level of implementation of joint activities between embryonic and established clusters. The evaluation of this research demonstrated that in the selected groups of activities, there was a statistically significant difference in terms of their level of implementation in clusters of various ages.","[Jircikova, Eva; Pavelkova, Drahomira; Bialic-Davendra, Magdalena; Homolka, Lubor] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Jircíková, E (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Nam TG Masaryka 5555, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",jircikova@fame.utb.cz,"Bialic-Davendra, Magdalena Lucyna/H-6520-2012; Nguyen, Ninh/GQH-2311-2022; Jirčíková, Eva/H-6497-2012; Homolka, Lubor/P-7714-2019","Nguyen, Ninh/0000-0002-7375-8408; Homolka, Lubor/0000-0002-6628-8241; Pavelkova, Drahomira/0000-0003-1399-6129",,,,,47,13,15,0,37,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The result indicates that the MFIs are, on average, 33.5 less efficient compared with the CBs mainly due to their smaller size, focus on outreach and reliance on non-commercial sources of funds such as donations. In fact, the largest MFIs are found to have cost efficiency scores that are comparable with that of the most efficient banks.

We examine the robustness of that result to the introduction of risky lifetime, and to a broader class of individual preferences. It is shown that classical utilitarianism remains unable to provide, in that broader framework, a general redistribution towards the short-lived. Then, we propose a remedy, which consists in imputing, when solving the social planner's allocation problem, the consumption equivalent of a long life to the consumption of long-lived agents. This compensation-constrained utilitarianism is shown to reduce welfare inequalities across agents with unequal lifetimes. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Two novel aspects of the model are (i) participation in open source arises as the optimal decision of profit-maximizing firms, and (ii) open-source and proprietary firms may (or may not) coexist in equilibrium. Firms decide their type and investment in R&D, and sell packages composed of a primary good and a complementary private good. Open-source firms share their technological advances on the primary good, whereas proprietary firms keep their innovations private. The main contribution of the paper is to determine conditions under which open-source and proprietary firms coexist in equilibrium. Interestingly, this equilibrium is characterized by an asymmetric market structure, with few large proprietary firms and many small open-source firms. We also study the limiting economy and present conditions under which large numbers favor cooperation in R&D. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These measures are: the equity ratio (relating to capital adequacy), the operating cost ratio (management capability), the return on equity (shareholders' profitability), the return on assets (bank profitability) and Tobin's Q (business value). Our empirical results reveal that following the disclosure of the sub-prime crisis, management capability, profitability and business value, in both investment and commercial banks alike, all took a turn for the worse, with clear rises in their risks of management capability and profitability; there has also been significant deterioration in the capital adequacy of investment banks. However, the significant declines in both the management capability and profitability of investment banks and commercial banks in the developed markets differ quite markedly from the findings on similar representative banks in the emerging markets; that is, investment and commercial banks within the developed nations suffered more direct and pronounced impacts from the credit crisis than those within the emerging markets. As a direct result of the sub-prime crisis, there were significant declines in the capital adequacy and profitability of investment banks, as well as similar significant declines in the profitability and business value of commercial banks, regardless of the overall size of the bank These results stand in stark contrast to the findings reported by both Li (2003) and Aysan and Ceyhan (2008), that when faced with financial crisis, the scale of a bank will be found to have a positive correlation with its financial performance.","[Lu, Yang-Cheng; Chang, Shu-Lien] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Fang, Hao] Hwa Hsia Inst Technol, Dept Assets & Property Management, Taipei, Taiwan",Ming Chuan University,"Fang, H (通讯作者)，Hwa Hsia Inst Technol, Dept Assets & Property Management, Taipei, Taiwan.",ralphyclu1@gmail.com; hihaoa@gmail.com; wslchang@mail.mcu.edu.tw,"張, 書濂/GRX-6678-2022; Fang, Hao/AAW-3714-2021","Fang, Hao/0000-0003-3874-5537",,,,,17,0,0,0,10,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We improve the current empirical literature by: (i) compiling a unique quarterly dataset to provide a larger sample size and enable the modelling of important intra-year dynamics - which should lead to better model specifications; (ii) providing a new empirical approach (Unobserved Components (UC)) to test the 'Dutch disease' hypothesis; and (iii) using several cointegration approaches to further test the robustness of our conclusions. Our results suggest that there are two main long-run determinants of the RER in Ethiopia: trade openness is found to be correlated with RER depreciations, while a positive shock to the terms of trade tends to appreciate the RER. Foreign aid is not found to have a statistically significant impact, while there is only weak evidence that remittances are associated with RER appreciations. The lack of empirical support for the 'Dutch disease' hypothesis suggests that Ethiopia has been able to effectively manage large capital inflows, thus avoiding major episodes of macroeconomic instability. We believe that most African countries will therefore be able to absorb large inflows of foreign capital without damaging their external competitiveness.","Overseas Dev Inst, London SE1 7JD, England",,"Martins, PMG (通讯作者)，Overseas Dev Inst, 111 Westminster Bridge Rd, London SE1 7JD, England.",p.martins@odi.org.uk,,"Martins, Pedro/0000-0001-7305-0920",,,,,34,13,13,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

So we exchanged the traditional economy based on resources, land, capital and labour, into an economy based on intangible assets with financial accounting difficult and high impact on productive performance of organizations. These assets are recognized as assets of knowledge and now have a strategic value, therefore reliable methods are needed to validate how these assets are being managed. Empirical studies conducted in Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), led to the development of a methodology for the accreditation of intellectual capital management-ICMA (R) methodology. The ICMA (R) methodology is a process where a collegial body recognizes that a particular company has the capacity to manage their intellectual capital. Effectively, the accreditation of the intellectual capital management would be a public declaration where a particular company meets a set of accreditation criteria, preestablished by the accrediting body. The accreditation will be seen as a quality and recognition stamp and as an indicator of the company's ability regarding intellectual capital management. The Propose of this paper is to present this methodology as well as the benefits of its use by the business community. In terms of practical implication, we can say that the creation of a recognized intellectual capital management accreditation methodology could be an important tool to ensure the innovation capacity of SMEs and therefore a guarantee for sustainability for the various partners (customers, suppliers, shareholders, government and employees). The following sections of this paper are detailed description of this accreditation methodology.","[Matos, Florinda; Matos, Nuno] ICAA, Santarem, Portugal; [Matos, Florinda; Lopes, Albino] Univ Tecn Lisboa, CAPP, ISCSP, P-1100 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,"Matos, F (通讯作者)，ICAA, Santarem, Portugal.",florinda.matos@icaa.pt; alopes@iscsp.utl.pt; nuno.matos@icaa.pt,"Matos, Nuno/HHC-0744-2022","Matos, Nuno/0000-0002-6387-3592",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,279,289,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000032,0

In this context, we analyze the effects of a centralized R&D subsidy policy upon steady state and welfare using an agglomeration and growth model composed of two asymmetric countries. If the policy leads to a steady state characterized by a higher growth rate and lower inequalities, the welfare analysis provides a more contrasted vision on the effects of the policy. Indeed, even though such a policy can eliminate some distortions and improve global welfare, it implies a zero-sum game at national level (the policy increases the welfare in the periphery country and decreases the welfare in the core country) when knowledge spillovers are sufficiently localized. Consequently, a centralized R&D subsidy policy conducted in an economy composed of two asymmetric countries would be a positive-sum game only if international knowledge spillovers are sufficiently large.","[Montmartin, Benjamin] Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Montmartin, Benjamin] GATE Lyon St Etienne, CNRS, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Montmartin, Benjamin] Univ St Etienne, F-42000 St Etienne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Jean Monnet,"Montmartin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France.",benjamin.montmartin@univ-st-etienne.fr,,,,,,,32,5,5,0,14,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

With survey data we demonstrate that uninvolved individuals hold well defined yet conflicting normative views of fair contribution rules related to efficiency, equality, and equity. In the experiment, in the absence of punishment no positive contribution norm is observed and all groups converge towards free-riding. With punishment, strong and stable differences in contributions emerge across group types and individuals in different roles. In some cases these differences result from the emergence of an efficiency norm where all fully contribute. In the cases where full efficiency is not attained, these differences result from the enforcement of different relative contribution norms. Hence, our experimental data show that, even in heterogeneous groups, individuals can overcome the collective action problem inherent in public good games by agreeing on and enforcing a contribution norm.

The results obtained confirm a rising trend in the use of KIBS as intermediate consumptions as well as the predominance of the domestic provision of this type of services with two exceptions: Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Finland. Leaving aside the two countries with the lowest intensities, Estonia and Hungary, four major groups of countries in terms of the R&D intensity of their KIBS sector were distinguished: very high (Finland, Sweden and Austria), high (Ireland, Czech Republic and Spain), medium (Greece, Belgium, Slovakia, Romania, Slovenia and Germany) and low (Portugal, Netherlands, Poland, Italy and Lithuania). Overall, a high correspondence between R&D intensity and product-embodied R&D diffusion was found, although Ireland, Romania, Belgium and the Netherlands displayed a disappointing diffusion per unit of value added in comparison with the R&D expenditures developed. The existence of weak linkages between the KIBS sector and the rest of industries can be identified as the main explanation for this diffusion gap. In brief, the results obtained confirm that KIBS are essential industries for improving innovation performance as they carry out strong efforts in R&D that spill over to the rest of the production system.","Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Rodriguez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Campus Univ Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",m_rodrig@ugr.es,"Rodríguez, Mercedes/HTL-9989-2023; Rodriguez, Mercedes/H-5517-2015","Rodriguez, Mercedes/0000-0002-0524-7737",,,,,44,6,6,0,39,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The magnitude of scale and scope economies determines the cost efficient configuration of any industry. In the case of a regulated sector, reliable estimates of these economies are relevant to inform reform proposals that promote vertical (un)bundling and mergers. The empirical evidence allows some general conclusions. First, there is considerable evidence for the existence of vertical scope economies between upstream water production and distribution. Second, there is only mixed evidence on the existence of (dis)economies of scope between water and sewerage activities. Third, economies of scale exist up to certain output level, and diseconomies of scale arise if the company increases its size beyond this level. However, the optimal scale of utilities also appears to vary considerably between countries. Finally, we briefly consider the implications of our findings for water pricing and point to several directions for necessary future empirical research on the measurement of these economies, and explaining their cross country variation.","[Saal, David S.] Aston Univ, Econ & Strategy Grp, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Arocena, Pablo] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Business Adm, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Maziotis, Alexandros] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, I-30124 Venice, Italy; [Triebs, Thomas] Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, IFO Inst, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Aston University; Universidad Publica de Navarra; Fondazione Mattei; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Saal, DS (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Econ & Strategy Grp, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",d.s.saal@aston.ac.uk,"Maziotis, Alexandros/AAB-5477-2020; Arocena, Pablo/K-6375-2017","Maziotis, Alexandros/0000-0001-9817-1470; Arocena, Pablo/0000-0002-4035-4597; Saal, David/0000-0002-9542-9496",,,,,72,44,47,0,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Increasingly important is the management of an organisations brand (image, brand philosophy, etc ... ), more specifically, its Own Brand, which has gained significance by obtaining an increasing role in various markets. This phenomenon also has a direct impact on an organisation's competitiveness. The focus of this paper is placed on the relevance of Human Capital (as a dimension of Intellectual Capital) to 'Own Brand' Product Innovation development. The research methodology for this investigation incorporated a case study, using both formal and informal interviewing techniques, conducted on a firm situated in the Viana do Castelo district, Northern Portugal. Human Capital and Innovation was the focus of this research study, with Product Innovation being the focal emphasis. Data collection took place during September 2010, with reference made to the previous three years of activity and performance of companies. This research suggests that the different degrees of instability in the markets faced by companies has to do with the company's commitment to training and their ability to offer workshops to their employees on new challenges experienced, as well as their exposure to a more enterprising outlook. It also depends on the function for which the employee is employed and the attitude of the employee (positive, which achieved the maximum value in the questionnaire) to life and work. Formal education, together with the extra professional training, and attitude, is given more consideration and then easily recognised as added value. We verify that there is a very good understanding and appreciation of the kind of effort and sacrifice necessary by highly educated individuals. We found a higher value placed on the extra professional training (higher than that found for the formal education especially if it was based on the individuals own initiative). In present study we found that employee motivation and organization initiatives were important to, innovative initiatives, and also to ease of delivery and exchange of ideas and knowledge. Focusing on the designer professional, we established that the formal academic training of designers and their multidisciplinary training were drivers of innovativeness.","[Santos-Rodrigues, Helena] Polytech Inst Viana Do Castelo, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal; [Santos-Rodrigues, Helena] Univ Algarve, CIEO Ctr Spatial Res & Org, Faro, Portugal; [Cranfield, Desiree] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo; Universidade do Algarve; University of Southampton,"Santos-Rodrigues, H (通讯作者)，Polytech Inst Viana Do Castelo, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal.",hsantos@estg.ipvc.pt; luisv22@portugalmail.com; djcranfield@gmail.com,"Santos-Rodrigues, Helena/A-8147-2012; Cranfield, Desiree Joy/AGT-4346-2022; santos-rodrigues, helena/M-7073-2019","Santos-Rodrigues, Helena/0000-0002-0442-4447; Cranfield, Desiree Joy/0000-0002-3082-687X; santos-rodrigues, helena/0000-0002-0442-4447",,,,,25,0,0,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,371,375,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000042,0

Companies can achieve such an improvement in different ways. One way, especially for companies operating in a multi-project environment, is a successfully operating Project Management Office (PMO). Recent studies have revealed that a successful PMO is a key factor influencing organisational performance. The author of this study conducted a world-wide research with a sample of over four hundred PMO cases to identify what determines the success of their operations. This study revealed that to achieve a successfully operating PMO, we should focus on the activities of the PMO during two periods: short term (up to one year) and long term (two or more years). Consequently, in each of these time frames, there are different issues that need to be addressed to run a successful PMO and, thus, improve industrial engineering performance. Moreover, the efficacy of operations in a multi-project environment is crucial for practitioners. Therefore, the findings of this research will help managers to improve organisational performance, which should result in the ability to manage more projects on time and within the budget and scope of the PMO.

Economic historians examine a variety of sources to learn when, why, and where modern industrial societies became rich and healthy. Monetary measures, such as income and wages, are highly desirable but usually unavailable to cover the time periods and countries over which modern societies evolved. Donning interdisciplinary lenses, these historians search archives, libraries, and archaeological sources for scraps of information, often assembled for other purposes, to construct a story of the evolution of humanity's well-being. Biological measures have the advantage of comparability across time and culture; life expectancy, for example, means about the same today as in ancient Egypt, but the same cannot be said for the purchasing power of income, wages, or wealth.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Steckel, RH (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",steckel.1@osu.edu,,,,,,,100,16,17,0,20,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4605-8,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

After controlling for county heterogeneity, county and year fixed effects, and county-specific time trends, this study shows that alcohol outlet density decreases expected alcohol-related traffic accidents and arrests for driving under the influence (DUI). The negative correlation can be explained according to the reduced travel distance between alcohol outlets and home, but this distance effect does not appear when the number of off-premise alcohol outlets increases. The empirical results of this study show that the off-premise alcohol outlet density is negatively related to the number of expected accidents and DUI arrests. These results indicate that on-premise consumption decreases according to the number of available off-premise outlets. The results also indicate that this effect originates mainly from the off-premise outlets that sell alcoholic products with a relatively low alcohol content.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Tang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan.",mengchi@gmail.com,,"Tang, Meng-Chi/0000-0002-7175-7241",,,,,25,1,2,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Housing price booms are more consistent with credit expansion than stock price. Likewise, housing price has stable positive connection with future output gap and inflation relative to stock price.

Unilateral climate policy cannot directly impose emission prices on foreign sources, but it can complement domestic emission pricing with border carbon adjustment to reduce leakage and increase global cost-effectiveness. While border carbon adjustment has a theoretical efficiency rationale, its practical implementation is subject to serious caveats. This article summarizes the results of an Energy Modeling Forum study (EMF 29) on the efficiency and distributional impacts of border carbon adjustment. We find that border carbon adjustment can effectively reduce leakage and ameliorate adverse impacts on energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries of unilaterally abating countries. However, the scope for global cost savings is small. The main effect of border carbon adjustment is to shift the economic burden of emission reduction to non-abating countries through implicit changes in international prices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal pricing of the platform depends not only on the cost of providing service and the benefits of the participants, but also on how the marginal entrant (either a buyer or a seller) affects the matching probability.

The paper concludes that economic growth is related to both the health growth rate and the health level. While growth in health capital always facilitates economic growth, the gross effect of health level on the rate of economic growth depends on how it affects physical capital accumulation. If the negative effect of health on economic growth through its influence on physical capital accumulation is not taken into consideration, then health level has a positive effect on the rate of economic growth by improving the efficiency of labor production. However, since health investment may crowd out physical capital investment and thus influence physical capital accumulation, excessive investment in health may have a negative effect on economic growth. Empirical tests of these theoretical hypotheses using panel data from individual provinces of China produce results that are consistent with our theoretical conclusions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Consider the following infinitely repeated game, similar to Ghosh and Ray (1996). At each stage, uncountable numbers of players, who are randomly matched without information about their partners' past actions, play a prisoner's dilemma game. The players have the option to continue their relationship, and they all have the same discount factor. Also, they have two possible types: high ability player (H) or low ability player (L). H can produce better outcomes for his partner as well as for himself than L can. We look for an equilibrium that is robust against both pair-wise deviation and individual deviation, and call such equilibrium a social equilibrium. In this setting, long-term cooperative behavior among the whole population can take place in a social equilibrium because of the players' preference for their partners' ability.

The break is such that the process has a unit root [i.e., is I(1)] in the pre-break regime but reverts to a stationary [i.e., I(0)] process in the post-break regime or vice versa. Chong (2001) develops the limit theory for the estimation of such autoregressive processes and shows that the rate of convergence of the breakpoint estimator in the I(1)-I(0) case is faster than that in the I(0)-I(1) case, which enables the break date to be estimated much more precisely in the former case. In this paper, we show that the faster rate is an artifact of the assumed data generating process that is characterized by a spurious jump at the true breakpoint. Based on a reformulation that avoids this jump, the same rate of convergence prevails in both cases. An important implication of this result is that existing confidence intervals in the I(1)-I(0) case have asymptotically zero coverage rates when the break magnitude is fixed. A small simulation study confirms the relevance of the asymptotic results in finite samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the impacts of the US monetary shocks on East Asian domestic interest rates and exchange rates contradict conventional wisdom. The conventional exchange rate channel is unlikely to play much role in the transmission of the US monetary policy shocks to floaters in East Asian countries, excluding Japan. In these countries, the domestic interest rates respond strongly to the US interest rate changes, by giving up monetary autonomy, probably because of fear of floating. However, the domestic interest rate does not respond much in countries with fixed exchange rate regimes and capital account restrictions, such as China and Malaysia. This may suggest that the countries with fixed exchange rate regimes enjoy a higher degree of monetary autonomy, most likely with the help of capital account restrictions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

According to this hypothesis, central banks have a smaller incentive to engineer surprise inflations in economies that are more open because the Phillips curve is steeper. In this paper, the panel data technique has been employed to examine the aforementioned hypothesis concerning the developed and developing countries over the last two decades. Also, comparing with other empirical studies, this paper has estimated the relationship between economic globalization as one dimension of the new KOF globalization index and inflation. The paper's results cast substantial doubts on the conventional view that suggests a robust and negative relationship between trade openness and inflation. The estimation result regarding the traditional measure of trade openness indicates a positive and significant association between trade openness and inflation which opposes the view of the Romer (1993) hypothesis. In contrast, the estimation results regarding a new economic globalization index (the KOF index) suggest that higher economic globalization will decrease inflation, as supported by the Romer (1993) hypothesis for both developed and developing countries during 1990-9 and 2000-9. Thus, it seems that the new economic globalization measure (the KOF index), which is a broader comprehensive index, is a better proxy for openness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While China's policy penalized any firm that assembled cars with less than 60% Chinese content, the policy was most likely to affect foreign-affiliated firms who were more likely to exceed the content ceiling. To assess whether foreign-affiliated firms differentially changed their input sourcing this paper uses Chinese product trade data for 1997-2009 which report trade transactions by firm ownership type. Compared with import transactions for other firms, the data show that foreign-affiliated firms appear to have mitigated the effects of the policy by reducing import transaction prices, and by reducing their import quantities on the extensive margin. While China's content-based auto import trade policy was repealed in 2009 after China lost its dispute case at the WTO, the extraordinary growth in China's global export of auto parts since 2005 suggests that China's short term trade policy may have contributed to enduring effects in global supply chains.

We show that even when two goods are ex ante homogeneous, quality uncertainty can eliminate the Bertrand paradox.","[Tasnadi, Attila] Corvinus Univ Budapest, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Smith, Trenton G.] Univ Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Hanks, Andrew S.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Corvinus University Budapest; University of Otago; Cornell University,"Tasnádi, A (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, MTA BCE Lendulet Strateg Interact Res Grp, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",attila.tasnadi@uni-corvinus.hu,"Tasnadi, Attila/D-2373-2010; Hanks, Andrew Stephen/B-7807-2015; Smith, Trenton/B-5449-2008","Tasnadi, Attila/0000-0003-3252-4223; Hanks, Andrew/0000-0003-0687-4772; Smith, Trenton/0000-0001-6272-8871",,,,,20,3,4,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The novelty of the approach lies in linking data from financial statements with data from innovation surveys of the Czech Statistical. Innovation activities of firms are modelled as a four stage model (CDM) which allows studying several interrelated questions while controlling for simultaneity and for causality problem. In the first two stages determinants of decision to innovate and consequent innovation investment are separated. In the third stage innovation input (R&D investment) is linked to innovation output, and finally, in the fourth stage it is determined how the productivity of firm is related to its innovation activities. Our analysis proved that innovation input significantly increases innovation output, with increasing firm's size, however, ceteris paribus, the innovation output is decreasing. This means that bigger firms are less efficient in transforming the innovation input into output. More importantly, our analysis shows that access to subsidies has significant, yet negative influence on innovation output. This result may throw a shadow on the efficiency of supported firms and have some implications for competition policy.","[Zemplinerova, Alena] CERGE Econ Inst, CZ-11121 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Hromadkova, Eva] Czech Natl Bank, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech National Bank,"Zemplinerová, A (通讯作者)，CERGE Econ Inst, Politickych Veznu 7, CZ-11121 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",aln@cerge-ei.cz,"Zemplinerova, Alena/H-2948-2014",,,,,,34,44,47,0,40,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Further, it is directly related to the development facts of Gurley and Shaw (1955). MUD is a global measure that reflects conditions in both debt and equity markets. It varies enormously across nations; from 0.23 in Australia at one extreme to 0.96 in Turkey at the other. Cross-country variations in MUD are not random; they are related to special-purpose measures of debt and equity market advancement from the financial development literature.

In the model, a global bidder bids for multiple items and can benefit from synergies, while local bidders bid for a single item. In the equilibrium, package bidding improves (hurts) efficiency at high (low) levels of synergies. Package bidding introduces free-riding incentives for local bidders resulting in asymmetric bidding that reduces efficiency when synergies are low but increases it with high synergies. The free ridding incentive lowers bidding of local and global bidders reducing revenues at all levels of synergies. We conduct experiments varying auction rules and the degree of synergies. Observed efficiencies are qualitatively consistent with the theory. The effect of package bidding on revenues is negative when global bidders are not allowed to bid on single items (a feature of the equilibrium) and positive when the restriction is relaxed and synergies are high.

We develop a new methodology for identifying episodes of extreme capital flow movements using data that differentiates activity by foreigners and domestics. We identify episodes of surges and stops (sharp increases and decreases, respectively, of gross inflows) and flight and retrenchment (sharp increases and decreases, respectively, of gross outflows). Our approach yields fundamentally different results than the previous literature that used measures of net flows. Global factors, especially global risk, are significantly associated with extreme capital flow episodes. Contagion, whether through trade, banking, or geography, is also associated with stop and retrenchment episodes. Domestic macroeconomic characteristics are generally less important, and we find little association between capital controls and the probability of having surges or stops driven by foreign capital flows. The results provide insights for different theoretical approaches explaining crises and capital flow volatility. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model is successful at matching the evolution of both the first and second moments of the data over the life cycle. The key challenge for the model is to generate declining inequality in annual hours worked over the first half of the working life, while respecting the constraints imposed by the data on consumption and wages. I argue that this is a robust feature of the data on life-cycle labor supply that is strongly at odds with the intratemporal first-order condition for labor. Allowing for a realistic degree of involuntary unemployment, coupled with preferences that feature nonseparability in the disutility of the extensive and intensive margins of hours worked, allows the model to overcome this challenge.

The two food-for-education programmes under consideration are, on the one hand, school meals where students are provided with lunch each school day, and, on the other hand, take-home rations which provide girls with 10 kg of cereal flour each month, conditional on 90 attendance rate. After the programme ran for one academic year, both programmes increased enrolment by 35 percentage points. The scores on mathematics improved for girls in both school meals and take-home rations villages. Conditional on enrolment, the interventions caused attendance to decrease, but this was mainly driven by lower attendance among new enrolees. The interventions also led to adjustment in child labour, with children (especially girls) with access to food-for-education programmes, in particular the take-home rations, shifting away from on farm labour and off-farm productive tasks which possibly are more incompatible with school hours.","[Kazianga, Harounan] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [de Walque, Damien; Alderman, Harold] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; The World Bank,"Kazianga, H (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",harounan.kazianga@okstate.edu,"de Walque, Damien/K-7049-2012","de Walque, Damien/0000-0003-1592-7602; Kazianga, Harounan/0000-0001-6780-9945",,,,,36,31,33,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The education expansion raised education levels across the whole education distribution and, in particular for our analysis, at the bottom end enabling us to develop an instrumental variable strategy to study the crimeeducation relationship. At the same time as the education expansion, youth crime fell, revealing a significant cross-cohort relationship between crime and education. The causal crime reducing effect of education is estimated to be negative and significant, and considerably bigger in (absolute) magnitude than ordinary least squares estimates. The education boost also significantly impacted other productivity-related economic variables (qualification attainment and wages), demonstrating that the incapacitation effect of additional time spent in school is not the sole driver of the results.","[Machin, Stephen] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Machin, Stephen; Marie, Olivier] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; [Marie, Olivier] Maastricht Univ, ROA, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Vujic, Suncica] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Maastricht University; University of Bath,"Machin, S (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",,,"Marie, Olivier/0000-0003-4097-7433; Vujic, Suncica/0000-0001-6510-1636",ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,20,24,25,5,76,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

According to economic life-cycle models, if learning HIV results is informative about additional years of life, being diagnosed HIV-positive or negative should predict changes in consumption, investment and savings behavior with important micro and macro-economic implications. Using an experiment that randomly assigned incentives to learn HIV results, I find that while learning HIV results had short term effects on subjective belief of HIV infection, these differences did not persist after two years. Consistent with this, there were relatively few differences two years later in savings, income, expenditures, and employment between those who learned and did not learn their status.

The overall goal is to show that demand matters to understand properly observed properties of markets not only because of its exogenous (i.e. non-economic) features, but also because of aspects of consumers' behavior that fully deserve to be considered in the domain of economics. The paper presents a general model of the consumer based on a bounded rational decision algorithm. The model is shown to be compatible with available evidence on consumers' behavior and adaptable for theoretical as well as empirical applications. The description of the proposed model's components provides the opportunity to discuss a number of issues the importance of which for the analysis of markets of markets becomes evident taking a demand-oriented perspective. Among these, we propose a formal definition of preferences meant as decision criteria used by consumers and distinct from the actual decisions made by consumers at each purchasing occasion. We also highlight the potential role of firms' marketing in shaping consumers' preferences, suggesting an endogenous channel of influence on consumers' preferences which is possibly highly relevant in certain markets. We use the model to show that the proposed model can easily replicate a generic market demand function, with the advantage of more robust foundations and greater flexibility in respect of standard consumer theory. We also show that limiting to consider distributional properties of markets, neglecting the type of demand, may lead to serious errors of interpretation.","[Valente, Marco] Univ Aquila, Dip Ingn Ind & Informaz & Econ, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Valente, Marco] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Ist Econ, Pisa, Italy",University of L'Aquila; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Valente, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aquila, Dip Ingn Ind & Informaz & Econ, Via G Falcone 25, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",marco.valente@univaq.it,"Valente, Marco/G-8781-2012","Valente, Marco/0000-0001-5378-4898",,,,,41,29,33,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

When actual reforms are motivated by work incentives, it is also crucial to evaluate behavioural responses and the distributional consequences thereof. For that purpose, I embed counterfactual simulations in a formal decomposition framework to quantify the relative roles of (i) direct tax-benefit policy changes, (ii) indirect policy effects due to labour supply responses to the reforms and (iii) all other factors affecting income distribution over time. An application to the UK shows that the redistributive reforms of the 1998-2001 period have offset much of the rise in market income inequality and contributed to a strong decline in child poverty and poverty amongst single parent households. In the latter group, a third of the headcount poverty reduction (and half of the reduction in the depth of poverty) is on account of the very large incentive effect of the policy changes.","[Bargain, Olivier] IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Bargain, Olivier] Aix Marseille Univ, DEFI, F-13290 Les Milles, France",IZA Institute Labor Economics; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，IZA, 5-7 Schaumburg Lippe Str, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",olivier.bargain@univmed.fr,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019",,,,,,46,16,16,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Our focus is on how the shape of the status function - i.e., how social status is computed and evaluated - can affect the equilibrium outcome of the model, and in particular the relationship between inequality and wasteful conspicuous consumption. We find that if status depends in an ordinal way on individuals' relative standing in terms of economic resources, then redistributing resources from the rich to the poor increases social waste because it forces the rich to spend more on conspicuous consumption in order to differentiate themselves from the poor. If, instead, status depends in a cardinal way on individuals' relative standing, then a redistribution of resources in favor of the poor can reduce social waste. This is possible because under cardinal status there is an additional effect: a lesser degree of inequality decreases the value of social status and, hence, reduces the incentives to engage in wasteful social competition. If this second effect is stronger than the first one, then social waste reduces. In this case a Pareto improvement is also possible but it requires, in addition, that the rich save enough on costly signaling to compensate for the losses due to the reduction of economic resources.

It uses a unique dataset collected through a firm-level survey conducted in 17 European countries and covering various sectors. Several conclusions are drawn from this evidence. Firms adjust wages less frequently than prices, on average every 15 and 10 months, respectively. Price and, especially, wage adjustment exhibit a substantial degree of time-dependence. In particular, wage changes tend to cluster at a specific time of the year, mostly January in the majority of countries. The results of a multivariate analysis indicate that prices are more flexible when competitive pressures in product markets are strong and when labor costs account for a lower fraction of firms' total costs, whereas wages are more flexible when bargaining is decentralized and when the coverage of collective bargaining and the stringency of employment protection legislation are low. Price rigidities are higher in firms with a larger share of high-skilled/white-collar workers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We model and simulate endogenous link formation among households heterogeneously endowed with both traditional and social network capital who make investment and technology choices over time in the absence of financial markets and faced with multiple production technologies featuring different fixed costs and returns. We show that social network capital can either complement or substitute for productive assets in facilitating some poor households' escape from poverty. However, the voluntary nature of costly link formation also creates exclusionary mechanisms that impede some poor households' use of social network capital. Through numerical simulation, we show that the ameliorative potential of social networks therefore depends fundamentally on the broader socio-economic wealth distribution in the economy, which determines the feasibility of social interactions and the net intertemporal benefits resulting from endogenous network formation. In some settings, targeted public transfers to the poor can crowd-in private resources by inducing new social links that the poor can exploit to escape from poverty.","[Chantarat, Sommarat] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Ardnt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Australian National University; Cornell University,"Chantarat, S (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Ardnt Corden Dept Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",sommarat.chantarat@anu.edu.au,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721",,,,,60,34,46,0,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Estimating marginal costs of quality can help energy regulators to design more effective incentive mechanisms for network utilities to achieve optimal quality levels and reduce welfare losses due to sub-optimal quality. We implement this methodology by way of applying it to the case of the UK electricity distribution networks. The proposed method allows us to measure the welfare effect of the observed quality improvements in the UK between 1995 and 2003. Our results suggest that the regulatory incentives to reduce service interruptions have not been strong enough to achieve economically efficient levels of service quality. We, find that the incentives to encourage utilities to reduce network energy losses have led to to performance improvement. We estimate that the observed improvements in quality during the period of the study only represented about 20% of the potential customer welfare gains, hence leaving considerable scope for further economically efficient improvements in service quality.

The system splits into two well separated branches - a fuels part and a food part. Biodiesel tends to the fuels branch and ethanol to the food branch. When the periods before and after the food crisis of 2007/2008 are compared, the connections are much stronger for the post-crisis period.

We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model in which there are two types of labor (skilled and unskilled), two types of capital (human and physical), and money is introduced via a cash in advance constraint on consumption purchases. Skill heterogeneity is characterized in terms of (i) a parameter governing the ease with which the two types of labor can be substituted for each other in production; and (ii) the productivity of human capital in the production of skill. The model includes the accumulation of human capital which in turn creates skill heterogeneity among workers through an efficiency wage mechanism. Numerical experiments indicate that there is a range of parameter estimates in which the Friedman Rule may not be optimal. Furthermore, our quantitative experiments also indicate that there is a range of parameter values in which a greater degree of skill heterogeneity may be associated with a greater preference for inflation. Empirically, we also find that the inflation and heterogeneity correlation is positive. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

First a basic model of advertising in oligopolistic industries is developed in which firms decide how much to invest in either predatory or cooperative advertising and then engage in product market competition either as Cournot competitors or as Bertrand competitors. It is shown that firms invest in only one form of advertising; which form they invest in depends on the relative effectiveness of the two types of advertising, the degree of product differentiation, and the form of product market competition. The paper then studies strategic industrial policy and shows that an advertising subsidy is the optimal strategic policy irrespective of the form of product market competition and the form of advertising in which firms invest.","[Ma, Jie] Univ Int Business & Econ, Dept Int Trade, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Ulph, Alistair M.] Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of International Business & Economics; University of Manchester,"Ma, J (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Dept Int Trade, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 10 Huixin Dongjie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",pkujiema@gmail.com; alistair.ulph@manchester.ac.uk,"Ma, Jie/IZQ-3214-2023","Ma, Jie/0000-0001-5915-9356",,,,,21,3,3,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

First we study the evolution of returns to education and then we estimate returns to education in terms of the match between the worker's schooling and the job requirements. The results indicate that returns to education have declined since the mid-nineties. One also finds that the return associated with the job's required education is greater than that corresponding to the worker's actual schooling, and that the return on an additional year of attained education is positive but less than that of an additional year of required education. From a policy perspective, the existence of educational mismatch points to inefficiencies in the allocation of the educational resources. Investment on education can positively contribute to alleviate the unemployment problem in Spain, but taken into account the existence of educational mismatch it also becomes necessary to introduce structural reforms in order to adapt the job structure to a model of production based on knowledge so that the more highly qualified workers can find a job that corresponds to their educational level.

Moreover, sustained real exchange rate overvaluation will, by distorting resource allocation away from productive activities, eventually lead to drastic adjustments of relative prices and reduction of aggregate economic growth. However, the direct theoretical and empirical link between exchange rate misalignment and macroeconomic indicators still remains to be fully understood. Nonetheless, empirical studies continue to make attempts to understand this relationship by exploring relationships that incorporate different measures of exchange rate misalignment in traditional growth regression models. Based on a behavioural equilibrium exchange rate derived measure exchange rate misalignment, this paper presents an empirical analysis of the relationship between real gross domestic product growth and real exchange rate misalignment for Zimbabwe. After controlling for other structural and policy variables, the main findings demonstrate that exchange rate misalignment exerts a negative and highly statistically significant impact on growth.

The non-homothetic case is the important one empirically (Engel's Law). The algorithm can be applied in both time series and cross section. It can also be used to estimate true producer price indices and Total Factor Productivity in the presence of input-biased economies of scale and technical change. The basic idea is to calculate a chain index of prices but with actual budget (cost) shares replaced by compensated shares, i.e. what the shares would have been if consumers (firms) faced actual prices but their utility (output) were held constant at some reference level. The compensated shares can be derived econometrically from the same data as are required for the construction of conventional index numbers. The algorithm is illustrated by applying it to estimating true PPPs for 141 countries and 100 products within household consumption, using data from the World Bank's latest International Comparison Program.","London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Oulton, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.oulton@lse.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,59,13,13,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

However, standard economic theory does not account for this possibility. Efficiency wage models, for example, conclude a positive relationship between wage incentives and productivity. While efficiency wage models are shown to describe productivity behavior in numerous settings, said models do not describe labor markets featuring (counterproductive) performance pressure. We put forth a theoretical model of performance production in which performance incentives induce productive effects and counterproductive effects. The model treats explicit monitoring and distraction as distinct, counterproductive processes within a cohesive theory of performance production. In settings featuring performance pressure, we find that higher levels of performance-contingent compensation may decrease not only labor output (i.e., likelihood of task success) but also labor input (i.e., effort) if counterproductive processes decrease the marginal effectiveness of effort sufficiently. The latter finding challenges a common view that performance decrements under pressure occur despite greater effort levels. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using standard growth equations, we look into the correlation between investment in technical structure and growth in Croatia for two periods - socialist (1960-1989) and transition (1990-2009). Results suggest that equipment investments can boost growth rates through total factor productivity (TFP). This is consistent with the work of De Long and Summers (1991, 1992, 1993, 1994) and Temple (1998). In Croatia the equipment investments - growth link appears to be stronger than the structure investment - growth link for both periods. We also find a strong positive correlation between human capital and growth. Tests confirm the consistency and robustness of the regression results, suggesting inclusion of new variables in standard growth models. The structure of technical investments, real capital stock (not proxies) and estimated human capital stock (not schooling proxies) should have an important role in explaining international growth differences.","[Skare, Marinko; Sinkovic, Dean] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr; dsinkov@unipu.hr,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692",,,,,41,3,3,0,11,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

It formulates the concepts of identity-sharing groups and resource-sharing groups to bridge between religious identity's social-psychological aspects and its socioeconomic effects. The paper then argues that social cleavages among religious identity-sharing groups generated informal institutions that are incompatible with the abstract formal institutions of the nation-states of Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. That incompatibility hobbles efforts of formal state institutions to promote economic development, and instead restrains economic growth by intensifying existing conflicts among groups. It suggests that a state that could promote economic development would be the one that recognizes and supports the informal, localized institutions and allows those of them with common features to evolve into abstract formal institutions.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Tomass, MK (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,47,13,15,0,24,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

However, in terms of the currency internationalization prospect index (CIPI), the RMB has remained the world's fifth highest since 2006. Although it is still far behind the US dollar and the euro, surpassing the ranking of the yen and the pound is possible in the near future. The dramatic difference in the ranking between the CIDI and the CIPI is a result of China's tight capital account control, the usage continuity of international currency due to network externalities, and the narrow foreign exchange and imperfect financial markets. Hence, to a large degree, the RMB's potential as an international currency depends on China's capital account liberalization.","[Yeh, Jason] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tung, Chen-yuan; Wang, Guo-chen] Natl Chengchi Univ, Grad Inst Dev Studies, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Tung, Chen-yuan] Natl Chengchi Univ, Ctr Predict Markets, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",Chinese University of Hong Kong; National Chengchi University; National Chengchi University,"Yeh, J (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ctung@nccu.edu.tw; guochenwang@hotmail.com.tw; jasonyeh@baf.msmail.cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,41,9,10,3,118,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2012,20.0,5,,,,,63,82,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01302.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,014SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309395400004,0

Proponents of gas drilling point to the activity's local economic benefits yet no empirical studies have systematically documented the magnitude or distribution of economic gains. I estimate these gains for counties in Colorado, Texas, and Wyoming, three states where natural gas production expanded substantially since the late 1990s. I find that a large increase in the value of gas production caused modest increases in employment, wage and salary income, and median household income. The results suggest that each million dollars in gas production created 2.35 jobs in the county of production, which led to an annualized increase in employment that was 1.5% of the pre-boom level for the average gas boom county. Comparisons show that ex-ante estimates of the number of jobs created by developing the Fayetteville and Marcellus shale gas formations may have been too large.

We demonstrate that adopting the (t - T) efficiency functional form used by BC can, in a model which allows for firm specific patterns of temporal inefficiency variation (as developed by Cuesta, 2000), results in counter intuitive 'falling-off' of efficient firms in the final sample year. This motivates us to look at a more general parameterisation. First we show that the choice of a function within the first order exponential class is only an issue for the Cuesta model; in the BC model, parameter estimates and inefficiency estimates are invariant to the form. Second we apply the more general model to a railways dataset and find that this model does not seem to suffer from the most efficient firms falling off the frontier. We discuss how to test restrictions in order to make the model more parsimonious, thus preserving the attractive property of the Cuesta model, namely the ability to test for firm specific patterns of inefficiency variation.

Some predicted a multiplier effect in the order of 1.5, others argued that the multiplier will be less than 0.5. Such multiplier estimates typically stem from estimated linear vector autoregressions (VARs) or linearized versions of DSGE models. In this paper, we argue that neither conventional VAR analysis nor linearized DGSE models may be appropriate to evaluate demand effects arising from such a stimulus package. The reason is, as recent research suggests, that the timing of demand shocks matters. To assess the multiplier's variability, we adopt a regime-dependent VAR approach. As is shown in detail, our model specification is grounded on theoretical considerations. The empirical analysis presented here suggests that a regime-dependent VAR-specification is favored for U.S. output and employment data, and that the standard (one-regime) VAR methodology is inappropriate for analyzing multi-regime processes. Although we employ a nonlinear VAR framework, the chosen setup allows the use of largely familiar macroeconometric modeling tools. Estimating a two-regime VAR, we show that the fiscal multiplier varies with the state of the business cycle and the particular specifics of the measure taken. For the U.S. we find, for example, the fiscal expansion multiplier is much higher in a regime of a low economic activity than in a regime of high activity. As we also show it is size dependent.

We find that on average it is the more fortunate members of rural society who belong in CBOs. In Senegal, the dominant criterion is land ownership. In Burkina Faso it is age and family ties with village authorities. Ethnicity plays a role as well: CBO membership is less likely for ethnic groups that traditionally emphasize livestock raising. Next we look for evidence of assortative matching along multiple dimensions, using an original methodology based on dyadic regressions. We find robust evidence of positive assorting by physical and ethnic proximity as well as by wealth and household size. Along certain dimensions, donor-sponsored CBOs are less elitist and more inclusive. But the reverse is true for other dimensions, particularly in Burkina Faso.

To achieve the target, the European Council has adopted mandatory differentiated national targets for each of the member states. In this paper, we consider the use of green certificates to reach the renewable targets and we analyze the potential for cost reductions by allowing for trade in green certificates across member states. We show that differentiated national targets cannot ensure a cost-effective implementation of the overall target for the EU's renewable energy consumption. Trade in green certificates can ensure a cost-effective distribution of renewable energy production, but the national targets prevent a cost-effective distribution of energy consumption. Nevertheless, our numerical model indicates that EU-wide trade in green certificates may cut the EU's total cost of fulfilling the renewable target by as much as 70% compared with a situation with no trade. However, the design of green certificate markets may have a large impact on the distribution of costs across countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that prices strongly cluster around the dollar digit value of 9 within the TPZ sub-periods, but not outside the sub-periods. Furthermore, the degree of clustering declines when production capacity utilization is high and when production significantly exceeds quotas, consistent with OPEC's inability to defend the zone. Nine-centered clustering also results in lower contemporaneous and next-day volatility. These results support the target pricing zone hypothesis of crude oil. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Contrary to the standard literature on cost regulation, the firm engages in cost reducing investment before it enters into a regulatory contract. This pre-contractual investment in cost reduction determines the firm type at the contracting stage. The paper derives both the optimum incentive compatible falsification contract and the equilibrium type distribution. With the distribution of cost types determined endogenously by the pre-contractual investment choice, an increase in the cost of falsification has two effects. First, there is a direct effect that reduces cost padding because it becomes more expensive to do so. Second, there is an indirect effect that increases cost padding because the firm responds by choosing lower investments, and lower investments are associated with more cost padding. It is demonstrated that the direct effect will dominate and both expected levels of cost padding and expected costs for falsification will be reduced. However, the indirect effect increases real costs and, despite the reduction in cost padding, the net effect can reduce welfare. It is determined that these conclusions are significantly different from those obtained when the distribution of cost types is exogenously fixed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Subsequently, we develop a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) where it is observed that the dynamics of patents and GDP are adjusted to long-run equilibrium. Empirical evidence suggests that the marginal change in the patents affects the GDP growth rate but this does not have a significant effect on the number of patents change, that is, the number of patents is an exogenous variable.

However, rationalizability has been formally defined in general settings only for games with a finite number of players. We propose an exploration of rationalizability in the context of games with a continuum of players. We deal with a special class of these games, in which payoff of each player depends only on his own strategy and on an aggregate value: the state of the game, which is obtained from the complete action profile. We define the sets of point-rationalizable states and rationalizable states.

The empirical analysis applies the asymmetric ARDL cointegration methodology proposed by Shin. Yu and Greenwood-Nimmo (2011) over the period from January 1999 to May 2011. The evidence suggests that ignoring the intrinsic nonlinearities may lead to misleading inference. In particular, the results reveal significant differences in the response of house prices to positive or negative changes of the explanatory variables in both the long- and short-run time horizons. The obtained evidence of asymmetry could be of major importance for more efficient policymaking and forecasting in the Greek house market. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This approach can explain the well-established phenomenon that, after a public announcement, trading volume increases, more private information is incorporated into prices and volatility increases. In such environments, public information has the important secondary role of helping agents learn about the information of other agents. Therefore, whenever the correlation between the private information of different groups is sufficiently low, a public announcement increases disagreement among short-horizon traders regarding the expected selling price even as it decreases disagreement about the fundamental value of the asset.

In our view, the black boxes to examine are the relations between price setting, market structure and spatial disparities. The paper aims to extend the empirical literature in several directions. A first goal of the research is to investigate the link between heterogeneity in price changes and spatial dependence. Besides, we compare the price dynamics among sectors, namely manufacturing vs. service. It is irrefutable that prices stickiness is linked to good market rigidities. Consequently, these issues have extremely important policy implications; for instance, the Monetary Authority considers the macro price indexes in order to determine the right policy to stabilize the economy and to improve social welfare. However, the Central Bank does not distinguish the likely aggregation bias source from the cross sector-region-country heterogeneities. Overall, the purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of survey data that allows us to collect important aspects for Economic Policy analysis, which could not be drawn from analysis with mesoeconomic or aggregate data. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that price dynamic heterogeneity across geographical areas, as well as disparities across industries, are statistically significant in our microeconometric models. Indeed, the probability that industries in the backward areas change prices is 30% less than in more developed regions (Northeast). In addition, we find that sectoral diversity counts especially across goods and service industries, even if this outcome is not always robust across microeconometric specifications.

A positive, negative or zero weight represents altruism, spite or complete selfishness, respectively. As it turns out, even in a symmetric interaction the equilibrium level of social payoff may be lower for a group of altruists than for selfish or spiteful groups. In particular, a concern for others' payoffs may paradoxically lower these payoffs. However, this can only be so if the equilibrium strategies involved are unstable. If they are stable, the social payoff can only increase or remain unchanged with an increasing degree of altruism. In these results, 'stability' stands for a general notion of static stability, which includes a number of established ones, such as evolutionarily stable strategy, as special cases.

The developed approach is based on three essential modern tools. The first is state-space modeling adopted from the classical control theory, and as state variables describing the behavior of a system the gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment rate CUE) were chosen. The history of development of the modeled economy in time, which is represented by triples of the values of GDP, inflation, and UE, is then considered as a trajectory in state-space. The second tool is fractional-order differential equations; solutions of a system of three fractional-order differential equations are used for fitting the available economic data. The third tool is the orthogonal distance fitting method, which is used for identification of the parameters of the system of fractional differential equations that is used as a general model. The obtained models of the state-space trajectories of the economics of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have similar shape (which can be explained, for example, by similarities in their political and economical systems) but look like stretched compared to each other (which can be explained, for example, by different size of population and its social structure).

Unlike in the standard Stackelberg setup with barriers to entry, the leader's profit increases when the differentiation becomes lower. The reason is that competition becomes tougher when products become more alike, and consequently, fewer firms enter in equilibrium. On the other hand, increasing product differentiation towards its limit results in number of entrants tending to infinity and for very large market, the profit of the leader approaches zero. Thus market structure approaches monopolistic competition, rather than the standard monopoly outcome that occurs with exogenous number of followers.","CERGE EI, Prague 11121 1, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Zigic, K (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, POB 882,Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11121 1, Czech Republic.",kresimir.zigic@cerge-ei.cz,"Zigic, Kresimir/H-2929-2014",,,,,,13,4,4,0,15,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We identify a gap between the empirical and the theoretical work that studies the credit crunch effects of these requirements, and how they can work as a financial accelerator that amplifies business cycles. This gap arises because the empirical work faces some difficulties in identifying the effects of capital requirements, whereas the theory still lacks a structural framework that can address these difficulties. We bridge that gap by providing a general equilibrium theoretical framework that allows us to study this financial accelerator. The main insight we obtain is that the credit crunch and financial accelerator effects are rather weak, which confirms the findings of existing empirical work. Additionally, by developing a structural framework, we are able to provide an explanation for this result.","[Olivero, Maria Pia] Drexel Univ, Dept Econ, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Olivero, MP (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, Dept Econ, LeBow Coll Business, 503-A Matheson Hall,3141 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",maria.olivero@drexel.edu,,,,,,,62,15,18,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This paper demonstrates the usefulness of reconceptualizing the usual definition of conditional heteroscedasticity as the (h = 1) special case of h-step-ahead conditional heteroscedasticity, where the conditional volatility in period t depends on observable variables up through period t h. Here it is shown that, for h > 1, h-stepahead conditional heteroscedasticity arises necessarily and endogenously - from nonlinear serial dependence in a time series; whereas one-step-ahead conditional heteroscedasticity (i.e., h = 1) requires multiple and heterogeneously-skedastic innovation terms. Consequently, the best response to observed volatility clustering may often be to model the nonlinear serial dependence which is likely causing it, rather than 'tacking on' an ad hoc volatility model. Even where such nonlinear modeling is infeasible or where volatility is quantified using, say, a model-free implied volatility measure rather than squared returns these results suggest a re-consideration of the usefulness of lag-one terms in volatility models.

These programs are among the largest and most controversial forms of social insurance, with the putative purpose of supporting families affected by unexpected income shocks due to workplace injuries and illnesses. Using Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data for a sample of workers who have experienced a work-related, work-limiting disability, I find that a 10% increase in WC benefit generosity offsets the drop in household consumption upon injury by 3 to 5%. Moreover, my estimates imply that if benefits were very low, the drop in consumption upon injury would be in the range of 30%. A model adapted from the literature on optimal social insurance yields a formula for the optimal level of WC benefits, which depends on empirical estimates of the consumption-smoothing parameter. My calculations suggest that current WC benefit levels are somewhat higher than optimal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper argues this position is wrong in two ways. First, it is a process that stretches back decades before 1980. Textbook mentions of 1970s precursor financial innovations fall far short of presenting the breadth and duration of the pre-1980 attack on the system of regulation. Second, it has not been an across-the-board attack on financial regulation in the name of market efficiency as required by its ideology and claimed by its advocates, but rather a focused attack on only one of the five pillars of the system of regulation. This paper develops both of these assertions through a presentation of the five central pillars of the pre-1980 system of financial regulation, and the four major attacks on the three different aspects of the restrictions on financial competition.","[Campbell, Al] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Bakir, Erdogan] Bucknell Univ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Bucknell University,"Campbell, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,,,,,,,11,8,11,0,14,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This paper investigates the role played by equilibrium selection under indeterminacy in the assessment of their relative merits. We contrast the outcomes of counterfactual simulations conditional on the continuity selection strategy-largely exploited by the literature-with those obtained with a novel sign restriction based strategy. Our results suggest that conclusions achieved under continuity are not necessarily robust to the selection of different-still economically sensible-equilibria. According to our simulations, the switch to a hawkish systematic monetary policy may very well induce an increase in output volatility. Hence, our sign restriction-selection strategy resurrects the inflation-output policy tradeoff.","[Castelnuovo, Efrem] Univ Padua, Dept Econ, I-35123 Padua, PD, Italy; [Castelnuovo, Efrem] Bank Finland, Helsinki, Finland",University of Padua; Bank of Finland,"Castelnuovo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, PD, Italy.",efrem.castelnuovo@unipd.it,,,,,,,50,8,8,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Quoted authors highlighted the importance of positional concerns by finding that people prefer to earn a fewer absolute amount of income but to earn a higher income than others. Why do people prefer to earn more than others? The proposed explanation is that people have a preference for status. This conclusion might be wrong due to their particular design. We conjecture that subjects, by indicating to prefer a state of the world in which they earn more than others, in reality signal a preference for equality. We replicated the same design as in Solnick and Hemenway (1998, 2005, 2007) and added a new option so as to disentangle positional concerns from egalitarian ones.

A series of static and dynamic panel data models are estimated, and then an optimal forecasting model selected by out-of-sample criteria is used to forecast the emission trend and reduction potential up to 2020. The estimation results show that economic development, technology progress and industry structure are the most important factors affecting China's CO2 emissions, while the impacts of energy consumption structure, trade openness and urbanization level are negligible. The inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita CO2 emissions and economic development level is not strongly supported by the estimation results. The impact of capital adjustment speed is significant. Scenario simulations further show that per capita and aggregate CO2 emissions of China will increase continuously up to 2020 under any of the three scenarios developed in this study, but the reduction potential is large.

We compare this real-effort treatment to a baseline treatment where the pot is a windfall gain and where a lottery determines the pot size. In the baseline treatment, reciprocity cannot play a role. We find that female dictators show reciprocity and decrease their taking-rates significantly in the real-effort treatment. This treatment effect is larger when female dictators make a decision on recipients who successfully generated a large pot compared to the case where the recipients performed poorly.

However, in reality, the precedence logic of activities is not necessarily unchangeable. There are two types of relations between activities: fixed (hard) and soft. Current scheduling methods do not differentiate between these two types of relations and require a planner to choose one particular logical sequence based on some assumptions. The paper presents a model that allows for weakening the links between activities, i.e. that permits concurrent execution of activities or reversing their order, but this may require additional resource-consuming works or expenditures. The model involves two subtypes of soft logic: REVERSED and CANCELED to represent the soft relations between activities.

The paper presents an example of practical application of the method to scheduling interior finishing works. The results support the argument that using soft logic relations between construction activities provides more flexibility in reducing project duration, activities timing and resource allocation.","[Jaskowski, Piotr] Lublin Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Architecture, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland; [Sobotka, Anna] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Min & Geoengn, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland",Lublin University of Technology; AGH University of Krakow,"Jaskowski, P (通讯作者)，Lublin Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Architecture, Ul Nadbystrzycka 40, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland.",p.jaskowski@pollub.pl; sobotka@agh.edu.pl,"Jaskowski, Piotr/I-1184-2014; Sobotka, Anna/W-6148-2018","Jaskowski, Piotr/0000-0003-1661-3373; Sobotka, Anna/0000-0002-4477-8821",,,,,49,19,21,1,33,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Invisible-hand theories suggest that the law is primarily driven by a selection process whereby inefficient laws are litigated more frequently than efficient laws, and hence are more likely to be overturned. However, the preferences of judges also necessarily affect legal change. This paper models the interaction of these two forces to evaluate the efficiency claim, and then applies the conclusions to the evolution of accident law in the United States beginning in the 19th century. Specifically, it attributes the persistence of negligence to its efficiency properties, despite its having been initially selected by judges for a different reason. The paper relates legal evolution to biological evolution by employing the concepts of natural and artificial selection, and the more recent concept of exaptation.","Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Miceli, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",Thomas.Miceli@UConn.edu,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This may be linked, among other things, to the growing role of commodities as an alternative investment instrument at times of excess liquidity and low interest rates on global markets. This analysis examines monthly data from January 1982 to September 2010. Since 2002 the direction of the relationship in the Granger causality sense has been from the dollar exchange rate to the oil price. A weakening of the dollar of 1% causes the Brent oil price to rise by 2.1%. The contrary movements in the Brent oil price and the dollar exchange rate are a factor dampening the impact of sharp fluctuations in the dollar price of oil on non-dollar economies, including the Czech Republic. This dampening effect was clearly visible in the period of sharp oil price growth in 2007 and 2008.","Czech Natl Bank, External Econ Relat Div, Prague 11503 1, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank,"Novotny, F (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, External Econ Relat Div, Prikope 28, Prague 11503 1, Czech Republic.",Filip.Novotny@cnb.cz,,,,,,,19,19,20,0,24,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

LIMEW is different in scope from the official U.S. Census Bureau measure of gross money income (MI) in that our measure includes non-cash transfers, public consumption, imputed income from wealth, and household production and nets out personal taxes. While the annual growth rates of median LIMEW and MI are very close over the whole period (0.67 and 0.63 percent), median LIMEW grew much faster than median MI after 1982 and much slower before. The Gini coefficient of MI is uniformly higher than that of LIMEW but both show about the same change from 1959 to 2007. Decomposition analysis shows that changes in inequality are driven to a large extent by non-home wealth in LIMEW and earnings in MI. While the racial gap in MI declined somewhat over the 1990s and 2000s, the racial gap in LIMEW actually widened a bit. Over the same years, while there was little change in the gap in MI between the elderly and non-elderly, the LIMEW of the elderly actually overtook that of the non-elderly.","[Wolff, Edward N.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Wolff, EN (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.",edward.wolff@nyu.edu,"Masterson, Thomas/W-6052-2019","Masterson, Thomas/0000-0003-1492-221X",,,,,35,5,7,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We further show that it is also responsible for the emergence of development traps in economies that otherwise would be characterized by unique equilibria. These results explain the conflicting evidence emerging from the recent empirical studies of the effects of bank competition on economic growth. We obtain them developing a dynamic, general equilibrium model of capital accumulation where banks operate in a Cournot oligopoly. More banks lead to a higher quantity of credit available to entrepreneurs, but also to diminished incentives to offer relationship services that improve the likelihood of success of investment projects. We also show that conditioning on one key parameter resolves the theoretical ambiguity: in economies where intrinsic market uncertainty is high (low), less (more) competition leads to higher capital accumulation.

Our theoretical model, in which an aid-recipient government, operating in an institutional environment of some given quality (making choices over the distribution of aid), predicts that a negative effect of aid volatility on growth is mitigated by stronger institutional quality. We use panel data covering the period 1984-2004 for 78 countries to test this theoretical prediction. Using Generalised Methods of Moments (GMM) we find the relationship between growth and aid volatility is significantly negative and depends on institutional quality.

Our results show that the overall speed of regional convergence in Russia, being slow by international standards, becomes even slower after controlling for spatial effects. However, when accounting for spatial regimes, we find a strong regional convergence among high-income regions located near other high-income regions.

Additionally, the linear scheme attracts demotivated, underconfident workers who perform below their ability.

We take advantage of a detailed household survey and analyze what matters and for whom. The three issues that matter most for measurement of household enterprise ROA are the choice of accrual versus cash income, the treatment of household labor in enterprise income, and the treatment of non-factor income. This sensitivity matters most for a poorer region dominated by cultivation relative to a richer region with non-farm enterprises. Though the choice between accrued and cash income matters less when the frequency of the data declines, there remains high sensitivity in annualized data.

Within a micro-meso framework, the model focuses on the influence of firms' labour choices (institutional settings) on industry dynamics, taking into account the existence of employment adjustment costs. The consideration of endogenous matching and bargaining processes in the labour market results in significant frictions, such as the simultaneous coexistence of unfilled job vacancies and unemployment. In a setting where technological progress is not biased a stylized fact of industrialized world economies in the last few decades emerges, the increasing wage inequality. Additionally, turbulence in the industry increases after a negative demand shock. As expected, the negative demand shock causes a decrease in the number of vacancies and, consequently, unemployment rates increase considerably. Interestingly, and mimicking the recent experiences of countries such as US, Spain, Greece and Portugal, the rise in unemployment is matched by a rise in contractual wages.

How do internal uncertainty associated with the task environment and external uncertainty arising from market volatility impact organization design? 2. What are the relationships among various elements of organization design: delegation of decision-making, incentives, monitoring, and internal labor market practices (promotion, training, employment security)? We expand on Prendergast (2002a), who challenged the conventional view of a tradeoff between risk and incentives, and build a single unified framework for answering our two research questions. Using a uniquely rich dataset that contains detailed information about the task environment of core employees and organization design at the individual, group and firms levels in 530 Minnesota firms in the mid 1990s, we first find support for Prendergast's key argument that internal uncertainty (over which employees have control) affects directly the allocation of decision-making and only indirectly incentives (via allocation of decision-making). This confirms similar findings by Foss and Laursen (2005), DeVaro and Kurtulus (2010) and Shi (2011). We also find that internal uncertainty has much impact on organization design through the choice of delegation of decision-making at the employee level, less so at the group level, and very little at the firm level, whereas external (market) uncertainty has little effect on organization design, especially at the individual and group level. Decision-making, monitoring, various internal labor market practices and incentives are strongly related to each other through substitution and complementarity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This is because footloose investors of dirty industries tend to relocate to pollution havens of the developing world. However when pollutant is transboundary (as in the case of greenhouse gases), the source country's incentive to relocate and the recipient country's willingness to host such industries are not straightforward. This article studies the relationship between FDI and environmental regulation using a North-South market share game model in a two-country setting, when pollution is transboundary. Contrary to the pollution haven hypothesis, our model shows that if market sizes of the two countries are small, FDI will raise the emission standard of the host country, resulting in a race-to-the-top phenomenon; but if market sizes are large enough, FDI will not change the emission standard of the South (from its laxest form), a finding that is consistent with the regulatory chill argument. Equilibrium FDI is contingent on the fixed cost of FDI, as the traditional proximity-concentration tradeoff theory predicts.","[Dong, Baomin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Dong, Baomin; Gong, Jiong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xin] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada",Zhejiang University; University of International Business & Economics; University of Toronto,"Dong, BM (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",baomindong@uibe.edu.cn; johngong@gmail.com; xinzhao1985@hotmail.com,"Dong, Baomin/AAV-7741-2021","Dong, Baomin/0000-0002-4787-021X; Zhao, Xin/0000-0003-3103-8688",,,,,46,104,119,5,124,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

To do this, I construct an input-output model economy in which firms produce gross output by means of a production function in capital, labor, and intermediate goods. This production function is subject, together with the standard neutral technical change, to intermediates-biased technical change. Positive (negative) intermediates-biased technical change implies a decline (increase) in the elasticity of gross output with respect to intermediate goods. In equilibrium, this elasticity appears as an explicit part of TFP in the value added aggregate production function. In particular, when the elasticity of gross output with respect to intermediates increases, aggregate TFP declines. I use the model to quantify the impact of intermediates-biased technical change for measured TFP growth in Italy. The exercise shows that intermediates-biased technical change can account for the productivity slowdown observed in Italy from 1994 to 2004.","Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Moro, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ, Viale St Ignazio 17, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",amoro@unica.it,,,,,,,26,16,16,2,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

However, in many social interactions, individuals face the environments in both games simultaneously: for example we are often engaged in charitable donations to strangers, as well as reciprocal exchange with family members and colleagues. As giving in one game could be prioritised over giving in the other, it is important to have participants play both as a dictator in the dictator game and as a trustee in a trust game simultaneously. The results indicate that when the recipient in the dictator game is significantly poorer relative to the dictator, the dictator tends to return an amount to the trustor such that the trustor neither makes a loss nor profit from trusting. This suggests that the presence of a sufficiently strong incentive to make transfers as a dictator may completely crowd-out any monetary returns to trust. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The first part of the story begins in 1928 and ends, with the publication of Yasui's classic on Kaldor, Hicks and Goodwin, in 1953, and Hudson's classic of 1957. But there were other classics in the 1930s. even within some theories of the business cycles of the time - particularly the Austrian and that which may now be called the time-to-build tradition, which originates in Marx and Aftalion, independently, and reaches its nonlinear formalization origins in Tinbergen's work of 1931, followed by Kalecki's theories of the business cycle, substantially influenced also by Tinbergen's classic for mathematical method. There is also what may, for want of a better name, be called the cobweb tradition, on the one hand, and the tradition of Swedish Sequence Analysis, on the other (especially in the 1937 classic work of Lundberg, summarising the Swedish discussion on business cycle theory). The former having its origins, partly, in Austrian inspired search for an integration of dynamic method with equilibrium economic theory (especially represented by a series of classics by Rosenstein-Rodan, from about 1929); and partly in the well known phenomenon of lagged responses in the supply-demand interactions in agricultural and commodity markets, particularly elegantly formalised by Leontief in 1934. From the point of view of economic theory, they were all part of the emerging consensus on the need to incorporate money and fluctuations in non-trivial ways as intrinsic components of orthodox equilibrium economic theory which was characterised as static theory. The implication was that the search was for a synthesis of dynamic method with traditional static equilibrium economic theory. The origins of macroeconomic theory, generally attributed to the post-depression development of monetary theory, business cycle theory and the theory of policy; could be traced to this particular search for a synthesis and was brilliantly summarised by Kuznets in a series of pioneering contributions in 1929-30. The story we try to tell is of mathematical business cycle theory in its non-linear modes, and how it emerged from one strand of macroeconomic theory, which, as just mentioned, was itself being forged, ab initio, dynamically.","[Ragupathy, Venkatachalam] Univ Trent, Fac Econ, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Velupillai, Kumaraswamy Vela] Univ Trent, Dipartimento Econ, I-38122 Trento, Italy",University of Trento; University of Trento,"Ragupathy, V (通讯作者)，Univ Trent, Fac Econ, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",rpathy@gmail.com; k.velupillai@unitn.it,,,,,,,102,7,7,0,18,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Surprisingly very few empirical studies have been conducted so far except by Kuga (1967). This fact implies that few people have ever tried to perform any empirical research to study whether the two-sector and multisector optimal growth models could explain the economic development properly based on the empirical data. Although we witnessed fairly active theoretical research on two-sector and multisector growth models in the 1990s and recent years, R. M. Solow has thrown doubt on the capital intensities [in Philippe Aghion and Steven Durlauf (eds.), Handbook of Economic Growth, Vol. 1A (2005, pp. 3-10)]. Our purpose is to measure the capital intensities of the consumption good and the investment good sectors mainly in the postwar Japanese economy, and also in other OECD countries. By so doing, we will demonstrate that the capital intensity does matter and our empirical evidence will strongly support the common assumption that the consumption goods sector is more capital-intensive than the capital goods sector.","[Takahashi, Harutaka; Mashiyama, Koichi] Meiji Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088636, Japan; [Sakagami, Tomoya] Kumamoto Gakuen Univ, Kumamoto, Japan",,"Takahashi, H (通讯作者)，Meiji Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Minato Ku, 1-2-37 Shirokanedai, Tokyo 1088636, Japan.",haru@eco.meijigakuin.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22530187] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,23,18,19,3,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The usual endogeneity problems related to estimating peer effects are addressed by using the dismissal of scientists by the Nazi government in 1933 as a source of exogenous variation in the peer group of scientists staying in Germany. To investigate localized peer effects, I construct a new panel data set covering the universe of scientists at the German universities from 1925 to 1938 from historical sources. I find no evidence for peer effects at the local level.

The paper proposed the now familiar Cobb-Douglas function as a mathematical representation of the relationship between capital, labor, and output. The paper's innovation, however, was not the function itself, which had originally been proposed by Knut Wicksell, but the use of the function as the basis of a statistical procedure for estimating the relationship between inputs and output. The paper's least squares regression of the log of the output-to-capital ratio in manufacturing on the log of the labor-to-capital ratio-the first Cobb-Douglas regression-was a realization of Douglas's innovative vision that a stable relationship between empirical measures of inputs and outputs could be discovered through statistical analysis, and that this stable relationship could cast light on important questions of economic theory and policy. This essay provides an account of the introduction of the Cobb-Douglas regression: its roots in Douglas's own work and in trends in economics in the 1920s, its initial application to time series data in the 1927 paper and Douglas's 1934 book The Theory of Wages, and the early reactions of economists to this new empirical tool.","Michigan State Univ E Lansing, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Biddle, J (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ E Lansing, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",biddle@msu.edu,,,,,,,30,20,21,0,20,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using an original micro-level public finance panel data from Senegal, we address three issues: (1) Does the Senegalese allocation system of fiscal transfers conform to the guidance of normative theory, in particular, to the equity principle? (2) Does this allocation system eliminate politically motivated targeting of transfers? (3) If not, what kind of political factors explain the horizontal allocation of fiscal resources? By rigorously estimating panel data for 67 local governments (communes) from 1997 to 2009, our results tend to show that equity concerns do not affect the allocation of intergovernmental grants in Senegal, leading to the conclusion that the resources distribution system does not comply with the dictates of normative theory. Moreover, we find evidence that political considerations influence the horizontal allocation of transfers. In particular, our analysis suggests that the distribution of central resources follows pattern of tactical redistribution more than patronage, swing communes being targeted while partisan communes are not.","Univ Auvergne, CERDI CNRS, Dept Econ, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Caldeira, E (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI CNRS, Dept Econ, 65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",emilie.caldeira@u-clermont1.fr,,,,,,,50,14,14,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

A recurrent concern is the effect of observable environmental factors that are beyond the influence of firms and unobserved factors that are not identifiable on measured cost and quality performance of firms. This paper analyses the effect of observed geographic and weather factors and unobserved heterogeneity on a set of 128 Norwegian electricity distribution utilities for the 2001-2004 period. We utilise data on 78 geographic and weather variables to identify real economic inefficiency while controlling for observed and unobserved heterogeneity. We use the Factor Analysis technique to reduce the number of environmental factors into few composite variables and to avoid the problem of multicollinearity. In order to identify firm-specific inefficiency, we then estimate a pooled version of the established stochastic frontier model of Aigner et al. (1977) and the recent true random effects model of Greene (2004; 2005a,b) without and with environmental variables. The results indicate that the observed environmental factors have a rather limited influence on the utilities' average efficiency and the efficiency rankings. Moreover, the difference between the average efficiency scores and the efficiency rankings among the pooled and the true random effects models imply that the type of SFA model used is highly influencing the efficiency estimates.

We start by characterizing perfect risk-sharing and find that it requires state-dependent consumption claims which depend only on the exogenous shock realizations. We show then that the recursive competitive equilibrium of any overlapping generations economy with weakly more than three generations is not strongly stationary., This then allows us to show directly that there are short-run Pareto improvements possible in terms of risk-sharing and hence, that the recursive competitive equilibrium is not Pareto optimal. We then show that a financial reform which eliminates the equity asset and replaces it with zero net supply insurance contracts (Arrow securities) will implement to Pareto optimal stochastic steady-state known to exist in the model. Finally, we also show via numerical simulations that a system of government taxes and transfers can lead to a Pareto improvement over the competitive equilibrium in the model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The interrelationship between Taiwan Real Estate Investment Trusts (T-REITs) and the aggregate equity markets and segmented industries has drawn the interests of both investors and academia. This paper employs Toda and Yamamoto's (1995) procedure and the generalized impulse response approach to uncover the extent and the magnitude of the relationship between T-REITs and aggregate and segmented stock prices. We collected daily data of the first two issued T-REITs, Fubon No.1 and Cathay No. 1, from March 2005 to March 2010 and October 2005 to March 2010, respectively, to examine their causal relationships with aggregate stock markets, the financial sector, and the construction sector. The empirical results indicate that all variables have break points, reflecting shocks from the Subprime Mortgage Crisis or deregulation of the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors (QDII) for Mainland Chinese to invest in Taiwan. We also discover that an individual T-REIT may lead or lag behind stock price indices due to its capitalization scale or business type. The transitory initial impacts of innovations in T-REITs on stock price indices are observed herein. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

If retailers conjecture that identical competing manufacturers always offer identical contracts (symmetric beliefs), manufacturers choose vertical separation in equilibrium. Even with private contracts, vertically separated manufacturers reduce competition and increase profits by inducing less aggressive behaviour by retailers in the final market. Manufacturers profits may be higher with private than with public contracts. Our results hold both with price and with quantity competition and do not hinge on retailers beliefs being perfectly symmetric.

Given the observed decline of the labor share in recent decades, this paper relaxes these assumptions, proposes a time-series calculation of the aggregate price mark-up reflecting the degree of imperfect competition in the product market, and provides estimates of the elasticity of substitution under such product market imperfections. We focus on Spain and the US and show that the elasticity of substitution is above one in Spain and below one in the US. We also show that the price markup drives the elasticity of substitution away from one, upwards in Spain, downwards in the US.

I show that, although there is Bertrand competition for advertisers, platforms obtain positive margins in the advertising market. In addition, platforms' profits can increase in the users' nuisance costs of advertising. As a general insight, I obtain that factors affecting competition in the user market in a well-known direction without externalities now have opposing effects due to competition in the advertiser market. The model can also explain why private TV platforms benefit if their public rivals are regulated to advertise less-a result at odds with models in which there is no competition for advertisers.

The consumers, lacking confidence in their knowledge of the stochastic environment, endogenously tilt their subjective probability model away from an approximating probability model. The government, though, is confident that the approximating probability model characterizes the stochastic environment. This confidence dichotomy reveals a range of possible objective functions for an altruistic government. I assume that the government maximizes the consumers' expected utility under the consumers' own subjective probability model. It is found that this government relies less heavily on labor taxes to absorb the fiscal shock than would be optimal if consumers were fully confident in their probability model. This policy helps mitigate the direct welfare cost associated with consumer uncertainty. I compare this policy to the one implemented by a government that maximizes the consumers' expected utility under the approximating probability model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, tensions are rising regarding Germany's responsibilities and opportunities as a member of the European Monetary Union. Other studies have documented the difficulties that Germany has encountered as a result of the unification and further integration of Europe. This paper adds to that literature by using an aggregate translog cost function approach to examine the relationships among inputs of domestic capital and labour and imports. Our findings indicate that the input pairs of capital-labour and labour-imports are substitutes. The substitutes relationship between labour and imports, which has become stronger over time, suggests that increasing globalisation will add to Germany's unemployment woes. Capital and imports appear to be weak complements, but that relationship is not statistically significant. The results also suggest that imports are playing an increasingly important role in Germany's aggregate production, accentuating the role of the international environment.","[Truett, Lila J.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Truett, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, 1 UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",lila.truett@utsa.edu,,"Truett, Lila/0000-0002-6976-2324",,,,,64,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

This latter can be thought of as a second best adaptation to the forces of natural selection and can also be an evolutionary stable strategy so that it is here to stay as seems to be supported by several psychological experiments. But once confirmatory bias is at work it is quite clear that economic agents in general or scientists in particular do not act as perfectly rational in the sense that they do no mimic the behavior of a Bayesian statistician. This combination has yielded three main results. First honest and open, power-free, conversations may not preclude systematic error in appreciation of theories. Therefore the moral constraint supposedly operating on the opinions of scientists might not be binding in the sense that their opinions might look completely anarchistic. Second the social constraint might also be not binding because each scientist opinion carries the same weight regardless of fame or honor, a very postmodern situation. Third, one can be a supporter of the correspondence theory of truth, one can have no doubts about the existence of an independent underlying real world and yet one might be obliged to accept that an honest and informed conversation may lead to the acceptance of false theories.","Fdn Urrutia Elejalde, Madrid 28010, Spain",,"Elejalde, JU (通讯作者)，Fdn Urrutia Elejalde, Fortuny 37, Madrid 28010, Spain.",juelejalde@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

We analyze policy interventions that increase the public good level at subscription equilibria, and show that some of the standard results of the neutrality literature do not survive in our model with many private goods and relative price effects allowed. First, we show that a redistribution away from a contributor or even a decrease in the total wealth of all contributors (while the contributing set of agents remains intact) can lead to an increase in the provided level of public good. Moreover, we prove that increasing the production of public good is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition to increase all households' welfare. Finally, we present. conditions under which, for a generic set of economies, well chosen interventions will Pareto improve upon a given subscription equilibrium outcome. As a consequence, a general non-neutrality result in terms of utilities holds even if all households are contributors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Using general demand and cost functions, we show that a cable operator's decision to bundle maximizes total producer surplus if the cable operator's bargaining power is sufficiently high, and that a cable operator in a weak bargaining position might strategically choose to unbundle viewer channels in order to enhance its bargaining position with individual program suppliers, even when this decision reduces total surplus. It is, therefore, plausible that regulations to cap market share or impose a la carte on cable operators may reduce total surplus, and absent offsetting increases in consumer welfare, such policy measures may reduce total welfare. Under more restrictive conditions, we extend the analysis and show that consumer and social welfare under bundling or a la carte depends on both bargaining power and advertising rates. Our results imply a monopolist does not necessarily increase deadweight loss, and under certain circumstances a monopolist's bargaining outcomes yield higher social welfare.","[Adilov, Nodir] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ Ft Wayne, Ft Wayne, IN USA; [Cunningham, Brendan M.] USN Acad, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA",Purdue University System; Indiana University Purdue University Fort Wayne; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; United States Naval Academy,"Adilov, N (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Purdue Univ Ft Wayne, Ft Wayne, IN USA.",nodir.adilov@gmail.com; peter.alexander@gmail.com; bcunning@usna.edu,,"Adilov, Nodir/0000-0002-9616-0433",,,,,16,3,4,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The findings are consistent with the conventional wisdom that concomitant liberalisation of trade and investment regimes, accompanied by creating a congenial environment for market-based decision making by the private agents, is vital for reaping developmental gains from FDI. During the 1990s growth of employment in firms with foreign capital participation lagged behind output growth, reflecting the capital-intensity bias in domestic-market-oriented production in a partially liberalised economy. This pattern has changed notably in recent years as the product mix gradually became export oriented in response to further liberalisation of trade and investment policy regimes.","[Athukorala, Prema-chandra] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Tran Quang Tien] Cent Women Training Sch Vietnam, Hanoi, Vietnam",Australian National University,"Athukorala, PC (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",prema-chandra.athukorala@anu.edu.au,"Tran, Tien Quang/AAI-5768-2020","Tran, Tien Quang/0000-0002-2527-277X",,,,,32,22,22,3,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The importance attached to competitive balance is predicated on the belief that it is uncertainty about the outcomes of sporting contests that attracts spectators and sponsors. In a perfectly balanced competition, each team would have an equal chance of winning each match and, therefore, of winning the championship or the league. By contrast, the absence of competitive balance would mean that the results of sporting contests would become predictable and attendance at sporting contests would suffer. The general theme that underpins the issue of competitive balance is that of inequality. This article proposes a general measure of competitive balance based on the Generalized Entropy (GE) approach to measuring inequality and shows how this might be interpreted in terms of the league's welfare. The measures are applied to results from 2006 to 2007 season of the English Premier League (EPL).","[Borooah, Vani K.] Univ Ulster, Sch Econ, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, North Ireland; [Mangan, John] Univ Queensland, Dept Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Ulster University; University of Queensland,"Borooah, VK (通讯作者)，Univ Ulster, Sch Econ, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, North Ireland.",VK.Borooah@ulster.ac.uk,,,,,,,20,22,23,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I argue that declining trade costs are an important explanation for these facts. I present a three stage vertical specialization trade model, with raw materials, manufactured parts and final goods sectors. In the simulated model, falling trade costs explain much of the observed growth in overall and VS trade. Manufacturing trade grows twice as fast as overall trade. Raw materials trade was more important in the 1960s when trade costs were high, since their production is more strongly linked to endowments than manufacturing. Therefore, materials will be traded even when trade costs are high. Trade costs have fallen more for manufactured goods over the last 40 years, leading to a rapid expansion of manufactured parts trade relative to materials.

A monopolist targets a parsimonious set of nodes that informs all consumers either directly or by word-of-mouth. A duopolist faces a tradeoff between this efficient targeting and possible preemption by a competitor's message. Under gentle price competition, duopolists saturate the network when messages are cheap, and target sets similar to the monopolist's when messages are costly. Under fierce price competition, duopolists' messages segment the network in an intermingled patchwork.

The econometric methodology follows the cross-country studies by Barro (1991) and Kandiero and Chitiga (2003) with empirical application to a panel of 36 African countries observed over the period 1980 to 2009. Panel regressions are carried out using the fixed-effects models. The aim is to provide an empirical evidence for the driving force of Africa's economic growth. The results illustrate that openness in trade and investment is positively related to economic growth significantly. However, foreign aid, gross national savings and investment have negative relationships to both Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and GDP. Using South Africa as benchmark, the regional performance indicates that North Africa is the best one in generating positive GDP growth from Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), followed by Middle Africa whilst East Africa and West Africa compete for the third and fourth positions.","[Chang, Ching-Cheng] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Mendy, Michael] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan University,"Chang, CC (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, 128,Sec 2,Yen Chiou Yuan Rd, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",emily@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,10,41,51,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The advantage of this approach is that it provides a coherent framework to identify the deterministic trend growth component and also the productivity enhancing (or technology related) stochastic components.

We analyse the impact on productivity growth of technological externalities, both inter- and intraindustry, national or international, at the industry level for the EU countries and the period 1995-2002. The results confirm the advisability of considering international externalities when countries are taken as regions, whose omission underestimates national spillovers. Together with national endowments and a central geographical position, the growth of productivity is encouraged by national and international specialization as a general result; moreover, it is fuelled by stronger interindustry spillovers and productive diversification, a result more evident for high technology industries, while lower technology industries are more sensitive to the omission of international externalities. Economic integration seems to be relevant, because supranational regions with less friction for goods and factor movements are more likely to take advantage of external economies as a mechanism of productivity growth and agglomeration.","[Domeque Claver, N.] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Struct & Econ Hist & Publ Econ, Huesca 22001, Spain; [Fillat Castejon, C.] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Struct & Econ Hist & Publ Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Sanz Gracia, F.] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Claver, ND (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Struct & Econ Hist & Publ Econ, Plaza Constituc S-N, Huesca 22001, Spain.",ndomeque@unizar.es,,"Sanz Gracia, Fernando/0000-0003-3725-0022; Domeque Claver, Nuria/0000-0001-9331-5092",,,,,39,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Which one is preferred over the other depends largely, on the relative importance of state dependence and heterogeneity in household purchase decision and behaviour on desired commodity over time. In this article, this issue is investigated for household purchases of fluid milk products using a panel data dynamic Tobit model. The proposed econometric model accounts not only for state dependence and heterogeneity of the purchasing process, but also for the censoring or sample selectivity encountered when using household survey data. Empirical findings show that state dependence is negative and household heterogeneity over milk persists over time implying that advertising efforts aimed at increasing milk consumption would be more effective than short-term price promotions. The results also suggest that advertising efforts should concentrate on attracting new purchasers and increasing purchase frequencies for fluid milk products.","[Dong, Diansheng] USDA, ERS, FED, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Schmit, Todd M.; Kaiser, Harry] Cornell Univ, AEM, Ithaca, NY USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Cornell University,"Dong, DS (通讯作者)，USDA, ERS, FED, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",ddong@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that the power of focal labels, when attached to the Pareto-efficient strategy, to promote efficiency critically depends upon the alternative strategy's label salience. When the relative salience of our focal labels is considerably weaker, focal labels mostly fail to raise expected efficiency beyond the mixed-strategy prediction. But when the relative salience of our focal labels is markedly stronger, focal labels raise expected efficiency much beyond the mixed-strategy prediction.

New strategies, valued decisions, new ways of thinking are implied in business. But there are some traditional viewpoints to business which creates added value. One of them is entrepreneurship. The phenomenon is known from the times than business was not so much researched as now is. The value and meaning of this phenomenon is important and even growing. Entrepreneurship can be described by the features of its expression. These features in the article are crystallized from theoretical research works on entrepreneurship and the whole of them reflects the modern concept of entrepreneurship in an enterprise nowadays. Development of features of entrepreneurship's expression strongly depends on the economic and society transformations. The features encounter economic, managerial, social cohesion and technological activities in the enterprise. As the theoretical analysis allowed to identify and to ground the features of entrepreneurship's expression in an enterprise, an empirical analysis of the development of features is important and useful in practice. Entrepreneurship is tightly connected with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Expression of entrepreneurship is more intensive in SMEs. Important support for SMEs is structural funding from the European Union (EU). Financial support goes under appropriate priorities, there is often declared that innovative entrepreneurial SMEs have to be supported in the documents. So, possible expression of entrepreneurship and its features is researched in this article in this kind of projects supported by the European Commission (EC) as to clarify how the concept of entrepreneurship is understood by the experts valuating projects and giving funding for the SMEs. The other part of empirical research is based on the Lithuanian enterprises, treated as innovative. Such environment as a science park could give the appropriate conditions to the enterprises for implying and developing entrepreneurship. So, interviewing enterprises of Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) Regional Science Park might disclose the view of business practitioners to the expression of entrepreneurship. They could value the features of entrepreneurship's expression from innovative SMEs attitude. Empirical research methods: content analysis of SMEs supporting projects; interview of experts (managerial staff) of enterprises of KTU Regional Science Park. The research results conclude that development of the features of entrepreneurship's expression depends on economic transformations, also is related with new innovation, technologies, and knowledge used. The pressure of competitors makes impact on activity directly. The society pressure raises conditions for social features' development. The consolidated features of entrepreneurship's expression are meaningful and important as well as newly developed features.","[Greblikaite, Jolita; Krisciunas, Kestutis] Kaunas Univ Technol, Inst Europe, LT-44320 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Greblikaite, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Inst Europe, Kestucio Str 8, LT-44320 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jolita.greblikaite@ktu.lt; kestutis.krisciunas@ktu.lt,"Greblikaite, Jolita/N-5493-2014; Greblikaite, Jolita/AAC-7042-2020","Greblikaite, Jolita/0000-0001-8327-1583",,,,,29,5,6,1,44,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We show that unsynchronized wage adjustment via a relative wage effect can both lower the required degree of increasing returns for indeterminacy to a plausible level and make it invariant to the relative risk aversion in labor. Consequently, indeterminacy and sunspot-driven fluctuations can emerge for plausible increasing returns regardless of the relative risk aversion in labor.

This paper uses historical census data since 1951 and two recent Labor Force Surveys to investigate the impact of international trade openness on gender differences in labor force participation rates in broad occupational categories in Pakistan. The method used controls for average gender differences in these occupational categories and the unobserved factors that affect male and female labor force participation rates equally. The estimates indicate that increased international trade significantly reduces the gap between male and female labor force participation on average across all occupations. However, if responses are allowed to vary across seven broad occupational categories, the estimates suggest that the significant relative increases in female labor force participation are concentrated in agriculture and other primary occupations.","[Hyder, Asma] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Hyder, Asma; Behrman, Jere R.] Univ Penn, Ctr Populat Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; University of Pennsylvania,"Hyder, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan.",asmahyder@nbs.edu.pk,"Hyder, Asma/F-9670-2010; Hyder, Asma/ABI-3714-2020; Behrman, Jere R/A-9734-2009","Hyder, Asma/0000-0001-5738-1375;",,,,,25,8,8,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Two alternative market mechanisms have recently been designed to organize the allocation of scarce transmission capacity at cross-border level: (i) the implicit auction, already used in some countries, and (ii) the coordinated explicit auction, proposed by the European Transmission System Operators (ETSO) but not yet implemented. The main advantage of the explicit auction is that it allows each country to keep its own power exchange running. In the European institutional context, this is seen as a factor of success of a market reform, although the explicit auction (not coordinated) is known to be less efficient than the implicit mechanism. The addition of a coordination dimension in the explicit auction is intended to solve problems of international flows. We use the experimental methodology to identify and compare in a laboratory setting the efficiency properties of these two market mechanisms, given a market structure similar to the existing one in continental Europe, i.e. a competitive oligopoly. Our main result highlights the inefficiency of the coordinated explicit auction compared to the performance of the implicit auction, measured in terms of both energy prices and transmission capacity allocation. We suggest that the poor performance of the coordinated explicit auction in the laboratory is due to the level of individual expectations about both energy and transmission prices that the mechanism demands. One solution to resolve this problem when the mechanism is implemented in the field would be to design an additional and secondary market for used transmission capacity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Rather than a polarized dichotomy of linear and strictly concave, differentiable benefit (felicity) functions, we develop the theory in the context of functions that are supported at the golden-rule consumption and are not necessarily concave. Through a non-interiority condition on the set of zeroes of a resulting discrepancy function, we show the equivalence of finitely-maximal, maximal, minimal value-loss and optimal programs, and thereby answer questions left open by Brock and Mitra. Our synthesizing criterion is new to the capital theory literature, and in the concave setting, proves to be necessary and sufficient for the asymptotic convergence of good programs.

The empirical approach utilizes the Ordered Generalized Extreme Value (OGEV) model which embodies differing utility functions across occupational outcomes, as well as accounting for any ordering in these outcomes. The results suggest that the transferability of knowledge and skills is affected by cultural and social backgrounds, and that non-Western immigrants are disproportionately channelled into inferior jobs post migration. The investigation of the country-of-origin effect on the skilled migrants' occupational transition process is especially apt in the context of skill shortages in many host countries.","[Kostenko, Weiping] Monash Univ, Fac Educ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Harris, Mark; Zhao, Xueyan] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University; Monash University,"Kostenko, W (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Fac Educ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",weiping.kostenko@monash.edu,"Harris, Mark/O-5084-2015","Harris, Mark/0000-0002-1804-4357; Zhao, Xueyan/0000-0002-5096-8787",,,,,31,16,18,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The model is based on Pindyck's inventory model of commodity price dynamics. We show that asymmetry in gasoline price dynamics is caused by changes in the net marginal convenience yield: higher costs of marketing and storage lead to rising gasoline prices, whereas a drop in these costs lowers gasoline prices. The former effect is stronger. This indicates asymmetric dynamics. We also analyze the asymmetry across the sample by analyzing recursive and rolling regressions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We apply the newly developed ARDL bounds testing approach to examine this linkage in a trivariate setting. Contrary to the results of some previous studies, our results show a distinct unidirectional causal flow from oil prices to economic growth in South Africa. In addition, our results show that oil consumption Granger-causes both economic growth and oil prices without any feedback. Given the deterrent effect of oil prices on economic growth and the fact that South Africa has adopted inflation targeting as its policy anchor, we recommend monetary policies should be relaxed during the global oil price shocks in order to protect the country from any possible outcome of a full-blown stagflation scenario.","Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, UNISA, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Odhiambo, NM (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, UNISA, POB 392, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,8,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

It develops a Schumpeterian model of endogenous growth that incorporates an upstream resource-intensive sector and yields an analytical solution for the transition path. It then derives conditions under which, as the economy's endowment of a natural resource rises, (i) growth accelerates and welfare rises, (ii) growth decelerates but welfare rises nevertheless, and (iii) growth decelerates and welfare falls. Which of these scenarios prevails depends on the response of the natural resource price to an increase in the resource endowment. The price response determines the change in income earned by the owners of the resource (the households) and thereby the change in their expenditure on manufacturing goods. Since manufacturing is the economy's innovative sector, this income-to-expenditure effect links resource abundance to the size of the market for manufacturing goods and drives how re-source abundance affects incentives to undertake innovative activity.

The transactions the persons are making to buy things that make them survive (in all sort of ways) are making them 'poorer', diminishing the amount of money they have. The 'work and get paid' type of transactions are rebuilding the financial capacity of the persons. Describing this process as a diffusion equation, in a cylindrical geometry, results in a Bessel function J(0)(r) solution, which matches the density distribution of persons in Paris (as a typical circular pattern city). Moreover, a simple equation for the dynamic behavior of a city, on which a 365 days period is imposed, results in one week as the time after which persons have to be paid to restart transactions, in the case of prompt pay. Thus, the extension of the basic model of the city as a reactor of economic transactions, for the cases of control through insertion or absorption of money, lead to the description of the crisis with a strikingly good accuracy for the case of Romania in 2009. Moreover, considering the prompt and delayed pay case gives a change in the average time to replenish financial resources of persons from 7 to 30 days. Using neutron physics methods in describing the economic transactions environment opens an alternative view on the forecasting models of economic systems' behavior, and shows that the geographical dimension of a city is determined by the economic transaction behavior/environment in that city.","Acad Romana, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Purica, I (通讯作者)，Acad Romana, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",puricai@yahoo.com,"Purica, Ionut I./B-6532-2011",,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

I document three key facts: First, one-half to one-third of the population expects unemployment to rise when it is falling at the end of a recession, even though the VAR predicts the fall in unemployment. Second, more people expect unemployment to rise when it is falling at the end of a recession than expect it to rise when it is rising at the beginning of a recession even though the VAR predicts these changes. Finally, the lag change in unemployment is almost as important as the VAR forecast in predicting the fraction of the population that expects unemployment to rise. Professional forecasters do not exhibit these discrepancies. Least squares learning or real time expectations do little to help explain these facts. However, delayed updating of expectations can explain some of these facts, and extrapolative expectations explains these facts best. Individuals with higher income or education are only slightly less likely to have expectations which differ from the VAR, and those whose expect more unemployment when the VAR predicts otherwise are 8-10 percent more likely to believe it is a bad time to make a major purchase.","Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA",Brandeis University,"Tortorice, DL (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",tor-toric@brandeis.edu,,,,,,,18,12,12,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Empirical results show that there exists a single cointegration relationship between the swap rates and treasury rates for all maturities. The cointegration vector for the 2-, 3- and 4-year maturities is 1, showing that a 1% increase in the treasury rates will lead to a 1% increase in the swap rates. On the other hand, in the 5-, 7- and 10-year maturities, the cointegration vector is found to be more than 1, implying that a 1% increase in the treasury rates will lead to a more than 1% increase in the swap rates. Thus, a rise (decline) in the treasury rates is associated with a rise (decline) in the swap spread.","[Hamori, Shigeyuki] Kobe Univ, Fac Econ, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Toyoshima, Yuki] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Kobe University; Kobe University,"Hamori, S (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Fac Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",hamori@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Hamori, Shigeyuki/J-4877-2019","Hamori, Shigeyuki/0000-0003-1498-0188",,,,,15,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Using the novel panel-data handling proposed in this study, we demonstrate shifts in stability before/after the unification or split. The stability of split countries fell by 50% or more, showing that they were extremely unstable before the split.

I find that when a state's banking sector starts out with a low capital-asset ratio, its subsequent lending and output growth are both more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate or other indicators of monetary policy. This result is consistent with the existence of a 'bank capital channel' as well as a conventional bank lending channel. Other evidence favors the capital channel, as bank liquidity is not associated with variation in the impact of monetary policy on output at the state level. Consistent with the theory, the importance of state-level measures of bank capital weakens significantly after the removal of regulatory barriers to interstate banking.",,,,skander.j.vandenheuvel@frb.gov,,"Van den Heuvel, Skander/0000-0001-6370-1742",,,,,26,16,17,1,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Decomposing the volatility of sales of exporters between their domestic and export markets, I show using an identification strategy based on a firm-specific geographical instrument that firms with a larger export share have more volatile domestic sales and less volatile exports. These empirical patterns can be explained using a model in which firms face market-specific shocks and short-run convex costs of production. In such a framework, firms react to a shock in one market by adjusting their sales in the other market. I point to strong evidence that output variations on the domestic and export market are negatively correlated at the firm level. This result casts doubts on the standard hypothesis that firms face constant marginal costs and maximize profits on their different markets independently of each other. Furthermore, it points to the caveat that sales volatility on a particular market only gives limited information about the size of shocks on that market. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although public sector employment is perceived as safer and offering more benefits, we find that in Romania it also offers higher wages, after controlling for experience, education and gender. This result is at odds with the negative premium uncovered in other transition economies. The publicprivate wage premium is increasing across the wage distribution, leading to more inequality in the public sector. Decomposing the wage premium into the effect of personal characteristics, coefficients and residuals, we show that only about half of this premium can be attributed to personal characteristics, especially in the top half of the wage distribution. We also find that the number of other public sector employees in the family is a significant driver of public sector employment, facilitating access to jobs. However, the effects of self-selection are negligible, the premium being still positive and significant after controlling for this.","[Voinea, Liviu] Acad Econ Studies, Dept Int Relat, Bucharest, Romania; [Voinea, Liviu] Natl Sch Polit & Adm Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Mihaescu, Flaviu] Grp Appl Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Voinea, L (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Dept Int Relat, Bucharest, Romania.",liviu.voinea@gea.org.ro; flaviu.mihaescu@gmail.com,"Voinea, Liviu/C-4361-2011",,,,,,19,6,8,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

We find that the Keynesian aggregate demand model is better suited to analyse the link than the Feder-Ram model for the case of Sri Lanka. Based upon our results we expect a higher economic growth rate in Sri Lanka if more public resources are diverted from the defence to civilian sectors of the economy, now that the war between the government and separatist guerrillas has come to an end. However, recent post war events cast doubt upon whether a diversion of sources from military to non-military spending will actually occur. We conclude that the sanguine predictions of our economic analysis are entirely dependent upon the political decisions of the Sri Lankan government for their realization.","[Wijeweera, Albert] So Cross Univ, So Cross Business Sch, Gold Coast, Qld 4255, Australia; [Webb, Matthew J.] Petr Inst, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Southern Cross University; Khalifa University of Science & Technology,"Wijeweera, A (通讯作者)，So Cross Univ, So Cross Business Sch, Locked Bag 4 Coolangatta, Gold Coast, Qld 4255, Australia.",albert.wijeweera@scu.edu.au,,,,,,,49,9,9,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Each period studied have some similar distributions of key sectors, including the cores, i.e. chemical industry, nonmetallic mineral products, construction, business. However, significant differences also exists, for example, the 2005 system is characterized as higher degrees of systemic connection and hierarchy, while the 1990s system has looser density and less centralization. Additionally, the high tech clusters (i.e. electronics and instruments) including high tech industry (i.e. electronics and telecommunications equipment manufacturers) has played a much more important role in 2005 than that in early 1990s.

Economic crisis promotes internet-based communication and stimulates organizations to look for cheaper possibilities, i.e. to integrate social media into relations building, public relations and other activities. Recent theoretical and practical scientific studies emphasize the importance of the development of social media ideas and its integration into organizations' communication activities, which used in appropriate way, can help to reach the appointed results: to present and to sell services or goods, to build brand value or to maintain two-way relations with target audiences, etc. Social media is changing the traditional marketing paradigm and stimulates new attitudes toward relations between organizations and consumers, where information flows bilateral, direct and effectively, may be diffused in social networks by consumers' wishes and can help to strengthen organization positions in the market. Therefore scientists recommend organizations to appraise the value of every member of virtual communities and to communicate in correct way: adding value, helping to solve problems, educating and etc. The article concentrates on the attitude which organizations have to have for successful social media, implementation and achievement of organizational goals. Different departments of organization should be involved in more effective use of social media. Business organizations have to consider both positive and negative social media application aspects in order to avoid certain risks. The negative aspect of social media that is mostly appointed by scientists is the lack of control mechanism: message content, timing and frequency. In order to avoid the risks related with communication in social media organizations have to plan social media implementation process. The main objective of this research is to build up the structural model of communication in social media and to test the application perspectives of the model for study promotion in public higher education institutions. The result of theoretical analysis is an original model of communication in social media. The steps of the model implementation are: environment and competitors' analysis preparation of communication strategy, selection of appropriate channels, communication process, monitoring, assessment and comparison of results. The theoretical model of communication in social media includes not only the process of communication between the organization and consumers, but also the stages of preparation and assessment that are also important in the evaluation of implementation of the overall communication strategy. A case study of Lithuanian state higher education institutions was used to reveal the possible application of the suggested model of communication in social media in the promotion of higher education studies in social media. The communication of higher education institutions in social media is important since active involvement of prospective students in communication in social media can help prospective students to choose the university where he or she would like to study. Social media presents a university as live, communicating and caring about current and prospective students. The study on communication in social media by promoting studies at Lithuanian higher education institutions showed that the suggested model of communication in social media of business organizations can be successfully applied to the communication of universities in social media. The popularization of higher education institutions and involvement of prospective students should originate from environment analysis and planning as well as benefit assessment that may be gained by social media.","[Zailskaite-Jakste, Ligita; Kuvykaite, Rita] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Zailskaite-Jakste, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ligita.zailskaite@ktu.lt; rita.kuvykaite@ktu.lt,"Zailskaitė-Jakštė, Ligita/GPG-0986-2022","Zailskaitė-Jakštė, Ligita/0000-0003-3696-6520",,,,,45,20,32,2,93,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Although stochastic cost frontier and stochastic revenue frontier can potentially be used to describe a multi-output, multi-input production, these functions only allow the possibility of specifying a multi-product technology when price information is available and some required behavioral assumptions are satisfied. An alternative for cost or revenue function called distance functions was developed by Shephard (1953). Fare et al. (1993) first used parametric linear programming (PLP) approach to estimate a translog distance function. In 1996, Tim Coelli and Sergio Perelman (1996) applied this approach (called stochastic distance function frontier) to adjust the function form of stochastic frontier and make it suitable for multi-product analysis. Since then, the stochastic distance function frontier has begun to be widely used in particular applications. But, in all these studies, the stochastic distance function frontier approach required changing the function form and thus it made the influence of function assumption on results stronger. Some econometricians proposed that the distance function approach in handling multi-product stochastic frontier might introduce regressor endogeneity and induce estimator inconsistency in estimation. It is also proposed that Multi-output stochastic distance functions suffer from input-output separability and linear homogeneity in outputs. However, we can not observe any studies on Monte Carlo test of stochastic distance function frontier. The principle purpose of this study is to contribute to the methodology discussion of stochastic distance function frontier using Monte Carlo analysis for multi-product efficiency measurement. Thus, a Monte Carlo analysis for stochastic distance function frontier model was developed to test the asymptotic properties. The technology for the framework of stochastic distance function, used to overcome the criticisms related to the stochastic frontier approach, is specified as a translog function. Then, the basic method to estimate the stochastic frontier is provided and the maximum likelihood function is also given. In the Monte Carlo experiment, 1000 replications are set for analysis. The results show that, except for the scenario with equal outputs, stochastic distance function frontier will yield biased estimators even with large sample size. The 2-output model will give better estimators than 3-output model. An increasing sample size will improve the relative performance of ML estimations for stochastic distance function frontier. Therefore, the Monte Carlo analysis indicates the result that the stochastic distance function frontier is probably biased for multi-output production.","Macao Polytech Inst, Sch Publ Adm, Macau, Peoples R China",Macao Polytechnic University,"Zhang, T (通讯作者)，Macao Polytech Inst, Sch Publ Adm, Rua Luis Gonzaga Gomes, Macau, Peoples R China.",taozhang7608@hotmail.com,"ZHANG, TAO/K-3795-2019","ZHANG, TAO/0000-0002-2400-7624",,,,,26,9,9,1,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Secondly, in a panel data approach we estimate time-varying pass-through coefficients and explain their development with regard to various macroeconomic factors. Our results show that long-run pass-through is only partly observable and incomplete, whereas short-run pass-through shows a more unique character, although heterogeneity across product groups does exist. We are also able to identify several macroeconomic factors that determine changes in the degree of pass-through, which is especially relevant for policymakers.","[Beckmann, Joscha; Belke, Ansgar; Verheyen, Florian] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Beckmann, Joscha] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Beckmann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",joscha.beckmann@uni-due.de,"Beckmann, Joscha/J-4234-2019",,,,,,21,6,6,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Here, borrowing ideas from the mixture model literature, a new approach to assigning poverty-non poverty status is proposed which avoids specifying a frontier, the price is that an agent's poverty status is only determined to the extent of its chance of being poor. Invoking variants of Gibrat's law to give structure to the distribution of outcomes for homogeneous subgroups of a population within the context of a finite mixture model of societal outcomes facilitates calculation of an agent's poverty status probability. From this it is straightforward to calculate all the usual poverty measures as well as other characteristics of the poor and non poor subgroups in a society. These ideas are exemplified in a study of 47 countries in Africa over the recent quarter century which reveals among other things a growing poverty rate and a growing disparity between poor and non poor groups not identified by conventional methods.","[Anderson, Gordon] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Pittau, Maria Grazia; Zelli, Roberto] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat Sci, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Toronto; Sapienza University Rome,"Anderson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",anderson@chass.utoronto.ca; grazia.pittau@uniroma1.it; roberto.zelli@uniroma1.it,,"ZELLI, Roberto/0000-0002-1967-3470",,,,,43,8,9,0,20,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

We also study the case where access is provided at two different levels, and show that access provision at multiple levels can delay infrastructure building.

In their pure form these models assume consumers solve complex dynamic programming (DP) problems to determine optimal choices. For this reason, these models are best viewed as as it approximations to consumer behavior. In this paper we present an estimation method, based on Geweke and Keane (2000), which allows us to estimate dynamic models without solving a DP problem and without strong assumptions about how consumers form expectations about the future. The relatively low computational burden of this method allows us to nest the learning and inventory models. We also incorporate the price consideration mechanism of Ching et al. (2009), which essentially says that consumers may not pay attention to a category in every period. The resulting model may be viewed as providing a more realistic or descriptive account of consumer choice behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that, in our model, the degree of collusion (captured by the discount factor) reduces the incentive to innovate when innovation is made non-cooperatively. The reason is that non-cooperative R&D introduces a negative externality where firms overinvest beyond the effort required to minimize the cost in order to extract profits from the rival firm, and a reduction in product competition helps internalize the externality. In a research joint venture the absence of R&D rivalry leads to contrary results. The main implication is that the validity of the Schumpeterian hypotheses depends on the extent of cooperation at the R&D stage.","[Escrihuela-Villar, Marc] Univ Balearic Isl, Balearic Islands, Spain; [Guillen, Jorge] ESAN, Lima, Peru",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universidad ESAN,"Escrihuela-Villar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Balearic Isl, Balearic Islands, Spain.",,"; Escrihuela-Villar, Marc/H-6997-2015","Guillen, Jorge/0000-0002-4511-2108; Escrihuela-Villar, Marc/0000-0002-5119-2415",,,,,25,0,0,0,22,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

Understanding the extent and the sources of such disparity is then important to help formulate policies that aim at avoiding further conflict. This paper analyzes economic disparity between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in southern Kyrgyzstan. These groups were involved in violent clashes in the recent past. Using household survey data from 2005, we show that, in contrast to the public perception, Kyrgyz households have slightly higher expenditure than Uzbek households in urban areas and about the same level in rural areas. The gap in urban areas is mostly due to smaller households and higher education among the Kyrgyz. We also find that Uzbek households are better off than Kyrgyz households in terms of the value of housing property. We argue that the house value gap can be explained by the Uzbeks having larger houses, which are home to larger families and serve as a basis for running small businesses.

Unconditional as well as conditional stochastic dominance tests are performed by year, by household heads' characteristics (age, education, gender, health, marital status and occupation) and by household characteristics (household type, household size and degree of urbanization). Mean least squares regression techniques are used to predict conditional expectations. The residuals containing effects for each characteristic conditional on the remaining characteristics are then used for the stochastic dominance analysis employing extended Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of first-order and second-order dominance in distribution of income and consumption. The results provide a detailed and up-to-date picture of inequality and poverty by subgroup in Korea, which helps in targeting particularly vulnerable groups. While inequality in disposable income is found to be substantial, consumption inequality is less substantial. Households headed by the elderly, the uneducated, the divorced, the widowed, females, and those with health problems are found to be the most vulnerable groups.","[Heshmati, Almas] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Rudolf, Robert] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University; Korea University,"Rudolf, R (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",rrudolf@korea.ac.kr,,"Rudolf, Robert/0000-0003-1956-0457",,,,,32,5,5,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The inference is based on revealed preference approach selecting cost synergies that rationalize observed merger decisions. The estimates can be used to assess the total welfare impact of retrospective and counterfactual mergers. The framework is applied to estimate cost efficiencies after the 1996 deregulation of U.S. radio industry. Within the period of 1996 to 2006 the cost savings resulting from mergers amount to $1.2 billion per year (equally split across economies of scale and within-format cost synergies).,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Jeziorski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",przemekj@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,56,40,50,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Both parties care about voters' payoffs, but they have different beliefs about how policy choices will map into future economic outcomes. We show that when the incumbent party can endogenously influence whether learning occurs through its policy choices (policy experimentation), future political competition gives it a new incentive to distort its policies it manipulates them so as to reduce uncertainty and disagreement in the future, thus avoiding facing competitive elections with an opponent very different from itself. The model thus demonstrates that all incumbents can find it optimal to 'over experiment', relative to a counterfactual in which they are sure to be in power in both periods. We thus identify an incentive for strategic policy manipulation that does not depend on parties having conflicting objectives, but rather stems from their differing beliefs about the consequences of their actions.

I present a model of an agent who learns to make forecasts on the basis of readily available information, but is selective as to which information he attends to: he chooses whether to attend as a function of current beliefs about whether such information is predictive. If the agent does not attend to some piece of information, it cannot be recalled at a later date. He uses Bayes' rule to update his beliefs given attended-to information, but does not attempt to fill in missing information. The model demonstrates how selective attention may lead the agent to persistently fail to recognize important empirical regularities, make systematically biased forecasts, and hold incorrect beliefs about the statistical relationship between variables. In addition, it identifies factors that make such errors more likely or persistent. The model is applied to shed light on stereotyping and discrimination, persistent learning failures and disagreement, and the process of discovery.","Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College,"Schwartzstein, J (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",josh.schwartzstein@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,77,81,101,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

To reduce potential self-selection problems arising from endogenous job changes, we focus on a sample of workers displaced by firm closures. By using this sample, we confirm that larger firms pay higher wages, in part for unmeasured workers' abilities and in part for firm size effects.","Univ Calabria, I-87030 Commenda Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Scoppa, V (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, I-87030 Commenda Di Rende, Italy.",,,"Scoppa, Vincenzo/0000-0002-2774-0258",,,,,31,5,6,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

For example, space is more important than fuel economy for an SUV, but the opposite is true for a commuter car. In our model, the weights associated with different categories are stable, but categorization decisions can be subject to significant context effects; that is to say, we suggest that context effects are due to task interpretation rather than to preference construction. We demonstrate that the model can correctly detect experimental manipulations of product categorizations, supporting its suitability as a tool to capture preference heterogeneity arising from categorizations outcomes. The model is then employed to analyze data from a discrete choice experiment and the results provide rich behavioral insights into how categorization influences choice processes.

Over the lifetime, about 30 percent of households could expect to receive a wealth transfer and these would account for close to 40 % of their net worth near time of death. However, there is little evidence of an inheritance boom. In fact, from 1989 to 2007, the share of households reporting a wealth transfer fell by 2.5 percentage points, a time trend statistically significant at the one percent level. The average value of inheritances received among all households did increase but at a slow pace, by 10 %; the time trend is not statistically significant. Wealth transfers as a proportion of current net worth fell sharply over this period, from 29 to 19 %, though the time trend once again is not statistically significant. We also found that inheritances and other wealth transfers tend to be equalizing in terms of the distribution of household wealth, though a number of caveats apply to this result.","[Wolff, Edward N.] New York Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Gittleman, Maury] Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA",New York University,"Wolff, EN (通讯作者)，New York Univ, Dept Econ, 19 West Fourth St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.",ew1@nyu.edu; Gittleman.Maury@bls.gov,,,,,,,44,42,48,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Based on a new definition of informal employment, we estimated the proportion of informal employment relative to total non-agricultural employment in urban China and found it to be 49.7% in 2005 and 40.3% in 2010. Meanwhile, our study illustrated that informal employees' earnings were 67% that of formal employees, and this large earnings gap raised the Gini coefficient to 0.42 in 2005. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition result shows that the earnings gap explains more than half of the overall personal income inequality in urban China. These results indicate that informal employment has a significant effect on the income distribution in urban China. Consequently, regulating the labour market, eliminating job discriminations and legislating the informal employment should be considered as alternative means of reducing inequality in China.

I disagree: it is implausible to assume that sovereign individuals behind a veil of ignorance would actually agree on manipulative nudges from the public sector. Resorting to a constitutional economics paradigm does not diminish the force of the manipulation objection-libertarian paternalism remains morally objectionable. Moreover, where sovereign citizens would agree on permissible (morally legitimate) nudges behind a veil of ignorance, these would no longer constitute paternalism under its commonly agreed definition. More constructively, the only morally defensible paternalistic nudges would be those that improve welfare while respecting or, better yet, improving individual autonomy.

Recent theoretical work suggests that loyalty discounts can be profitable to sellers when customer preferences are not stationary and sellers can pre-commit to prices for repeat buyers, but otherwise returning customers can be expected to pay the same or more than new buyers. This paper reports behavior in controlled laboratory experiments designed to empirically test the impact of these factors on pricing strategies. The results generally support the comparative static predictions of the theoretical model. When customer preferences are fixed over time, sellers attempt to lure customers from their rival. Price pre-commitment for repeat shoppers when buyer preferences vary over time resulted in modest loyalty pricing, but the discounts are not as prevalent as predicted as sellers rarely price below cost. Behaviorally, price pre-commitment to loyal customers is found to reduce prices overall. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, this pricing scheme introduces bias into estimating elasticities for welfare analysis or policy changes. I develop a local elasticity estimation method that uses nonlinear price schedules to isolate consumers' expenditure choices from selection and simultaneity biases. This method improves over previous approaches by using commonly-available observational data and requiring only a single general monotonicity assumption. Using claims-level data on health insurance with two nonlinearities, I am able to measure two separate elasticities, and find that elasticity declines from -026 to-0.09 by the second nonlinearity. These estimates are then used to calculate moral hazard deadweight loss. This method enables estimation of many policies with nonlinear pricing which previous tools could not address.

The proposed method was then applied to a real-world case for supporting the planning of the energy system in Beijing. The developed FIP-CVESE method could not only tackle uncertainties expressed as both interval numbers and fuzzy sets, but also allow several given levels of tolerable violations of system objective and constraints to expand the model's decision space, facilitating the improvement in solution robustness. The obtained results could provide a series of desired decision alternatives at preferred satisfaction degrees, including schemes related to energy resources allocation, technology adoption, facility capacity expansion, transportation device identification, and environmental pollution mitigation. Also the substitution solutions among multiple energy resources can be generated by combining energy substitution effects with the violation levels of resources demands constrains through the introduction of violation variables.

Due to rising temperatures throughout the tropics, pressures for adaptation will be greatest in some of the poorest parts of the world where the adaptive capacity is least abundant. We discuss both autonomous (market driven) and planned adaptations, distinguishing: (a) those that can be undertaken with existing technology, (b) those that involve development of new technologies, and (c) those that involve institutional/market and policy reforms. The paper then proceeds to identify which of these adaptations are currently modeled in integrated assessment studies and related analyses at global scale. This, in turn, gives rise to recommendations about how these models should be modified in order to more effectively capture climate change adaptation in the farm and food sector. In general, we find that existing integrated assessment models are better suited to analyzing adaptation by relatively well-endowed producers operating in market-integrated, developed countries. They likely understate climate impacts on agriculture in developing countries, while overstating the potential adaptations. This is troubling, since the need for adaptation will be greatest amongst the lower income producers in the poorest tropical countries. This is also where policies and public investments are likely to have the highest payoff. We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for improving the empirical foundations of integrated assessment modeling with an emphasis on the poorest countries. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The key innovation is the introduction of managerial pay. Kaleckian monopoly power determines the functional distribution of income and Goodwin labour bargaining power determines the wage-bill division. The model helps explain slower US growth over the past 30 years. For much of that period the functional distribution of income was relatively constant, but growth slowed because income inequality increased owing to a wage-bill shift from workers to managers. The wage-bill division effect explains why economies can display wage-led and profit-led characteristics. Economies can be profit-led regarding functional income distribution and wage-led regarding wage-bill distribution.","AFL CIO, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"Palley, TI (通讯作者)，AFL CIO, 815 16th St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",mail@thom-aspalley.com,,,,,,,42,25,26,2,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS; ENERGY EFFICIENCY,"This study proposes a new use of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) radial approach to examine the corporate sustainability of Japanese industrial sectors. The concept of corporate sustainability is measured by its subcomponent measures, including UEN (Unified Efficiency under Natural Disposability), UEM (Unified Efficiency under Managerial Disposability), UENM (Unified Efficiency under Natural and Managerial Disposability), UEI (Unified Efficiency for Intermediate measurement) and UENM (DC) (Unified Efficiency under Natural and Managerial Disposability with Desirable Congestion). Among the five measures, the UEI examines a degree of how each firm can efficiently utilize its resources. The UENM(DC) examines a degree of how the firm can reduce an amount of undesirable outputs by technology innovation and/or managerial change. Such a combined use between UEI and UENM(DC) has been never explored in DEA environmental assessment. The empirical results obtained from the proposed approach have identified two important implications. One of the two implications is that the Japanese energy industry has been long under governmental regulation so that energy firms do not have corporate governance capabilities at the level of other industrial sectors which are competing in a global market. In particular, the implication is applicable to Japanese electric power firms. It is necessary for them to change their corporate governances (e.g., by adding new executive board members who have international experience and/or woman executives, as widely found in American and European energy industries) so that they can pay attention to consumers, not regulatory agencies of the Japanese government. The other implication is that technology innovation can more effectively improve the performance of the energy sector. Employing high efficiency and low carbon generation technologies to achieve desirable fuel mix is essential for improving the corporate sustainability of the Japanese energy sector.

In this paper, I compare both methods, explain the structural differences between them and illustrate the latter through a backward linkage analysis. I find that only one method is suited to the analysis of the physical structure of the economy, since it comprehends both the production of goods and associated emissions.

Since then progress might appear to have stalled. We argue to the contrary that significant progress has been made in understanding labor market frictions and imperfections, and in modeling search behavior and heterogeneous preferences. Perhaps most notable have been the improvements in data, in the form of longitudinal matched employer-employee data, and in techniques and algorithms (e.g. for solving heterogeneous parameter models). In short, the Cinderella status of the field is frankly overdrawn. Nevertheless, a chief lacuna remains the need for a better match between theory and data. This paper provides a critical albeit eclectic assessment of these developments, along the dimensions of the static and dynamic theory of labor demand, wage formation, and estimation, noting advances and limitations.

However, the effect of financial integration on growth remains an empirically controversial topic. This paper explores the impact of financial integration on economic growth in Botswana over the period 1974-2009. We do not find a direct, robust and statistically significant association between financial integration and economic growth in Botswana. However, our results show that financial integration is positively and significantly correlated with financial development in the Botswana economy. Although the relationship between financial integration and growth initially is, at best, weak, we believe this is not to say that financial integration does not promote economic growth, as it could do so indirectly through fostering financial development. Policy-wise, we observe that institutional quality, lower level of government spending and a stable macroeconomic environment are important determinants of both financial development and long-term economic growth. Thus, the Botswana government should continue strengthening and developing its capital market to international standards so as to attract both local and foreign investors and encourage foreign investment in the non-mining sectors. The government should ensure that financial reforms are coordinated, law enforcement authorities are strengthened and property rights are protected to reduce investment risks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Since interest rates are determined through a search and negotiation process, consolidation weakens consumers' bargaining positions. We use reduced-form techniques to estimate the mergers' distributional impact, and show that competition benefits only consumers at the bottom and middle of the transaction price distribution, and that mergers reduce the dispersion of prices. We illustrate that these effects can be explained by the presence of search frictions, and that the average effect of mergers on rates underestimates the increase in market power.","[Allen, Jason] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada; [Clark, Robert] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Clark, Robert] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Clark, Robert] CIRPEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Houde, Jean-Francois] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Bank of Canada; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite de Montreal; University of Pennsylvania,"Allen, J (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",jallen@bankofcanada.ca; robert.clark@hec.ca; houde@wharton.upenn.edu,,"Allen, Jason/0000-0003-2558-9061; Clark, Robert/0000-0002-5197-8370",,,,,50,37,44,0,32,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Therefore, the approximate form of financial integration cannot be used to refute the precision of the financial integration simply because of complex data collection procedures and the misspecification of a commonly used model. To overcome this shortcoming, this study uses the precise form to specify the measures of financial integration and examines the empirical validity based on a sample of ASEAN-5 countries plus 3 additional countries. Using the panel error correction method, the findings provide a number of policy implications; the precise form of financial integration can characterise the capital mobility conditions and the degree of sterilised foreign exchange intervention, and serve as a guiding policy instrument for fine-tuning the disruptions in the foreign capital market through sterilised foreign exchange intervention in exchange rate misalignments without abandoning the role of domestic interest rate policy that eventually promotes orderly financial integration.

However, if beliefs and preferences interact, this may have implications for the interpretation of observed behavior. Our sequential social dilemma experiment allows us to separate different interaction channels. When subjects play both roles in such experiments, a positive correlation between first- and second-mover behavior is frequently reported. We find that the observed correlation primarily originates via an indirect channel, where second-mover decisions influence beliefs through a consensus effect, and the first-mover decision is a best response to these beliefs. Specifically, beliefs about second-mover cooperation are biased toward own second-mover behavior, and most subjects best respond to stated beliefs. However, we also find evidence for a direct, preference-based channel. When first movers know the true probability of second-mover cooperation, subjects' own second moves still have predictive power regarding their first moves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Our framework offers a theory of how frozen markets suffering from adverse selection recover or thaw over time endogenously; given an initial fraction of lemons, our model delivers sharp predictions about the length of time it takes for the market to recover, and how prices and the composition of assets in the market behave over this horizon. We use our framework to analyze a form of government intervention introduced during the recent financial crisis in order to help unfreeze the market for asset-backed securities. We find that, depending on the fraction of lemons in the market, such an intervention can speed up or slow down market recovery. More generally, our analysis highlights that the success of an intervention in a lemons market depends on both its size and duration.

Using data from harmonized household surveys we decompose the gwg into an explained component (differences in human capital) and an unexplained component (different rates of return to human capital). We find evidence of sticky floors (larger gwg at the tenth percentile than at the median) and glass ceilings (larger gwg at the ninetieth percentile than at the median). The former are more frequent and their magnitude is generally larger. Working women are more educated than working men all along the wage distribution, which partially hides the 'unexplained' pay difference. Finally, we find that poorer countries and countries with more income inequality have higher gwg at the tenth percentile of the wage distribution.

The evidence based on comparative analysis suggests that despite China's high growth rate, the development of China's service trade lags behind its merchandise trade. With a policy environment adjusted in China's 12th 5-Year Plan, a growing significance of China's service trade to both China and the global economy is likely under the prospective development strategy. China's service trade has already had large impacts on China's economic growth, employment, and technology diffusion.

Poverty reduction tends to be strongly linked to economic growth, but growth impacts the environment and increases carbon-dioxide emissions. So can greener growth that is more climate-resilient and less environmentally damaging deliver large-scale poverty reduction? Can aid be used for effective poverty reduction now without affecting carbon emissions substantially? We argue that there are bound to be trade-offs between emissions reductions and a greener growth on the one hand, and growth that is most effective in poverty reduction. We argue that development aid, earmarked for the poorest countries, should only selectively pay attention to climate change, and remain focused on fighting current poverty reduction, including via economic growth, not least as future resilience of these countries and their population will depend on their ability to create wealth and build up human capital now. The only use for development aid within the poorest countries for explicit climate-related investment ought to be when the investments also contribute to poverty reduction now, including for increasing resilience to current impacts of environmental shocks, or when the investments done now have serious intertemporal 'lock-in' problems so that they have implications also for when climate change bites by 2050. In an annex, we offer a series of concrete principles to judge development spending.","[Dercon, Stefan] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Dercon, Stefan] Dept Int Dev DFID, London, England",University of Oxford,"Dercon, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",stefan.dercon@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,49,7,8,4,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

People's opinions, which products they buy, whether they invest in education, become criminals, and so forth, are all influenced by friends and acquaintances. Ultimately, the full network of relationships-how dense it is, whether some groups are segregated, who sits in central positions-affects how information spreads and how people behave. Increased availability of data coupled with increased computing power allows us to analyze networks in economic settings in ways not previously possible. In this paper, I describe some of the ways in which networks are helping economists to model and understand behavior. I begin with an example that demonstrates the sorts of things that researchers can miss if they do not account for network patterns of interaction. Next I discuss a taxonomy of network properties and how they impact behaviors.

While the rapidly expanding oil sands industry in western Canada has driven economic growth, the extraction of the oil comes at a significant environmental cost. It is believed that the government policies have failed to keep up with the rapid oil sands expansion, creating serious challenges in managing the environmental impacts. This paper presents a practical, yet financially sound, real options model to evaluate the rate of oil sands expansion, under different environmental cost scenarios resulting from governmental policies, while accounting for oil price uncertainty and managerial flexibilities. Our model considers a multi-plant/multi-agent setting, in which labor costs increase for all agents and impact their optimal strategies, as new plants come online. Our results show that a stricter environmental cost scenario delays investment, but leads to a higher rate of expansion once investment begins. Once constructed, a plant is highly unlikely to shut down. Our model can be used by government policy makers, to gauge the impact of policy strategies on the oil sands expansion rate, and by oil companies, to evaluate expansion strategies based on assumptions regarding market and taxation costs.

Under an EPC, both ESCO and the client invest in the energy efficiency measures, according to a negotiated share of investment. Within the length of the contract, the ESCO and its client divide up the saved energy bill according to a negotiated share. Once the contract expires, the client claims all of the saved energy bills if the energy efficiency measures still last Different EPC projects have different contract terms, including total investment, share of investment and length of contract. These contract terms directly determine the resulted energy savings. Thus it is essential and important to look at how these contract terms are formed and what are the major influencing factors. This paper first builds a theoretical bargain model between ESCO and its client to find out the structural relationship among these contract terms. Then, using the information of about 140 EPC contracts in China in 2010 and 2011, the paper empirically estimates the impacts of various factors on the contract terms and the resulted energy savings.

Our results show that the natural gas price is affected by temperature, storage and supply shortfalls in the short term, while the long-term development is closely tied to both crude oil and coal prices, capturing the economic climate and the substitution relationship between the different energy commodities.

It also provides a theoretical framework for analysing the past and projecting the future. Piketty argues that the ratio of wealth to national income is on an upward trend and that this is responsible for the rising income share of wealth-owners. This note accepts Piketty's main empirical findings but questions his interpretation. The rising income share of wealth-owners is not due to the over-accumulation of capital, as he claims, but just the opposite. There has been too little real investment. The note also considers the long-term dynamics of Piketty's model and explores the effect of modifying his assumptions about savings behaviour. Finally, it considers the implications of rising asset prices, which are documented by Piketty but are not adequately taken into account in his theoretical analysis or projection of future trends.","[Rowthorn, Robert] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB1 2AQ, England",University of Cambridge,"Rowthorn, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, 9 Willis Rd, Cambridge CB1 2AQ, England.",rer3@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,16,32,35,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

It is also one of the most salient examples of a variable affected by data problems. Issues with income arise as measurement errors in categorically captured income, correlation between stated income and unobserved variables, systematic over- or under-statement of income and missing income values for those who refuse to answer or do not know their (household) income. A common approach for dealing especially with missing income is to use imputation based on the relationship among those who report income between their stated income for reporters and their socio-demographic characteristics. A number of authors have also recently put forward a latent variable treatment of the issue, which has theoretical advantages over imputation, not least by drawing not just on data on stated income for reporters, but also choice behaviour of all respondents. We contrast this approach empirically with imputation as well as simpler approaches in two case studies, one with stated preference data and one with revealed preference data. Our findings suggest that, at least with the data at hand, the latent variable approach produces similar results to imputation, possibly an indication of non-reporters of income having similar income distributions from those who report it. But in other data sets the efficiency advantage over imputation could help in revealing issues in the complete and accurate reporting of income. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the absence of quotas, women consider their chances of getting top positions to be lower than men's. The lure of top positions induces even men of relatively low ability to engage in human capital formation, whereas women of relatively high ability do not expect to get top positions and do not therefore engage in human capital formation. Gender quotas discourage men who are less efficient in forming human capital, and encourage women who are more efficient in forming human capital.

The model shows that the country from which FDI originates experiences a welfare gain following liberalization. However, a counterintuitive finding is that the welfare of the host country deteriorates. This is explained by the production relocation process that leads to an increase in the mass of domestic firms in the source country and a decrease in the host country. The model also confirms that unilateral trade liberalization brings a similar result even in the presence of bilateral FDI flows.

The dataset contain real estate credit and price conditions (loan principal and spread, and the appraisal and market price) at the mortgage level, matched with borrower characteristics (such as income, labor status and contract) and the lender identity, over the last credit boom and bust. We find that lending standards are softer in the boom than in the bust. Moreover, despite some adjustment in lending conditions in the good times depending on borrower risk, the results suggest too soft lending standards and excessive risk-taking in the boom. For example, mortgage spreads for non-employed are identical to employed borrowers during the boom. Banks with worse corporate governance problems soften even more the standards. Finally, we analyze the mechanism by which banks could increase the supply of mortgage loans despite of regulatory restrictions on LTVs. The evidence is consistent with banks encouraging real estate appraisal firms to introduce an upward bias in appraisal prices (29 %), to meet loan-to-value regulatory thresholds (40 % of mortgages are just bunched on these limits), thus building-up the credit and the real estate bubble.","[Akin, Ozlem; Garcia Montalvo, Jose; Garcia Villar, Jaume; Peydro, Jose-Luis; Maria Raya, Josep] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain; [Akin, Ozlem] Ozyegin Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Garcia Montalvo, Jose; Garcia Villar, Jaume; Peydro, Jose-Luis] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia Montalvo, Jose; Peydro, Jose-Luis] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Peydro, Jose-Luis] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England; [Maria Raya, Josep] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Escola Univ Maresme, Barcelona 08302, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Ozyegin University; ICREA; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Pompeu Fabra University,"Raya, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Escola Univ Maresme, Tecnocampus,Ernest Lluch 32, Barcelona 08302, Spain.",josep.raya@upf.edu,"Peydró, José-Luis/F-3923-2018; Raya, Josep Maria/AAR-7073-2020; Akin, Ozlem/B-7621-2015; Garcia Villar, Jaume/D-7140-2013; Montalvo, Jose G./D-6731-2013","Peydró, José-Luis/0000-0002-4542-7353; Raya, Josep Maria/0000-0002-2885-234X; Akin, Ozlem/0000-0003-2115-8416; Garcia Villar, Jaume/0000-0002-8427-9541; Montalvo, Jose G./0000-0003-4161-5055",ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,28,55,56,3,72,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

We find that regional and global shocks have different influences on the ASEAN-wide sector and national equity indices. There is evidence that the ASEAN-wide sectoral returns are mostly driven by local shocks, except for the insurance and technology sectors. The volatility of Singapore's and Vietnam's national returns mostly results from their own shocks rather than local and global shocks. Applying the trend spillover model, this paper also shows that the effects of regional and global shocks on return volatility have been decreasing for almost all ASEAN-wide sectors' equity indices, while the trend for the volatility spillover effects of those shocks are positive and significant for the production and industries group sectors, as well as the food and beverage sector. Comparing the variance ratios of ASEAN sectoral and national returns, it is evident that the percentage of national equity returns belonging to their own shocks is higher than that of sectoral returns, indicating that investors might be better off diversifying their assets across countries rather than sectors in ASEAN area. This finding is consistent with the results of the mean variance frontiers, as the portfolio composed purely of ASEAN national returns has a stronger efficiency frontier than a portfolio of all ASEAN-wide sector equity returns. By using the spanning and intersection tests, the paper also indicates that adding ASEAN national equity returns might improve the efficiency frontiers of investors' holding portfolios.

In places where there were more scandals, individuals state a preference for less government provision of social services. In contrast, a higher level of abuse is also associated with an increase in voting for Democratic candidates for President, state legislatures, and the US House of Representatives, and an increase in per capita government welfare spending, although this increase is insufficient to replace the decrease in Catholic-provided charity.

This analysis was conducted to determine which households would be most affected by higher energy tariffs and to what extent mitigation measures, such as lifeline tariffs or direct cash transfers, might lessen the impact for poor and vulnerable households. The analysis focused on first-order effects and used benefit incidence analysis and static micro-simulation to estimate the expected costs and benefits of higher energy prices and the corresponding mitigation measures. The results suggest that both the type of energy and the level of connectedness matter. Increasing tariffs for thermal power used for central heating and hot water mainly affects richer households in urban areas. Reducing implicit electricity subsidies affects the entire population due to nearly complete country coverage with electricity connections. Both lifeline tariffs and direct cash transfers could mitigate the effect of higher electricity tariffs at lower costs than universal subsidies.

An additional year of education leads to a 4-percentage-point decline in the likelihood that an individual identifies with any religious tradition.

If the required supermajority is not reached, voting is repeated indefinitely, although there is a cost to delay. Under suitable assumptions the equilibrium analysis provides a sharp prediction. The result can be interpreted as a generalization of the seminal median voter theorem known from the simple majority case. If a supermajority is required instead, the power to select the outcome moves from the median voter to the more extreme voters. Normative analysis indicates that, in the utilitarian sense, simple majority is strictly inferior to some supermajorities. Even if unanimity is a bad voting rule, voting rules close to unanimity may be efficient. The more likely it is to have very many almost indifferent voters and some very opinionated ones, the more stringent a supermajority is required for efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that this incentive arises from the presence of a second-hand market and uncertainty about consumers' willingness to pay for the good. Consumers are heterogeneous and initially uninformed about their valuations but learn about them over time. Given demand uncertainty, first period sales may result in misallocation and lead to active trading on the secondary market after the uncertainty is resolved. Trading on the second-hand market will generate additional surplus. This surplus can be captured by the monopolist ex-ante because consumers are forward-looking, and the price they are willing to pay incorporates the product's resale value. As a consequence, when selling to uninformed consumers, the monopolist faces the trade-off between more sales today and a lower profit margin. Specifically, because the product's resale value is negatively related to the stock of the good in the second-hand market, selling more units today will result in a lower equilibrium price of the product. Therefore, the monopolist may find it optimal to create a shortage and ration consumers to the second period. We characterize conditions under which the monopolist would like to restrict sales and generate buying frenzies.

I estimate the causal effect of birth analyzing a sample of unplanned pregnancies, defined as those that happened while the woman was using contraception. Women with high labor force attachment may be more likely to use contraception or to have an induced abortion if contraception fails. I use spontaneous fetal losses as a source of exogenous variation in births. Unplanned births significantly reduce labor force participation, especially at the beginning of the sample period (1973-2004) and when the child is below 6 years of age. This effect is remarkably higher than the estimates traditionally reported in the literature, suggesting that family planning plays a key role in the limited magnitude of previous estimates. The negative impact decreases over the sample period. There are no significant differences in the effect of an unplanned birth by level of education and its impact on income is small: (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper assesses the efficiency consequence of that political decision. We estimate revenue drains arising from tax-motivated divestures to infer maximum possible efficiency losses from behavioral responses. The estimation utilizes variations in tax incentives arising from the new tax and its amendments. The sample is 7619 subsidiaries founded from January 1985 through December 1998. The results indicate that the tax influenced 10.7-12.7 percent of new subsidiaries incorporated during a high-tax-incentive regime. The behavioral response accounted for 3.4 percent of the overall revenue drain. The modest amount of revenue drain suggests that firms faced coordination problem in separating business segments, and that firms with low costs of reorganization responded. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It considers an open economy with a positive net foreign asset (net creditor) position and shows that tradable and nontradable sector reforms, understood as reforms that shift the supply curve in the respective sector outward, tend to have similar external balance effects. Namely, supply-side reforms improve the price competitiveness of domestic output and tend to increase the trade and current account balance on impact. In the longer term, competitiveness gains are compensated by additional imports associated with domestic income growth. Starting from a non-zero NFA position, the denominator effect does also contribute significantly to changes in external accounts relative to GDP. The results are robust across modifications of the model. (C) 2014 European Union. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Choices and lookups are similar when stakes are higher. When cluster analysis is used to group subjects according to lookup patterns and choices, three clusters appear to correspond approximately to level-3, level-2, and level-1 thinking in level-k models, and a fourth cluster is consistent with inferential mistakes (as, for example, in QRE or Cursed Equilibrium theories). Deviations from Nash play are associated with failure to look at the necessary payoffs.

However, the RPS will also provide substantial annual savings in carbon dioxide emissions, equal to 40 million metric tons in 2020. Continuing non-price induced energy conservation at the historical rate will only result in a marginal reduction in electricity rates, although lower electricity use means that substantial savings are nonetheless achieved in electricity expenditures. In addition, continuing trend energy conservation leads to substantial savings in carbon dioxide emissions. Like the RPS, developing domestic natural gas generation also leads to rate increases and reductions in carbon dioxide emissions (relative to the baseline). However, these impacts are minor compared to the RPS scenario. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings suggest that the euro periphery crises share sufficient commonalities with earlier crises in their pre-crisis domestic vulnerabilities. The study points to two important conclusions. First, the euro periphery crises are composed of unique country experiences; hence, it will not be easily resolved with a 'one-size-fits-all' set of economic policies. Secondly, while each banking crisis has its inherent uniqueness, each crisis also shares sufficient commonalities with one or more of the Asian-5 1996/97 crises, the Nordic banking crisis of the early 1990s or the Japanese banking crisis of the 1990s.

From the theory we derive an empirical strategy that allows us to distinguish the impact of wage bargaining pressure from other sourcing motives.

This has temporarily kept private consumption and employment high, but it also contributed to the creation of a credit bubble. This surge in household indebtedness turned out to be unsustainable in the financial crisis starting in 2007. Although Rajan and others emphasize the role of government in promoting credit to those households with declining relative (permanent) incomes, other strands of the literature have focused more explicitly on the implications of rising inequality for aggregate demand and households' demand for credit. These differences in emphasis may explain why the literature on the inequality-crisis nexus appears somewhat disparate, even though the various strands are far from mutually exclusive but rather complement each other. We therefore place the 'Rajan hypothesis' in the context of competing theories of consumption, and survey the empirical literature on the effects of inequality on household behaviour. We conclude that the empirical evidence calls for a renaissance of the relative income hypothesis of consumption.","[van Treeck, Till] Macroecon Policy Inst IMK, Dusseldorf, Germany; [van Treeck, Till] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"van Treeck, T (通讯作者)，Macroecon Policy Inst IMK, Dusseldorf, Germany.",till-van-treeck@boeckler.de,,,,,,,128,82,97,3,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Results show that parental migration has a negative effect on children's school enrollment. This negative effect is significant and sizable on the school enrollment of boys, but insignificant on the school enrollment of girls. The most important source of this robust negative effect on boys is the absence of fathers.

J,"Zhao, K",,,,"Zhao, Kai",,,War finance and the baby boom,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fertility; Baby boom; Government debt; WWII,DIFFERENTIAL FERTILITY MATTERS; GROWTH; MODEL; CHOICE,"In this paper, I extend the Barro-Becker model of endogenous fertility to incorporate specific fiscal policies and use it to study the effects of the fiscal policy changes following WWII on fertility in the United States. The US government went through large changes in fiscal policy after the beginning of WWII. The marginal income tax rate for an average American jumped from 4% on average before 1940 to approximately 25% during the war and stayed around 20% afterwards. The government debt-GDP ratio jumped from approximately 30% on average before WWII to 108% in 1946 and then dropped gradually in the following two decades to about 30% again at the end of 1960s. I find that the dramatic increase in the marginal income tax rate was an important cause of the postwar baby boom in the US because it lowered the after-tax wage and thus the opportunity cost of child-rearing. I also find that the differential change in taxes by income was an important reason why the baby boom was more pronounced among richer households (as documented by Jones and Tertilt, 2008). Furthermore, I argue that the government's debt policy may also matter for understanding fertility choices because government debt implies a tax burden on children in the future and thus affects their utility, which is a key determinant of current fertility choice in the Barro-Becker model. The results of a computational experiment show that the US government's postwar debt policy also contributed to the baby boom, but its quantitative importance is relatively small.

Against this backdrop, this paper argues that corporatism survived as an institutional structure (at least in European countries), but became pointedly less egalitarian. Essentially, it became a policy process by which governments that were unable or unwilling to engage in unilateral reform (for example, due to parliamentary weakness or fear of electoral retribution) managed to implement policy changes whose fundamental orientation was neoliberal. Perhaps surprisingly, the new corporatism also became more internally participatory and democratic than in the old days. This change compensated for the disappearance of the political exchange traditionally associated with classic corporatism. Because unions were no longer rewarded for bargaining moderation through more generous social protection programs or other side payments, they began to pay more attention to issues of procedural democracy in order to legitimize centrally negotiated agreements. The evidence buttressing these claims comes from quantitative data for 16 OECD countries between 1974 and 2005 and case study evidence of Ireland and Italy.","Univ Geneva, Dept Sociol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",University of Geneva,"Baccaro, L (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Dept Sociol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",,,"Baccaro, Lucio/0000-0001-6410-6179",,,,,152,8,9,0,28,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Such devices focus donations at discrete levels, thereby effectively limiting the donors' freedom to give. We study the effects on overall donations of the trade-off between rigid schemes that severely restrict the choices of contribution on the one hand, and flexible membership contracts on the other, taking into account the strategic response of contributors whose values for the public good are private information. We show flexibility dominates when (i)the dispersion of donors' taste for the public good increases, (ii)the number of potential donors increases, and (iii)there is greater funding by an external authority. Our theoretical results are consistent with three basic patterns we discover in the membership schemes of National Public Radio stations: stations offer a larger number of suggested contribution levels-a proxy for flexibility-as (i)the incomes of the population served become more diverse, (ii)the population of the coverage area increases, and (iii)there is greater external support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.","[Barbieri, Stefano] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Malueg, David A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Tulane University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Barbieri, S (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 206 Tilton Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",sbarbier@tulane.edu; david.malueg@ucr.edu,,,,,,,37,6,7,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

These hedging mechanisms are used differently across countries. In this paper, we use a life cycle model to study the effects of unemployment on the portfolio choice of households in the US and in Germany. We distinguish short- and long-term unemployment and find that, in case of short-term unemployment, unemployment insurance offsets the negative impact of unemployment risk on households' equity holdings. When incorporating long-term unemployment, the US-equity share drops. This negative effect of unemployment is mainly driven by its high expected duration. In Germany, however, long-term unemployment does not significantly alter portfolio decisions. We show that different responses of portfolios to unemployment risk can be attributed to both differences in social security payments and different age-income profiles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The results of the impulse response functions and variance decomposition analysis indicate that the contribution of oil revenue shocks in explaining the government expenditures is stronger than the contribution of oil price shocks. Moreover the results of the vector autoregression (VAR) and vector error correction (VEC) models show that the strong causality is running from government revenues to government expenditures (both current and capital) in Iranian economy while the evidence for the reverse causality is very weak. Overall the results support the revenue-spending hypothesis for Iran.

However, the implementation of a priority rule might allow for loopholes - as is the case in Israel - in which an individual can register to receive priority but avoid ever being in a position to donate organs. We experimentally investigate how such a loophole affects donation and find that the majority of subjects use the loophole when available. The existence of a loophole completely eliminates the increase in donation generated by the priority rule. When information about loophole use is made public, subjects respond to others' use of the loophole by withholding donation such that the priority system with a loophole generates fewer donations than an allocation system without priority.

The use of simultaneous equations for the panel data, via the GMM estimator proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991), highlights the positive effect of financial reporting quality (FRQ) on financial performance. This result is robust according to the different measurements of FRQ (earnings quality, accruals quality and accounting conservatism) and for an aggregated measure for the previous three proxies of FRQ.

The problematic national history of Russians is seen in relation to this complex methodological and ideological. background. The evolution of imperial history is traced from the state-centered rediscovery of empire to different interpretations of empire as a general framework for the region's entangled history. The new paradigm of imperial history is then introduced with its focus on the imperial situation of complex societies and multilayered, irregular diversity. This understanding of imperial history is precisely what has made studies of the Russian Empire relevant internationally.

What is missing both in classical and modern literature is an explicit discussion of (i) whether a general causal principle may be identified behind Smith's classical trio of advantages, and (ii) whether those advantages may be realized independently of specific conditions of the behavioural or institutional type. This paper addresses those issues by outlining a structural theory of increasing returns based on Babbage's law of multiples. The paper explores the implications of the law of multiples for decomposition or integration of production units and outlines the distinction between enabling conditions for increasing returns and their realization.

In addition, issues of social exclusion (including access to social services) and life satisfaction are investigated. While objective gaps in access are wide, subjective satisfaction with the quality of life is still higher in rural areas, including among those who are found to be socially excluded, indicating greater resilience of the rural population.","[Spoor, Max; Tasciotti, Luca] Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands; [Spoor, Max; Tasciotti, Luca] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Peleah, Mihail] UNDP, Bratislava, Slovakia",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Spoor, M (通讯作者)，Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands.",spoor@iss.nl,"Peleah, Mihail/GRX-4926-2022",,,,,,16,10,10,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUN,2014,26.0,2,,,,,201,219,,10.1080/14631377.2014.904107,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AH8GK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336374800003,0

Historical experience has shown that despite implementing regulations, supervision and macroeconomic policies, the financial industry regularly experiences crises. Consequently, a similar impact might be expected from the Basel Ill new bank regulatory framework. The aim of this paper is two-fold; in the first part dedicated to theory we describe the Basel III regulatory standards and argue that this regulation is not sufficient and will not prevent financial markets from experiencing future crises. Moreover, we discuss implementation of new banking regulation in Europe: the Capital Requirements Directive IV and stricter capital requirements for European banks set by the European Banking Authority in 2011. In the second part, we focus on an empirical analysis of the impact of stricter capital requirements as defined in the Basel III framework on the market value of European banks. Our analysis employs the fixed effects methodology on the financial data collected from 172 banks listed on European stock exchanges during the 2005-2011 period. We conclude that the impact of the Basel III regulation on the value of bank shares will probably be perceived negatively by the market, which could be reflected in a drop in the market value of the observed banks.","[Sutorova, Barbora] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Teply, Petr] Univ Econ, IES FSS UK, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Teply, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, IES FSS UK, Fac Finance & Accounting, W Churchilla 4,130 67 Prague 3, Prague, Czech Republic.",barbora.sutorova@gmail.com; petr.teply@vse.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,,,,,58,19,19,1,33,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Our results confirm the existence of cointegration with threshold symmetric and asymmetric adjustment processes toward PPP equilibrium. We also estimate the unconditional half-lives for non-linear PPP deviations to measure PPP persistence. We find that the speed of non-linear mean reversion may be faster than previously thought when allowing non-linear adjustments. In addition, we measure the absorption of shocks and suggest that different types of shocks are absorbed at different rates by different variables in the system. The evidence reveals that there are complex non-linearities in the price data and these justify the use of non-linear methods to study adjustments to intranational PPP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, when the full sample is split into subgroups, the results strongly indicate that the adoption of IT is associated with higher (lower) unemployment rate in the industrial (developing) countries.

These findings are remarkably stable across sub-periods, in apparent contrast with previous contributions that emphasised differences between first- and second-generation pacts.

He also acknowledged that his critique 'possibly' gave the phrase an 'extended sense' applicable to any current in historiography characterised by equivalently crude teleology and decontextualisation. It is with reference to this possible 'extended' sense that the phrase has gained currency in critical currents within the history of the natural and social sciences. The present case study of the secondary literature on the English writer William Petty (1623-87) argues that, while the two senses are of course conceptually distinct, they are nevertheless very much part of the same story if we are to explain how it has come about that the distortions indicated in the extended sense have become so deeply rooted in the economics mainstream's portrayal of its own history.","[Goodacre, Hugh] Univ Westminster, London NW1 5LS, England; [Goodacre, Hugh] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Westminster; University of London; University College London,"Goodacre, H (通讯作者)，Univ Westminster, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England.",h.goodacre@westminster.ac.uk,,,,,,,59,4,4,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We introduce two different bargaining mechanisms: tacit and explicit bargaining. In tacit bargaining, an uninformed principal makes a take-it-or-leave-it price offer to the agent, who then decides whether to accept or reject the offer. In the equilibrium of the game, the principal inefficiently screens out some agent types so that the agent's private information cannot be fully utilized when the decision is made. In explicit bargaining in which parties can communicate explicitly via cheap talk before tacit bargaining, however, an equilibrium with no such inefficient screening exists even when the conflict of interest is arbitrarily large. We also follow a mechanism design approach, showing that under certain conditions, explicit bargaining is an optimal bargaining mechanism that maximizes the joint surplus of the parties.

The results from a commonly used panel error correction model find (a) a bidirectional relationship between aggregate renewable generation and real GDP, (b) biomass, hydroelectricity, waste, and wind energy exhibit a positive long-run relationship with GDP, (c) hydroelectricity and waste generation exhibit a short-run positive bidirectional relationship with GDP growth, and (d) biomass, hydroelectric, and waste electricity generation have the largest impact on real GDP in the long-run. We extend the analysis to consider the possibility of structural breaks and cross-sectional dependence. Accounting for cross-sectional dependence, we find that in the short-run, increases in biomass and waste generation negatively affect GDP, while aggregate renewable and hydroelectricity increase GDP. Energy conservation policies will positively impact GDP, if the policies cause decreases in biomass or waste energy but increase hydroelectricity and wind energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With respect to China, fiscal decentralization has been a fundamental aspect of its transition to a market economy; and the country has made substantial efforts to break down its highly centralized fiscal management system. China's fiscal system currently has five levels central, provincial, prefecture, county, and township. Sub-national governments have been assigned primary responsibility for public services provision and financing. China's highly decentralized system could be a boon to managing service delivery, but the country's crave for rapid economic growth in the last two decades has kept the reform of the public services on the fringes of political agenda. Under the current arrangements, public services are extensively decentralized with sub-national governments taking a much larger portion of expenditure responsibilities that are out of line with international practice. The over-devolution of spending responsibilities has resulted in insufficient financing and provision for core public services, and particularly a default in the delivery of vital services in many rural and poor localities. Further, in the absence of mechanisms to ensure national minimum service standards, the decentralized public services delivery system is faced with growing inequality across the country due to the widening regional disparity in economic development over the past decade. This paper reviews fiscal decentralization policies in China, identifies prominent issues in the current pubic service delivery system, and examines the deficiencies in the existing intergovernmental fiscal system that have contributed to insufficiency and inequality in public services provision. It advises plausible reform options to further national objectives.","[Shen, Chunli] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zhao, Xiaojun] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Wuhan Univ, IAS, Wuhan, Peoples R China",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Peking University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Wuhan University,"Shen, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,18,8,8,1,36,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

In a situation where citizens can observe the effectiveness of JI with some positive probability, the model shows that the ruler in fact creates an independent judiciary and credibly commits to an announced tax rate, i.e., the ruler protects private property rights. Even when citizens have no chance to observe the effectiveness of JI, the ruler can still guarantee property rights by granting human rights as a signal of JI. Although the creation of JI achieves a Pareto improvement compared with its lack, two sources of inefficiency arise. First, the equilibrium tax is inefficiently high in the sense that the tax rate is on the inefficient side of the Laffer curve. This inefficiently high tax reflects the cost of credible commitment. Second, equilibrium JI for guaranteeing human rights is inefficiently high in the sense that the ruler does not entirely use JI for credibly committing to a low tax. This inefficiently high JI represents the cost of credible signalling.","Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Yazaki, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",y-yazaki@grips.ac.jp,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Additionally, we compare this benchmark case with one scenario where the tariffs are partially eliminated, and another scenario with more realistic trade elasticities. We quantify how trade liberalisation leads to falling consumer prices in the import sectors, increased production in the export sectors and aggregate welfare gains. Our analysis indicates a social welfare gain of around 0.4% which is robust to different estimates of trade elasticities, or in the case in which perhaps more realistically reflecting the recent episodes of free trade agreement we partially remove bilateral trade barriers.","[Cho, Sang-Wook (Stanley)] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Yoon, Gordon] Northern Terr Govt, Dept Lands Planning & Environm, Darwin, NT, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Northern Territory Government,"Cho, SW (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",s.cho@unsw.edu.au,"Cho, Sang-Wook/AAS-3855-2020","Cho, Sang-Wook/0000-0002-8435-9322",,,,,20,6,6,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The theory has strong predictions. In both cases, trading falls short of full efficiency, but for opposite reasons: with group leaders, the minority wins too rarely; with market trades, the minority wins too often.

This paradigm, whose expected utility (EU) version is Arrow and Pratt's more risk aversion concept, will be studied in the Choquet expected utility (CEU) model. Necessary condition Pointwise inequality between a function of the utility functions and another of the capacities is necessary and sufficient for the preference by Victor of safety over a dichotomous act whenever such is the preference of Ursula. However, increased preference for safety versus dichotomous acts does not imply preference by Victor of safety over a general act whenever such is the preference of Ursula. A counterexample will be provided, via the casino theory of Dubins and Savage. Sufficient condition Separation of the two functions by some convex function is sufficient for Victor to prefer safety more than Ursula, over general acts. Furthermore, a condition on the capacities will be presented for simplicity seeking, the preference by Victor over any act for some dichotomous act that leaves Ursula indifferent. This condition is met in particular if Victor's capacity is a convex function of Ursula's capacity. For these cases, the pointwise inequality (necessary) condition is a characterization of greater preference for safety, extending the Arrow-Pratt notion from EU to CEU and rank-dependent utility (RDU). These inequalities preserve the flavor of the more pessimism than greediness characterization of monotone risk aversion by Chateauneuf, Cohen and Meilijson in the RDU model and its extension by Grant and Quiggin to CEU. Preferences between safety and dichotomous acts are at the core of the biseparable preferences model of Ghirardato and Marinacci.","[Cohen, Michele] Paris Sch Econ, F-76475 Paris, France; [Cohen, Michele] Univ Paris 01, F-76475 Paris, France; [Meilijson, Isaac] Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Fac Exact Sci, Sch Math Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Tel Aviv University,"Meilijson, I (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Fac Exact Sci, Sch Math Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",cohenmd@univ-paris1.fr; isaco@math.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

For a sufficiently high social multiplier, both government interventions improve the welfare of those most concerned with PA but worsen the welfare of the least concerned individuals if they are not too many.

Under zero trend inflation we show that the economic structure is isomorphic to that of Bullard and Mitra (2002) and show that under a policy rule that responds to current period inflation and output a higher trend growth rate relaxes the conditions for determinacy and learnability. Results are mixed for other policy rules. Under the expectations-based rule, trend growth tightens the conditions for determinacy but it relaxes the conditions for learnability. Under the lagged-data-based rule, trend growth tightens the conditions for determinacy and learnability. Our analysis shows that lower (higher) trend growth has similar effects as higher (lower) trend inflation in the sense of making inflation more (less) forward-looking. Thus, our results complement previous studies on the role of high trend inflation as a cause of macroeconomic volatility in the U.S. in the 1970s, as this period was also characterized by productivity growth slowdown.

Mass promotion strategy creates a spectrum effect in market with an aim to create wider product awareness and influence the market size. Whereas the differentiated promotion strategy plays major role in external influence component in the respective segment and target for adoption by the current potential segment. Previous studies on segmented diffusion models assumed only first time purchase and constant market size which may yield underestimated results and fail to give appropriate insight of the diffusion process. The study develops and validates generalized diffusion models for segmented market incorporating the repurchase behaviour of the adopter population and dynamic potential market size considerations. Performance of the proposed models is analysed on real life data for a new product marketed in four segments and compared with the previous study.,"[Aggarwal, Sugandha; Gupta, Anshu; Jha, P.

Squeezed between the inevitability of having a welfare ideology and the mantra of value-neutrality (depoliticization), neoclassical policy economists tend to disguise their normative positions on policy matters as common sense. This attitude is particularly pronounced in what I will call the rhetoric of worthiness, whereby the neoclassical approach justifies its advocacy that certain people should not be helped. This normative position is disguised by a vocabulary (e. g., moral hazard) claimed to be politically neutral.

High-dimensional data arise through a combination of two phenomena. First, the data may be inherently high dimensional in that many different characteristics per observation are available. For example, the US Census collects information on hundreds of individual characteristics and scanner datasets record transaction-level data for households across a wide range of products. Second, even when the number of available variables is relatively small, researchers rarely know the exact functional form with which the small number of variables enter the model of interest. Researchers are thus faced with a large set of potential variables formed by different ways of interacting and transforming the underlying variables. This paper provides an overview of how innovations in data mining can be adapted and modified to provide high-quality inference about model parameters. Note that we use the term data mining in a modern sense which denotes a principled search for true predictive power that guards against false discovery and overfitting, does not erroneously equate in-sample fit to out-of-sample predictive ability, and accurately accounts for using the same data to examine many different hypotheses or models.","[Belloni, Alexandre] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Chernozhukov, Victor] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hansen, Christian] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Duke University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago,"Belloni, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",abn5@duke.edu; vchern@mit.edu; chansen1@chicagobooth.edu,,,"ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1061841] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,33,282,330,3,32,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We present an integrated analysis of variance/variance decomposition that summarizes the determinants of the housework contributions of, and the housework burden imposed by, all the individuals in four common household types, with a focus on the contributions of older children and youths. We demonstrate the importance of statistical interactions between the contributions of different household members (distinguished by partnership status, gender, and the ages and genders of children/youths), in particular for those households containing children/youths. We conclude that in order to analyze the contributions of all household members jointly, it is necessary to distinguish different household compositions for separate analysis.","[Gershuny, Jonathan; Sullivan, Oriel] Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Ctr Time Use Res, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Sullivan, O (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Ctr Time Use Res, Oxford, England.",oriel.sullivan@sociology.ox.ac.uk,,"Sullivan, Oriel/0000-0002-0995-5888; Gershuny, Jonathan/0000-0001-5011-0257","ESRC [ES/F037937/1, ES/L011662/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-0704, ES/L011662/1, ES/F037937/1, RES-000-23-0704-A] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,21,9,10,3,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

A standard trade model of Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition is coupled with a micro-founded model of cultural dynamics. We show that access to varieties that are attached to a global cultural type changes the incentives of parents to socialize their children and transmit their type. The resulting increase in agents of the global cultural type leads to a magnification of the initial shock. A striking feature of the model is that even temporary shocks to openness may have permanent effects through the changing distribution of preferences in the economy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find that free care increased use of formal healthcare shifting care seeking away from informal providers, with particularly strong effects for children who were anaemic at baseline. There was no health effect on the intervention population taken overall. However, consistent with the utilization findings, there were health improvements amongst those with anaemia initially. Further benefits included a large reduction in health spending, with the effect greater at higher levels of the medical spending distribution. Free care was found to have no influence on a range of malaria prevention behaviours or on the incidence of self-reported illness, suggesting that ex-ante moral hazard is unlikely to be a concern in this particular setting.

This paper aims to investigate whether this is the case. The study uses a panel dataset covering 155 countries, including 33 in the OECD, where China had invested during 2003-09. This is by far the most comprehensive dataset of China's outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). A two-stage least squared (TSLS) regression approach is adopted for our econometric models according to an established augmented gravity model in the literature. The empirical results show clear evidence that China's OFDI displaces that of the OECD countries, but the argument that China's emergence is a 'new colonialism' is not supported as OECD countries' OFDI in resource abundant host countries, particularly that in Africa and Latin America, does not appear to have been displaced by China's OFDI.

Understanding this impact sheds light on how firms function. This article examines the relationship between a firm's approach to environmental management and the nature of the pollution prevention activities or practices that it undertakes. We differentiate pollution prevention activities according to (i) four functional characteristics and (ii) visibility to consumers. We find that the application of the total quality management (TQM) approaches on pollution prevention has a stronger effect for practices that involve procedural changes or are of a customized nature. These are indeed the type of practices where one would expect TQM to have a disproportionate impact in decision-making effectiveness. There seems to be no corresponding effect on the adoption of practices that are visible to consumers. Our results corroborate the notion that a well-designed management system can help stimulate innovation, but only for specific types. They also help identify the types of firms that are more likely to benefit from adoption of TQM principles.","[Deltas, George] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Harrington, Donna Ramirez] Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Vermont; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Deltas, G (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",deltas@uiuc.edu,,,,,,,39,13,15,0,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Larger companies receive greater lenience in multiple dimensions. Inspector issued fines and final fines, after negotiated reductions, are both smaller during Republican presidencies.

In the framework of standard capital tax competition models, regions have to be large, in the sense of having market power, otherwise they will tax capital, a mobile factor, at the same rate. In this paper, we consider a second mobile factor, labor, which is mobile only within metropolitan areas. We will show that this spatially limited mobile factor may explain the capital tax rate differences levied on the global mobile factor as long as no source-based wage tax is available.

This follows a growing literature which posits that currency unions in general lead to greater synchronization of business cycles. The previous papers on the gold standard, however, suffer from simultaneity problems, and incomplete measures of just how synchronized output gaps are. We accordingly apply two new measures of business cycle coherence which have recently been applied to the modern Euro zone. These measures account both for differences in the sign as well as the amplitude of output gaps, and can be computed on a period-by-period basis, unlike previous metrics. In addition, we employ two other methods which do not allow for time-varying estimation, but have been employed in other studies of output convergence. We find, contrary to the earlier studies, that the classical gold standard did not appear to increase the coherence of business cycles.","[Miles, William] Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA; [Vijverberg, Chu-Ping C.] CUNY Coll Staten Isl, Dept Econ, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA",Wichita State University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; College of Staten Island (CUNY),"Miles, W (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, 1845 Fairmount, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",william.miles@wichita.edu; chuping.vijverberg@csi.cuny.edu,"Vijverberg, Chu-Ping/AAO-8199-2021",,,,,,55,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2014,67.0,1,,,,,93,115,,10.1111/kykl.12045,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,282JM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329167200007,0

Further, all three types of forecast failed to predict the recession that started in 2007 and continued to forecast poorly even after the recession was known to have begun. The aim of this paper is to investigate why these results occur by examining the structure of the solution of DSGE models and compare this with pure time series models. The main factor seems to be the dynamic structure of DSGE models. Their backward-looking dynamics gives them a similar forecasting structure to time series models and their forward-looking dynamics, which consists of expected values of future exogenous variables, is difficult to forecast accurately. This suggests that DSGE models should not be tested through their forecasting ability.","[Wickens, Michael] Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Wickens, Michael] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Cardiff University; University of York - UK,"Wickens, M (通讯作者)，Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",mike.wickens@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,23,14,15,3,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The results conclude: (1) FDI can bring significant technology spillover effects for our country, but due to great differences in FDI source countries and in various regions of China, the spillover effects of FDI from South Korea and Singapore and FDI from other countries are greater than those of FDI from G7 and FDI from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and the spillover effects in the Eastern China surpass those in the Western China. (2) The proper marketization degree and human capital level can not only directly promote China's technical efficiency, but also can indirectly promote China's technical efficiency through increasing spillover effects of FDI. (3) In analysis of the threshold effects. FDI from G7 needs the highest threshold values of marketization degree and human capital level, while FDI from South Korea can maximize the improvement of technology spillover effects with the lowest threshold values of marketization degree and human capital level. The findings indicate that provinces of China shall attract foreign investment in gradient method according to local circumstances, in other words, avoid introducing low-quality foreign investment and blindly admiring high-quality foreign investment to ensure smooth and transcending impetus in technical efficiency of domestic enterprises. Meanwhile, efforts have yet to be made to improve marketization degree and human capital level for higher technical efficiency directly and mediately. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that: first, carbon price behaviour is asymmetric, and the long-term bearish probability is greater than the long-term bullish probability. Second, time-scales of investment and speculators' expectations of returns have dual effects on carbon price behaviour. The longer the time-scales of investment, the higher the bearish probability. The lower the expectations of returns, the smaller the distortion of carbon price behaviour. Third, the differences in carbon market cognitions from non-greedy speculators with different expectations of returns mainly lie in the amplitudes and occasions of carbon price fluctuations, rather than in the carbon price fluctuations themselves. Fourth, speculators' expectations of returns have critical points. Once the critical points are reached, they will no longer be able to distort carbon price behaviour. Finally, we discuss some investment advice for supports of the decision-makers. For non-greedy-type speculators, they will choose to hold negatively in the short term and buy and hold in the long term, while for greedy-type speculators they will sell their European Union Allowances (EUAs) in the short term, and buy and hold in the long term. The results are helpful to hedge against unwanted carbon price movements, and to understand the transactions between different types of agents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main empirical findings of this paper are that: (i) the regional bias of services trade in Asia is as high as or higher than in Europe and North America; (ii) in Asia, the regional bias of services trade is higher than that of goods trade, which is in sharp contrast to Europe and North America, where the regional bias of goods trade is higher than that of services trade; and (iii) while Asia's regional bias of goods trade shows a declining trend, that of services trade remains high, although in the future its decline is expected. Asia's relatively high-level of regional bias of services trade can be explained by the following factors: (i) a relatively high prevalence of a shared language (Chinese), which is essential to services trade, but not to goods trade; and (ii) the archipelagic nature of the region, which inhibits goods trade more than services trade. In contrast, for example, major European countries share land borders with their neighbors and they speak different languages. In order to deepen Asia's services trade integration, two policies are necessary. First, effective regional services agreements are critical to enhancing the level of integration. Second, policies to increase the trade of crisis-resilient services, such as professional services and insurance, as opposed to crisis-vulnerable services, such as transport and travel, are necessary.","Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Mandaluyong City, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Hamanaka, S (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Mandaluyong City, Philippines.",shamanaka@adb.org,,,,,,,17,4,4,6,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Nevertheless, there are issues and challenges being faced by the institutions that could give impact towards their sustainability. Among others are moral hazard and adverse selection problems among participants that would ultimately give potential risks to the institutions. Hence, maintaining its sustainability by way of risk management is significant in ensuring financial inclusion of the poor and materializing the objective of poverty alleviation. This qualitative study was conducted toexamine one type of financial risk i.e. credit risk in the specific context of Islamic microfinance (IMF) product.

We show in a search-matching model that this moral hazard problem can be reduced by attaching a workfare requirement to the eligibility conditions for claiming unemployment benefits. Even when workfare has no effects on human capital or productivity, it is possible to improve labour market performance to create more jobs and lower unemployment by the introduction of workfare, and also to improve welfare.

We document a new set of facts regarding the U.S. cyclical regularities of inventories and capacity utilization. First, we find that capital utilization and the flows of services from both capital and labor are procyclical, and comove with the holdings of inventories. Second, we find that labor utilization is procyclical as well, but is weakly negatively correlated with inventories. We build a model that accounts for these facts, and also accounts for the stylized inventory facts, i.e., inventory holdings are procyclical, while the inventory-to-sales ratio is countercyclical. The analysis is-centered on the effects of two possible shocks: preference (demand) shocks and technology shocks. Our model shows that inventories and the rate of capital utilization are mostly complements, while inventories and the rate of labor utilization are mostly substitutes. It further shows that temporary demand shocks emphasize the role of inventories as being a shock absorber, whereas high-persistence demand shocks, as well as technology shocks of any persistence, emphasize the role of inventories as being a complement to consumption.

We consider a monopoly incumbent who may expand capacity to deter entry, and a potential entrant who owns an Intelligence System. The Intelligence System (IS) generates a noisy signal based on the incumbent's actions. The potential entrant uses this signal to decide whether or not to enter the market. The incumbent may signal-jam to manipulate the likelihood of the noisy signals and hence affect the entrant's decisions. If the precision of the IS is commonly known, the incumbent benefits from his rival's espionage. Actually, he benefits more the higher is the precision of the IS while the spying entrant is worse off with art IS of relatively high quality. When the IS quality is private information of the entrant, the incumbent is better off with an IS of high expected precision while the entrant benefits from one of high quality. In this case espionage makes the market more competitive. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although shocks to the government nonwage consumption generate an appreciation in the real exchange rate and worsening of the trade balance, the effects of government investment shocks remain insignificant.

In this respect, many researchers have started to reconsider the linkages between financial and macroeconomic areas. In this paper, we evaluate the leading role of the daily volatility of two major financial variables, namely commodity and stock prices, in their ability to anticipate the output growth. For this purpose, we propose an extended MIDAS model that allows the forecasting of the quarterly output growth rate using exogenous variables sampled at various higher frequencies. Empirical results on three industrialized countries (US, France, and UK) show that mixing daily financial volatilities and monthly industrial production is useful at the time of predicting gross domestic product growth over the Great Recession period.

The two predominant contest regimes are considered, all-pay auctions and lottery contests. For all-pay auctions the optimal bias is derived in closed form: It implies extreme competitive pressure among active contestants and low endogenous participation rates. Moreover, the exclusion principle advanced by Baye et al. (1993) becomes obsolete in this case. In contrast, the optimally biased lottery induces a higher number of actively participating contestants due to softer competition. Our main result regarding total revenue comparison under the optimal biases reveals that the all-pay auction revenue-dominates the lottery contest for all levels of heterogeneity among contestants. The incentive effect due to a strongly discriminating contest rule (all-pay auction) dominates the participation effect due to a weakly discriminating contest rule (lottery).

This paper will look at the implications of parameter shifts for econometric policy evaluation, to see whether policy advice derived from DSGE models would have differed fundamentally from that which the policymakers of the 1970s derived from their reduced-form Phillips curves. The results show drift in most parameters, including those that are supposedly structural (such as the share of capital in production, habits or the elasticity of labour supply to the real wage), and major shifts in the impulse response functions derived from the real-time estimation of the model. After the expansionary monetary shocks of the early 1970s, a standard DSGE model would have behaved very similarly to an old-style Phillips curve, with marked shifts in parameter values and impulse response functions.

The major component of trade barriers is explicitly modeled through the introduction of entry-sunk costs. Hence, liberalization is treated assuming a government's policy decision aimed at reducing those costs. Then, we estimate the model using Bayesian techniques for Tunisia and the Euro Area. The paper presents a precise quantitative evaluation of services trade barriers as the difference between entry-sunk costs in Tunisia versus the Euro Area. We find significant welfare benefits in addition to aggregate and sectoral growth gains the Tunisian economy could attain following services liberalization.

Although different industries face different levels of competition and therefore the likelihood of financial distress can differ for firms in different industries, scant attention has been paid to predicting restaurant financial distress. The primary objective of this paper is to examine the key financial distress factors for publicly traded U.S. restaurants for the period from 1988 to 2010 using decision trees (DT) and AdaBoosted decision trees. The AdaBoosted DT model for the entire dataset revealed that financially distressed restaurants relied more heavily on debt; and showed lower rates of increase of assets, lower net profit margins, and lower current ratios than non-distressed restaurants. A larger proportion of debt in the capital structure ruined restaurants' financial structure and the inability to pay their drastically increased debt exposed restaurants to financial distress. Additionally, a lack of capital efficiency increased the possibility of financial distress. We recommend the use of the AdaBoosted DT model as an early warning system for restaurant distress prediction because the AdaBoosted DT model demonstrated the best prediction performance with the smallest error in overall and type I error rates. The results of two subset models for full-service and limited-service restaurants indicated that the segments had slightly different financial risk factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Government deficits and government debts increased and collected revenues dropped. In addition, the economic crisis influenced a basic element of modern tax systems, i.e. tax compliance, where the consequence has been an increase in the tax debt. Data for Slovenia show that the amount of outstanding tax obligations during the recession increases, while the amount of collected revenues simultaneously drops. Thus, in 2011, the amount of tax debt grew to over 0.9 billion EUR, which is equivalent to the deficit in the general public finance budget. In our analysis, we examine the influence the recession has had on tax compliance in Slovenia. As a measure for non-compliance, we used data on tax debt (unpaid taxes). On the basis of the tax debt fluctuations and the results of regression model, we have discovered that economic fluctuations have significantly influenced the level of tax compliance. As significant explanatory variables, we point to the fluctuations of the average wages in the private sector and also the unemployment rate, which has been steadily increasing during the course of the recession. We also believe that the possibility for less restrictive measures of fiscal policy during the times of economic recession (tax enforcement activities, temporary reprieves, and instalment plans) is worth discussing.","[Lesnik, Tomaz; Kracun, Davorin; Jagric, Timotej] Univ Maribor, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Lesnik, T (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",lesnik.tomaz@amis.net; davorin.kracun@uni-mb.si; timotej.jagric@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

To better capture the uncertainty of many real world situations, we postulate a stochastic timing framework. The players get a revision opportunity at a pre-specified time (common to them) with some known probability (different across them). The probabilistic revisions resemble the Calvo (1983) timing widely used in macroeconomics, and by nesting the standard simultaneous move game and Stackelberg leadership they can serve as a dynamic commitment device. The analysis shows how the revision time and probabilities affect the outcomes in games with multiple and/or inefficient equilibria. Unsurprisingly, we show in the Battle of the sexes that commitment - low revision probability relative to the opponent - improves the player's chances to uniquely achieve his preferred outcome (i.e. to dominate). What may, however, seem surprising is that the less committed (higher revision probability) player may dominate the game under some circumstances (for which we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions). This is in contrast to the intuition of Stackelberg leadership where the more committed player (leader) always does so. The paper then applies the framework to the strategic interaction between monetary and fiscal policies in the aftermath of the Global financial crisis. It is modelled as the Game of chicken in which a double-dip recession and deflation can occur when both policies postpone stimulatory measures - attempting to induce the other policy to carry them out. In order to link our theoretic results to the real world, we develop new indices of monetary and fiscal policy leadership (pre-commitment) and quantify them using institutional characteristics of high-income countries. This exercise shows that the danger of the undesirable deflationary scenario caused by a monetary-fiscal policy deadlock may be high in some major economies.","[Libich, Jan; Dat Thanh Nguyen] La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Libich, Jan] Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Libich, Jan] CAMA, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",La Trobe University; Technical University of Ostrava,"Libich, J (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",j.libich@latrobe.edu.au; T.Nguyendat@latrobe.edu.au,"Libich, Jan/JWO-5802-2024; Nguyen, Dat Thanh/HZJ-3407-2023; Libich, Jan/ABD-4410-2020","Nguyen, Dat Thanh/0000-0002-6868-3253; Libich, Jan/0000-0002-2991-2228",,,,,33,0,0,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Hidden underemployment can be attributed to a number of factors relating to inadequate employment situations as described at the 16th International Conference of Labour Statisticians such as low productivity, the poor utilization of skills and other factors specific to agriculture. We place particular attention upon the potential role of off-farm labour supply in solving the underemployment problem. We utilize a two-stage residual inclusion model and a random effects probit model to examine the forces behind farm underemployment. We utilize a fixed effects model to examine the factors driving the severity of farm underemployment. Our findings suggest that instances of hidden underemployment increased between 2002 and 2011. Hidden underemployment appears to be a stubborn problem and is related to the absence of off-farm employment, low yield, livestock intensity and smaller than average farm size in the sheep and drystock cattle sectors in particular.","[Loughrey, Jason; Hennessy, Thia] TEAGASC, Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Agr Econ & Farm Survey Dept, Galway, Ireland",Teagasc,"Loughrey, J (通讯作者)，TEAGASC, Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Agr Econ & Farm Survey Dept, Galway, Ireland.",jason.loughrey@teagasc.ie,,"Loughrey, Jason/0000-0001-9658-0801; Hennessy, Thia/0000-0002-6137-1249",,,,,39,5,6,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We focus on the role of changes in the quality-adjusted price of investment goods on China's growth by comparing the effects of IST and human capital on the decomposition of US and Chinese productivity. The results show that both human capital and IST play an important role in the decomposition of US TFP. For China, human capital accounts for an increasingly higher portion of Chinese TFP for the period 1952-2009; however, IST contributes to the explanation of TFP only after the 1979 reforms. The analysis is extended by considering the impact of IST in the consumer's investment decision and by projecting both countries' GDP while modelling unbalanced Chinese growth using catch-up.

Based on the literature review, the paper summarizes the identified inadequacies of management compensation systems in banks: overcompensation, short-termism and the related incentive for excessive risk-taking, manipulation by managers, poor disclosure and the lack of proper oversight from the supervisory boards. Another problem is that although as a rule the management compensation system should be used as a tool to motivate managers (agents) to act in a way to achieve the objectives of the owners (and other legitimate stakeholders) the literature shows the unequivocal results of the pay-performance research. As the described problems in the banking industry have grown enormously, the recommendations and regulations concerning the management remuneration policies and practices are being enacted. The paper shows however that their implementation raises many problems and challenges. Therefore there is a need to further analyze the issue of designing a proper bank managers' compensation model. The postulates concerning performance evaluation process, linkage with risk, instruments and disclosure are presented.","Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Marcinkowska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",,,,,,,,97,3,3,0,18,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Panel unit root tests, which account for common cross-sectional factors, fail to reject non-stationarity in both variables. Thus, we explore their long-run relation and short-run dynamics using three alternative panel estimation techniques dynamic fixed effect, pooled and mean-group estimators before and after accounting for common cross-sectional factors. These estimators allow for various degrees of heterogeneity in long-run parameters and short-run dynamics. The results based on the mean group estimator with common correlated effects suggest (a) a stable relation between energy consumption and output; (b) bi-directional causality in both long- and short-run; and (c) the robustness of the long-run causality results to the inclusion of additional variables. As such, environmental policies designed to curtail energy may have significant long-run ramifications for economic growth, and policies designed to promote economic growth may have adverse environmental consequences.

Similar restrictions have been discussed in New York State and Germany. Despite their intuitive appeal, this article argues that Austrian-type policies may actually harm consumers. In a two-period duopoly model with consumer search, I show that under the regulation, firms will distort their prices intertemporally in such a way that their aggregate expected profit remains unchanged. This implies that, as some consumers find it optimal to delay their purchase due to expected price savings, but find it inconvenient to do so, a friction is introduced that decreases net consumer surplus in the market.

Through news impact curves (NICs) we tried to highlight the behaviour of inflation volatility in response to lagged inflation shocks under different GARCH specifications. In our results the leverage parameter shows the expected sign and is significant for almost all countries suggesting strong asymmetry in inflation volatility. The hyperbolic sign integral shape of NICs based on Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle GARCH (GJR-GARCH) highlights the importance of inflation stabilisation programmes particularly because of the subsequent evidence obtained in favour of bidirectional causality running between inflation and inflation volatility. There is also evidence in favour of the argument that a cyclic component of inflation obtained through an HP filter could be used as a suitable proxy of inflation for volatility estimation.","[Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas; Mirza, Nawazish] Lahore Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Lahore, Pakistan; [Naqvi, Bushra] Lahore Univ Management Sci, SDSB, Lahore, Pakistan; [Bordes, Christian] Univ Paris 01, CES Axe Finance, Pantheon Sorbonne, France",Lahore School of Economics; Lahore University of Management Sciences,"Rizvi, SKA (通讯作者)，Lahore Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Lahore, Pakistan.",kumail@lahoreschool.edu.pk,"Mirza, Nawazish/F-9388-2010; Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas/AAR-2381-2021","Mirza, Nawazish/0000-0003-4265-9519; Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas/0000-0003-1246-0912; Naqvi, Bushra/0000-0002-1990-3547",,,,,49,18,19,1,8,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON-RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The first is the tendency of workers and entrepreneurs to hold their company's stock. The second is the propensity of workers to limit their equity holdings through time. The explanation offered here for both of these behaviors lies in the option to switch jobs when one's company does poorly. This is equivalent to holding put options on one's own company stock and call options on the other company's stock, where both options must be exercised at the same time. Given these initial undiversified implicit financial holdings, workers need to allocate a relatively large share of their regular financial assets to their own company's stock and a relatively small share to the stock of their alternative employment simply to restore overall portfolio balance. Although this effect can only create some hedging demand for company's stock, it is a factor of potentially major import for assessing the suitability of workers' financial decisions. I find that, under certain conditions, workers optimally hold almost 40% of their financial wealth in their company's stock. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This paper develops an I-O model extension using an event tree analysis to assess the propagation of disaster effects across interdependent economic sectors using the inoperability and economic loss metrics. Inoperability, a dimensionless index that ranges between 0 and 1, indicates the extent to which a sector's production deviates below its normal state. On the other hand, economic loss is the monetary worth of the drop in output incurred in each sector of the economy due to the disaster. The new dynamic I-O extension is capable of adjusting the inoperability parameters within the disaster timeline to reflect events that can either degrade or enhance the predicted paths of sector recovery. It was implemented to the Nashville region - a metropolitan area in the USA known for its vibrant music and the tourism industry. The Nashville region is frequently hit by natural disasters such as tornadoes and floods, which makes it a suitable case study site for the model application. Results of the study can help identify critical economic sectors and ultimately provide insights for formulating preparedness decisions to expedite disaster recovery.","[Santos, Joost R.] George Washington Univ, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Yu, Krista Danielle S.] De La Salle Univ, Sch Econ, Manila 1004, Philippines; [Pagsuyoin, Sheree Ann T.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Tan, Raymond R.] De La Salle Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Manila 1004, Philippines",George Washington University; De La Salle University; University of Waterloo; De La Salle University,"Santos, JR (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",joost@gwu.edu,"Santos, Joost/AAH-1466-2019; Yu, Krista/AAG-6259-2020","Yu, Krista/0000-0002-3001-1793",,,,,39,38,48,2,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Our sample is interesting because it covers important periods or events: the second stage of economic transition in the aftermath of the collapse of socialism; the establishment of the eurozone at the turn of the century; and the enlargement of the eurozone to include the Eastern European countries of Slovenia and Slovakia. The data enable us to investigate how the introduction of market mechanisms in the early 1990s and the establishment and enlargement of the eurozone acted on real interest rate convergence. We test the real interest parity condition using a unit root test with and without structural breaks.

Results suggest that there is strong evidence of stationarity and relatively weaker evidence of structural breaks, particularly when using adaptive inflation expectations.","[Sonora, Robert J.] Ft Lewis Coll, Sch Business Adm, Durango, CO 81301 USA; [Tica, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Sonora, RJ (通讯作者)，Ft Lewis Coll, Sch Business Adm, Durango, CO 81301 USA.",,"Sonora, Robert/GQP-2058-2022; Tica, Josip/B-7628-2013","Tica, Josip/0000-0001-7937-1573; Sonora, Robert/0000-0003-4713-7082",,,,,27,1,1,0,10,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Moreover, despite opting for austerity and all the social and political consequences of achieving fiscal consolidation, the governing coalition in Estonia succeeded also in avoiding a negative political reaction from the voters and remained in power. The current article analyses the variables that made the austerity reforms in Estonia in 2008-11 electorally successful. The economic success of Estonia has otherwise been attributed to a combination of political, institutional, and economic factors: timing; a fiscal policy that was not pro-cyclical; the availability of reserves in Estonia; and the ownership structure of the banks. The present study asks more specifically about the variables that saw the economic success in the implementation of the austerity measures accompanied by a positive electoral outcome. As it will be argued, these factors include the communication strategy chosen intentionally or otherwise by the government, the design of the austerity measures, the peculiarity of the electoral cycle, lack of political alternatives, and the performance of neighbouring countries in implementing austerity measures.","[Veebel, Viljar] Estonian Natl Def Coll, Tartu, Estonia; [Veebel, Viljar] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ragnar Nurkse Sch Innovat & Governance, Dept Governance, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Kulu, Liina] Bank Estonia, Econ & Res Dept, Tallinn, Estonia",Estonian Military Academy; Tallinn University of Technology; Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank),"Veebel, V (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Estonian Natl Def Coll, Ragnar Nurkse Sch Innovat & Governance, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",viljar.veebel@mil.ee,"Veebel, Viljar/AAD-2852-2019","Veebel, Viljar/0000-0002-9122-0134",,,,,33,1,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Decrease of the personal income tax rate and increase of government spending on education turned out to be the most effective policy measures. It is important, though, to understand its transitory dynamic. Namely, as education expenditure is increased, certain amount of labour is temporarily withdrawn from its productive use and put into the educational system. Higher skill upgrade of labour requires longer and higher short-term labour force decrease, but also provides us with higher long-term growth. The households that would gain more utility from such policy scenarios are those with more skilled labour and thus higher income level.","[Verbic, Miroslav; Majcev, Boris] Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Verbic, Miroslav; Cok, Mitja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Verbic, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Res, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",miroslav.verbic@ef.uni-lj.si; majcenb@ier.si; mitja.cok@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Verbic, Miroslav/0000-0001-5506-0973",,,,,54,4,4,0,19,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

SERVQUAL method was applied with a seven-point Likert scale. The SERVQUAL method also took into account the extended minimum size. The study was conducted among the customers of the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) and the Agricultural Social Insurance Fund (KRUS) in north-eastern Poland. For five tested areas (tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy) 20 questions were assigned. Actual, expected, and minimum quality of provided services was determined. Additionally, the gaps were defined which allowed organizations to evaluate the service in terms of efficient and effective customer service policy. The gaps identify the areas on which the company should pay a particular attention. According to the respondents, assurance area plays a major role among the dimensions mentioned. However, the research shows that empathy area was rated as the highest by the respondents. In turn, customers have the highest expectations in relation to the area of assurance. The biggest gap was observed in the dimension of responsiveness. In general it can be stated that quality of insurance services provided by the surveyed institutions were assessed at the good level. In many areas, the amendments should be introduced indicated in the next part of the article. Moreover, customers were grouped by demographic and social variables, depicting that older and better educated customers are more satisfied with the insurance service quality. Scientific contribution of the authors is preparation of the research questionnaire measuring the quality of insurance services that can be used by studied institutions to make good decisions. The conclusion briefly describes the potential for appication of customer satisfaction research and customer service strategies in the social insurance sector. Due to the study carried out, market institutions can properly identify customer needs in the services they provide and see occurring discrepancies.","[Witkowska, Justyna] Univ Warmia & Mazury, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland; [Lakstutiene, Ausrine] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",University of Warmia & Mazury; Kaunas University of Technology,"Witkowska, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, M Oczapowski 4, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland.",justyna.witkowska@uwm.edu.pl; ausrine.lakstutiene@ktu.lt,"Witkowska, Justyna/ADH-4952-2022","Witkowska, Justyna/0000-0001-8478-0769",,,,,30,4,4,4,43,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Firms' information processing limit gives rise to imperfect knowledge about macroeconomic aggregates and endogenous information learning contingent on the monetary policy. Staggered price setting introduces the observed price duration and additional policy tradeoffs resulting from the interactions between nominal rigidities and imperfect information processing. The integrated model implies an optimal policy that commits to complete price stabilization in response to natural rate shocks but not in response to markup shocks. In the presence of markup shocks, it is optimal for the central bank to focus on price stabilization in the initial periods following markup shocks and shifts the emphasis to output gap stabilization later. Moreover, larger information capacity, stronger complementarities and more persistent shocks require more aggressive price stabilization in the short-run. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We rely on a case study we conducted on the socio-economic impact of La Notte della Taranta Festival, one of the most important European festivals dedicated to traditional music (about 170,000 participants per year), on the sub-region of southern Italy where it is held. Our evidence is based on a large survey, consisting of nearly 10,000 interviews to Festival attendees over a span of five editions (2007-2011). A primary result is that the initial economic investment in the Festival has brought a short-term return in terms of touristic attraction worth more than two times as much. More importantly, our results indicate that a cultural festival, despite being a mass gathering, is able to create strong bonds among its participants and between them and the area where the event takes place. Although these bonds are instantaneous, i.e. temporally restricted to the duration of the event, they are positively correlated with the economic impact of the event on the territory.

This article uses state tobacco taxes as an instrument for life expectancy to estimate the effect on earnings per capita in a panel of almost 3000 counties in the United States over the period 1970 to 2000. In the first stage of the model, we find that a one dollar increase in state tobacco taxes significantly increases life expectancy between 1.9% and 2.1%. Despite showing that tobacco tax is correlated with higher life expectancy and that, theoretically, improvements in health from reductions in smoking should lead to increased earnings, we find an insignificant impact of the induced gains in life expectancy from tobacco policy on county level earnings per capita over the period 1970 to 2000. The lack of significance is explained through local average treatment effects and the smaller economic impact of certain policies that impact health later in life. These results provide further evidence that the most effective interventions for improving income later in life are policy interventions with a direct impact on the health of younger cohorts rather than older cohorts.","[Bowser, Diana; Canning, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

We model this choice by assuming both competition between entrepreneurial (owner-managed) firms and competition between managerial firms in which market decisions are delegated from owners to revenue-concerned managers. While network externalities are shown not to alter the symmetric equilibrium quantity choice arising in the no-delegation case, sufficiently strong network effects allow us to eliminate the multiplicity of equilibria under delegation and lead to a unique equilibrium in which both firms choose price.

We examine the Korean soju industry, in which the government designated only one firm for each regional market and obliged consumers to purchase local brands. We find that consumers tend to purchase local brands even after this regulation was removed. To explain the persistent leadership of local firms in their respective markets, we propose an identity-based thew), with three theoretical implications. In particular, we consider regionalism in Korean politics, and use presidential election results as events that triggered higher identity costs, thereby increasing local market shares of designated local companies. We find empirical evidence consistent with three theoretical implications, which is robust to several alternative specifications. We further find that various other mechanisms are not fully consistent with our data, suggesting that local identity, once established, can be an important source behind persistence in preferences for local brands.","[Choi, Jay Pil] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Choi, Jay Pil] Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Hong, Seung-Hyun] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Jeon, Seonghoon] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",University of New South Wales Sydney; Yonsei University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Sogang University,"Hong, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jay.choi@unsw.edu.au; hyunhong@illinois.edu; jeonsh@sogang.ac.kr,,,,,,,32,3,4,0,22,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

This stands in sharp contrast to the perceived view that the Cape was an economic and social backwater, a slave economy with slow growth and little progress. Following a national accounts framework, we find that Cape settlers' per capita income is similar to the most prosperous countries of the time - Holland and England. We trace the roots of this result, showing that it is partly explained by a highly skewed population structure and very low dependency ratio of slavery, and attempt to link the eighteenth-century Cape Colony experience to twentieth-century South African income levels.","[Fourie, Johan; Van Zanden, Jan Luiten] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Van Zanden, Jan Luiten] Univ Utrecht, Ctr Global Econ Hist, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Stellenbosch University; Utrecht University,"Fourie, J (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",johanf@sun.ac.za; jvz@iisg.nl,,"Fourie, Johan/0000-0002-7341-017X",,,,,36,34,35,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

This paper chose Indonesia as a case study and employed both a linear cointegration test and a nonlinear cointegration test to examine the relationship between population and income. The tests detected a long-run equilibrium relationship between population and real per capita income in Indonesia. Also, the causality test indicated that there existed a unidirectional causality from Indonesia's population expansion to the country's economic growth, but not vice versa. These results indicate a population-driven economic development in Indonesia. In other words, Indonesia could represent a textbook case of population-induced development where a rapid population growth stimulates economic development.","[Furuoka, Fumitaka] Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Furuoka, F (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",fumitakamy@gmail.com,"Furuoka, Fumitaka/C-4197-2012","Furuoka, Fumitaka/0000-0003-1863-387X",,,,,40,5,5,0,26,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

However, more research is required into the effects of this tool in isolation. A case in point is the so-called Renove plan in Spain. First, the inefficiency losses (dead-weight losses) associated with energy efficiency rebates must be taken into account. Such a policy may also encourage the large-scale purchasing of energy-efficient appliances, which may finally result in an increase in electricity consumption (rebound effect). Furthermore, although a subsidy is more widely accepted than other tools from social and political viewpoints, especially than taxes, the fiscal consolidation challenge faced by many countries reduces the scope for environmental policy measures on the expenditure side of the budget and strengthens the need to use taxes to meet the agreed policy objectives. This paper shows that the current application of the Spanish Renove plan with rebates on the dishwasher market for energy efficient appliances generates some welfare losses, a rebound effect and a considerable deficit in public budgets. The paper examines and assesses the effect of different combinations of taxes and rebates in the case of dishwashers in Spain based on their performance in terms of economic efficiency, environmental effectiveness and implementation feasibility.

The essential idea is that banks are recapitalized by private investors when negative events would otherwise cause a write-down of capital-or even bank insolvency. There are two modes of private insurance: pure insurance contracts and contingent debt contracts. In the former, funding of banks and insurance are separated, whereas in the latter, debt holders provide insurance. We summarize the main insights regarding the potential and limits of private insurance. We also discuss how such crisis insurance could be strengthened through complementary regulatory measures.

In this paper, we discuss how a multi-method approach she pioneered may be used to study the robustness of social-ecological systems. We synthesize lessons learned from a series of studies on small-scale irrigation systems in which we use case-study analysis, experimental methods in laboratory and field settings, and mathematical models. The accumulated insights show the importance of creating institutional arrangements that fit the human ecology within the biophysical constraints of the system. The examples of work based on multiple methods approaches presented here highlight several lessons. For example, experimental work helps us better understand the details of how the ability to maintain trust relationships, low levels of inequality, and low transaction costs of coordination are critical for success. Likewise, the integration of case-study analysis and modeling helps us better understand how systems that can leverage biophysical characteristics to help address challenges of monitoring, sanctioning, and coordination may be able to increase their chances of success.","[Janssen, Marco A.; Anderies, John M.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Study Inst Divers, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Janssen, MA (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Ctr Study Inst Divers, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Marco.Janssen@asu.edu; m.anderies@asu.edu,,,"Directorate For Geosciences [1115054] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0748632] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,56,37,50,0,55,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This paper builds a simple model of copyright levies and investigates welfare implications of the harmonization of levy rates. The result is that, when the policy-maker places sufficient weight on the interests of collecting societies, harmonization could reduce social welfare. When countries are asymmetric, the country with a larger proportion of foreign consumption and more inefficient tax system loses more from harmonization. A calibration exercise using European data shows that harmonization would increase aggregate social welfare. However, in some countries, policy-makers are worse off although consumers are better off with harmonization. Especially, when larger countries have higher decision weights, the policy-makers are worse off overall, and hence would not agree to harmonize the levy rates.","Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Kim, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",JinHyuk.Kim@Colorado.edu,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The findings of empirical analysis imply that the income inequality for urban households in China is mainly related to the coastal provinces with relatively higher return to capital, capital intensity, and thus capital income in the state sector. The Chinese government should redirect their policy that emphasizes the role of large enterprises in the state sector and subsidizes the capital in the capital-intensive state sector.

However, such studies have not modelled the effects of the presence of a shadow economy, even though informal markets account for a significant and growing part of GDP in many developed economies. This paper analyses this important link using a Computable General Equilibrium model for the case of Spain, with historically high unemployment rates and a large informal economy. Since the informal labour is not taxed, when the green tax is introduced and the tax on formal labour is reduced, the pre-existing non-environment-related inefficiency of the tax system is remarkably reduced. Our analysis shows that if the distortions created by the shadow economy are considered, the case for an environmental tax reform where revenues are used to reduce labour taxes is strengthened and the possibility to find a double divided is more likely.

The most appropriate way to obtain consistent SUTs at both current and constant prices is to balance them simultaneously but, in this case, the main complexity is the nonlinearity that inevitably occurs. This paper proposes a new method to balance extremely large sets of National Accounts simultaneously at current and constant prices. The distinctive features of the proposed balancing method are its flexibility, which is very high compared with the other methods in the literature, and its capability to allow the control of the consistency of the system of deflators that are used. This new balancing method has been applied to balance the Italian 2006 SUTs simultaneously at current and constant prices, and it has yielded very good outcomes.","Univ Bari, Dept Econ & Math, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Nicolardi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Bari, Dept Econ & Math, Bari, Italy.",vittorio.nicolardi@uniba.it,,"Nicolardi, Vittorio/0000-0001-5163-7288",,,,,15,8,8,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

It is well known that exchange rate fluctuations are very difficult to predict using economic models, and that a random walk forecasts exchange rates better than any economic model (the Meese and Rogoff puzzle). However, the recent literature has identified a series of fundamentals/methodologies that claim to have resolved the puzzle. This article provides a critical review of the recent literature on exchange rate forecasting and illustrates the new methodologies and fundamentals that have been recently proposed in an up-to-date, thorough empirical analysis. Overall, our analysis of the literature and the data suggests that the answer to the question: Are exchange rates predictable? is, It depends-on the choice of predictor, forecast horizon, sample period, model, and forecast evaluation method. Predictability is most apparent when one or more of the following hold: the predictors are Taylor rule or net foreign assets, the model is linear, and a small number of parameters are estimated. The toughest benchmark is the random walk without drift.","[Rossi, Barbara] Univ Pompeu Fabra, ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University,"Rossi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, ICREA, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Rossi, Barbara/D-6756-2013; PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017",,ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,161,305,343,10,113,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

This paper adds to these explanations by showing that common lands positively contributed to achieving significantly higher levels of both schooling expenditure and literacy rates. By supporting both municipal and households' incomes, these collective resources sustained not only the local supply of education, but also the demand for it, although their influence decreased over time. Likewise, either low levels of economic development prevented human capital from growing endogenously or demand factors were not as important as previously argued. Lastly, even though the active intervention of the central government was crucial to promote education, its effort was not enough and human capital in Spain lagged behind other European countries in the early stages of economic development.","Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Tapia, FJB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England.",francisco.beltran@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,"Beltran Tapia, Francisco/H-4337-2015","Beltran Tapia, Francisco/0000-0002-7354-5699",,,,,89,16,17,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This paper presents an alternative approach to exploitation theory which is related to the New Interpretation (Dumenil 1980; Foley 1982).

We use the concept of pre-donations, namely, a redefinition of the game in which each agent commits to transfer a share of its output to the other agent (Sertel, 1991). Conditions are established under which a system of pre-donations may facilitate a truce. In particular, for conflicts involving high costs there is a distributive mechanism, acceptable for both parties, whereby cease-fire is the best strategy for both of them. However, in many cases the conditions are not right for such a scheme of pre-donations to be effective. Some limitations of the framework are analyzed and the model is extended to deal with certain shortcomings in the basic setup. To illustrate the relevance of the theoretical results, we briefly describe the circumstances that have characterized the negotiation processes between the Colombian government and various illegal groups in this long-lasting armed conflict.

Using the latest nationally representative household survey-the 2007 Labour Force Survey-from which wage data are available, we find the following: first, the gender wage gap is higher at the bottom of the wage distribution than at the top; second, the constant or 'pure discrimination' accounts for the majority of the gap between the 20 and 50th quantiles; third, negative or favourable unexplained contributions related to a positive policy shock for domestic workers at the 20 and 30th quantiles and formal sector employment both served to narrow the gap between the 20 and 50th quantiles; finally, between the 70 and 90th quantiles, large and positive unexplained contributions associated mainly with degree holders, wage-employed workers and public sector and managerial workers (at the 90th quantile) were tempered by both endowment effects in favour of women and negative unexplained contributions. The favourable endowment effects arise mainly from workers with higher education, professional workers, public sector workers and workers in the formal sector (at the 90th quantile), while negative unexplained contributions were mainly related to the constant or 'pure favourable discrimination'.","[Bhorat, Haroon] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Bhorat, Haroon; Goga, Sumayya] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Dev Policy Res Unit, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Bhorat, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",haroon.bhorat@uct.ac.za,,,,,,,20,21,23,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The model accounts for aggregate fluctuations by assigning a dominant role to financial frictions in amplifying conventional (temporary) productivity shocks, whereas trend shocks play a minor role.

In contrast to previous research, a unified statistical framework is used to determine the number of governance indices to create, the conceptual content of each index, and the relative importance each has in accounting for the observable data. The four indices are labeled market infrastructure, downside governance risk, order, and civil liberties. Confidence intervals are calculated for each country, for each index to aid in the comparison of scores. As an application, the indices are used as explanatory variables in cross-country income regressions. Instrumental variables estimates show that market infrastructure and civil liberties both exert statistically and economically significant effects on per capita income, controlling for geography (malaria risk) and international trade.

In this paper, we provide a formal representation of inductive reasoning in the context of a dynamic game with differential awareness. We show that, given differential awareness over time and between players, individuals can derive inductive support for propositions expressing their own unawareness.

We find that operas in their premiere season are more popular than reprises. Demand is lower for classical operas and higher for domestic operas and for performances with a famous opera singer. Press reviews and the overall popularity of the opera piece have the expected effects. There is also evidence of seasonal effects. By excluding temporarily discounted tickets, controlling for performance characteristics and quality and using a method that takes into account capacity constraints, we are able to credibly estimate the price elasticity of demand. The overall elasticity is close to unity: on average, a 1 % increase in prices would result in 1.16 % decrease in demand.","Univ Tampere, Sch Management, Tampere 33014, Finland",Tampere University,"Laamanen, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Sch Management, Tampere 33014, Finland.",jani-petri.laamanen@uta.fi,,,,,,,22,18,18,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Our goal is to add new evidence on the factors that influence the introduction and adoption of decentralized and less carbon-intensive energy sources in developing countries, and, more generally, to the empirical debate on the energy ladder. We capitalize on a unique representative survey on energy use and sources from Kenya, one of the few relatively well-established SHS markets in the world. Our results reveal some very interesting patterns of the fuel transition in the context of lighting fuel choices. While we find clear evidence for a cross-sectional energy ladder, the income threshold for modem fuel use - including solar energy use - to move beyond traditional and transitional fuels is very high. Income and education turn out to be key determinants of SHS adoption, but we also find a very pronounced effect of SHS clustering, i.e. the prevalence of SHS in the proximity of a potential user increases the likelihood of adoption. In addition, we do not find a negative correlation between grid access and SHS use. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In line with economic theory, we show that proportional systems shift spending toward broad goods (like education and welfare benefits) but decrease spending on geographically targetable goods (like roads). We find little evidence that proportional representation increases the overall size of government. An analysis of the underlying theoretical mechanisms reveals that proportional representation increases electoral turnout, left-wing representation, and political fragmentation. These changes in political representation explain a substantial share of the rise in education spending, but a small share of the rise in welfare spending or the decline in road expenditures.","[Funk, Patricia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Funk, Patricia] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Gathmann, Christina] Heidelberg Univ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Funk, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",patricia.funk@upf.edu; christina.gathmann@awi.uni-heidelberg.de,"Gathmann, Christina/AAA-3955-2020; Funk, Patricia/E-7138-2013","Gathmann, Christina/0000-0002-9158-0375; Funk, Patricia/0000-0002-0263-7879",,,,,33,37,38,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The labor market is characterized by search frictions and uncertain quality of the match between a worker and a job. Using referrals increases the arrival rate of applicants and provides more accurate signals regarding a worker's suitability for the job. Consistent with the data, referred workers are predicted to have higher wage, higher productivity and lower separation rates and these differentials decline with tenure. The model is extended by introducing heterogeneity in firm productivity and allowing the endogenous determination of signal accuracy. High productivity firms are predicted to invest more in increasing signal accuracy and use referrals to a lesser extent. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Large jurisdictions (cities) compete both locally with smaller neighbouring communities and interregionally with more distant cities, while small jurisdictions (hinterlands) compete only with other jurisdictions in their neighbourhood. The model structure is motivated by recent empirical findings as well as survey results among German mayors: the perceived intensity of competition for firms varies considerably between jurisdictions and can mainly be explained by the size and location of the jurisdiction. Our model predicts - contrary to earlier findings for competition between countries or regions - that capital taxes of large jurisdictions fall more strongly with increasing interregional competition and may eventually lead to smaller taxes than in small jurisdictions. Hinterlands are therefore less affected from globalisation than cities. We contrast our results with a standard tax competition model in which all jurisdictions compete with all other jurisdictions.

However, since the beginning of this century the number of disability cases has dropped remarkably due to some very successful policy reforms. An administrative data set concerning Dutch disability benefit recipients from 1999 to 2010 was used to analyse the immediate effects of the recent policy measures on disability inflow and outflow. Three inflow-related measures introduced between 1998 and 2004 have had a large effect on the disability stock, reducing inflow into the disability scheme by over 40 percentage points. The new disability scheme introduced in 2006 created an additional reduction of over 20 percentage points. Effects differ substantially among demographic groups and sectors of economic activities. Furthermore, it is shown that the main outflow-related measure, re-examinations of younger beneficiaries, has had ambiguous effects on the disability stock.","[van Sonsbeek, Jan-Maarten; Gradus, Raymond H.

It also investigates whether monetary policy in South Africa can indeed be described by a linear Taylor rule or, instead, by a nonlinear rule. In particular, we extend the linear Taylor rule to a regime-switching framework, where the transition from one regime to another occurs in a smooth way, using a logistic smooth transition regression (LSTR) approach. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the behaviour of monetary authorities in emerging countries, particularly in South Africa, in response to changes in macroeconomic variables over time based on LSTR model. In this sense, we empirically analyse Taylor-type equations for short-term interest rate in South Africa using quarterly data covering the period 1995:Q3-2011:Q4. Our results show that the nonlinear approach leads to the reduction of the measurement errors by 150 basis points in 1998 and 40 basis points in 2009. Moreover, the South Africa's monetary policy exhibits nonlinear patterns that better capture special events and unexpected contingencies and may contain relevant information rendering it applicable only to unusual conditions i.e., recession. Additionally, the presence of asymmetries in the reaction function of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) requires disconnection from its automatic pilot rule and use of judgement to make decisions.

Real output is conventionally measured as value added corrected for price inflation, but there are some industries in which no independent measure of value added is possible and existing statistics depend on imputing value added to equal income. Indexes of output that exclude these imputations are closely correlated with employment over the whole period and remain more closely correlated during the current business cycle. This analysis offers insights into deeper structural changes that have taken place in the US economy over the past few decades in a context marked by the following three factors: (i) the service (especially the financial) sector has grown in importance, (ii) the economy has become more globalised, and (iii) the policy orientation has increasingly become neo-liberal. We demonstrate an economically significant reduction in the coefficient relating employment growth to output growth over the business cycles since 1985. Some of this change is due to sectoral shifts towards services, but an important part of it reflects a reduction in the coefficient for the goods and material value-adding sectors.","[Foley, Duncan K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Basu, D (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 1012 Thompson Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",dbasu@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,26,40,46,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The sample covers 1999-2011.The analysis is performed for the main expenditure aggregates as well as their subcomponents. The disaggregated approach is useful in revealing potential differences in the cyclical properties of individual expenditure components since they could move in different and possibly offsetting directions. Procyclical behaviour is found for total general government expenditure as well as for its main components, i.e. current and capital expenditure. The exclusion of interest payments does not alter the result that output expansion is strongly associated with growth in major expenditure aggregates. Furthermore, the same proportional reaction is found for capital expenditure, indicating the presence of the voracity effect. The subcomponents of current expenditure reveal a slightly different pattern. While government wage and non-wage consumption behave in a procyclical manner, social transfers are countercyclical. However, their countercyclical behaviour is not strong enough to overcome the procyclical influence of the wage bill and non-wage consumption on the overall cyclical stance of current expenditure.

Simulation results, based on a stylised version of the Polish pension system, show that, in the baseline scenario, the weakening of the second pillar would permanently lower future pension system debt, chiefly as a result of a cut in replacement rates. But using a combination of pessimistic assumptions including strong population ageing, low real wage growth and an indexation of existing pension benefits on nominal wage growth rather than inflation coupled with bringing in tax expenditures related to the third voluntary pension pillar and an increase in the share of minimum pensioners leads to higher pension system deficits and eventually more public debt at a very long horizon. The simulation results also suggest that if Poland had not transformed its pay-as-you-go first pension pillar into a defined contribution from a defined benefit system, the weakening of the second pillar would deteriorate fiscal sustainability relatively quickly in the baseline scenario. This result suggests that the Hungarian pension reversal would reduce deficit and debt only temporarily, mainly because of Hungary's costly defined benefit first pension pillar: the weakening of the second pillar is tantamount to swapping low current replacement rates (in the defined contribution second pillar) against high future replacement rates in the defined benefit first pension pillar.

Absent institutional constraints like prices and budgets, the optimal consumption rule would have marginal utility increase at the preferential discount rate. In a rational competitive equilibrium where households fully annuitize, the growth rate of marginal utility will be the discount rate minus the interest rate, resulting in a consumption profile that is too flat. Accidental bequests transfer wealth from the old to the young, steepening the consumption profile and yielding a better equilibrium. If households are restricted to Keynesian consumption functions, the optimal irrational equilibrium with standard preferences can replicate observed consumption and macroeconomic behavior, and the equilibrium without annuities delivers higher utility than the equilibrium with annuities. Whereas preceding papers have merely hypothesized that households might engage in socially optimal, yet irrational behavior, the failure of households to annuitize is a real-world example of this. Policymakers should not take steps to encourage more annuitization by the public. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The labour share has been decreasing across OECD countries since the 1980s, sparking a renewed interest in what is behind this trend. The aim of this paper is to take a systematic approach to estimating the coefficients of factors explaining these movements across countries. In particular, we focus on proper dynamic model specification and test the validity of the homogeneity assumption of slope coefficients frequently implied in previous studies. We employ fixed effect estimators as well as pooled mean group and mean group estimators, the latter in a dynamic heterogeneous panel framework. We find support for a dynamic estimation setup and derive statements regarding the homogeneity assumption with respect to the three most prominent explanatory variables in the literature: the capital-output ratio, total factor productivity and trade openness. We find the first two variables to decrease the labour share, to be better captured by dynamic estimators and to be better identified in more recent time periods. With regard to trade, we see it depressing the labour share since 1980 only. We furthermore provide evidence on increased cross-country homogeneity over time for all of the analysed driving forces of the labour share.","[Hogrefe, Jan; Kappler, Marcus] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Kappler, M (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, POB 103443, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",hogrefe@zew.de; kappler@zew.de,,,,,,,15,10,11,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The restrictions imposed by the state specification have substantive a priori disadvantages, implying that use of the state specification requires justification by a specification test. Because the state and event specifications are non-nested, a classical approach to specification testing runs into practical problems. We demonstrate the advantages of a Bayesian approach to the specification testing problem using two applications to young adult prosocial behavior-charitable giving and volunteering. Substantive results are that family structure transitions during adolescence are negatively associated with subsequent giving, and transitions during middle childhood are positively associated with subsequent volunteering. There are other substantive results that would have been missed had we not realized that the state and event specifications impose restrictions on the underlying model and had we not made specification testing a prerequisite for substantive analysis.","[Ottoni-Wilhelm, Mark] Indiana Univ, Ctr Philanthropy, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Ottoni-Wilhelm, Mark; Bandy, Robert] IUPUI, Dept Econ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,"Ottoni-Wilhelm, M (通讯作者)，IUPUI, Dept Econ, 425 Univ Blvd, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",mowilhel@iupui.edu,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Consequently, it provides five main innovations: (i) it analyzes OP and EXR using the recently developed test by Narayan and Popp (2010) (NP) which allows for two structural breaks in the data series (ii) it employs the Narayan and Liu (2011) (NL) GARCH unit root test to evaluate robustness of NP test (iii) it considers the newly developed VAR-GARCH model to capture the spillover effects in the returns and volatility of OP and EXR; (iv) it modifies the VAR-GARCH model to account for structural breaks obtained from the NP procedure and (v) using the results obtained from the VAR-GARCH model, it examines the optimal weights of holding oil and foreign exchange (FX) assets and also computes the hedging ratios in the presence of oil risk. Based on the NP and NL tests, it finds robust structural breaks that coincide with the period of global financial crisis as well as period of FX crisis in Nigeria. Also, it establishes a bidirectional returns and spillover transmission between oil and FX markets. Finally, its findings reveal evidence of hedging effectiveness involving oil and FX markets in Nigeria and thus, the inclusion of oil into a diversified portfolio of FX will improve its risk-adjusted return performance.

Since the financial sector plays a vital role in mobilizing and allocating savings into productive ventures, the core issue of this investigation remains important for developing economics. The examination is based on a Cobb-Douglas production augmented by incorporating financial development. A simulation based ARDL bounds testing and Gregory and Hansen's structural break cointegration approaches are being utilized in this study. Cointegration is being found between the series in the presence of a structural break in 1992.

The resale market is modeled as a stochastic ultimatum bargaining game between the two buyers. We fully characterize an optimal mechanism under general conditions. Surprisingly, in this optimal mechanism, the seller never allocates the object to the regular buyer regardless of his bargaining power in the resale market. The seller sells only to the publicly known buyer, and reveals no additional information to the resale market. The possibility of resale causes the seller to sometimes hold back the object, which under our setup is never optimal if resale is prohibited. We find that the seller's revenue is increasing in the publicly known buyer's bargaining power in the resale market. When the publicly known buyer has full bargaining power, Myerson's optimal revenue is achieved; when the publicly known buyer has no bargaining power, a conditionally efficient mechanism prevails.

It is well known that majoritarian systems give rise to highly biased seat-vote curves, causing representation to be less than ideal. What should, therefore, be the optimal constituency design when the objective is to maximize voters' welfare? I show that when parties take account of districting while setting platforms, then the district design problem reduces to a very simple rule: do nothing when voters are risk neutral, and - when voters are risk averse - choose a bias that is against the largest partisan group. Calibrating the model on data of the U.S. State legislative elections during the 1990s, I show that the welfare gain due to optimal districting is very small. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

(2010). We model a banking sector and a monetary authority setting interest rates and credit lending conditions in a framework combining Keynesian mechanisms of demand generation, a Schumpeterian innovation-fueled process of growth and Minskian credit dynamics. We show that the model is able to account for a rich ensemble of empirical features underlying current and past recessions, including the impact of financial factors on the real economy, and the role in that of income distribution. We find that more unequal economies are exposed to more severe business cycles fluctuations, higher unemployment rates, and higher probability of crises. From a policy perspective, the model suggests that fiscal policies dampen business cycles, reduce unemployment and the likelihood of experiencing a huge crisis and, in some circumstances, also affect long-term growth. Furthermore, the more income distribution is skewed toward profits, the greater the effects of fiscal policies. Interest rates have instead a strong non-linear effect on macroeconomic dynamics. Tuning the interest rate when it is below a given threshold has no detectable effects. Conversely, increasing the interest rate when it is above that threshold yields lower and more volatile output growth, higher unemployment rates, and higher likelihood of crises.

Starting from a benchmark economy without social security, we introduce alternative pension systems and compare the costs arising from liquidity constraints as well as distortions of labor supply versus the benefits from insurance provision against income and lifespan uncertainty. Our findings suggest an optimal replacement rate of about 50 % of average earnings. In our model a single-tier earnings-related pension system yields the highest efficiency gains dominating flat benefits as well as two-tier systems of any form. We also show that the negative correlation between pension progressivity and pension generosity of real-world social security systems can be justified on efficiency grounds. Finally, our results indicate a positive impact of means-testing flat benefits against earnings-related benefits within multi-pillar pension systems.","[Fehr, Hans; Uhde, Johannes] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Econ, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Fehr, Hans] Univ Wurzburg, CESifo, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Fehr, Hans] Univ Wurzburg, Netspar, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg; Ifo Institut; University of Wurzburg; University of Wurzburg,"Fehr, H (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Dept Econ, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",hans.fehr@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,,21,11,12,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2013,40.0,3,,,SI,,457,482,,10.1007/s10663-013-9214-2,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,181KH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321666000005,0

The DD became smaller in anticipation of failure for most cases. Both the DD and DD spread, defined as the DD of a failed bank minus the DD of sound banks, were better indicators for deterioration of a failed bank's health than other traditional indicators. A probit model yielded that the quality of the DD was surely better than other measures. For a bank which window-dressed its financial statements, neither the DD nor the DD spread predicted the failure. However, the result was partly due to lack of transparency in financial statements and disclosed information. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The first study showed that dispositional envy correlated quite strongly with individual's ratings of how much they would envy another's success for a number of different objects of envy. Studies 2, 3 and 4 found little correlation between dispositional envy and rated preferences for living in a society with more equal incomes for five scenarios which were predicted to be productive of envy for samples of New Zealand students, East German students, and New Zealand general public respectively. Study 3 also found a similar result for an experiment in which distribution decisions implied corresponding money transfers to the participants.

We rely on a model that features Borrowers and Savers and allows for over-borrowing induced by news-shock-driven cycles. We find that policy that responds to changes in financial variables is socially optimal. Considering the use of a single policy instrument, both types of agents are better off when the interest rate optimally responds to credit growth. When we allow for the implementation of both interest-rate and LTV policies, heterogeneity in the welfare implications is key in determining the optimal use of policy instruments. The optimal policy for the Borrowers is characterized by a LTV ratio that responds countercyclically to credit growth, which most effectively stabilizes credit relative to GDP. In contrast, the optimal policy for the Savers features a constant LTV ratio coupled with an interest-rate response to credit growth. News-shock-driven cycles account for most of the gains from a policy response to changes in financial variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First, what are the genetic and environmental contributions to being a public sector employee, and second, are there wage gaps between public and private sector employees. The results indicate that 34 to 40% of the observed variance in the tendency to be a public sector employee can be attributed to genetic factors, with no influence of the shared environment. Furthermore, at least one-third of the genetic variance is mediated through educational attainment. The results from the wage gap analysis suggest that OLS estimates are downward biased. In fact, while OLS estimates indicate a negative wage gap for both males (seven per cent) and females (four per cent), the within-twin estimates do not indicate any inequalities with respect to pay offered by the two sectors.

Since then over 100 Indian gaming centers have sprung up across Oklahoma. Casino gambling can have a great affect on surrounding communities. However, there is a distinct possibility that these gains from casino gambling could be offset by social costs associated with problem gambling and crime, the cannibalization of existing industry (where funds are simply redirected from existing industries), and by any additional public expenditure needed to regulate or maintain the casino. For twenty years Native Americans have been operating casinos all over Oklahoma, yet the economic effects of these Indian gaming institutions have gone largely unstudied. This paper offers significant conclusions regarding how Indian gaming impacts communities using data collected from the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 500 Nations Indian gaming website, and phone interviews with various gaming centers. Testable, quantitative conclusions provide a tool not only for Native American tribes but also policy makers in determining optimal amounts of gaming centers and how these centers are regulated and operated.

Experimental tests of such models typically focus on only one of these two dimensions. In this paper we consider both forecasting and optimization decisions in an experimental cobweb economy. We report results from four main experimental treatments: (1) subjects form forecasts only, (2) subjects determine quantity only (solve an optimization problem), (3) they do both and (4) they are paired in teams and one member is assigned the forecasting role while the other is assigned the optimization task. All treatments converge to Rational Expectation Equilibrium (REE), but at different speeds. We observe that performance is the best in treatment 1 and the worst in Treatment 3. We further find that most subjects use adaptive rules to forecast prices. Given a price forecast, subjects are less likely to make conditionally optimal production decisions in Treatment 3 where the forecast is made by themselves, than in Treatment 4 where the forecast is made by the other member of their team, which suggests that two heads are better than one in term of the speed of finding the REE.

Workers in the young generation are offered employment contracts designed by the firms' owners who belong to the old generation. When old, employed workers are granted ownership rights as long as the firm continues to operate. In line with theoretical predictions, the results indicate that as firm longevity increases, the recursive nature of the contracts leads to a rat race characterized by low wages, high effort levels, and rent dissipation.

The empirical results show that: 1) the risk factor - the proportion of the total amount of overdue loans to total loans - affects the value of firms technical efficiency. 2) From the standard deviation of the three-year average TGR between domestic and foreign banks, domestic banks reach 0.19802, which is much higher than foreign banks' 0.00388.

An important exception arises when players interact locally in small close-knit groups; in this case convergence can be rapid for small noise and an arbitrarily large population.

As such no inter-bank market structure maximizes stability under all conditions. In contrast, deposit insurance costs are always reduced under greater numbers of inter-bank lending relationships.

This paper finds evidence that effects for oil-importing and oil-exporting countries run in opposite directions. Oil price hikes have a negative effect on the stock markets of oil-importing countries, while the impact is positive for the stock markets of oil-exporting countries. Statistical tests support the presence of asymmetric effects only in oil-importing countries. Oil price volatility has a negative impact in stock markets of oil-importing countries and positive in oil-exporting countries. Moreover, oil volatility seems to be affected asymmetrically by oil price changes. Oil price drops increase oil volatility more than oil price hikes do.

The labor income tax for financing pay-as-you-go social security is determined in a majoritarian voting game played by successive generations. When the interest-rate elasticity of consumption is low, the political equilibrium might be characterized by an equilibrium where the old and the middle-income young individuals form a coalition in favor of a higher tax rate and greater social security, while the low- and the high-income young individuals favor a lower tax rate and less social security. In this equilibrium, the size of social security is decreased by the mean-preserving reduction of a decisive voter's wage if he/she is borrowing-constrained.","[Arawatari, Ryo] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ono, Tetsuo] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Nagoya University; Osaka University,"Arawatari, R (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",arawatari@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp; tono@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Arawatari, Ryo/HKO-6865-2023","Arawatari, Ryo/0000-0001-6875-881X; Ono, Tetsuo/0000-0002-9838-828X",,,,,28,4,4,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Moreover, the value of the beta and its coefficient of determination (R-squared) vary with different parameters used for estimating the beta. In this paper, we investigate for the parameters that provide a higher explanation when we estimate the beta on the Portuguese stock market. We use all nine economic groups listed on the Euronext Lisbon and, for each of those groups, determine which company has the highest market capitalization and highest turnover at the same time, measured in millions of Euros and thousands of Euros, respectively. The linear regression and correlation coefficient between each of the companies can be calculated by studying two national indexes (PSI20 and PSI General) to determine if they get better results with respect to a given period, frequency data or index. We conclude that the explanatory power of R-squared in the Portuguese stock market is very low, independent of the parameters used. When analyzing the year 2008 using linear regression, it remains unclear whether it is preferable to use daily returns or weekly returns, since half of the surveyed companies report the highest yield using either method. The explanatory power of R-squared is higher when using extended time periods and monthly returns, and the results become more accurate when doing the regressions with the PSI20 Index.","[Barajas, Angel] Univ Vigo, Fac Business Adm & Tourism, Dept Accountancy & Finance, Vigo, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Barajas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Fac Business Adm & Tourism, Dept Accountancy & Finance, Vigo, Spain.",abarajas@uvigo.es; soniacarvalho@esce.ipvc.pt,"Carvalho, Sónia/HHC-4866-2022; Barajas, Angel/B-4698-2012","Carvalho, Sónia/0000-0002-5466-107X; Barajas, Angel/0000-0002-0198-4457",,,,,32,0,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In this paper, we will make four arguments. First, the increase in the incomes and wages of the top 1 percent over the last three decades should be interpreted as driven largely by the creation and/or redistribution of economic rents, and not simply as the outcome of well-functioning competitive markets rewarding skills or productivity based on marginal differences. This rise in rents accruing to the top 1 percent could be the result of increased opportunities for rentshifting, increased incentives for rent-shifting, or a combination of both. Second, this rise in incomes at the very top has been the primary impediment to having growth in living standards for low- and moderate-income households approach the growth rate of economy-wide productivity. Third, because this rise in top incomes is largely driven by rents, there is the potential for checking (or even reversing) this rise through policy measures with little to no adverse impact on overall economic growth. Lastly, this analysis suggests two complementary approaches for policymakers wishing to reverse the rise in the top 1 percent's share of income: dismantling the institutional sources of their increased ability to channel rents their way and/or reducing the return to this rent-seeking by significantly increasing marginal rates of taxation on high incomes.","[Bivens, Josh; Mishel, Lawrence] Econ Policy Inst, Washington, DC USA",,"Bivens, J (通讯作者)，Econ Policy Inst, Washington, DC USA.",jbivens@epi.org; lmishel@epi.org,,,,,,,54,85,94,0,22,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Moreover, these new inequalities have primarily benefited the top 1 percent and even the top .01 percent. These groups seem sufficiently small that economic inequality could be held in check by political equality in the form of one person, one vote. In this paper, we explore five possible reasons why the US political system has failed to counterbalance rising inequality. First, both Republicans and many Democrats have experienced an ideological shift toward acceptance of a form of free market capitalism that offers less support for government provision of transfers, lower marginal tax rates for those with high incomes, and deregulation of a number of industries. Second, immigration and low turnout of the poor have combined to make the distribution of voters more weighted to high incomes than is the distribution of households. Third, rising real income and wealth has made a larger fraction of the population less attracted to turning to government for social insurance. Fourth, the rich have been able to use their resources to influence electoral, legislative, and regulatory processes through campaign contributions, lobbying, and revolving door employment of politicians and bureaucrats. Fifth, the political process is distorted by institutions that reduce the accountability of elected officials to the majority and hampered by institutions that combine with political polarization to create policy gridlock.","[Bonica, Adam] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [McCarty, Nolan] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Poole, Keith T.] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Rosenthal, Howard] NYU, New York, NY USA",Stanford University; Princeton University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; New York University,"Bonica, A (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",bonica@stanford.edu; nmccarty@princeton.edu; ktpoole@uga.edu; howardrosenthal@nyu.edu,"McCarty, Nolan M/C-2507-2008; Bonica, Adam/AAQ-1776-2021","Bonica, Adam/0000-0002-3004-9441; McCarty, Nolan/0000-0002-0538-1928",,,,,47,187,224,2,75,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations require comparable treatment of demand reduction and generation in the wholesale electric market so that they are compensated at the same market clearing price. The new regulations measure demand reduction as a reduction from a customer baseline, a historically based estimate of the expected consumption. In this paper, we study the incentive effects on the efficiency of the demand response regulation using a static equilibrium model and a dynamic extension of the model. Our analysis provides three main results. Firstly, our analysis shows that the demand reduction payment will induce consumers to (1) inflate the customer baseline by increasing consumption above the already excessive level during normal peak periods and (2) exaggerate demand reduction by decreasing consumption beyond the efficient level during a demand response event. This result persists when applied to alternative baseline designs in a dynamic model. Secondly, we study alternative policy remedies to restore the efficiency of demand response regulation and introduce a newapproach to define the customer baseline as a fixed proportion of an aggregate baseline. In particular, the aggregate baseline approach can significantly weaken or eliminate the incentive to inflate the baseline. Finally, we illustrate that if the baseline inflation problem is solved and demand and supply functions are linear, the current policy can produce a net social welfare gain. However, the welfare improvement requires that demand reduction be paid only when the wholesale price is at least twice the fixed retail rate. This argues that the policy should include a sufficiently high threshold price below which demand response is not dispatched.","[Chao, Hung-po; DePillis, Mario] ISO New England, Holyoke, MA USA",,"Chao, HP (通讯作者)，ISO New England, Holyoke, MA USA.",hchao@iso-ne.com; mdepillis@iso-ne.com,,,,,,,20,24,27,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In the experiment a principal pays a wage to each of two agents, who then make effort choices sequentially. In our baseline treatment we observe that the second agent's effort is influenced by the effort choice of the first agent, even though there are no material spillovers between agents. This peer effect is predicted by the Fehr-Schmidt (1999) model of social preferences. As we show from a norms elicitation experiment, it is also consistent with social norms compliance. A conditional logit investigation of the explanatory power of payoff inequality and elicited norms finds that the second agent's effort is best explained by the social preferences model. In further experiments we find that the peer effects change as predicted by the social preferences model. Again, a conditional logit analysis favors an explanation based on social preferences, rather than social norms. Our results suggest that, in our context, the social preferences model provides a parsimonious explanation for the observed peer effect.","[Gaechter, Simon; Nosenzo, Daniele; Sefton, Martin] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Gächter, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",simon.gaechter@nottingham.ac.uk; daniele.nosenzo@nottingham.ac.uk; martin.sefton@nottingham.ac.uk,"Gachter, Simon/C-9787-2009","Gachter, Simon/0000-0002-7182-8505; Nosenzo, Daniele/0000-0002-0831-5408; Sefton, Martin/0000-0002-1327-7311",European Research Council (ERC) [295707] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); European Research Council [295707] Funding Source: Medline,European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),,,56,104,111,9,92,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

With an endogenously determined single break in 1985 in annual CPI data for 17 major US cities between 1918 and 2010, the panel unit root test results provide overwhelming evidence of convergence of relative prices across cities, which is consistent with the existing literature. Most importantly, this study finds that the speed of convergence with structural break is faster than that reported by previous panel studies with no structural break that use similar long time series data. Furthermore, correcting for small-sample bias (the so-called Nickell Bias) and time aggregation bias generates a half-life of 3.9 years, which is 64% shorter than the half-life estimate with no structural break and no bias correction. The breakpoint in 1985 coincides with the beginning of the period of Great Moderation during which inflation, along with other macro variables, has become more stable and its impact on relative prices across US cities seems to have waned.

The study explicitly considers the potential existence of a structural break when estimating the model. On balance, it is found that Thailand's long-run economic growth over the period 1962-2009 is balance-of-payments constrained. Besides the positive effect of export growth, changes in the terms of trade also played a role, but had an adverse effect on the growth performance of Thailand. Thailand's economic growth declined following the Asian financial crisis in 1998 and this study reveals that the root cause of this disappointing performance lay in the dramatic decline in the world income elasticity of demand for its manufacturing exports. This is likely to be the result of an adverse structural change within the sector.","[Tharnpanich, Nat] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [McCombie, John S.

First, both mechanisms are manipulable via Type-2 pre-arrangements. Regarding the welfare consequences, they might cause inefficient outcomes to arise, and the welfare effects on each side are ambiguous in the sense that there might be agents from each side, apart from pre-arranging ones, being better and worse off. Then, for Type-1 pre-arrangements, due to Kojima and Pathak (Am Econ Rev 99(3):608-627, 2009), we know that the intern-optimal stable mechanism is immune to this type of manipulations. In contrast to this result, the hospital-optimal stable mechanism turns out to be manipulable. More interestingly, they do not result in inefficient outcomes, and the welfare effects on each side are unambiguous: All hospitals (interns) are better (worse) off.","[Afacan, Mustafa Oguz] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Afacan, Mustafa Oguz] Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey",Stanford University; Sabanci University,"Afacan, MO (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",oafacan@stanford.edu,"AFACAN, MUSTAFA/AAA-7252-2020","AFACAN, MUSTAFA/0000-0001-7359-9569",,,,,27,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The purpose of this study is to provide the first systematic empirical analysis of the economic determinants of BITs and of the likelihood of BITs between pairs of countries using a qualitative choice model, in a manner consistent with explaining PTAs. We develop the econometric specification for explaining the two based upon a general equilibrium model of world trade and foreign direct investment with three factors, two products, and trade and investment costs among multiple countries in the presence of national and multinational firms. The empirical model for BITs and PTAs is bivariate in nature and supports a set of hypotheses drawn from the general equilibrium model. Using the preferred empirical model for a sample of 12,880 country-pairs in the year 2000, we predict correctly 88% of all pairs with a BIT and a PTA, 81% with a BIT but no PTA, and 84% with a PTA but no BIT.

The most important result of the paper is that the relationship between the yield curve and macroeconomic variables is significantly affected by the change in monetary policy which is associated with the implementation of inflation targeting (IT) regime. While before the IT regime the yield curve is affected to some extent by macroeconomic variables, after the IT regime, it is mainly driven by macroeconomic variables. We also find that central bank has gained ability to affect the entire yield curve with the IT regime. The other important result is that in addition to inflation and real activities, the exchange rates also play an important role in the yield curve dynamics in Turkey. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, what accounts for variation in the quality of property rights institutions in different countries? In this paper, I empirically assess four different theories relating to the determinants of property rights institutions: (1) the economic approach, which maintains that property rights institutions are created when the benefits of their creation exceed their costs; (2) the cultural approach, which stipulates that institutional variation reflects the differences in the beliefs of political leaders about what institutions create benefits for society; (3) the historical approach, which contends that cross-country differences in property rights institutions are the by-product of historical accidents; and (4) the political approach, which defends the premise that institutions are voluntarily chosen by the individuals who control political power, and these individuals choose institutions with the objective to maximize their personal payoffs rather than the benefits of the society as a whole. In order to test the veracity of these theories, I undertake a cross-sectional analysis of 142 countries (including 116 developing and 26 developed countries) over the period 1970-2005. The results of this analysis provide several interesting insights. Firstly, they indicate that the political approach appears to be the most relevant explanation for cross-country variation in property rights institutions: not only is this approach the most statistically robust, it also provides the best fit with the property rights index. The results of non-nested hypothesis test A la Davidson and MacKinnon (1981) confirm this analysis. Secondly, regardless of econometric specification and country sample, democracy is positively and significantly linked to property rights institutions. Thirdly, the data also reveal that while legal origin does significantly affect property rights institutions in developing countries, it appears to have no effect in developed countries. Fourthly, my analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to the full sample case, an increase in GDP per capita does not significantly contribute to the improvement in the quality of property rights institutions in Africa.","ACET, Accra, Ghana",,"Mijiyawa, AG (通讯作者)，ACET, PMB CT4 Cantonments, Accra, Ghana.",mijiyawaa@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,84,21,22,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

The ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration has been applied while robustness of long run relationship is established by using rolling window approach. The empirical evidence confirms the cointegration between inflation, economic growth and terrorism in Pakistan. An increase in inflation raises terrorist attacks while economic growth is also a major contributor to terrorism. Moreover, bidirectional causality is found between inflation and terrorism as investigated by the VECM Granger-causality approach while variance decomposition approach also supports the findings by the VECM Granger causality analysis. Our results therefore points to benefits of pursuing sustainability of low inflation in reducing terrorism. However, it also implies some difficulties for policy-makers in Pakistan in their pursuit for economic growth as latter would result in an increase in terrorism activities crowding out some of the benefits of economic growth.

Domestically, unionization dampens the downward wage adjustment due to unions' strategic rent-seeking and leads to a more muted expansion relative to a frictionless setting. Externally, the rent-sharing mechanism ensures that the terms of trade improvement benefits both firms and workers, and thus increases hiring. This is in contrast to the spillover effect in a frictionless setting, where the terms-of-trade induced wealth effect reduces individual labour supply, increases wages, and reduces hiring. When the model is enriched with sticky prices and a common monetary policy across countries, I find that the domestic dampening and positive spillover effects are further reinforced in the short run.","Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Dao, MC (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mdao@imf.org,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

When the number of buyers is large, bilateral oligopoly approximates a game of quantity competition played by sellers. We present examples which show that this is not typically a Cournot game. Rather, we introduce an alternative game of quantity competition (the market share game) and, appealing to results in the literature on contests, show that this yields the same equilibria as the many-buyer limit of bilateral oligopoly, under standard assumptions on costs and preferences. We also show that the market share and Cournot games have the same equilibria if and only if the price elasticity of the latter is one and investigate the differences in equilibria otherwise. These results lead to necessary and sufficient conditions for the Cournot game to be a good approximation to bilateral oligopoly with many buyers and to an ordering of total output when they are not satisfied.","[Dickson, Alex] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland; [Hartley, Roger] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Strathclyde; University of Manchester,"Dickson, A (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, 130 Rottenrow, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland.",alex.dickson@strath.ac.uk,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This link is confirmed through the analysis of 87 distinct empirical economics literatures, involving more than three and a half thousand separate empirical studies, using objective measures of both selectivity and contests.

We distinguish between two trade cost reductions, (i) trade liberalizations in the 1980s, which increased trade in low-skill-intensive goods (denoted L-globalization) and (ii) reductions in communication costs due to the IT revolution, which raised trade in middle-skill-intensive goods during the 19905 (denoted C-globalization). We consider a North-south trade economy in which the North is skill abundant. A freely traded final good is produced using high-skill services and a bundle of inputs. Inputs differ on the intensity of middle- and low-skill workers required to be produced, and are subject to heterogeneous trade costs. In the North, we find that wage inequality increases in the L-globalization. During the C-globalization, wage polarization emerges. The relative wage of high- to middle-skill workers increases, while the relative wage of middle- to low-skill workers is hump-shaped. We find a complementarity between the two globalizations. Wage polarization is delayed by the extent of trade in the L-globalization. In the South, we find that wage inequality increases in both globalizations. Finally, we show how asymmetric participation in the C-globalization of two southern countries generates a discontinuous pattern of specialization. The southern country participating in the C-globalization specializes in the least and most skill-intensive traded inputs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper shows that this allocation puzzle can be explained simply by introducing uninsurable idiosyncratic investment risk in the neoclassical growth model with international trade in bonds, and by taking into account not only TFP catch-up, but also the capital wedge, that is, the distortions on the return to capital. The model fits the two following facts, documented on a sample of 67 countries between 1980 and 2003: (i) TFP growth is positively correlated with capital outflows in a sample including creditor countries; (ii) the long-run level of capital per efficient unit of labor is positively correlated with capital outflows. Consistently, we show that the capital flows predicted by the model are positively correlated with the actual ones in this sample once the capital wedge is accounted for. The fact that Asia dominates global imbalances can be explained by its relatively low capital wedge. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this class of models, the scope for policy intervention arises because individual agents do not internalize the effects of their action on a key market price that enters the collateral constraint (i.e. there is a pecuniary externality). Our main result is that the interaction between agents' behavior in crisis and normal times is crucial for the normative implications of this class of models. In contrast to the related literature, we find that in our model economy the social planner borrows more than private agents in normal times (i.e., the economy displays underborrowing rather than overborrowing in normal times) and yet has a lower probability to enter a financial crisis. While our findings call for both ex-ante and ex-post policy interventions relative to the crisis event, our analysis shows that welfare gains of ex-post policies are much larger than those of ex-ante policies. As a result, adopting only ex ante interventions such as macro-prudential policies or capital controls may be costly in welfare terms. For example, a small macro-prudential tax on debt that lowers the probability of a crisis to zero is welfare-reducing in our model because it also lowers average consumption. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that cognitive ability (measured by the percentile ranking for university entrance at age 18) has no effect on risk preferences measured at age 20. This is in contrast to experimental studies that use IQ measures to proxy cognitive skills. However, we do find that gender matters. While young women are significantly more likely than young men to assess themselves as being prepared to take risks, women choose to invest significantly less when they are confronted with a clearly specified investment decision based on hypothetical lottery winnings.

To answer these questions, we employ a signalling game framework in which both the donor's donation and his benefits of being in a higher category are determined endogenously. We find that categorised reporting can always improve fundraising. Both high and low category thresholds can increase donations, with prior beliefs determining which is better. While categorising can lead to the existence of a low donation equilibrium, it is less problematic if signalling benefits are low. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The public/private divide, in turn, provides greater insights into the sources and limits of public finance. The importance of the role of the state as the issuer of the currency is highlighted in the development of Marx's analysis, as well as in recent debates regarding economic policy and the causes of global financial crises. Using Marx's analysis of the rules of capitalist property, along with the distribution of the surplus and the formation of the equal average rate of profit, the illusion that money is productive is found to be the source of distortions in understanding, and erroneous policies for the management of, the capitalist economy.

Generally less emphasized are the ramifications of this process when it occurs in reverse; that is, when the relative size of the working age population begins to shrink. Related to this is the more subtle effect of changes to the age structure of the overall working age population, which can have compounding or offsetting effects in relation to the demographic dividend noted above. This paper explores how these age-related phenomena were instrumental to both the Great Depression and the Great Recession of 2008. We explore how the generational composition of economic actors and the aging of the baby-boom worker may have played a role in provoking these remarkable recessionary periods. The reversal of the demographic dividend and the aging of the working age population are factors now contributing to the propagation of the global economic downturn, as witnessed in the example of Japan over the past half-century. This paper applies the lessons of the Great Depression, the Great Recession and Japan to offer a forward-looking analysis of the Chinese economy. China is on the precipice of a significant demographic shift whose implications for economic growth are explored.","[Gomez, Rafael] Univ Toronto, Ctr Ind Relat & Human Resources, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Lamb, Danielle] Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Gomez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Ctr Ind Relat & Human Resources, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",ralph.gomez@utoronto.ca; danielle.lamb@ryerson.ca,,,,,,,47,7,7,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2013,21.0,2,,,SI,,97,118,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12017.x,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,112YA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316630000006,0

During this crisis the three largest banks all collapsed and many other smaller banks and companies went bankrupt in the aftermath of the crisis with severe consequences for the economy and the people. Prior to the crisis, Iceland, a high income economy, had experienced strong growth rates and unprecedented expansion in overseas investment and activities, especially in the financial sector. This article focuses on action by top government officials during this expansion as well as during and after the collapse of the Icelandic banks. The findings of the study are that the government showed negligence and made mistakes by not taking credible action to manage risks following a rapid cross border expansion of the Icelandic banking system. This had severe consequences and resulted in the collapse of the Icelandic economy in October 2008. The discussion can have a wider relevance than that for Iceland only. This is especially true for small countries with a large banking sector, using their own currency, and with limited fiscal space to support their banks during a crisis.","Univ Akureyri, Sch Business & Sci, IS-600 Akureyri, Iceland",University of Akureyri,"Hilmarsson, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Akureyri, Sch Business & Sci, IS-600 Akureyri, Iceland.",hilmar@unak.is,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,18,EUROBALTIC CENTRES EXCELLENCE,RIGA,"RAINA BLVD 19, RIGA, LV-1586, LATVIA",1406-099X,,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Recent studies have proposed an approach that relies on a calorie share of staples threshold. Our analysis with Indian household data shows that such a measure is of limited interest and potentially misleading because it confines variation in calorie share to a measure of wealth. Since even the poor substitute in response to changes in food prices, calorie and income thresholds change, and, consequently, the estimates of undernourished. Thus, both the predictive accuracy of this measure and its descriptive richness leave a lot to be desired. The policy implications of our critique are significant, as not just livelihood expansion but also food price stabilisation are likely to mitigate undernutrition.

The path of the time-varying inflation coefficient shows that, unlike in the linear model, the Fed consistently responds to inflationary pressures in an aggressive manner even after 1991. The stock price coefficient stays positive since 1991. However, its time-varying pattern does not show active responses in the early periods of stock price hikes, which is counter to the view that the Fed has preemptively reacted to stock price bubbles.

This is in contrast with the empirical evidence which shows that: (1) innovation size is not identical across industries and (2) the size distribution of profit returns from innovation is highly skewed toward the low value side, with a long tail on the high value side. In the present paper, we develop a Schumpeterian growth model that is consistent with this evidence. In particular, we assume that when a firm innovates, the size of its quality improvement is the result of a random draw from a Pareto distribution. This enables us to extend the class of quality-ladder growth models to encompass firm heterogeneity. We study the policy implications of this new setup numerically and find that it is optimal to heavily subsidize R&D for plausible parameter values. Although it is optimal to tax R&D for some parameter values, this case only occurs when the steady-state rate of economic growth is very low.","[Minniti, Antonio] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Parello, Carmelo P.] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Segerstrom, Paul S.] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Bologna; Sapienza University Rome; Stockholm School of Economics,"Parello, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",antonio.minniti@unibo.it; carmelo.parello@uniroma1.it; paul.segerstrom@hhs.se,"Minniti, Antonio/HKM-3586-2023; Parello, Carmelo Pierpaolo/O-5411-2015","MINNITI, ANTONIO/0000-0001-8308-637X",,,,,43,20,20,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The term modified refers to an important innovation with regard to the reviewed literature: the inclusion of a proxy for the international interest rate in the original equation. This study reinforces and expands results achieved by Modenesi (2011) and also provides a new evidence that the BCB reacts to foreign interest rates when setting its basic rate (Selic). The BCB has reduced autonomy: Selic is endogenous not only to domestic conditions (inflation and output gaps) but also to foreign interest rates (measured by the LIBOR). The evidence provided might support the argument that BCB policy is ruled by a proconservative convention substantiated in the adoption of a Taylor rule containing three distinctive features: (1) a high degree of interest rate smoothness; (2) a high pure domestic equilibrium interest rate; and (3) high interest rate differential. Items (2) and (3) largely explain the overvaluation of the real, a key element of price stabilization.","[Modenesi, Andre de Melo; Martins, Norberto Montani] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Modenesi, Rui Lyrio] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Econ, BR-24220000 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Modenesi, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,"Martins, Norberto/AAJ-9771-2021","Montani Martins, Norberto/0000-0002-9101-3135",,,,,56,5,6,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We suggest that the impact of MNCs on the quantity of backward linkages is mixed: in our sample Czech-owned suppliers represent half of the companies but they contribute only little to the total turnover of the suppliers. The new position of follow-source suppliers in the motor industry value chain explains the fragile position of indigenous suppliers in small emerging economies. The presence of numerous foreign-owned affiliates belonging to global MNCs, with whom the manufacturers are engaged in relational linkages on a world scale, also explains the absence of interest of the MNCs in relational linkages with the indigenous supply base.","[Rugraff, Eric] Inst Technol Robert Schuman, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France",,"Rugraff, E (通讯作者)，Inst Technol Robert Schuman, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",Eric.rugraff@unistra.fr,,,,,,,46,2,2,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,MAR 1,2013,25.0,1,,,,,82,98,,10.1080/14631377.2013.756695,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,083GU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314451900005,0

The production rate is a dynamic variable (varying with time) in a production system. Due to a long run process, the machinery system is converted from in-control state to out-of-control state which results the production of improper items. The improper items are reworked at a fixed cost to make it as proper. With the increasing value of time, the production of improper item also increases. To reduce the production of the improper items, the systems have to be more reliable and with less amount of failure. In this direction, the model considers that the development cost, production cost, and material cost are dependent on the reliability parameter. The deterioration of the product is considered probabilistic to make the research a more realistic one. By considering the reliability parameter as a decision variable, we try to obtain the associated profit of the system which we have to maximize. To derive the maximization procedure, we use Euler-Lagrange formula from control theory. We outline some numerical examples along with graphical representations and sensitivity analysis to illustrate the model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We observe that the condition of households that suffered from socio-economic inequality with respect to total consumption, educational expenditures, medical expenditures, and durable consumption worsened relative to other households when faced with income uncertainty. Income uncertainty did not affect the housing consumption of households that suffered from socio-economic inequality, but it substantially decreased their ability to consume other durables. As a result of the introduction of the modern enterprise system and the reform of the housing distribution system, households with a member employed in a management position suffer larger shocks of income uncertainty in total consumption, educational expenditures, medical expenditures, and housing consumption relative to household with all members employed in worker positions in 2002.

Lower levels of bribe payments are associated with ownership by a former manager of a state-owned enterprise (SUE), with being a spin-off from a SUE, and with trade association membership. The results also suggest that these networks have a larger impact on bribe payments than do firm characteristics such as profits, sales, or resale value. For the average firm, having a former SUE manager as an owner can be expected to reduce bribe payments by over 50%, while, by contrast, doubling the firm's profits results in only a 7% increase in bribe payments.

We examine these domestic and external imbalances from two perspectives: the saving-investment balance and the effective renminbi exchange rate. China's large external surplus has arisen neither from anaemic consumption nor from weak investment but rather from the saved windfalls from favorable demographics, market liberalization, robust restructuring and World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. Looking ahead, as these windfalls fade, saving will subside. The exchange rate is already playing a supporting role in rebalancing the Chinese economy, and the real effective exchange rate based on unit labor costs has appreciated very sharply. Prospective savings-investment and exchange-rate developments point to a higher consumption share and a narrowing of China's current account surplus.","[Ma, Guonan; Lam, Lillie] Bank Int Settlements, Two Int Finance Ctr, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [McCauley, Robert] Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland",Bank for International Settlements (BIS); Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Ma, GN (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Two Int Finance Ctr, 78-F,8 Finance St, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",guonan.ma@bis.org; robert.mccauley@bis.org; lillie.lam@bis.org,,,,,,,19,14,14,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We show that increasing the share of spending on public pensions always reduces economic growth. However, we show numerically that public pension provision improves social welfare and there exists an optimal share of spending on public pension provision unless the value of the time discount factor of the government is sufficiently high. Moreover, we show that in an economy facing an aging population, an increase in social security provision for the old rather than an increase in public investment can be preferable from the viewpoint of social welfare.","Osaka Univ, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan",Osaka University,"Maebayashi, N (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan.",gge010mn@mail2.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,12,5,7,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In RBC models, recessions are caused on the supply side by random technology shocks which are independent of monetary policy. However, in ABC models, credit expansion results in negative productivity shocks, as the marginal return on investment is lowered and the production structure is extended by commitment to more capital-intensive activities. Thus. ABC theory helps resolve several problems with RBC theory. The FIH describes a process of endogenous overleveraging which unsustainably overvalues assets and exposes the financial sector to greater risk. This paper argues that the overleveraging described by the FIH is compatible with the unsustainable expansion of production described in ABC theory, and further argues that credit expansion would both provide additional funds to finance overleveraging, as well as encourage the process by making it cheaper with lower interest rates.

An upstream supplier and a competitive fringe sell differentiated products to a retailer who has private information about the stochastic demand. We compare the market outcomes, when the supplier uses two-part tariffs (2PT), all-unit quantity discounts (AU), and market-share discounts (MS). We show that the retailer's risk attitude affects supplier's preferences over these pricing schemes. When the retailer is risk neutral, it bears all the risk and the three schemes lead to the same outcome. When the retailer is risk averse, a 2PT performs the worst from the supplier's perspective, but it leads to the highest welfare. For a wide range of parameter values (but not for all), the supplier prefers MS to AU. By limiting the retailer's product substitution possibilities, MS makes the demand for the manufacturer's product more inelastic. This reduces the amount (share of total profits) the supplier needs to leave to the retailer for the latter to participate in the scheme.","[Akguen, Ugur] Charles Rivers Associates, London EC2M 3XD, England; [Chioveanu, Ioana] Brunel Univ London, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University,"Akgün, U (通讯作者)，Charles Rivers Associates, 99 Bishopsgate, London EC2M 3XD, England.",uakgun@crai.com; ioana.chioveanu@brunel.ac.uk,"Chioveanu, Ioana/ABD-3779-2020","Chioveanu, Ioana/0000-0002-5406-5331",,,,,19,1,2,1,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Social interactions are a specific form of interdependence whereby the changes in the behavior of other agents affect utility functions for households and production functions for producers. In this paper, we apply the general concept of social interactions to the area of the economics of innovation and we articulate the view that knowledge interactions play a central role in the generation of new technological knowledge so that innovation becomes the emergent property of a system, rather than the product of individual actions. In particular, we articulate and test the hypothesis that different layers of knowledge interactions play a crucial role in determining the rate of technological change that each firm is able to introduce. The paper presents an empirical analysis of firm level total factor productivity (TFP) for a sample of 7,020 Italian manufacturing companies observed during the years 1996-2005.

This study investigates the empirical association between obesity and the propensity to smoke and to quit smoking, using a Seemingly Unrelated (SUR) probit approach that takes into consideration the potential for reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity. Using Australian health survey data, this article demonstrates the usefulness of the SUR probit approach in generating information on the relationship between unobserved factors influencing both smoking behaviour and obesity, and in providing estimates of the conditional probabilities of each risk factor. Results suggest the two risk factors are not independent. The presence, size and direction of correlation between the unobserved factors are found to vary by smoking behaviour and by gender. Estimates of conditional probabilities demonstrate smokers have a lower probability of obesity, particularly among females, and ex-smokers have a higher probability of obesity, particularly among males. These findings suggest that health policies targeted at one risk factor may have unintended implications for the other.","[Au, N.; Hollingsworth, B.] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Hauck, K.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, London SW7 2AZ, England",Monash University; Imperial College London,"Au, N (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",nicole.au@monash.edu,"Hauck, Katharina/ABE-8926-2020; Hollingsworth, Bruce/ABH-7283-2020","Hauck, Katharina/0000-0003-3138-4169; Hollingsworth, Bruce/0000-0002-4314-6523; Black, Nicole/0000-0002-6396-7054",,,,,51,4,4,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

From a theoretical point of view, we argue that FT should have a positive effect on child schooling since it generates a short-run pure income effect together with a medium-run productivity effect on both adult and child wages. On the other hand, because of the higher productivity generated by the medium-run effect, the opportunity cost of child education increases if they work with their parents. The direction of the impact of FT affiliation on child schooling is therefore uncertain and requires empirical testing.

Hence, enhancing the quality of new firms is an important goal of entrepreneurship support policies. Schemes that give professional assistance to individuals who want to start up a business are a key feature of most developed countries' policies towards improving the performance of new firms. In our sample, only approximately half of nascent entrepreneurs seek professional assistance. Given that assistance is highly subsidized and available to everyone interested in starting up a firm, we ask why certain nascent entrepreneurs do not seek assistance. By using survey data consisting of an initial screening interview and a follow-up interview after 1 year, we are able to show that men and well-educated founders tend to refrain from professional assistance. Notably, those without any experience in the industry of the planned business are more apt not to seek assistance. This finding suggests that cognitive biases such as overconfidence might play a role in explaining the assistance-avoiding behaviour. Policy measures aiming at improving the knowledge of potential entrepreneurs are therefore well advised to target well-educated males in particular.","[Brixy, U.; Stueber, H.] Inst Employment Res IAB, Res Dept Reg Labour Markets, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Brixy, U.] Univ Munich, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany; [Sternberg, R.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",University of Munich; Leibniz University Hannover,"Brixy, U (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res IAB, Res Dept Reg Labour Markets, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",udo.brixy@iab.de,,"Sternberg, Rolf/0000-0002-7649-0419; Brixy, Udo/0000-0002-1682-9011",,,,,12,9,12,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This finding is predicated upon the argument that increased economic freedom elevates the pace of economic activity through incentives and other means and hence generates higher economic growth. This study focuses on a similar, but not identical, potential impact of higher economic freedom levels. In particular, this study investigates the hypothesis that higher levels of economic freedom promote higher levels of economic activity and hence higher levels of per capita real income. The context of this empirical study is the 30 nations of the OECD over the study period 2003 to 2006. Panel Least Squares (PLS) estimations reveal that the level of per capita real income is an increasing function of business freedom, freedom from corruption, investment freedom, monetary freedom, government size freedom, trade freedom and property rights freedom, whereas fiscal freedom, labour freedom and financial freedom do not appear to influence per capita real income.","Jacksonville Univ, Dept Finance, Jacksonville, FL USA",Jacksonville University,"Cebula, RJ (通讯作者)，Jacksonville Univ, Dept Finance, Jacksonville, FL USA.",Dr.RichardCebula@gmail.com,"Cebula, Richard J/P-7535-2018",,,,,,12,14,17,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The EPP is where the neoclassical asset pricing model cannot be reconciled with the empirical fact that stocks have much higher returns than risk-free assets. The prior predictive analysis employed follows a Bayesian approach that draws realizations for preferences that describe the degree of LANF characterizing consumer's tastes. The analysis is also extended along two more dimensions: the variance of aggregate uncertainty and the elasticity of labor. The priors used are carefully defined from previous works in the literature. This Monte Carlo procedure finds that the theory is unable to jointly describe the equity premium and labor's elasticity of supply. That is, only when the labor supply elasticity is unreasonably low can LANF preferences generate any equity premiums. Alternatively, when the elasticity is more realistically high, LANF preferences fail to generate significant premiums. My analysis therefore concludes that a resolution to the EPP via a theory of LANF must be modified along the description of labor's choices. As ancillary result, the hybrid perturbation-projection method developed for this experiment is shown to be a robust technique.","Marshall Univ, Div Finance & Econ, Huntington, WV 25755 USA",Marshall University,"Chen, YY (通讯作者)，Marshall Univ, Div Finance & Econ, One John Marshall Dr, Huntington, WV 25755 USA.",chenyu@marshall.edu,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Therefore, we can appraise the co-movements of the four previous financial markets as well as the joint behavior of their respective volatilities (i.e. systemic risk). Moreover, the resulting conditional variance and covariance metrics allow for handling volatility spillovers (i.e. contagion risk in terms of transmitting volatility shocks from one market place to another market place). Indeed, results highlight the unprecedented high systemic risk levels (i.e. joint increased volatility levels) as well as a high contagion risk (i.e. volatility spillover) during the subprime mortgage market crisis. The transmission process of volatility shocks reveals to be simultaneous across financial markets due to a strong arbitrage activity and electronic trading practices among others. Most importantly, the estimated conditional correlations exhibit an upward sloping trend, which underlines an increase in the correlation risk between financial markets in the late nineties or early 2000. Thus, our major findings are twofold. First, we characterize the dynamic correlation risk across financial markets. Second, we also confirm the increasing and nonlinear trend in the correlation risk, which we are able to quantify. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The paper makes two useful contributions. First, the data is analyzed using a novel method due to Phillips and Sul (2007) leading to different conclusions in comparison to past studies, and secondly sectoral level data is employed which to our knowledge has not been employed in the literature before. Applying the novel approach to panel data relating to fifteen major states of India for the period 1968/69-2008/09, the results display significant divergence in per capita income across states at the aggregate and sectoral levels. There is also evidence of convergence clubs and variations in the number and composition of clubs across sectors. While three clubs are identified at the aggregate level, at the sectoral level we find three clubs in the industrial sector, two clubs are identified in both the agriculture and services sectors.

A natural extension of the fixed parameter latent class model is a random parameter latent class model which allows for another layer of preference heterogeneity within each class.

We focus on criminal decisions across US states' Supreme Courts. We find that justices that are shielded from voters' influence (bureaucrats) on average (i) have better information, (ii) are more likely to change their preconceived opinions about a case, and (iii) are more effective (make less mistakes) than their elected counterparts (politicians).

Wage dispersion has generally been rising. This increase occurred predominantly in the lower part of the wage distribution for women and in the upper part for men. Moreover, the sectoral transition affected female workers to a much larger extent than their male counterparts. A sequential decomposition analysis using quantile regressions reveals that changes in industry-specific remuneration schemes contributed strongly to the rise in wage inequality in the lower part of the distribution for women, whereas changes in the industry composition alone would have led to a polarization of wages. In contrast, for men, changes in individual characteristics are the single most important factor contributing to the increasing wage dispersion. These gender differences are attributed to employment segregation across industries present right after German reunification.","[Kohn, Karsten] KfW Bankengrp, Frankfurt, Germany; [Kohn, Karsten; Antonczyk, Dirk] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Antonczyk, Dirk] Deloitte FAS LLP, Washington, DC USA",IZA Institute Labor Economics; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited,"Kohn, K (通讯作者)，KfW Bankengrp, Frankfurt, Germany.",karsten.kohn@kfw.de; dirk.antonczyk@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,6,7,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Using tools of the Modern Portfolio Theory, the benefit from international diversification is decomposed into these two components, using a counterfactual hypothesis of perfect correlation between two assets. This approach allows an original measure of the respective share of the higher foreign returns and the low correlation in the benefit of diversification. The argument is put forward that French investors were mainly attracted by weak foreign correlation with domestic assets, rather than higher foreign returns.","Bordeaux Management Sch, KEDGE BEM, Bordeaux, France",,"Le Bris, D (通讯作者)，Bordeaux Management Sch, KEDGE BEM, Bordeaux, France.",,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,6,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Despite the high level of poverty, 84 of the individuals sought treatment from a qualified health provider during their last illness. The high rate of utilisation in the area is found to be attributable to the characteristics of the PHC facilities. Indeed, PHC facilities are highly accessible and offer good medical services at a low price. The low price of medical services in the sample explains why the demand for curative care is found to be price-inelastic. This latter result suggests that policies that will reduce the price of medical services to increase the health care use are not likely to be effective.","[Lepine, Aurelia; Le Nestour, Alexis] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Lépine, A (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, 60 Clyde St,Commerce Bldg,Level 7, Dunedin, New Zealand.",aurelia.lepine@otago.ac.nz,,"Lepine, Aurelia/0000-0002-9237-2914",,,,,40,9,11,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

The performance of different dimension reduction methods depends on forecasting horizons, the number of factors chosen, and the number of slices for SIR. The empirical study finds that the FAAR model with an optimal number of PCA factors outperforms the other model in out-of-sample inflation forecasting in China.","[Lin, Ching-Yi] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Wang, Chun] CUNY Brooklyn Coll, Dept Econ, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA",National Tsing Hua University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Brooklyn College (CUNY),"Lin, CY (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, 101,Sect 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",lincy@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,19,4,4,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The physician's degree of altruism is his private information. The consumer's illness severity will be learned by the physician, and also will become his private information. Treatments are discrete choices, and can be combined to form treatment plans. We distinguish between two commitment regimes. In the first, the physician can commit to treatment decisions at the time a payment contract is accepted. In the second, the physician cannot commit to treatment decisions at that time, and will wait until he learns about the patient's illness to do so. In the commitment game, the first best is implemented by a single payment contract to all types of altruistic physician. In the noncommitment game, the first best is not achieved.

Following this literature, we measure the economic strength of one of these demand-driven channels, the trade channel, in the transmission of oil shocks to the US economy. We use Kilian's (2009) decomposition of oil price shocks to identify three possible sources of oil shocks: oil supply, oil-market specific demand and global demand shocks. We then estimate the impact of each shock on the US terms of trade controlling for nonlinear effects in the sign and the size of the shocks. All oil shocks have persistent and statistically significant effects on the US terms of trade. However, we find that only oil supply shocks have an impact on the terms of trade that is nonlinear in the size of the shock.

When faced with uncertainty about its prospects, and foreseeing that it may wish to leave the market should profitability prove poor, a rational entrant considers possible exit routes. Horizontal merger reduces competition post-merger which, all else being equal, lowers welfare; but merger also provides a valuable exit route. By facilitating exit and thus raising the value of entry, more lenient merger policy may stimulate entry sufficiently that welfare is increased overall. We calculate the optimal merger policy in the form of a low, but positive, profitability threshold below which merger is permitted despite the adverse impact on post-merger competition. This may be viewed as an extension of the failing firm defence to include ailing, low profitability firms as well as imminently failing ones. Merger policy is compared with an entry subsidy, and the implications of strategic firm behaviour for the choice of merger policy are also examined. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
