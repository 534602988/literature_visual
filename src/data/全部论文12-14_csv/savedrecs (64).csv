Each oligopolist offered a single two-part electricity tariff, but inconsistent with current theory, the two-part tariffs were heterogeneous in ways that cannot be attributed to explanations such as asymmetric costs or variations in brand loyalty. Instead, the evidence suggests that firms deliberately differentiated their tariff structures, resulting in market segmentation according to consumers' usage.","[Davies, Stephen; Price, Catherine Waddams] Univ E Anglia, ESRC Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Wilson, Chris M.] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of East Anglia; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); Loughborough University,"Price, CW (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, ESRC Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",C.Waddams@uea.ac.uk,"Davies, Stephen/HPD-3182-2023",,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The financial support of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) is gratefully acknowledged.

To explore interaction effects, so-called interaction terms are typically included in estimation specifications. While in linear models the effect of a marginal change in the interaction term is equal to the interaction effect, this equality generally does not hold in non-linear specifications (Ai/Norton 2003). This paper provides for a general derivation of interaction effects in both linear and non-linear models and calculates the formulae of the interaction effects resulting from Heckman's sample selection model as well as the Two-Part Model, two regression models commonly applied to data with a large fraction of either missing or zero values in the dependent variable. Drawing on a survey of automobile use from Germany, we argue that while it is important to test for the significance of interaction effects, their size conveys limited substantive content. More meaningful, and also more easy to grasp, are the conditional marginal effects pertaining to two variables that are assumed to interact.","[Frondel, Manuel] Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Dept Environm & Resources, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Vance, Colin] Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Bremen,"Frondel, M (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Dept Environm & Resources, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",frondel@rwi-essen.de; colin.vance@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

In the first part, we discuss various general measures of uncertainty of states, the power entropies in particular. In the second part, we use Shannon entropy as a base framework for the case study - supplier system of the most important commodity in brewery industry, the malted barley. We assume a problem-oriented database exists, which contains detailed records of all product orders, deliveries and forecasts both in quantity and time being scheduled and realized, within time period given. We concern ourselves with quantity perturbations since they play more crucial role as the time variations. The general procedure elaborated consists of three basic steps - preprocessing of data with consistency checks in Java, calculation of histograms and empirical distribution functions, and finally, evaluation of conditional entropy. These two last steps are realized by Mathematica modules. Illustrative results of operational complexity of malted barley supplier system focused on volume quantity variations are presented in detail.","[Hofman, Jiri] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Business Admin & Mngmt, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,hofman@kpm.zcu.cz; lukasl@kem.zcu.cz,"Lukas, Ladislav/B-5818-2016",,,,,,7,2,2,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,267,272,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000046,0

The damage caused by international competition led Montchrestien to promote protectionism and a policy aimed at educating the labour force. But, the mercantilism attributed to Montchrestien in no way implies that the economy is a transposition of a war-like model. In the embedded markets of a well-managed State, trade is not a zero-sum game. More generally, the paper argues that Montchrestien distinguishes three modes of transaction and gives a place to money that is peculiar in mercantilist thought.","[Maucourant, Jerome] Univ Lyon, TRIANGLE, UMR CNRS 5206, Lyon, France; [Maucourant, Jerome] Univ St Etienne, St Etienne, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Institut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Securite (INRETS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Paris-VIII; Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Jean Monnet,"Maucourant, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, TRIANGLE, UMR CNRS 5206, Lyon, France.",maucourant.jerome@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

This paper analyzes the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on students' achievement in the selected course during the first semester of the full-time undergraduate study. Based on the survey among first-year students, which examined the motivational variables and subjective ratings of specific prior knowledge of subjects associated with the selected course, a database of 90 subjects has been obtained. This research has explored the possibility of using neural networks for the prediction of the learning outcomes expressed in measurable and observable terms, i.e., grades earned in the selected course. Several configurations of neural networks have been examined and the neural network that achieved the best correlation in the success prediction has been used to analyse the impact of each input variable on the students. success achieved during the selected course. According to the Self-determination theory, increasing of intrinsic motivation would lead to higher student achievement, greater creativity and flexibility of thinking and better long-term memory. Variable intrinsic motivation can be encouraged by a certain social atmosphere, by strengthening individual sense of autonomy, by competence and connection. The results of this study have revealed a complex interaction of input variables, but generally the effect of extrinsic motivation on achievement of students included in this research is more significant. These results are indicative, but they should be taken with a grain of salt, because they include the assessment of the success of learning outcomes of the only one course. More realistic picture requires a longer period of observation of the students' achievement, including more courses and the observation of the overall success of students during their undergraduate studies.","[Otkovic, Irena Istoka; Bosnjak, Natasa; Brkanic, Ivana] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Civil Engn, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,,iirena@gfos.hr; nbosnjak@gfos.hr; ibrkanic@gfos.hr,"Otković, Irena/AAJ-5569-2021; Istoka Otkovic, Irena/K-7743-2018","Otković, Irena/0000-0003-3650-2021;",,,,,12,0,0,0,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,300,307,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400035,0

We use a micro-founded heterogeneous-consumers model to estimate the impact of national borders on global and regional trade flows. Results show that difficulties faced by developing countries' exporters in accessing developed markets are 50% higher than those faced by Northern exporters. These difficulties have however experienced a noticeable fall since 1980 in all industries. It is twenty three times easier to enter Northern and Southern markets for a Southern country exporter in 2006 than in 1980. Expressed in tariff-equivalent, the level of protection implied when crossing a border fell from 180% to 89% for this same sample. While tariffs still have an influence on trade patterns, they do not seem to explain an important part of the border effect. Last, our theory-based measure offers a renewal of the assessment of the impact of regional trading arrangements. The EU, NAFTA, ASEAN and MERCOSUR agreements all tend to reduce the estimated degree of market fragmentation within those zones, with the expected ranking between their respective trade impact.

The political situation was characterized by a divided fiscal authority: the absolute king controlled how resources were spent while the Diet controlled the operations of the Bank of Sweden and the National Debt Office. This division affected fiscal policies and how the country financed its wars. During the Napoleonic Wars, the king was unwilling to negotiate a deal with the Diet that relinquished his spending control in exchange for greater revenues to fight the war. As a consequence, he was unable to mobilize the necessary resources, which led to the loss of Finland and to his dethronement through a coup dtat organized by the elite in 1809.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Hist, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Winton, P (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Hist, Uppsala, Sweden.",patrik.winton@hist.uu.se,,,,,,,50,3,3,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Using a framework that recognises the total information available as composed of units available only to each of them along with units available to both, we show: that a sufficient statistic for all the information available to both the expert and the statistician is the product of their odds ratios in favour of the event; that the geometric mean of their two probabilities specifies a contour of pairs of assertions in the unit-square that yield the same posterior probability; that the information-combining function is parameterised by an unknown probability for the event conditioned only on the unspecified information common to both the statistician and the expert; and that an assessable mixing distribution over this unspecified probability allows an integrable mixture distribution to represent a computable posterior probability. The exact results allow the identification of the subclass of coherent probabilities that are externally Bayesian operators. This subclass is equivalent to the class of combining functions that honour the principles of uniformity and compromise.","[Frederic, Patrizio] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, Ctr Econ Res RECent, I-41100 Modena, Italy; [Di Bacco, Mario] Polo Univ Asti, Asti, Italy; [Lad, Frank] Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch 1, New Zealand",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; University of Canterbury,"Frederic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, Ctr Econ Res RECent, Via Berengario 51, I-41100 Modena, Italy.",patrizio.frederic@unimore.it; mario.dibacco@unibo.it; F.Lad@math.canterbury.ac.nz,"Frederic, Patrizio/E-5566-2016","Frederic, Patrizio/0000-0001-9073-2878",,,,,22,1,6,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2012,73.0,4,,,,,605,619,,10.1007/s11238-012-9320-9,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,989EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307543400007,0

That landlords could only be identified in south China was attributable to the sharply more active land rental market there, and the single-cut policy of defining the landlords narrowly as a rentier class. We attribute the predominance of an active land rental market in south China to three socioeconomic characteristics: 1) a sharply higher inequality in land distribution, 2) an organization of agriculture whose efficiency required the unsupervised initiatives of family labor, and 3) a distinctly higher proportion of absentee landlords. Our hypothesis of land rentals being the only variable distinguishing the landlords from the rich peasants and only in south China is strongly supported by empirical evidence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

More importantly, they may reconfigure outcomes in a way that is not neutral with respect to payroll. The article finds, for example, that in the NHL over the 1994-2004 time period, team success in the playoffs was much less dependent on payroll than it was during the regular-season. The article also analyzes the differential impacts of the specific type of playoff tournament employed, and finds that the choice of playoff pooling structures directly impacts the probability of upsets occurring in the playoffs.","[Longley, Neil] Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Dept Sport Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Lacey, Nelson J.] Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Dept Finance & Operat Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Longley, N (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Dept Sport Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",nlongley@sportmgt.umass.edu,,,,,,,10,5,6,3,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

We derive an asymptotic distribution-free covariance matrix for the decomposed generalized Lorenz curves.

Using variation in transportation costs between different regions of the country to generate exogenous migration, I find frontier city migration had significant job-holding benefits. The impact of migration on job holding was 68% greater for immigrants than for the native born. Expectations about job holding were the most important factor in the decision to migrate to a frontier city. Clerical workers, unskilled blue-collar workers, immigrants, and the poor were also the most likely to migrate. These results show the benefits of geographic mobility and suggest the contribution of frontier cities to economic opportunity in America's past. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A bootstrap simulation approach with leverage adjustment is used to generate critical values that are robust to non-normality and time-varying volatility.

We assume that each player's preference over subsets of items is consistent with a strict ranking of the items, and that neither player has information about the other's preferences. Our procedure ensures an envy-free division-each player receives a subset of items that it values more than the other player's complementary subset-given that an envy-free division of contested items, which the players would choose at the same time, is possible. We show that the possibility of one player's undercutting the other's proposal, and implementing the reduced subset for himself or herself, makes the proposer reasonable, and generally leads to an envy-free division, even when the players rank items exactly the same. Although the undercut procedure is manipulable and its envy-free allocation may be Pareto-inferior, each player's maximin strategy is to be truthful. Applications of the procedure are discussed briefly.","[Klamler, Christian] Graz Univ, Inst Publ Econ, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Brams, Steven J.] NYU, Dept Polit, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Kilgour, D.

Earlier research has shown that regret aversion and reason-based choice effects are linked through a common emphasis on decision justification, and that a simple manipulation of regret salience can eliminate the decoy effect, a well-known reason-based choice effect. We show here that the effect of regret salience varies in theory-relevant ways from one reason-based choice effect to another. For effects such as the select/reject and decoy effect, both of which were independently judged to be unreasonable bases for deciding, regret salience eliminated the effect. For the most-important attribute effect that is judged to be normatively acceptable, however, regret salience amplified the effect. Anticipated self-blame regret and perceived decision justifiability consistently predicted preferences and thus offer a parsimonious account of both attenuation and amplification of these reason-based choice effects.","[Connolly, Terry] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Reb, Jochen] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore",University of Arizona; Singapore Management University,"Connolly, T (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Eller Coll, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",Connolly@u.arizona.edu; jreb@smu.edu.sg,"REB, Jochen M/D-2201-2010","Reb, Jochen/0000-0003-0233-8016","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0819780] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,55,19,26,1,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2012,73.0,1,,,SI,,35,51,,10.1007/s11238-011-9269-0,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,958GR,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305225000003,0

Estimation of relative health valuation requires the decomposition of a child health improvement into its direct effect on the child's health and its indirect effect, through improvements in maternal health. Failure to distinguish the impact of the direct and indirect effects can lead to biased estimates. We consider the intrauterine environment of a pregnant mother and her unborn child, where maternal health inputs are choice variables and her health affects child health. The empirical estimates suggest that mothers value child health up to six times higher than own health, and that the relative value depends on maternal consumption patterns and household characteristics.

Assuming tractable functional forms, long- and short-run comparative-static results are derived to show how the choice variables are affected by the model's parameters.

The results indicate that the dynamic effect of exchange rate on Chinas trade balance is still very limited and Chinas balance of trade is mainly determined by the world demand and its trade performance, with the latter being a result of its successfully maintained comparative advantage.","[Zhang, Zhaoyong] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Perth, WA, Australia; [Sato, Kiyotaka] Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Econ, Yokohama, Kanagawa 240, Japan",Edith Cowan University; Yokohama National University,"Zhang, ZY (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Perth, WA, Australia.",,"Zhang, Zhaoyong/D-5100-2013; Sato, Kiyotaka/F-6489-2018","Zhang, Zhaoyong/0000-0001-9596-2648; Sato, Kiyotaka/0000-0002-1611-9191","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21330074, 20223003] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,26,20,21,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2012,35.0,5,,,,,632,650,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01438.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,936NV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303598200005,0

Legal instruments have been the main tool of integration, but politics come back with a vengeance as democratic practices are challenged by regulatory regimes and institutions. The second one is the alternative between the persistence of an international organization regime or the creation of a federation. This unresolved and lasting issue takes dramatic tones with the euro crisis.

We find that 36 (39%) became private interest representatives after leaving the Commission-14 with registered institutions, 22 with non-registered institutions. Our probit analysis shows that an ex-commissioner is significantly more likely to turn lobbyist if he or she is still young and has been in charge of competition, the internal market, industry or taxation. At the 10% level of significance, the probability is lower if the commissioner has been proposed by a left wing government, has stepped down after the introduction of the code of conduct (1999) or has retired from the Delors I Commission, and the probability is higher for commissioners from central Europe. The descriptive statistics reveal in addition that the share of private interest representatives in all ex-commissioners is largest for Portuguese, Austrian, Bulgarian and Maltese commissioners and zero for Scandinavians. With regard to the commissioners' training, 48% of the lawyers but only 35% of the economists have become lobbyists. Commissioners who have turned private interest representatives have on average stayed somewhat longer (6.3 years) with the Commission than the others (5.5 years). Registered lobbyism is significantly more likely than non-registered lobbyism if the ex-commissioner is a lawyer, has been in charge of competition, the internal market, industry or taxation and-at the 10% level-has been proposed by a left wing government.","[Vaubel, Roland; Klingen, Bernhard; Mueller, David] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Vaubel, R (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",vaubel@uni-mannheim.de; klingen@uni-mannheim.de; davmuell@rumms.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,24,15,15,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

To address this unresolved issue, this paper uses new provincial data on average real land prices, together with a province-level variation in land productivity, to analyze the efficiency of land markets. Specifically, we test, first, whether land markets were spatially integrated and, secondly, whether land prices can be explained with the present value model. Our results suggest that land prices converged across provinces and that their variations were driven by market fundamentals. In consequence, we conclude that the institutional failure in land markets was not the cause of the relatively poor productivity performance of Spanish agriculture.","[Carmona, Juan] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Hist Econ & Inst, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; Univ Carlos III Madrid, Inst Figuerola, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Carmona, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Hist Econ & Inst, C Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",jucar@clio.uc3m.es; jroses@clio.uc3m.es,"Roses, Joan/K-5475-2013; carmona, juan/AAA-6428-2019","Roses, Joan/0000-0003-0661-3134; carmona, juan/0000-0002-1447-2178",,,,,80,14,17,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

We propose and empirically test various structural models of investment for new ship orders in the oil tanker industry, which accommodate estimation of the implied real option value multiple. Because of the competitive characteristics of this industry, the property of myopic equivalence (Leahy, Quart J Econ 108:1105-1133, 1993) in a competitive equilibrium is applied, and the traditional serious problems of aggregation are foregone.

Outsourcing is a key process integrated into the design of the supply chain management. The research also focuses on empirically identifying the role of the outsourcing strategy in hotels. To this end, the authors propose two hypotheses to study the relationship between the benefits and risks of outsourcing and the tendency to use third-party organizations. These hypotheses are analysed and tested in the two regions. The study was conducted on a representative sample of 118 hotels in Scotland and Taiwan. A questionnaire was used to obtain the findings. The results indicate that the principal candidates for outsourcing are the activities requiring technical skills and those services not involving direct contact with guests. No significant differences were found between the current levels of outsourcing in Scottish and Taiwanese hotels. The findings indicate that a stronger perception of the risks and benefits of outsourcing has a greater influence on outsourcing strategy. Furthermore, in the case of Scottish hotels, it is the benefits that determine the level of outsourcing, while it is the risks that do so in Taiwanese hotels. This work contributes to the literature on outsourcing from a services perspective.","[Espino-Rodriguez, Tomas F.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Edificio Dept Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Lai, Pei Chun] Dept Hotel & Restaurant Management, Neipu 912, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Baum, Tom] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XU, Lanark, Scotland",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Strathclyde,"Espino-Rodríguez, TF (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Edificio Dept Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Modulo C, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",tespino@dede.ulpgc.es; pclai@mail.npust.edu.tw; t.g.baum@strath.ac.uk,"Espino-Rodriguez, Tomas F./X-1662-2019; Espino-Rodriguez, Tomas F./G-3390-2013","Espino-Rodriguez, Tomas F./0000-0002-4292-504X; Espino-Rodriguez, Tomas F./0000-0002-4292-504X; Baum, Thomas/0000-0002-5918-847X",,,,,48,17,18,0,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We use the existence of immigrant communities across U.S. states before 1960 and the distance from the Mexican border as instruments for immigration flows. We find no evidence that immigrants crowded out employment. At the same time, we find that immigration had a strong, positive association with total factor productivity and a negative association with the high skill bias of production technologies. The results are consistent with the idea that immigrants promoted efficient task specialization, thus increasing TFP, and also promoted the adoption of unskilled-efficient technologies.","[Peri, Giovanni] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Peri, Giovanni] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Peri, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,,34,212,264,4,67,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

However, the explanation for this is unclear. An individual may want to send a signal of her generosity to improve her own reputation. Alternately ( or additionally) she may value the public good or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic complements, give more to influence others to give more. We perform the first series of laboratory experiments that can separately estimate the impact of these two social effects, and test whether realized influence is consistent with the desire to influence, and whether either of these are consistent with anticipated influence. Our experimental subjects were given the opportunity to contribute from their endowment to Bread for the World, a development NGO. Depending on treatment, leader subjects' donations were reported to other subjects either anonymously or with their identities, and these were reported either before these follower subjects made their donation decisions. We find that leaders are influential only when their identities are revealed along with their donations, and female leaders are more influential than males. Identified leaders' predictions suggest that are aware of their influence. They respond to this by giving more than either the control group or the unidentified leaders. We find mixed evidence for reputation-seeking.","[Reinstein, David] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Riener, Gerhard] Univ Jena GK EIC, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Riener, Gerhard] MPI Econ, D-07743 Jena, Germany",University of Essex,"Reinstein, D (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",drein@essex.ac.uk; gerhard.riener@uni-jena.de,"Reinstein, David/AAD-2454-2020","Reinstein, David/0000-0002-0470-4991; Riener, Gerhard/0000-0003-1056-2034",,,,,49,38,51,0,72,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2012,72.0,2,,,,,221,243,,10.1007/s11238-011-9245-8,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,885JC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299774200005,0

The agreement consists of a fully-fledged development plan, which includes a series of private and public investments for which public funding is provided. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of TPs by comparing the economic performance - in terms of employment and number of plants - of the municipalities taking part in a TP with a sample of municipalities not involved in the policy.

This system allows us to analyse situations in which the volume of what can be divided between players is determined by the way the players divide it, i.e. it is one of the examples of a non-constant sum game. As we anticipate a fully symmetric situation, we may define the term of expected average payoff'. From the term expected average payoff' the concept of commonly acceptable equilibrium is derived. The distribution of wage at an acceptable equilibrium point is (in general) close to Nash's solution to a relevant cooperative game, which is derived from the point whose coordinates coincide with the expected average wage, yet are not completely identical. In the conclusion we outline the practical use of the model based on the definition of the redistribution system as well as a commonly acceptable equilibrium in the context of testing hypotheses concerning the objects called structures based on mutual covering-up of violation of generally accepted principles.

The IMF has always used the conditions attached to its lending to try and shape borrower's policy; here we explore the evolving content of that conditionality and the economic ideas underpinning it. Using recently released IMF records, as well as other archives, we argue that the negotiations between the IMF and the UK Government in the 1960s can be seen as part of the Fund's drive towards a crucial change from discretionary to rules-based approaches to macroeconomic policy making. This drive took place within a struggle over a specific policy instrument, domestic credit expansion (DCE), at that time regarded as an important measure of monetary policy. The article locates the IMF advocacy of DCE within an attempt by the Fund to constrain discretionary policy-making through increasingly specific and binding rules. In response, UK Government officials began to pre-empt and even deceive the Fund to avoid being tied down. Our analysis unpacks which neo-liberal economic ideas the Fund embraced, noting its rejection of monetarism. In the period charted here (1965-69), the rules-based regime remained compatible with Keynesianism. However, the UK Government's grudging acceptance of this approach provided a crucial condition of possibility for a significant qualitative shift in macroeconomic policy-making when rules later became infused with an increasingly neo-liberal character.","[Clift, Ben] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Tomlinson, Jim] Univ Dundee, Dept Hist, Dundee, Scotland",University of Warwick; University of Dundee,"Clift, B (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",,"Clift, Ben/IQT-5716-2023","Clift, Ben/0000-0001-6983-5768",,,,,57,32,33,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Whereas recently made exogenous explanations have shed some more light on aggregate changes in centrality, they remain silent on an endogenous understanding of how individual firms can come to occupy a more central position. To address this, we argue and demonstrate how heterogeneity in firm-level attributes formed by their possession of pioneering technology, alliance portfolio size and choice for alliance organization drives differences among firms in becoming more central. Based on a sample of technology-based alliances in two different high-tech industries (pharmaceuticals and the broader ICT industry), we find evidence for most of our hypotheses. We contribute to the standing literature by considering changes in position as a dependent variable, which goes beyond the dominant approach in which network structural properties have mostly been treated as independent variables. In this way, we contribute to an emerging literature in which the focus shifts away from how network embeddedness enables and constrains action towards what factors affect and shape a firm's network embeddedness through the lens of its structural position.","[Cloodt, Myriam] Eindhoven Univ Technol, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Bertrand-Cloodt, Danielle] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Gilsing, Victor] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; Maastricht University; Tilburg University,"Cloodt, M (通讯作者)，Eindhoven Univ Technol, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",m.m.a.h.cloodt@tue.nl; dam.cloodt@maastrichtuniversity.nl; v.a.gilsing@tilburguniversity.edu,"Cloodt, Myriam/AAY-3882-2020",,,,,,117,0,0,0,18,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,78,+,,,,,,6,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500016,0

Peat soil, which contains high amount of carbon, released carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when RB is practiced and this method is harmful to the environment as it caused among others air pollution. The air quality deteriorated when there is open burning and this can lead to the haze problem when large scale burning is involved. Zero burning (ZB) is a more sustainable method as it mitigated the release of carbon into the atmosphere and it is a step to achieve a better environment. The villagers and farmers in Samarahan are asked to state their willingness to pay (WTP) for better environment in this study and 206 respondents were interviewed. The average WTP among the respondents was RM4.12. This low value is expected as most of the farmers are low income earners but this should not be seen as giving a low environmental value by the community in this area. Policymakers are sometimes looking at the monetary value/cost per se but this does not necessarily mean a relatively low WTP value justifies the lack of effort to promote good agricultural practices such as ZB.","[Daud, Adrian] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Serdang 43400, Malaysia; [Rahim, Khalid Abdul; Shuib, Ahmad] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Agr & Food Policy Studies, Serdang 43400, Malaysia; [Shamsudin, Mad Nasir] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Agr, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Daud, A (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Serdang 43400, Malaysia.",,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,2,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,635,+,,,,,,4,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600055,0

We use Blanchard-Quah [1] decomposition scheme to isolate macroeconomic shocks for further analysis. Alternative VAR model specifications may be used to generate impulse response functions with varied degrees of stratification and interpretation possibilities. We evaluate the homogeneity of expected costs of disinflationary monetary policy among VG countries by studying the impulse response dynamics of the output cost of disinflation. Our results indicate that VG countries do not exhibit a statistically significant symmetric behaviour in response to incurred monetary shocks.

Recognizing the difficulty of identifying market power in the crude oil market by empirical studies, we propose a numerical partial equilibrium model formulated as a mixed complementarity problem. Our approach allows for strategic behavior in a Nash-Cournot market, a Stackelberg leader-follower game, an OPEC oligopoly or cartel, as well as perfect competition. To take account of liquid spot markets, the model specifically includes arbitragers to capture the effect of global crude oil market integration. Our results indicate a market structure shift over the past years. Reported quantities and prices before the 2008 turmoil are close to those derived from a Stackelberg market simulation, with Saudi Arabia acting as Stackelberg leader vis-a-vis a non-cooperative OPEC oligopoly and a competitive fringe. However, in 2008 and 2009, observed prices are closer to the competitive benchmark.

The Slovak Republic (SR) is a typical example of small open economy, as the openness of its economy is approx. 160% according to data of 2011 (defined as the share of total export and import of goods in GDP at current prices). The main objective of this paper is to identify an influence of foreign factors on the domestic economy. The empirical approach VAR (vector autoregression) is applied for this purpose. Both domestic and foreign economies are represented by basic macroeconomic indicators - gross domestic product, inflation and interest rate and the foreign economy also by the exchange rate and oil price. The most significant foreign partners of the SR are selected according to their maximum contribution to the openness of the Slovak economy.

In the end, employees fail to follow the organisation's security polices out of ignorance. The solution to this problem is two-fold. First, companies must create security policies and then develop sustainable awareness training campaign to inform and educate staff of the existence of these policies. The security policies will define the tolerable use of organisational data, and will help the organisation in minimizing the threats. This research study took a quantitative research approach and questionnaires were distributed to different organisations in the Greater Mahikeng area, one of South Africa's cities.

A customer is characterized by a nonnegative demand of each commodity and a time window allowing its delivery. The goal is to service all customers under the vehicle capacity constraints and time windows constraints with minimal total cost.

The goal of the authors is financial and legal analysis of factoring in the changing environment. The authors analyze the main features, benefits and costs of factoring implementation by small and medium enterprises (with a particular emphasis on the use of factoring in the service sector), and show that the use of factoring can improve profitability, liquidity and cash-flow of business, management of time, credit and default risks. However, the use of factoring is limited because of many restrictions and hidden cost coming from the legal environment.

We argue that Chinese SMEs are facing several challenges that limit their implementation of environmental practices and environmental sound technology: lack of environmental responsibility awareness, lack of technological absorptive capacity, lack of financial resources, difficulty to access conventional loans, and short-term economic perspective. Environmentally sound technology (EST) represents a necessity for allowing economic development without significant environmental degradation. Our main recommendations for Chinese SMEs to achieve environmental sustainable development include a strengthening of firms' technological absorptive capacity, implementation of good housekeeping procedures; building linkages between financiers of SMEs and EST owners and centers, providing support mechanisms to encourage the development of financial flows; diffuse EST through a combination of effective knowledge transfer and diffusion mechanisms; and finally promote technological and financial synergy with SMEs different stakeholders.","[Stevens, Randriamalala Jean Luc] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China; [Stevenson, Randriamalala Jean] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology,"Stevens, RJL (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China.",luc_stevens@hotmail.fr; jeanstevenson@hotmail.com,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,3,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,315,+,,,,,,3,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500047,0

However, this raised the same issues later faced by the National Communists: as membership was extended to those with a 'doubtful' background, and the press played down 'proletarian internationalism', Moscow took fright.

The assumed oligopoly scenario cannot explain market equilibria for any year While we find that the competitive model simulates market equilibria well in 2006, the competitive model is yet not able to reproduce real market outcomes in 2008.

At present, the production of a number of products in China are at the forefront of the world, the international balance of payments surplus is very large, but this does not mean that we are a powerful trading country, and does not urge the continued development of the national economy. In my opinion, in order to make the country strong and sustained development, we must foster the concept of powerful trading country, use soft power of the state and its enterprises as the correct and effective measure to be a powerful trading country. Speaking from the phenomenon level, trading is a kind of exchange among different regions, but from the essence level it is a process that makes an optimal allocation of resources among regions or countries. Therefore, the commodity exchange through the trading activities, in essence, is to maximize the regional or national interest through circulation of commodities. A country with large trading quantity is not always a country with strong trade power. A large trading country maybe is just the large volume of trade, rather than the maximization of the various national interests. For China's sustained economic and social development, it is not enough to be a large trading country, we have to build a powerful trading country. Building a powerful trading country, especially in the 21st century, could not depend on natural resources and cheap labor, but the cultural soft power of a state and enterprises. From the perspective of international trade, that is not to depend on the entity trade, but to depend on the trade in services. Therefore, it is the fundamental way solution of developing trade in services, constructing the powerful trading country, achieving sustainable development of China to enhance the soft power of our country and enterprises, to rely on the construction of China's traditional culture, which greatly improved the cultural quality and the level of knowledge of our people.","[Wang Haibin] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,,wanghaibin@whut.edu.cn,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,7,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,1081,1085,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500171,0

The results indicate that monetary control can reduce the amplitude of fluctuations at frequencies near the region of historic business cycles. However, with significant time lags in the control loop, monetary control tends to increase the amplitude of the fluctuations at the higher frequencies.

One factor usually outsourced is knowledge. Key providers of this asset are firms offering knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS); the strength of Krakow's position on the tourism market could be significantly influenced by KIBS firms. The objective of this study is to analyse the relationship between the development in Krakow of tourism, on the one hand, and KIBS firms, on the other. A review of the literature confirmed that KIBS are a determinant of the city's potential (including that of the tourism sector). Analysis of tourism supply, represented by the growth dynamic in the hotel segment, shows a higher increase than in tourism movement, but significantly lower than in many other KIBS subsectors. In this context the competitiveness and innovation of Krakow's tourism companies could be boosted by knowledge and expertise from KIBS companies.","[Borodako, Krzysztof; Berbeka, Jadwiga; Rudnicki, Michal] Cracow Univ Econ, Tourism Dept, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Borodako, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Tourism Dept, 27 Rakowicka St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",borodako@uek.krakow.pl; jadwiga.berbeka@uek.krakow.pl; michal.rudnicki@uek.krakow.pl,"Borodako, Krzysztof/T-2587-2018; Berbeka, Jadwiga/IAO-8537-2023","Borodako, Krzysztof/0000-0002-7348-8372; Berbeka, Jadwiga/0000-0002-3136-2800; Rudnicki, Michal/0000-0003-3310-8117",National Science Center [DEC-2011/01/D/HSA/03983],"National Science Center(National Science Centre, Poland)",The project on which this paper is based was financed with a National Science Center grant pursuant to decision DEC-2011/01/D/HSA/03983.,,30,6,7,3,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Children of immigrants in a broad set of European countries with ancestry from across the world are studied. Individuals are examined within country of residence using variation in trust across countries of ancestry. The approach addresses reverse causality and concerns that the trust measure picks up institutional factors in the individual's contextual setting. There is a significant positive estimate of ancestral trust in explaining self-assessed health. The finding is robust to accounting for individual, parental, and extensive ancestral country characteristics. Individuals with higher ancestral trust are also less likely to be hampered by health problems in their daily life, providing evidence of trust influencing real life outcomes. Individuals with high trust feel and act healthier, enabling a more productive life. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Far from deepening democratisation, what has emerged instead is a political terrain increasingly reminiscent of what Nicos Poulantzas termed 'authoritarian statism'. The present article aims to illuminate this phenomenon in relation to the institutional shifts within the EU that both preceded and followed the debt crisis, as well as in relation to the historical processes of uneven and combined development that form the ground upon which the European state project has been erected. Our overarching goal is to theorise the EU as a manifestation of contradictory tendencies towards transnationalisation within which elements of nation-states play a constitutive role, but one that simultaneously exacerbates Europe's crisis tendencies. It is this intractable tension within the internal structure of the EU that has given rise to a transnational authoritarian statism across Europe expressed in a 'strengthening-weakening' of state power, i.e. a reinforcement of state authority that simultaneously expresses and exacerbates the political crisis to which it seeks to respond.","[Sandbeck, Sune] York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Schneider, Etienne] Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",York University - Canada; University of Vienna,"Sandbeck, S (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",sandbeck@yorku.ca; etienne.schneider@univie.ac.at,"Schneider, Etienne/H-1920-2018","Schneider, Etienne/0000-0002-4243-7337",,,,,56,22,22,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The aims of the paper are threefold. First, a novel dataset consisting of 120 disaggregated macroeconomic time series spanning the period 1999:M1 through 2011:M12 is gathered for the EA as an aggregate. Second, a Bayesian joint estimation technique of the FAVAR approach is applied to the European data in order to investigate the impacts of monetary policy shocks on the economy. Third, time variation in the transmission mechanism and the impact of the global financial crisis are investigated in the FAVAR context using a rolling windows technique. We find that there are considerable gains from the implementation of the Bayesian technique such as smoother impulse response functions and statistical significance of the estimates. According to our rolling estimations, consumer prices and monetary aggregates display the most time-variant responses to the monetary policy shocks in the EA.","[Bagzibagli, Kemal] JDINTL Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Bagzibagli, Kemal] Cambridge Resources Int Inc, Cambridge, MA USA",Queens University - Canada,"Bagzibagli, K (通讯作者)，JDINTL Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada.",kemal.bagzibagli@cri-world.com,"Bagzibagli, Kemal/P-8541-2014",,,,,,69,4,4,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Understanding the spatial structure of these factors is particularly relevant in order to efficiently allocate resources. This paper explores the general equilibrium spatial structure of health outcomes and health behaviours across Scottish health boards using a variant of the spatial Durbin model which allows for an a priori unknown spatial weights matrix. The results suggest that there is substantial spatial dynamics in behaviours across health boards and that these spillovers are, as expected, asymmetric. We then demonstrate how the model can be used to estimate the behavioural and health impact of a targeted education policy within each health board taking into account both the direct effect on the particular health board itself and the indirect effect in terms of spillovers. The results illustrate how the dynamic effects should play a large role in designing place based policies that maximise the overall effectiveness of health interventions. Taking into account the spatial dynamics allows policy makers to better target resources and interventions on particular clusters where the direct and indirect spillover benefits are likely to be the greatest in terms of improving health.

To address reliability issues, transit authorities have begun to provide real-time information (RTI) to riders via mobile and web-enabled devices. The objective of this research is to quantify the benefits of RTI provided to bus riders. The method used is a behavioral experiment with a before-after control group design in which RTI is only provided to the experimental group. Web-based surveys are used to measure behavior, feeling, and satisfaction changes of bus riders in Tampa, Florida over a study period of approximately three months. The results show that the primary benefits associated with providing RTI to passengers pertain to waiting at the bus stop. Analysis of usual wait times revealed a significantly larger decrease (nearly 2 min) for RTI users compared to the control group. Additionally, RTI users had significant decreases in levels of anxiety and frustration when waiting for the bus compared to the control group. Similarly, they had significant increases in levels of satisfaction with the time they spend waiting for the bus and how often the bus arrives at the stop on time. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence that RTI significantly improves the passenger experience of waiting for the bus, which is notoriously one of the most disliked elements of transit trips. The frequency of bus trips and bus-to-bus transfers were also evaluated during the study period, but there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups. This is not surprising since the majority of bus riders in Tampa are transit-dependent and lack other transportation alternatives. The primary contribution of this research is a comprehensive evaluation of the passenger benefits of RTI conducted in a controlled environment. Moreover, this research has immediate implications for public transit agencies - particularly those serving largely transit-dependent populations - facing pressure to improve service under tight budget constraints.

Acknowledging the fact that units in the same building serve as close substitutes for each other, we show that within the same building, a recently realized transaction price may generate two signaling effects on potential buyers' willingness to pay. First, the average willingness to pay among buyers is positively correlated with the observed price level, which we interpret as a spatio-temporal autocorrelation effect; second, after observing a price signal, the heterogeneity of potential buyer's willingness to pay decreases, which urges the seller to mark down the asking price. Using a geo-coded dataset on condominium transactions in Singapore, we find significant evidence of the reference dependence effect. Meanwhile, we find that the spatio-temporal autocorrelation among the units in the same building is significantly higher than with the units in the neighboring buildings. Furthermore, after controlling for the autocorrelation effect, we find that sellers tend to mark down their asking prices if a recent transaction has occurred within the same building, consistent with the prediction from decreasing bidding heterogeneity. We also propose a measure on potential buyers' outside option and find consistent evidence that the realized transaction price decreases with the outside option. Finally, using a proxy measure on the exogenous arrival rate of potential buyers, we show evidence that sellers' asking prices tend to increase with the arrival rate, as predicted by the model.","[Sun, Hua] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Accounting & Finance, Coll Business & Publ Adm, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA; [Ong, Seow Eng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Sch Design & Environm, Singapore 117548, Singapore",California State University System; California State University San Bernardino; National University of Singapore,"Sun, H (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Accounting & Finance, Coll Business & Publ Adm, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA.",hsun@csusb.edu; seong@nus.edu.sg,"Ong, Seow Eng/ABB-9098-2020","Sun, Hua/0000-0002-9232-7777",,,,,14,6,8,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Unlike other accounts of normalization, however, it is argued here that these transformations are only partly desirable, and that a better direction for the future is to develop EU-US research as a distinct programme within EU studies, centred on a 'dual mission' - theoretical and empirical - that accepts political science's scope and explanatory objectives, but at the same time sees the two cases as worthy of being studied in isolation owing to their importance and the political value of their comparison.","[Tortola, Pier Domenico] Ctr Federalismo, I-10024 Moncalieri, TO, Italy; [Tortola, Pier Domenico] Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, TO, Italy",Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Tortola, PD (通讯作者)，Ctr Federalismo, Via Real Coll 30, I-10024 Moncalieri, TO, Italy.",tortola@csfederalismo.it,"Tortola, Pier Domenico/K-8479-2019","Tortola, Pier Domenico/0000-0003-4865-572X",,,,,55,8,9,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We apply the bivariate panel ordered probit model to the analysis of the simultaneous determination of the male's and the female's risk attitude, using the survey question about general willingness to take risk, provided on a 0-10 Likert-scale. The correlations between both the individual-specific effects of the two partners and the two within-individual errors are separately estimated, and found to be +0.285 and +0.310, respectively. We consider the former to be a key parameter, since its positive sign may be interpreted in terms of positive assortative mating on risk attitude: individuals tend to form partnerships with others having a similar risk attitude. We also find evidence that this correlation increases with years of marriage, suggesting either a form of spousal socialization or a selection process in which marriage breakdown is more likely in poorly matched couples.","[Bacon, Philomena M.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Conte, Anna] Max Planck Inst Econ, Strateg Interact Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Conte, Anna] Univ Westminster, EQM Dept, London NW1 5LS, England; [Moffatt, Peter G.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; Max Planck Society; University of Westminster; University of East Anglia,"Moffatt, PG (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",aconte@econ.mpg.de; p.moffatt@uea.ac.uk,"Conte, Anna/GLT-3497-2022","Conte, Anna/0000-0002-9234-5705",,,,,34,24,24,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2014,77.0,3,,,SI,,389,401,,10.1007/s11238-014-9448-x,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AO8VB,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341632000009,0

Several studies have shown that sustainable buildings command a rent premium compared to comparable conventional buildings. Lower operating expenses are expected to be a major source of the rent premium that sustainable buildings command. This is especially the case for buildings with triple-net leases, where tenants directly benefit from savings in operating costs. For a large dataset of U.S. office buildings this study finds significantly lower operating expenses in LEED certified buildings. However, savings in operating expenses only explain part of the rent premium. Additional factors must be at work. Surprisingly, we find significantly higher operating expenses in Energy Star rated buildings. Hence, intangible benefits appear to be the major source of rental premiums of Energy Star rated buildings.","EBS Univ Wirtschaft & Recht, Real Estate Management Inst, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany",European Business School (EBS) University,"Reichardt, A (通讯作者)，EBS Univ Wirtschaft & Recht, Real Estate Management Inst, Gustav Stresemann Ring 3, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany.",ar_2809@hotmail.com,,,,,,,35,34,36,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Many research works show that Diaspora consumers affect exports from their country of origin. The methodology applied consisted in comparing the import and export elasticities determined by the gravity model to assess whether the preference effect is more or less high. We took into account a category of products (local products) not yet investigated by international economic research. These products deserve much attention since they are becoming increasingly important in international trade. Indeed, they represent on average 31% of the total agricultural/agro-food products exported by Algeria. In this study we carried out a questionnaire-based survey focussing on consumers of Algerian Diaspora, to evaluate their preferences towards the products from their country of origin. Our results showed a clear preference effect of Diaspora consumers on local products.","[Hadjou, Alamara] Univ Montpellier I, F-34006 Montpellier, France; [Hadjou, Alamara] Univ Bejaia, Bejaia, Algeria; [Cheriet, Foued] Montpellier SupAgro, UMR MOISA 1110, Montpellier, France; [Djenane, Abdel-Madjid] Univ Setif, Setif, Algeria",Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Bejaia; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite Ferhat Abbas Setif,"Hadjou, A (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier I, F-34006 Montpellier, France.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,7,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2014,13.0,3,,,,,13,22,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AU4UC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345605800002,0

In particular, pure exporters arise when the export market is sufficiently large - a situation more likely to hold in developing countries as opposed to large developed countries, and their productivity levels are above those of nonexporters, but below those of firms having both domestic sales and export.

This as an important undertaking as allocation of financial savings is expected to have an impact on the incentives faced by ship owners to invest in more energy efficient vessels. We focus on the dry bulk Panamax segment as it contributes to around 50 Mt (5%) of total CO2 emissions from shipping in 2007 and therefore its importance in terms of environmental impact should not be neglected. The time charter market represents a classical example of the principal agent problem similar to the tenant landlord problem in the buildings sector. We discovered that on average only 40% of the financial savings delivered by energy efficiency accrue to ship owner for the period 2008-2012. The finding that only part of the savings are recouped by shipowners affecting their incentives towards energy efficiency could consequently have implications on the type of emission reduction policies opted at both, global and regional levels.

This study examines the discounts associated with foreclosure and short sale status in the Fresno, California from 2006 to 2010, a time period containing significant housing price volatility. Generally, we find approximately 20 % and 13 % discounts for foreclosure transactions and short sale transactions, respectively. These discounts remain consistent even after controlling for endogeneity of time-on-the-market and self-selection bias. We also document that both the foreclosure and short-sale discounts are time varying based on market conditions. Both foreclosure and short-sale discounts increase from 2008 to 2009 and decrease in 2010. Also, the foreclosure status decreases time on the market while the short-sale status increases time on the market.","[Aroul, Ramya Rajajagadeesan] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Hansz, J.

The model is able to detect rational bubbles while they rise and to predict the most likely time of their collapse. We apply the model to daily price data on U.S. Equity REITs from 1989 to 2011. Our findings suggest the existence of a bubble for the period of 2003 to 2007.

I argue that the levels of foreign ownership and domestic bank internationalization are important determinants of the extent to which governments are prepared to endorse European solutions in banking supervision or prefer national ones. I test two hypotheses about the impact of foreign ownership and domestic bank internationalization on regulatory preferences. This article shows that being a host jurisdiction to foreign financial institutions constrains states' ability to steer credit flows and tackle perceived threats to national financial stability. As a consequence, decision-makers seek to preserve some national regulatory autonomy. Especially during economic downturns, national supervisory authorities have strong incentives to pursue policies that minimize losses for domestic stake-holders and shift burdens onto foreign ones.","Maastricht Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Spendzharova, AB (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands.",,,"Spendzharova, Aneta/0000-0002-6764-1430",,,,,96,41,42,0,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The government took various policies to convert the petroleum vehicles on road to run on compressed natural gas (CNG), which allows both air quality improvements and energy security benefits. One of the market friendly policies to encourage the fuel switch was to increase the price differential between CNG and petrol and diesel. This has allowed a wide-scale adoption of CNG as the fuel of choice. However, several years into the policy, there is now a widespread belief among the policymakers that the CNG conversion may have increased car ownership and car travel due to their lower running costs, resulting in more congestion and a reversal of the strategy is on the cards. It is therefore important to test the hypothesis whether CNG conversion had genuinely increased car ownership and car travel in Dhaka city. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire survey and an econometric intervention analysis to understand the impact of CNG conversion on car ownership and car travel in Dhaka. Attention is also given to disentangle the self-selection and price-induced travel effects of CNG conversion. Results show that ownership did not increase, but travel of on-road vehicles increased due to the CNG policy. However, additional congestion costs are still around one half of the health benefits brought about by the policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We use debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios and the number of loans on commercial commitments as proxies for the funding liquidity of REITs. We use Amihud Illiquidity measurement and Turnover Ratio measurement to estimate REIT market trading liquidity. Our results are fourfold: one, funding liquidity is influenced by changes in macroeconomic factors; two, macroeconomic effects are different across phases of the business cycle; three, funding liquidity is significantly positively related to REIT market liquidity (this is supportive of Brunnermeier and Petersen's Review of Financial Studies, 22:2201-2238 (2009) findings); and four, these effects vary across economic regimes.

Extending the current hospitality literature, this paper tests asymmetric effects of Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy changes on long-term US hospitality index returns (HIRs) in bull and bear markets. Monetary policy changes are measured by directional changes in the discount rate (dr) and in the federal funds rate (ffr). This study uses a Markov regime-switching model of stock returns to identify bull and bear stock market conditions. The test results bring new evidence to the hospitality literature. The significant effects of both dr and ffr on all five HIRs exist only in bear markets over the 36-year period from January 1973 to May 2008. In addition, after controlling for all three different macroeconomic conditions, asymmetry in the impact of both dr and ffr remains robust in bear markets, but not in business cycle contractions or under tight credit market conditions. The findings support the credit channel of monetary policy transmission mechanism by showing that characteristics of hospitality sectors interact with stock market conditions to determine the impact of Fed policy changes on HIRs.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, MH (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan.",finmhc@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,5,5,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

A test for partial monotonicity in datasets could (1) increase model performance if monotonicity may be assumed, (2) validate the practical relevance of policy and legal requirements, and (3) guard against falsely assuming monotonicity both in theory and applications. To our knowledge, there is no test for this phenomenon available yet. In this article, we propose a novel non-parametric test, which does not require resampling or simulation. It is formally proven that the test is asymptotically conservative, and that its power converges to one. A brief simulation study shows the characteristics of the test. Finally, in order to show its practical applicability, we apply the test to a dataset and interpret its results.","[van Beek, Misha; Daniels, Hennie A.

The benefit of consuming an amount of water is given by a continuous, concave benefit function. In this setting, a solution efficiently distributes water over the agents and wastes no money. Since we deal with concave benefit functions, it is not always possible to follow the usual approach and define a cooperative river game. Instead, we directly introduce axioms for solutions on the water allocation problem. Besides three basic axioms, we introduce two independence axioms to characterize the downstream incremental solution, introduced by Ambec and Sprumont (J Econ Theory 107:453-462, 2002), and a new solution, called the UTI incremental solution. Both solutions can be implemented by allocating the water optimally among the agents and monetary transfers between the agents. We also consider the particular case in which every agent has a satiation point, constant marginal benefit equal to one up to its satiation point and marginal benefit of zero thereafter. This boils down to a water claim problem, where each agent only has a nonnegative claim on water, but no benefit function is specified. In this case, both solutions can be implemented without monetary transfers.","[van den Brink, Rene; Estevez-Fernandez, Arantza; van der Laan, Gerard; Moes, Nigel] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van den Brink, Rene; Estevez-Fernandez, Arantza; van der Laan, Gerard; Moes, Nigel] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van den Brink, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jrbrink@feweb.vu.nl; mestevez@feweb.vu.nl; glaan@feweb.vu.nl; nmoes@feweb.vu.nl,,"Estevez-Fernandez, Arantza/0000-0002-3747-4010; van den Brink, Rene/0000-0001-8570-3706",,,,,18,8,8,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2014,43.0,1,,,,,173,194,,10.1007/s00355-013-0771-x,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AI7RS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337094300010,0

We suggest an estimator for the regression parameters, and demonstrate its consistency and asymptotic normality. We also suggest an estimator for the large sample variance-covariance matrix of that distribution. We then apply our results to an interstate panel data cigarette demand model which contains an endogenous weighting matrix. Among other things, our results suggest that there is a bootlegging effect in which buyers, or, more generally agents, cross state borders to purchase cigarette.

We compared the results of VAR and FAVAR model and the results showed that FAVAR model explains the effects of monetary policy which are consistent with the theory and better than the VAR model. VAR model shows the existence of price puzzle and liquidity puzzle in Pakistan while FAVAR model did not provide any evidence of puzzles. Interest rate negatively influences prices, hence interest rate is a good instrument for controlling inflation in Pakistan but it takes a lag of 5 months. The transmission of monetary policy shock is faster in case of prices as compared to output in Pakistan.

Each period represents different dynamics (including the Global Financial Crisis) in the life of the REIT industry and leads to a different hypothesis. Further, we present comparative results based on the Fama-French 3- and 4-factor models. Overall, we document a negative relation between idiosyncratic risk and cross-sectional expected returns and demonstrate that this negative relation changes over time. These findings amplify the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle, as reported in the recent finance literature. Interestingly, REITs with a price of $5-to-$10 do well in 2009 and 2010. Further, the momentum factor appears to be influential since the first-ever listing of a REIT in the S&P500 Index in early October 2001.","[Cakici, Nusret] Fordham Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Erol, Isil] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Tirtiroglu, Dogan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",Fordham University; Middle East Technical University; University of Adelaide,"Tirtiroglu, D (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",cakici@fordham.edu; isile@metu.edu.tr; dtirtiroglu@yahoo.com,,"Erol, Isil/0000-0001-8125-9118",,,,,48,9,10,3,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In particular, the author explores whether tourism spending leads to a decline in the proportion of people helms the poverty line. An error correction model is applied to estimate the relationship between poverty and tourism spending. The results reveal that tourism does matter for the poor, but that it does not appear to have systematic effects, and that tourism development matters most for the poor at the lower levels of economic development. The findings from the two developing country case studies show differing impacts of tourism development, and thus the policy implications differ for each case.","Univ Cent Florida, Rosen Coll Hospitality Management, Orlando, FL 32819 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Croes, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Rosen Coll Hospitality Management, 9907 Universal Blvd, Orlando, FL 32819 USA.",robertico.croes@ucf.edu,,,,,,,75,82,96,1,99,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In this article, the work/family arrangements and practices of nurses are compared with those of builders in Melbourne, Australia. The concept of family time economies is used to explore the intersections of work time and family time. Some change in traditional gender divisions of labour was evident in the nurses' families but in the builders' families more traditional gender specialization was displayed. The article contends that the organization of work time shapes the temporal structures of family life. Gendered patterns of employment in sex-segregated industries intersect with gendered family care practices in complicated and sometimes contradictory ways, but gendered differences at work and at home have a significant influence on how time for paid work and care is distributed between parents.","[Lindsay, Jo] Monash Univ, Sch Polit & Social Inquiry, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Maher, JaneMaree] Monash Univ, Ctr Womens Studies & Gender Res, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Maher, JaneMaree] Monash Univ, Social & Polit Sci Grad Res Programme, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University; Monash University; Monash University,"Lindsay, J (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Sch Polit & Social Inquiry, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",Jo.Lindsay@monash.edu,"Lindsay, Jo/A-4256-2012; Maher, JaneMaree/G-9193-2016","Lindsay, Jo/0000-0001-9717-627X; Maher, JaneMaree/0000-0002-6592-8390",,,,,40,13,17,1,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In preparing a common proposal for the European Union, the European Commission initially appeared to favour the FAT, but then swung its weight behind the FTT in late 2011. Its rationale was that in addition to generating revenue, this tax could also help to stabilize the financial markets by curbing excessive speculative trading. This article takes a different position. Its central argument is that the FTT would amplify rather than dampen market instability by interfering with the functions of important financial institutions. Its chief conclusion is that the FAT is superior to the FTT.","[Grahl, John] Middlesex Univ, London NW4 4BT, England; [Lysandrou, Photis] City Univ London, London, England",Middlesex University; City University London,"Grahl, J (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, London NW4 4BT, England.",j.grahl@mdx.ac.uk,,,,,,,22,14,15,1,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In particular, we examine whether long-run growth in labor force participation rates can be modeled by smooth transitions between states rather than as abrupt mean level changes or as a stochastic trend. Smooth transitions permit for non-instantaneous adjustment of individual workers to changes associated with economic events or general labor market conditions. We employ unit root testing procedures with alternatives characterized by stationary fluctuations around one or two smooth transitions in linear trend. We examine labor force participation rates by gender- and age-specific groups. The results indicate that all female and most male participation series are better characterized as stationary processes that undergo transitional deterministics.","[Salamaliki, Paraskevi K.; Venetis, Ioannis A.] Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Rion 26504, Greece",University of Patras,"Venetis, IA (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Rion 26504, Greece.",ivenetis@upatras.gr,"Venetis, Ioannis A./P-2959-2017","VENETIS, IOANNIS/0000-0001-6252-5353",,,,,53,5,5,0,18,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We seek to identify the conditions leading to a shift in the choice of strategies from attempts at informal agreements with extortionists controlling means of coercion to cooperation of businessmen and trace the further evolution of organized forms of collective action.

The paper evaluates the economic damage caused by typhoon Morakot. The author uses long-term tourist trend lines as the basis for calculating disaster losses and adopts an error correction model as a measurement method for the estimation. The study finds that the entire park lost over 700,000 visitors in the year and a half after the disaster, representing a loss of NT$ 1.39 billion in tourism business - a value three times the infrastructure loss. Any delays in reconstruction will increase the losses to the tourism industry. However, several tourist spots were gradually losing their attractiveness even before the disaster, and hastening to rebuild such sites is not conducive to the recovery of tourism. Rather, efforts should first be made to understand the reasons why these tourist spots were becoming less attractive and to gauge tourist demand for them before their reconstruction.","Natl TaiChung Univ Educ, Grad Program Sustainable Tourism & Recreat Manage, Taichung 40306, Taiwan",National Taichung University of Education,"Liu, TM (通讯作者)，Natl TaiChung Univ Educ, Grad Program Sustainable Tourism & Recreat Manage, 140 Min Sheng Rd, Taichung 40306, Taiwan.",liutm.tw@gmail.com,"Liu, Tzu-Ming/V-5520-2019","Liu, Tzu-Ming/0000-0002-8187-9779",,,,,31,19,20,7,56,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Previous analyses have focused on policy commitments made by countries in international agreements, but in many cases, these commitments do not reflect actual policy. This paper describes a new initiative to collect comparable information on trade policies for services from 103 countries across a range of service sectors and relevant modes of service delivery. The resulting database reveals interesting policy patterns. Although public monopolies are now rare and few services markets are completely closed, we observe numerous second-generation restrictions on entry, ownership, and operations. Even in instances in which there is little explicit discrimination against foreign providers, market access is often unpredictable because the allocation of new licenses remains opaque and highly discretionary in many countries. Across regions, some of the fastest-growing countries in Asia and the oil-rich Gulf states have restrictive policies in services, whereas some of the poorest countries are remarkably open. Across sectors, professional and transportation services are among the most protected industries in both industrial and developing countries, whereas retail, telecommunications, and even finance tend to be more open.","[Borchert, Ingo] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Gootiiz, Batshur; Mattoo, Aaditya] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Sussex; The World Bank,"Mattoo, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",I.Borchert@sussex.ac.uk; bgootiiz@gmail.com; amattoo@worldbank.org,,"Borchert, Ingo/0009-0002-9512-5713",,,,,16,70,72,1,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Using the sustainable livelihoods concept, this study analyzes the ability of households to adapt to the changing environment from both, household assets' availability and vulnerability to external structures. Results of field survey and in-depth interviews indicate that basic needs such as shelter, water and electricity supply were improved after resettlement. Contrary, production of cash crops is based on principles of contract farming and is highly subsidized. Not appropriate production techniques and vast use of agro-toxins were observed as major causes of harvest losses. Low purchasing price is making the promissory dairy production ineffective. Moreover, farmers' food spending creates significant part of household expenditures. Based on these results we suggest creation of sustainable locally-based agri-business aimed to diversify production, promote agro-tourism in the region and thus strengthen community resilience.","[Brtnikova, Petra; Verner, Vladimir] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Brtníková, P (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Verner, Vladimir/E-5494-2012","Verner, Vladimir/0000-0002-1075-248X",,,,,15,0,0,0,10,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,199,206,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800026,0

When evaluating its ridership benefits, previous studies often choose the city/county/region as control groups, rather than comparable corridors without rail, and hence overstate its impacts. In this study, we employ propensity score matching to explore the impact of Hiawatha light rail transit (LRT) on transit use. We find that compared to residents in similar urban corridors, the Hiawatha LRT promotes transit use of residents who have lived in the corridor before its opening, and that residents who moved to the corridor after its opening use transit as often as new residents in the comparable urban corridors without LRT. We conclude that besides LRT, land use and transportation policies are necessary for ridership growth.

In the recent past, the multiple-barrier approach has been adapted in research to develop measures to reduce contamination at different levels on the food chain. However, adoption of these measures could be constrained by low awareness levels of risks and risk-reduction measures as well as lack of adoption incentives. This paper presents various approaches and practical considerations that could enhance adoption rates of these measures, based on lessons learned from extensive studies carried out in Ghana. These studies include participatory development of risk reduction measures where end-users are actively involved in the process, incorporating their perceptions, needs and constraints. In addition, relevant social marketing techniques, incentive systems, awareness creation/education strategies and appropriate regulation measures are described. However, for optimal adoption, a combined framework of the most relevant approaches is advised.","[Keraitaa, B.; Amoah, P.] IWMI Africa Off, Accra, Ghana; [Drechsel, P.] IWMI Headquarters, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Akple, M.] Ho Polytech, Ho, Ghana",,"Keraitaa, B (通讯作者)，IWMI Africa Off, Accra, Ghana.",,"Akple, Maxwell Selase/ABB-1808-2021","Akple, Maxwell Selase/0000-0001-6239-5149",,,,,23,1,1,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-08-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1021.0,,,,,,391,399,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB5GQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343861400036,0

The issue of employability is a complex one, and is, among others, dealt with by students' associations which are present at the university through various projects and initiatives. These associations raise the awareness about this issue among the student population. The term employability depends greatly on the context, and it is difficult to define. In this paper employability is defined as the continuous fulfilling, acquiring or creating of work through the optimal use of competences (Van Der Heijden et al., 2009.). Senior students possess distinct knowledge, skills and attitudes, and employability, in particular, deals with ways of including these students into the national and international labor market. The objective of this paper is to present what university can do to increase the employability of its students. In the first part of the paper the role of university programs in it is examined. In the second part attention is given to a project of a students' association Entrepreneurs without borders (EWoB), active at the Faculty of Economics in Osijek. The project, during the Global Entrepreneurship Week 2013, dealt with the issue of youth employability and their competitiveness on the labor market after finishing formal university education. Apart from the literature review of the topic, the paper presents a real-life example. For research purposes, a qualitative research method, an interview, is used, and attitudes and perceptions of participants of the EWoB project on the topic of employability and the role of university are analyzed and preliminary findings provided.","[Koenig, Ljerka Sedlan] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Croatia Dept Econ, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"König, LS (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Croatia Dept Econ, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek, Croatia.",sedlan@efos.hr; nikolina.mezulic@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,9,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,670,680,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600066,0

It consists of several phases that guide future entrepreneurs through the process of idea validation and defining all the elements needed for starting a business venture. Understanding the entrepreneurial process is important for understanding the big picture of entrepreneurial venture, which includes all the elements that are needed to convert an idea to a successful business venture. The most important thing in this process is to evaluate whether an idea is a business opportunity. Business opportunity is the initiator of business venture and it consists of a series of circumstances in the market that enable turning a business idea into a business venture. There are many tools and methods that can be used in the process of evaluation and validation of a business idea. These methods can also help in the process of modification and adaption of the business idea to the environment in which the business venture will develop. Vast majority of entrepreneurs pay too much attention to business idea and they decide to start a business venture without a lot of thinking and researching. Because of that, many business ventures fail at the beginning of their existence. The goal of this paper is to explain the importance of understanding the difference between business idea and business opportunity, to explain different methods of evaluation of business opportunity and to explain the importance of balance of the main elements of business venture (business opportunity, resources and team). Using the example of private initiative in preschool education (starting a Montessori kindergarten,) the goal is to show how a seemingly good business idea does not have to be a good business opportunity.","[Peterka, Suncica Oberman; Delic, Anamarija] Sveuciliste JJ Strossmayera Osijeku, Osijek, Croatia; [Tomasevic, Vedrana] Konzum Dd, Zagreb, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Peterka, SO (通讯作者)，Sveuciliste JJ Strossmayera Osijeku, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek, Croatia.",suncica@efos.hr; adelic@efos.hr; vedrana.tomasevic@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,406,417,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600039,0

They show that the region likely achieved modest improvements in per capita GDP over this period despite a number of demographic factors that tended to slow the pace of growth. Nonetheless the rate of growth we find is below that commonly assumed to have prevailed in eighteenth century North America and calls those estimates into question. The striking feature of the region's economy in the eighteenth century was not the rising living-standard, but its ability to achieve rapid extensive growth without a decline in living standards. To contemporaries this extensive growth and short-term volatility in incomes must have been much more visible than any trend improvement in overall well-being. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Applying a univariate time series approach, the results from the quarterly transaction-based Nationwide Building Society indices from 1974 to 2009 provide empirical evidence for a high persistence of house price movements. In addition to conducting parametric and non-parametric tests, we provide technical trading strategies as a robustness check to compare predictability across markets and to test whether or not the detected persistence can also be used for detecting turning points in the market. The empirical findings from the technical trading strategies support the results from the statistical tests. Moving average-based trading strategies perform extremely well in the southern regions, while trading strategies are less profitable for the northern regions and Wales. Thus, from an investors' perspective, there are excess real returns from moving average-based strategies compared to a buy-and-hold strategy for most regional markets. From a household perspective, the findings support the importance of derivative markets where households could hedge their risk exposure from being homeowner.","[Schindler, Felix] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, Dept Int Finance & Financial Management, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany; [Schindler, Felix] SHB, CRES, Berlin, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Schindler, F (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, Dept Int Finance & Financial Management, POB 10 34 43, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",schindler@zew.de,,,,,,,75,8,8,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

For the second group of countries education has the greatest influence on income inequality, but the FDI also contributes to higher income differentiation, while the influence of GDP is negative.","[Vasilescu, Maria Denisa; Cristescu, Amalia; Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,,"Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/AAK-8233-2020; Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/F-8696-2011","Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/0000-0002-0589-4010;",,,,,15,0,0,0,12,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,341,348,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900044,0

Given the huband-spoke routing structure and the consequent affiliation between mainline and regional carriers, we consider not only fuel efficiency of individual mainline airlines, but also the joint efficiency of each mainline and its regional subsidiaries, as well as efficiency in transporting passengers from their origins to destinations. We find that: (1) airline fuel consumption is highly correlated with, and largely explained by, the amount of revenue passenger miles and flight departures it produces; (2) depending on the methodology applied, average airline fuel efficiency for the year 2010 is 9-20% less than that of the most efficient carrier, while the least efficient carriers are 25-42% less efficient than the industry leaders; (3) regional carriers have two opposing effects on fuel efficiency of mainline airlines: higher fuel per revenue passenger mile but improved accessibility provision; (4) the net effect of routing circuity on fuel efficiency is small; (5) potential cost savings from improved efficiency for mainline airlines can reach the magnitude of billion dollars in 2010.

An important question is then to what extent travelers react to these forms of congestion by switching to other travel modes. Using information from a national travel survey from 1996 till 2005, we analyze trips from the home to beach destinations in the Netherlands and examine the influence of weather on the probability of making beach trips by car. We take into account that the distance to the beach affects the decision to travel to the beach as well as the decision to travel by car. Our findings suggest that modal choice of beach travelers is sensitive to weather-induced congestion on roads to the beach. Our results imply that, conditional on making a beach trip, car use decreases by about 15% during higher temperatures inducing a 50% increase in train use. Furthermore, the distance elasticity of demand for beach trips is clearly negative and about -0.40, suggesting that the monetary value of visiting a beach during the summer is in the order of (sic)10-20. Appropriate pricing of parking near beaches is suggested as a solution to reduce congestion and cruising for parking externalities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Focusing on conditionality and labour rights in 11 post-communist CEE candidate countries, in the period between 1998 and 2009, the study analyzes the relationship between the extent of annual monitoring and the post-communist CEE candidate countries' labour rights scores, two years later. A positive, statistically significant association between the two variables is found. The article proposes an explanation of the findings based on discursive institutionalism, and integrates this with the theory of conditionality. According to discursive institutionalism, monitoring supported conditionality through strategic, normative and communicative mechanisms. It strengthened certainty regarding rewards and sanctions, reduced domestic costs of compliance and supported normative convergence.","[Kahn-Nisser, Sara] Open Univ Israel, IL-43107 Raanana, Israel",Open University Israel,"Kahn-Nisser, S (通讯作者)，Open Univ Israel, Dept Sociol Polit Sci & Commun, POB 808, IL-43107 Raanana, Israel.",sarakn@openu.ac.il,,,,,,,80,7,7,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

To identify the causal effect of the penalty points system (PPS) on road safety we use a regression discontinuity design. It emerges that, controlling for weather conditions, police patrols, speed cameras, gasoline price, unemployment rate, the introduction of the PPS has led to a reduction of about 9 % of road accidents and of about 30 % of traffic fatalities. These findings are robust to different specifications of the model and different time windows.

Simultaneously, it developed a supervisory regime that was unprecedentedly complex, producing a Handbook' of intricate secondary legislation that ran to some 8000 pages. Explaining these contradictory aspects of the pre-crisis regime demands a reappraisal of the dominant explanations of the supervisory failures that contributed to the banking crisis. In contrast to accounts that focus on officials' uncritical adherence to efficient market thinking (regulatory groupthink) or the political clout of the financial industry (regulatory capture), this article suggests that supervisory officials' actions can be understood only by reference to their institutional and structural contexts. Amid heightened public sensitivity to risk, officials developed an elaborate and transparent supervisory framework as a defence against potential political censure. At the same time, collegial firm-supervisor relationships were preserved as state-of-the-art risk-management ideas were recombined and repackaged in line with the institutional legacies of earlier club-like' modes of supervision. Together, these divergent tendencies contributed to overconfidence in the use of predictive risk assessment and neglect of banks' fundamental business risks.","Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"McPhilemy, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",s.mcphilemy@warwick.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [1013804] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,78,17,19,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We consider the natural experiment of an individual's final mortgage payment, an anticipated income change, and examine how it affects credit card expenditure. We can identify causality because the dates of final mortgage payments across individuals are uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of consumption.

This type of data allows researchers to look at whether some household outcomes are influenced by decisions made at the extended-family level. This article utilizes data from two waves of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (1997 and 2000) to construct a panel of extended families in order to focus on one particular example of such outcome: whether consumption risk sharing occurs among households within the extended family. The findings show that after controlling for the extended family fixed effects, changes in the household''s own income still matter for changes in its consumption, rejecting full consumption risk insurance. However, the coefficients on household own income are small, indicating significant degrees of risk sharing. Results from a set of reduced-form estimations suggest that household consumption is affected by characteristics of other households in the extended family. This article contributes to the literature on household surveys by shedding light on how one could define a household in a panel analysis that uses data from longitudinal household surveys in which split-off households are tracked.","World Bank, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank,"Witoelar, F (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC USA.",fwitoelar@gmail.com,"Witoelar, Firman/H-4150-2015","Witoelar, Firman/0000-0001-8286-861X",,,,,45,10,15,1,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

This feedback-free design is proposed for the experimental test of the one-shot game situation. We consider both within-subjects and between-subjects variations. In line with the qualitative risk neutral Nash equilibrium prediction, the data show that bids increase in the number of bidders. However, in auctions involving a small number of bidders, average bids are above, and in auctions involving a larger number of bidders, average bids are below the risk neutral equilibrium prediction. The quartile analysis reveals that bidding behavior is not constant across the full value range for a given number of bidders. On the high value quartiles, however, the average bid-value ratio is not different from the risk neutral prediction. The behavior is different when the winning bid is revealed after each repetition.","[Fullbrunn, Sascha] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Econ, NL-6525 GD Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Neugebauer, Tibor] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Sch Finance, L-1240 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Luxembourg,"Neugebauer, T (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Sch Finance, Campus Kirchberg 4,Rue Albert Borschette, L-1240 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",s.fullbrunn@fm.ru.nl; Tibor.NEUGEBAUER@uni.lu,"; Fullbrunn, Sascha/H-5710-2012","Neugebauer, Tibor/0000-0002-1183-7979; Fullbrunn, Sascha/0000-0002-3862-5722",,,,,46,5,6,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2013,75.0,3,,,,,421,447,,10.1007/s11238-013-9378-z,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,203SC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323312400006,0

First, they must be understood in the context of the general de-pacification of relations among principal political actors in Ukraine as well as exacerbation of political and ideological tensions among those actors. Second, the emergence of more violent episodes in the Rada, breaking with a more routine modus operandi of disruptions, has its origin in the earlier, prepolitical careers of certain members of parliament and their propensity to bring into politics particular dispositions (i.e., propensity to use violence) acquired in those previous professional experiences.","Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre & Sci Po, Paris, France",,"Shukan, I (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre & Sci Po, Paris, France.",ioulia.shukan@u-paris10.fr,,"Shukan, Ioulia/0000-0002-9354-9822",,,,,34,6,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Demand systems are characterized by two indirect utility functions which are effectively globally regular and can better approximate nonlinear Engel curves. Furthermore, an exact and nonlinear Euler equation is derived without a log approximation. This equation is estimated jointly with the demand functions by a careful implementation of the orthogonality conditions using generalized method of moments. We illustrate the techniques by estimating the demand system and Euler equation for Australian aggregate data. Results generally indicate that the proposed methods are promising. The estimated rate of time preference is fairly small while the restrictions producing the moment equations are not rejected. Estimated Frisch price elasticities, which are relevant in an intertemporal setting, appear reasonable, and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption is found to be small, which are consistent with the findings in earlier studies.","[Kim, H.

We provide suggestive evidence that human resource constraints played a role in preventing Japanese firms from adapting to the documented shift in IT innovation.","[Arora, Ashish] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Arora, Ashish; Branstetter, Lee G.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Branstetter, Lee G.; Drev, Matej] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Carnegie Mellon University,"Arora, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,"arora, ashish/A-2513-2008; arora, ashish/M-1720-2013","arora, ashish/0000-0001-5097-8646",,,,,69,30,31,1,53,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Recent experiments have shown that decision makers display aversion towards both disagreement among experts and imprecision of information. We provide an axiomatic foundation for a decision criterion that allows one to distinguish on a behavioral basis the decision maker's attitude towards imprecision and disagreement. This criterion accommodates patterns of preferences observed in experiments that are precluded by two-steps procedures, where information is first aggregated, and then used by the decision maker. This might be seen as an argument for having experts transmitting a more detailed information to the decision maker.","[Gajdos, Thibault] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, F-13236 Marseille 02, France; [Gajdos, Thibault] EHESS, F-13236 Marseille 02, France; [Vergnaud, Jean-Christophe] CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Gajdos, T (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille 02, France.",thibault.gajdos@univ-amu.fr; vergnaud@univ-paris1.fr,,"Vergnaud, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-6604-4186; gajdos, thibault/0000-0001-6906-4836",,,,,29,10,12,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2013,41.0,2,,,,,427,452,,10.1007/s00355-012-0691-1,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,155TE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319770300011,0

It develops a new way of measuring the co-location of suppliers and buyers of intermediate goods in a region based on an input-output approach. The resulting indicator is implemented in a shift-share regression in order to analyse the importance of input-output linkages for the employment development in individual industries. One advantage of this approach is that the results can be compared to earlier studies on localization advantages according to Marshall (1890). The results show that the availability of suppliers and customers in the same region was a major engine for job creation in specific industries in the past. In the period 1998 to 2007 this was particularly observed for service sectors, such as Air Transport or Health and Social Work but also for some manufacturing industries as well as for Agriculture and Construction. It becomes apparent from the comparison with earlier findings that agglomeration advantages are not realizable within a single industry. Positive effects rather result from the right composition of different industries that have the possibility to establish common production chains. However, for a lot of industries the intensity of inter-industrial interdependence did not play a significant role for their employment development.","Hamburg WeltWirtschaftsInst HWWI, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany",,"Kowalewski, J (通讯作者)，Hamburg WeltWirtschaftsInst HWWI, Heimhuder Str 71, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",kowalewski@hwwi.org,,,,,,,40,3,3,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We use a sample of Spanish manufacturing SMEs for the period 1991-2002, drawn from the Encuesta sobre Estrategias Empresariales.

Yet, what is notable is the extent to which the dysfunctional micro-economic consequences of financialization at firm level have gone largely unremarked and unchanged. By revisiting and renewing the disconnected capitalism thesis, this article seeks to rectify the omission of a focus on financialization and the workplace and develops a complex and nuanced bigger picture that explores in some detail changes in accumulation, corporate, work and employment domains. The dual objective is thus to understand the dynamics and drivers of such changes and to identify the extent to which financialization has shaped them. In identifying patterns of connection and disconnection across and within domains, a recurrent theme concerns financialization interacting with, accelerating and exacerbating longer term trends such as labour market insecurity, externalization and internationalization.","Univ Strathclyde, Dept HRM, Glasgow G1 1XT, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Thompson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept HRM, Graham Hills Bldg,50 George St, Glasgow G1 1XT, Lanark, Scotland.",p.thompson@strath.ac.uk,,,,,,,88,118,124,1,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We distinguish the servicers' behavior from the borrowers' behavior. A multinomial logit model is applied to analyze the servicers' choice of workout options and a proportional hazard model is applied to analyze the borrower's default decision-making process under time-varying conditions. We find that cash flow condition is the most significant factor in the servicers' decision making process. We also find that borrowers make default decisions based upon both the equity position in the mortgage and the cash flow condition in the space market. Key real estate space market variables, such as market-level vacancy rates, also provide useful information in explaining commercial mortgage defaults. We find that special service seems to be successful in reducing the probability that a troubled loan will default. Finally, sensitivity analysis shows nontrivial economic significance of the impact of explanatory variables, real estate market variables in particular have the most significant impact on the pricing of special-serviced loans.","[Chen, Jun] Moodys Analyt, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Deng, Yongheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore 119613, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Deng, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,04-02, Singapore 119613, Singapore.",jun.chen@moodys.com; ydeng@nus.edu.sg,"Deng, Yongheng/A-4272-2010","Deng, Yongheng/0000-0002-4438-5171",,,,,33,13,14,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The paper uses a methodological approach based on pooling the experiences of various countries over time. It consists of vector autoregressions in the presence of endogenous variables and exogenous shocks (VARX), applied to a panel of cross-country and time series data. The analysis finds heterogeneous effects on a variety of dimensions. First, the effects of natural disasters are stronger on developing than on advanced countries. Second, not all natural disasters are alike in terms of the growth response they induce, and some can even have positive effects on economic growth. Third, severe disasters often carry much worse effects than moderate effects do. Fourth, the timing of the growth response varies with both the type of natural disaster and the sector of economic activity.

Specifically, it extends the volatility feedback model to study the relationship between housing volatility and asset returns during 19632007. The analysis considers two alternative breakpoints, 1984Q1 and 1999Q1, in order to distinguish the permanent structural break from temporary Markov-switching volatility. The novelty of this study lies in its insightful investigations into the recent U.S. housing boom and bust in the post-1999 period in four dimensions. First, the significantly negative volatility feedback effect in the housing market suggests a positive relationship between housing volatility and expected asset returns, and highly supports the important role of people's expectations in the recent housing boom and bust. Second, the high-volatility regimes of the housing market delivered by this study indicate a strong association between housing cycles and business cycles, as well as a remarkable uncertainty in the U.S. housing market after the recession 2001. Third, the violated fundamental which refers to the broken negative relationship between housing volatility and realized asset returns during 2001-2004 implies the possible presence of a housing bubble during this period. Finally, volatility feedback anticipates the recent bubble-like housing market dynamics because high volatility during 2002-2003 implies low realized returns in the early housing-boom stage (2002-2003), as well as high expected returns in the second stage of the housing boom (2004-2005).","Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management Finance, Chungli, Taiwan",Yuan Ze University,"Huang, MC (通讯作者)，Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management Finance, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Chungli, Taiwan.",huamaggie@saturn.yzu.edu.tw,,,,,,,43,20,20,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

However, 25 years of experimental evidence indicates that individuals' behavior often differs from the Nash prediction. This experiment examines provision in the context of asymmetric benefits and asymmetric costs of providing a public good with declining marginal benefits and increasing marginal costs. The design eliminates the coordination problem at the individual level inherent in previous declining marginal benefit experiments. Yet, even with the improved theoretical design, over-contribution persists, suggesting that it is a behavioral phenomenon rather than a design artifact. Analysis of individual contributions indicates that subjects' responses to asymmetry match the theoretical prediction in 3 out of 4 single asymmetry cases. Thus, although over-contribution remains, the theoretical role of asymmetry is confirmed.","[McGinty, Matthew] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Milam, Garrett] Univ Puget Sound, Dept Econ, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"McGinty, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",mmcginty@uwm.edu; gmilam@pugetsound.edu,,,,,,,19,19,22,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2013,40.0,4,,,,,1159,1177,,10.1007/s00355-012-0658-2,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,112DQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316572800011,0

I exploit the fact not only that different tracking policies were practiced simultaneously in Swedish compulsory schools but also that tracking policies changed overtime within schools. I estimate not only if being in a tracked math environment had any effect on the probability of graduating from high school but also if tracking status had any impact on the math grade in high school. The results show that there are no significant average effects of tracking. However, there are effects in the lower part of the grade distribution. Students with a low-educated family background are more likely to fail math at high school if they have attended a compulsory school that practiced tracking compared to similar students in a non-tracked environment.","Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res SOFI, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Sund, K (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res SOFI, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",krister.Sund@sofi.su.se,,,,,,,22,2,3,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper shows that the analogous result is not true in urban economies under appropriate modifications for this field. An open subset of economies where none of the modified rational expectations equilibria fully reveals private information is found. There are two important pieces. First, there can be information about a location known by a consumer who does not live in that location in equilibrium, and thus the equilibrium rent does not reflect this information. Second, if a consumer's utility depends only on information about their (endogenous) location of residence, perturbations of utility naturally do not incorporate information about other locations conditional on the consumer's location of residence. Existence of equilibrium is proved. Space can prevent housing prices from transmitting information from informed to uninformed households, resulting in an inefficient outcome. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Behavior in repeated games, including coordination games, can be explained by theories of learning. This paper considers games in which both theories apply, repeated coordination games with common knowledge labels. The research question asks how players combine the two sources of information-salience and the history of play-when making their choices. We specifically ask whether salience, normally considered as a one-shot strategy, continues to influence players' actions beyond the first round, even while the player might learn from the history of play. We explore two possible mechanisms for such a continuing effect of salience: via an influence on prior beliefs, and/or via a bias, given beliefs. Regression analysis of individual-level choices shows that salience, normally considered only in the context of one-shot games, does exert a lasting effect, with the precise mechanism depending on the details of the game.","Univ Haifa, Grad Sch Management, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Bodoff, D (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Grad Sch Management, Jacobs Bldg,6th Floor, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel.",dbodoff@univ.haifa.ac.il,"bodoff, david/A-3775-2009","bodoff, david/0000-0003-4594-9706",,,,,16,0,0,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2013,74.0,2,,,,,241,266,,10.1007/s11238-012-9325-4,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,072II,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313663200004,0

Importantly, recent international trade literature showed that trading firms are different in terms of workforce, size and productivity. We argue that externalities that determine density premium for firms will be affected by the firms' involvement in trade. Indeed, firms active in international trade may employ a different bundle of resources and be organized differently so that they would appreciate inputs and information in a different fashion and intensity. Using Hungarian manufacturing firm level data from 1992 to 2003 at a 150 micro-region level, we show that the elasticity of agglomeration on productivity is much larger for traders than for non-traders. As firms' trade participation is endogenous to firm performance, we offer various treatment methods of this endogeneity issue. We find that our key results are robust and well above the gap suggested by simple self-selection models. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Based on archival documents, this article examines what could have caused this sudden, reckless shift in policy, and attention is drawn to a hitherto overlooked factor.

This has motivated the introduction of models able to reproduce this stylized fact, like the Fractionally Integrated Autoregressive Conditional Duration Model. In this work we introduce a novel specification able to capture long range dependence. We propose a three component model that consists of an autoregressive daily random effect, a semiparametric time-of-day effect and an intra-daily dynamic component: the Mixed Autoregressive Conditional Duration (Mixed ACD) Model. The random effect component allows for heterogeneity in mean reversal within a day and captures low frequency dynamics in the duration time series. The joint estimation of the model parameters is carried out using MCMC techniques based on the Bayesian formulation of the model. The empirical application to a set of widely traded US tickers shows that the model is able to capture low frequency dependence in duration time series. We also find that the degree of dependence and dispersion of low frequency dynamics is higher in periods of higher financial distress.","[Brownlees, Christian T.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Brownlees, Christian T.] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Vannucci, Marina] Rice Univ, Dept Stat, Houston, TX 77005 USA",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Rice University,"Brownlees, CT (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",christian.brownlees@upf.edu,"Brownlees, Christian T/D-9811-2014; Vannucci, Marina/I-8439-2014","Brownlees, Christian T/0000-0003-4276-1468; Vannucci, Marina/0000-0002-7360-5321",,,,,40,7,8,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Our data cover a period when the housing market is taking a steep downturn. We argue that, when housing prices are falling, seniors are more likely to avoid investing in housing for at least two reasons. First, seniors are relatively more sensitive to their immediate equity loss than younger homeowners, mainly due to the limited remaining lifetime over which they can afford to wait; second, age-restriction acts as a luxury good, with seniors not willing to pay for reduction in neighborhood uncertainty, eliminating buyer demand for this segment of the population. If this larger demand loss outweighs the positive externality of the reduction in neighborhood uncertainty during the market downturn, we would observe that age-restrictions reduce property values. Using data from Broward County, Florida for the years of 2005-2007, we find a significant discount in residential condominium prices due to age-restrictions. In particular, we find that imposing age-restriction on properties decreases housing prices by 17.9% during the period May 2005 to April 2006, while the discount is worse, 22.7%, during the later period May 2006 to May 2007.","[Carter, Charles C.] Haint Blue Realty LLC, Boca Raton, FL 33433 USA; [Lin, Zhenguo] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Finance, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA; [Allen, Marcus T.] Coll Charleston, Carter Real Estate Ctr, Charleston, SC 29401 USA; [Haloupek, William J.] Coll New Jersey, Dept Math & Stat, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton; College of Charleston; College of New Jersey,"Lin, ZG (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Finance, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA.",cccarter2010@yahoo.com; llin@fullerton.edu; allent@cofc.edu; haloupek@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,4,4,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Dynamic formation mechanism of airport competitiveness is studied through Structure Equation Model as well as System Dynamic with the historical data of 25 Chinese airports from 2006 to 2010. Then the influencing mechanism of some important influencing factors is analyzed with the help of Vensim software, which verifies the rationality of the model.

More specifically, the aggregate demand oil price shocks have a significant explanatory power on both current- and forward-looking volatilities. The results are qualitatively similar for the aggregate stock market volatility and the industrial sectors' volatilities. Finally, a robustness exercise using short- and long-run volatility models supports the findings.","[Degiannakis, Stavros] Bank Greece, Econ Res Dept, GR-10250 Athens, Greece; [Filis, George] Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England; [Kizys, Renatas] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Subject Grp Econ & Finance, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England",European Central Bank; Bank of Greece; Bournemouth University; University of Portsmouth,"Filis, G (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England.",gfilis@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Degiannakis, Stavros/AAD-2502-2019; Kizys, Renatas/AAG-1757-2019; Filis, George/HHS-1048-2022; Filis, George/N-5012-2017; Degiannakis, Stavros/AAF-2415-2021","Kizys, Renatas/0000-0001-9104-1809; Filis, George/0000-0002-4912-0973; Degiannakis, Stavros/0000-0003-1931-5494","European Community [FP7-PEOPLE-IEF, PIEF-GA-2009-237022]",European Community,We would like to thank one editor Prof. Lester Hunt and the two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions which helped us to improve the scope and clarity of the paper.

Meanwhile, through exploratory factor analysis, we get three factors of employee satisfaction: the employee's development and growth, the work atmosphere and interpersonal relationship, job evaluation and incentive satisfaction. From the descriptive statistics of various factors of organizational culture, the order from highest to lowest is: rule-oriented, innovation-oriented, support orientation and goal-oriented.

While previous studies focusing mainly on LBW effects on physical growth and cognitive outcomes have found effects of the same size at both school age and young adulthood, others have found a diminishing negative effect over time. The purpose of this paper was to bring new evidence to this issue by analyzing the medium run effects of low birth weight on child behavioral outcomes as well as physical growth at ages 6 months, 3, 7 and 11 years using data from the Danish Longitudinal Survey of Children. Observing the same children at different points in time enabled us to chart the evolution of anthropometric and behavioral deficits among children born with low birth weight and helped understanding the nature and timing of interventions.

This can be obviously useful in multivariate financial time series analysis, e.g. in the multivariate GARCH context. The proposed method consists of two steps. The first one is based on the LDL factorization of the conditional covariance matrix, state space modelling and associated Kalman recursions. Moreover, it is able to deliver a dynamic orthogonal transformation of given stochastic vector data. The second step of the suggested technique analyses conditional covariances of transformed time series which is indeed simplified due to its simultaneously uncorrelated components. In the paper, performance of the introduced procedure is tested in an empirical financial framework. Namely, the daily correlation links between logarithmic returns on stocks and bonds are investigated and compared with other estimated dynamic correlations gained by several common methods, e.g. the moving averages, the diagonal BEKK model or the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) models.","[Hendrych, Radek] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,,hendrych@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Hendrych, Radek/O-8266-2017; Hendrych, Radek/HJH-3526-2023","Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148; Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148",,,,,8,0,0,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,249,254,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000043,0

The attention was than focused on the regulation of the fiscal policy and the agreed instrument was the Stability and Growth Pact (the SGP). States of the EMU have agreed to satisfy the 3% of GDP for the maximum annual public budgets deficit. Based on the evolution of the public debt in member countries we can say that the SGP has failed as a tool of fiscal discipline. In this paper we answer the question whether the failure was given due to incorrect concept of the SGP or whether the development of the debt was affected more by arbitrary disrespect of agreed rules. The two reasons mentioned above are interdependent. To separate them, we construct a dynamic model of EU countries public debt. By using real data we simulate the potential values of public debt in a situation where the SGP rules had been respected in recent years. Comparing the results for the potential debt given by simulation of the model with the current real values we are able to quantify the impact of non-compliance for each country. The initial results indicate that there are both EU states where non-compliance has led to a negligible increase in public debt - up to 5% of GDP, as well as other states where this factor caused the growth of public debt by more than 25% of GDP.","[Horakova, Sarka; Jahoda, Robert] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Brno 62100, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,sarka.horakova@econ.muni.cz; robert.jahoda@econ.muni.cz,"Jahoda, Robert/D-9180-2012",,,,,,13,1,1,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,279,284,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000048,0

All input variables will be time series of dummy variables showing whether the indicator is suggesting taking a long position or not and of course their lags. Explained variable will be the successful trade (the price movement upwards is greater then spread and commissions). For this kind of purposes logistic regression seems to be essential, which is widely used in credit scoring. Basically the problem whether to invest or not is the same issue as whether to give a customer a loan or not. The only difference will be in the type of data.

The classrooms at HIFA can be roughly divided into three kinds: studios, multimedia classrooms and computer labs with reference to ICT. There are three general approaches to the instructional use of the technology at HIFA, namely: learning about computers and the Internet; learning with computers and the Internet and learning through computers and the Internet. The utilization of ICT has shaped the art education model of HIFA considerably and has brought about a lot of changes and benefits to the faculty and students.

In this context, cost-based re-dispatching of power plants and technical flexibility through topology optimization are considered as market-based and technical congestion management methods. To replicate the current market regime in Germany a two-step procedure is chosen consisting of a transactional spot market model and a congestion management model. This uniform pricing model is compared to a nodal pricing regime. The results show that currently congestion can mainly be managed by re-dispatching power plants and optimizing the network topology. However, congestion management costs tend to increase significantly in future years if the developments of transmission as well as generation infrastructure diverge. It is concluded that there is a need for improving the current congestion management regime to achieve an efficient long-term development of the German electricity system.","Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business Management & Econ, Chair Energy Econ, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Kunz, F (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business Management & Econ, Chair Energy Econ, Munchner Pl 3, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",friedrich.kunz@tu-dresden.de,,,RWE fellowship program (RWE Studienforderung),RWE fellowship program (RWE Studienforderung),"Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the Young Energy Economists and Engineers Seminar (YEEES) in Dresden 2011 and the IDEI conference The Economics of Energy Markets Toulouse 2011.

Educational conditions in the Republic of Croatia are not homogenized. The current changes will impact the equalization of educational conditions. By the conducted research, using scientific methods (analysis and synthesis, inductive and deductive method, descriptive, mathematical methods), we have analyzed the impact of education on the efficiency of the education system in the case of primary education of Brod Posavina County. In the society of knowledge the approach to the possibilities of acquiring necessary knowledge, skills and competence is essential for the social progress and economical growth of a country. Additional investments in acquiring new acquisitions through education presents the benefit for the individual as well as for the national economy. The education as an activity is at the same time the starter of the development of countries and societies. This applies to the field in which the changes in science and society must be firstly recognised. The education changes its environment but the education itself is subjected to constant changes. The education of every country and Croatia as well, is influenced by low birth-rate resulting in decreased number of students. This can be exemplified i the case of Brodsko-Posavska county region. In the school year 20012/2013 the number of registered children was less for 400 than the previous year. The consequence of this will be closing more and more schools especially in rural areas. It is knowen that the communities without educational institutions cannot prosper conserning the quality of living. Young people are encouraged to leave the areas where the schools are being closed. The surplus of teaching staff is evident in the employment offices. The low birth-rate has been noticed resulting in smaller number of registered children in the elementary schools. There is a surplus of teachers of great number of subjects especially in lower classes of elementary schools on the labour market. On the one hand there is longer and thorough education of teachers and on the other hand there are not enough job opportunities-In developed countries such situation presents the possibility of the quality of education. However, in Croatia the finance for education are being decreased in the recent years due to the smaller number of stutents. The Ministry of science, education and sport introduced the project building of schools a few years ago, so that all schools in Croatia could function in only one shift, what is in fact quite real and possible, but taking into considration the exsisting demografic trands it will be not necessary to build up new school buildings or construct annexes because the number of students has been decreased. The exsisting schoools are spacious enough to function in one shift. We have done the research in elementary schools (33) of Brodsko-Posavske county in order to find out if it is possible, in the conditions of exsisting changes, to increase the quality of education. There are 1810 employees in elementary schools of Brodsko-Posavska county and 14.752 students distributed in 771 forms. Data analysis has been done in the equalization of educational conditions giving us the results pointing the increase of efficiency of exsisting educational system, the improvement of pedagogical standard and better motivation for teachers, what is important for a successful educational system.","[Vukasinovic, Anica] Posavina Brod Cty, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",,,anica.vukasinovic@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,357,365,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400041,0

Compared with the traditional education, the multimedia teaching owns many significant advantages, and multimedia can be used for comprehensively expressing texts, pictures, audio, animation and so on, so that the teaching contents can be shown from multiple aspects and angles. The traditional physical education relies mainly on the outdoor sports activities, but it is necessary to promote learning physical education classes at present along with the development of science and technology. Therefore, physical education should not only rely on the outdoor sports activities, and also should own a solid theoretical foundation. In this aspect, the multimedia technology has a good auxiliary function and plays the practicability of multimedia.","[Wang, Hongchun] Southwest Guizhou Vocat & Tech Coll Nationalities, Guizhou 562400, Peoples R China",,,,,,,,,,3,1,1,0,4,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,18.0,,,,,,254,258,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BA4DZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335479600052,0

ZIP model gives the possibility to analyze the influence regressors on the location of the conditional distribution of claim counts. The additional information how the risk factors affects the entire shape of distribution gives the estimation of quantiles of the claim counts distribution.

This however leads to overrepresentation of the categories which are in general observed more often and hence can lead to biased results in many tasks especially in the case of presence of dominant categories. We present original methodology of imputation of missing values which results in the most likely structure (distribution) of the missing data conditional on the observed values. The methodology is based on the assumption that the categorical variable containing the missing values has multinomial distribution.

We link the variation in estimated MTE scores to differences in the following factors: the frontier methodology used, which essentially are the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA); regions where seaports are situated; type of data used; number of observations; and the total number of variables used. Furthermore, we compare fixed-effects against a random-effects regression model where the latter assumes that the individual study specific characteristics matter while the former assumes that there is one general tendency across all studies. We present several findings based on the data: (1) the random-effects model outperforms the fixed effects model in explaining the variations in MTEs, (2) recently published studies have lower MTE scores as compared with earlier published studies, (3) studies that used nonparametric DEA models depict higher MTE scores as compared with those that used SFA models, (4) panel data studies have lower TE scores as compared with cross-sectional data, and (5) studies using European seaport data produce lower MTE scores when compared with the rest of the world. Finally, our results contradict some previous meta-analysis studies of TE scores. We encourage the use of random-effects models in meta-analysis studies because they account for individual study specific effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in practice, tolls are uniform over the day, or at most have just a few steps. Such uniform and step tolls have received surprisingly little attention from the literature. Moreover, most models that do study them assume that demand is insensitive to the price. This seems an empirically questionable assumption that, as this paper finds, strongly affects the implications of step tolling for the consumer. In the bottleneck model, first-best tolling has no effect on the generalised price, and thus consumer surplus remains the same as without tolling. Conversely, under price-sensitive demand, step tolling increases the price, making the consumer worse off. The more steps the toll has, the closer it approximates the first-best toll, thereby increasing the welfare gain and making consumers better off. This indicates the importance for real-world tolls to have as many steps as possible: this not only raises welfare, but may also increase the political acceptability of the scheme by making consumers better off.

Any given probability of exceeding a targeted maximum temperature rise implies a maximum limit on the cumulative total of CO2 that can be emitted: a CO2 budget. This paper describes an approach to modelling cumulative emissions from light and heavy duty road transport from the present to 2050, focussing on the USA and Europe, and comparing the potential impacts of a range of technological and behaviourally-based abatement measures with such cumulative emissions budgets. The model shows that abatement measures would have a lower effect on cumulative emissions from 2000 to 2050 than on annual emissions in 2050, so that focussing only on annual emissions could be misleading. It shows that technological developments would be insufficient on their own to enable Europe and the USA to meet CO2 budgets for road transport. Behavioural changes, which potentially can be implemented much sooner, would be essential too. There is potential to keep European light duty emissions very close to CO2 budgets, and US light duty emissions not far above the least restrictive budget, but the model predicts that heavy duty emissions in both regions are likely to exceed their CO2 budgets. Deeper emissions reductions in other regions and sectors will be needed to compensate for this. Timing would be critical: for the greatest impact, behaviour change policies and interventions would need to be applied early and deeply. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We require that two allocations can be ranked with the knowledge only of agents present, their aggregate bundles, and community indifference sets-a condition we refer to as aggregate independence. We also postulate a basic Pareto and continuity property, and a property stating that when two disjoint economies and allocations are put together, the ranking in the large economy should be consistent with the rankings in the two smaller economies (reinforcement). We show that a ranking method satisfies these axioms if and only if there is a probability measure over the strictly positive prices for which the rule ranks allocations on the basis of the random-price money-metric utilitarian rule. This is a rule which computes the money-metric utility for each agent at each price, sums these, and then takes an expectation according to the probability measure.","[Chambers, Christopher P.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Hayashi, Takashi] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Chambers, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",cpchambers@ucsd.edu; th925@eco.utexas.edu,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2012,39.0,4,,,,,809,831,,10.1007/s00355-011-0554-1,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,015VE,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309473700006,0

Based on a case study involving two Probation Service Areas and interviews with national and local trade union officers, insights are gained into changes for probation work and the workforce that perform it. The findings illustrate how reforms of probation practice, implemented locally through performance management, have led to probation work becoming increasingly 'Taylorized' with implications for the division of labour based on labour substitution, deskilling and degradation. As the Probation Service was entering a new political era under the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition, these findings provide insights into its trajectory under previous governments.

The model predicts that the relationship between remittances and migrants' education is ambiguous and depends on the immigration policy conducted at destination. The effect of education is more likely to be positive when the immigration policy is more restrictive and less skill-selective. These predictions are then tested empirically using bilateral remittance and migration data and proxy measures for the restrictiveness and selectivity of immigration policies at destination.

This study applies the contingent valuation method to assess the economic values of services provided by forested trails newly opened for recreational purposes. The objective is to evaluate the benefits received by the two main user groups: local residents and visitors to the three trails in I-Lan County, Taiwan. In Taiwan, the demand for outdoor recreation is increasing and trails in marginal forest areas have to deal with the conflicting needs for recreation and conservation. The monetary valuation results show that the three forested trails have significant values for both visitors and residents and that to 'develop ecotourism for the purposes of trail use and conservation will benefit both groups. However, local residents value the trails more than visitors clue to their higher reliance on them and their interactions with them: the residents have long lived in the local villages and have relied on their surroundings to earn their living. The visitors, by contrast, visit the trails only occasionally. The authors conclude that the sustainable development of ecotourism can maintain the values generated from the trails and deal successfully with the conflict of needs between recreational exploitation and conservation.","[Chen, Wan-Jiun] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Law, Shyue-Cherng] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University; National Taiwan Normal University,"Chen, WJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, 55 Hwa Kung Rd,111 Yang Ming Shan, Taipei, Taiwan.",cwj@faculty.pccu.edu.tw,"Liaw, Shyue-Cherng/O-4370-2019","Liaw, Shyue-Cherng/0000-0001-8337-5390",,,,,13,14,14,2,107,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

After controlling for the earnings announcement, we examine the relation between conference call tone and the contemporaneous stock price reaction. We find that the tone of the conference call dialogue has significant explanatory power for the abnormal returns at and immediately following quarterly earnings announcements. The question and answer portion of the conference calls dominates prepared managerial introductory remarks in explanatory significance. Furthermore, an overall positive tone in the conference call discussion between management and analysts is found to nearly offset the damaging effects of a negative earnings surprise.","[Price, S.

The SPSCM is derived from a nonparametric specification of the production technology represented by an input distance function (IDF), using a growth formulation. The functional coefficients of the SPSCM come naturally from the model and are fully flexible in the sense that no functional form of the underlying production technology is used to derive them. Another advantage of the SPSCM is that it can estimate bias (input and scale) in technical change in a fully flexible manner. We also used a translog IDF framework to estimate TFP growth components. A panel of U.S. electricity generating plants for the period 1986-1998 is used for this purpose. Comparing estimated TFP growth results from both parametric and semiparametric models against the Divisia TFP growth, we conclude that the SPSCM performs the best in tracking the temporal behavior of TFP growth.","[Kumbhakar, Subal C.; Sun, Kai] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Kumbhakar, SC (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",kkar@binghamton.edu; ksun1@binghamton.edu,"Sun, Kai/AAX-1669-2020","Sun, Kai/0000-0002-5245-0439",,,,,30,18,19,0,22,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Long-run effects between bivariate integrated series are represented as the spectral density matrix of their first-differences evaluated at the zero frequency. The long-run neutrality, the core issue in this work, reduces to zero power of the cross spectral density function near the origin. We propose a statistic based on a kernel-based cross spectral density estimator. As designed to be consistent against cross correlations of unknown forms, the test differentiates it from tests based on parametric regression models. In implementing the tests, some feasible bandwidth selection procedures are detailed in terms of mean squared error criteria and of type I and type II errors criteria. Our testing procedures can be a complementary approach for neutrality testing. Simulation studies are shown to support theoretical results. Our methods are applied to testing long-run neutrality in the US nominal money and real output quarterly data from the first quarter of 1959 to the third quarter of 2009. Our tests unanimously reject the long-run neutrality for M2 regardless of the choice of bandwidths and of kernels.","Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120750, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",leejin@ewha.ac.kr,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

We find a long-run elasticity of gasoline demand (with congestion endogenous) of -0.081, keeping constant car prices and the TFI (technological fuel intensity) of car types but allowing consumers to choose from car types. 43% of this long run elasticity is from switching to transit: 15% from trip, car-type and location choice; 38% from price, wage and rent equilibration, and 4% from building stock changes. 79% of the long run elasticity is from changes in car-VMT (the extensive margin) and 21% from savings in gasoline per mile (the intensive margin); with 83% of this intensive margin from changes in congestion and 17% from the substitution in favor of lower TFI. An exogenous trend-line improvement of the TFI of the car-types available for choice raises the long-run response to a percent increase in the gas price from -0.081 to -0.251. Thus, only 1/3 of the long-run response to the gas price stems from consumer choices and 2/3 from progress in fuel intensity. From 2000 to 2007, real gas prices rose 53.7%, the average car fuel intensity improved 2.7% and car prices fell 20%. The model predicts that from these changes alone, keeping constant population, income, etc. aggregate gasoline use in this period would have fallen by 5.2%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A growing body of literature has emerged on the issue of rail marginal infrastructure wear and tear costs, but the majority of the work is focused on costs for infrastructure maintenance. Railway track renewals are a substantial part of an infrastructure manager's budget, but in disaggregated statistical analyses they cause problems for traditional regression models since there is a piling up of values of the dependent variable at zero. Previous econometric work has sought to circumvent the problem by aggregation in some way. In this paper we instead apply corner solution models to disaggregate (track-section) data, including the zero observations. We derive track renewal cost elasticities with respect to traffic volumes and in turn marginal renewal costs using Swedish railway renewal data over the period 1999-2009. This paper is the first attempt in the literature to apply corner solution models, and in particular the two-part model, to disaggregate renewal cost data in railways. It is also the first paper that we are aware of to report usage elasticities specifically for renewal costs and therefore adds important new evidence to the previous literature where there is a paucity of studies on renewals and considerable uncertainty over the effects of rail traffic on renewal costs. In the Swedish context, we find that the inclusion of marginal track renewal costs in the track access pricing regime, which currently only reflects marginal maintenance costs, would add substantially to the existing track access charge. EU legislation requires that access charges reflect the 'costs directly incurred as a result of operating the train service', which should include a marginal renewal cost component. This change would also increase the cost recovery ratio of the Swedish infrastructure manager, thus meeting a policy objective of the national government. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Conditional on amenities and housing attributes, in the bombed area (where fewer restrictions apply) house prices are about 10% higher.

By 1880, Union veterans were more likely to migrate to a different state or region than nonveterans. The higher geographic mobility of veterans is likely attributable to their experience of traveling away from their hometowns while in service. Union veterans who held unskilled jobs prior to enlistment were more likely to move up to white-collar or farming jobs by 1880 than unskilled nonveterans. In contrast, unskilled veterans were less likely to become artisans than nonveterans. The differences in occupational mobility by veteran status might be explained by the effects of military experiences such as learning from comrades in the company. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Historians have typically attributed this to myopia, the failure to understand the long-term threat represented by the Company. We examine the negotiations leading up to a key conflict, the Third Mysore War, and find that the Company's allies were not myopic. The British parliament had, in 1784, passed Pitt's India Act, which limited the scope for unprovoked military aggression by the Company in India. This had changed the behavior of the Company, making its promises more credible.

Until recently, the lack of temporally and spatially-consistently interpreted data on urban extent for U.S. metropolitan areas has limited the ability to estimate panel models of land use change. This paper first describes the creation of a consistent data set on urbanized land area for all U.S. metropolitan areas. It then estimates cross-sectional models of the determinants of urban spatial extent. For purposes of comparison, results are compared to temporally-consistent satellite-derived measures of developed land area from the National Land Cover Database. The paper then presents panel-model estimates of changes in urban land area, finding that both population and income elasticities are substantially less than unity. Tests for the structural stability of urbanized land area determinants across metropolitan size categories and polycentric regions are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The performance of the resulting blocking and regularization ('RnB') estimator is analyzed in an extensive simulation study mimicking the liquidity and market microstructure features of the S&P 1500 universe. The RnB estimator yields efficiency gains for varying liquidity settings, noise-to-signal ratios and dimensions.

Though the matching approach is similar to a repeat sales estimator in pairing each sale with the sale of a comparable property, sample sizes are much larger because the matched properties are not constrained to be identical in each period. An advantage of the matching procedure is that it makes it easy to characterize changes in the full distribution of quality-adjusted sales prices, rather than just the means. We find that the distribution of sales prices shifted much farther to the right at high prices than at lower prices for 1995-2010, and this pattern is particularly evident in the boom periods of 1996 and 2005-2007. The variance of the sale price distribution increased significantly during boom periods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In professional team sports, the competition of the clubs functions as a platform that enables sponsors to interact with fans. In these club-mediated interactions, positive network effects operate from the fan market to the sponsor market, while positive or negative network effects operate from the sponsor market to the fan market. We show that the size of these network effects determines the level of competitive balance within the league. If the market potential of the sponsors is small (large), competitive balance increases (decreases) with stronger combined network effects. We further deduce that clubs benefit from stronger combined network effects through higher profits and that network externalities can mitigate the negative effect of revenue sharing on competitive balance. Finally, we derive implications for improving competitive balance by taking advantage of network externalities. For example, our model suggests that an increase in the market potential of sponsors produces a more balanced league.","[Dietl, Helmut; Duschl, Tobias; Franck, Egon; Lang, Markus] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Dietl, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Plattenstr 14, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",helmut.dietl@business.uzh.ch; tobias.duschl@business.uzh.ch; egon.franck@business.uzh.ch; markus.lang@business.uzh.ch,"Lang, Markus/AAD-2995-2019","Lang, Markus/0000-0002-6837-790X",,,,,64,7,8,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This paper makes a moral argument for what would be a fair distribution of these benefits. The argument follows Walzer's Spheres of Justice approach to define the benefits of transportation, access, as a sphere deserving a separate, non-market driven, distribution. That distribution, we propose, is one where the maximum gap between the lowest and highest accessibility, both by mode and in space, should be limited, while attempting to maximize average access. We then review transportation planning practice for a priori distributional goals and find little explicit guidance in conventional and even justice-oriented transportation planning and analyses.

In most OECD countries, governments remunerate hospitals according to the activity performed. Activity is usually measured through a diagnosis related groups (DRGs) system. This study estimates the degree of cost sharing of the NordDRG classification system (the DRG version of the Nordic countries) in Iceland during 2003-2005. We first apply ordinary least square (OLS) methods to estimate the degree of cost sharing by regressing the price for each individual patient against its cost. Second, we propose an instrumental-variable approach to address the potential endogeneity of costs. The OLS estimates suggest that the degree of cost sharing is in the range 0.16-0.17 (i.e. 1$ increase in cost is associated with an increase in reimbursement by 0.16-0.17$). The instrumental-variable approach provides some evidence of endogeneity, and suggests that cost sharing is overestimated by OLS. The instrumented estimates of cost sharing are 0.11, 0.13 and 0.14 in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Regardless of the method applied, most cost sharing is associated with the retrospective features of the classification system (such as the type of treatment provided).","[Siciliani, Luigi] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Siciliani, Luigi] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Hafsteinsdottir, Elin J.

The bilateral relationships specified by a directed graph may reflect the outcomes of a sport competition, the mutual reference structure between websites, or a group preference structure over alternatives. We introduce a class of scoring methods for directed graphs, indexed by a single nonnegative parameter alpha. This parameter reflects the internal slackening of a node within an underlying iterative process. The class of so-called internal slackening scoring methods, denoted by lambda (alpha) , consists of the limits of these processes. It is seen that lambda(0) extends the invariant scoring method, while lambda (a) extends the fair bets scoring method. Method lambda(1) corresponds with the existing lambda-scoring method of Borm et al. (Ann Oper Res 109(1):61-75, 2002) and can be seen as a compromise between lambda(0) and lambda (a) . In particular, an explicit proportionality relation between lambda (alpha) and lambda(1) is derived. Moreover, the internal slackening scoring methods are applied to the setting of social choice situations where they give rise to a class of social choice correspondences that refine both the Top cycle correspondence and the Uncovered set correspondence.","[Slikker, Marco] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Ind Engn, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Borm, Peter] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & OR, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van den Brink, Rene] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van den Brink, Rene] Tinbergen Inst, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Borm, Peter] Tilburg Univ, Ctr Econometr & OR, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; Tilburg University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Tilburg University,"Slikker, M (通讯作者)，Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Ind Engn, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",M.Slikker@tue.nl,"Slikker, Marco/Q-6056-2019","Slikker, Marco/0000-0003-4705-1588; Borm, Peter/0000-0002-2710-1827; van den Brink, Rene/0000-0001-8570-3706",,,,,13,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2012,72.0,4,,,,,445,462,,10.1007/s11238-011-9281-4,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,892LK,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300287500002,0

Overuse by tenants and poor maintenance by landlords, however may lead to longer term or legacy effects on value and liquidity. We use a 20 year data series on house transactions to estimate these separate effects in a simultaneous model of price and liquidity. The results reveal strong transitory renter effects on both value and liquidity consistent with lower buyer willingness-to-pay. We do not find persistent legacy effects from prior use as rental property.

The model covers most of actual real-world dichotomus rules, where quorums are often required, and some of the extensions considered in the literature.

Therefore, recent studies have investigated the growth effects of remittances but reached different conclusions. In these studies, the rate of growth of output is simply regressed on both remittances and the channels through which remittances affect growth. Thus, no distinction has been made between the indirect and direct growth effects of remittances. Such regressions may give unreliable estimates because the channels may also capture some growth effects of remittances, making the growth effects of remittances insignificant. In this study, we make a distinction between the indirect and direct growth effects of remittances. Our model is estimated with panel data of 40 high remittance recipient countries with the system generalized method of moment. We found that remittances have no direct growth effects but they have small indirect growth effects.","[Rao, B.

We classify the spot market volatility into two states: high and low and use the Markov chain theory to construct a Two-State volatility model for pricing and hedging Taiwan stock index options (TXO). Compared to binomial option pricing model, the Two-State model is more stable in convergence and faster in early periods of convergence but is much more time-consuming as the number of periods and computations extensively increase. The growth order of total node number for quadrinomial lattice is O(n(4)) while it is O(n(2)) for binomial lattice. Empirically, the Taiwan stock index has high-volatility = 42.85%, low-volatility = 17.39%, and probability of being in high-volatility state = 0.3487 over the in-sample period from 1/6/1990 to 04/30/2008 according to Markov chain. Using as large as 87,160 datasets of TXO covering out-of-sample period from 05/02/2008 to 03/17/2010 and strike prices from 3600 to 8700, we demonstrated that the Two-State volatility model has the most outstanding performance in high-volatility period as applying put options for pricing and hedging. However, to avoid the cost of taxes resulting from position changes, a longer-term (e.g. 10 day) hedge is more properly than a short-term (e.g. 5 day) hedge.","[Su, En-Der; Lin, Feng-Jeng] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Su, ED (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",suender@ccms.nkfust.edu.tw,"Su, EnDer/AAD-9141-2019",,,,,,46,1,1,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Farmers of urban areas are handicapped in friendly environmental conditions and inputs supply for cultivation of fresh vegetables. The prominent hurdle in farming practices is non-availability of fresh water and other inputs supply for urban farmers around cities. A study was conducted in urban areas of District Sargodha-Pakistan to estimate the threat to food crops cultivating through untreated waste water. The purpose of the study was to check the knowledge level, perceptions, and role of extension advisory services to the farmers those are involved in this business. The demographic data revealed that average age of the farmers was 45 years with average education level of grade 5. The average area under waste water producing vegetables is about 3.93 acres. On average, approximately for the last 15 years farmers are involved in farming under untreated waste water. The results from regression analysis show that knowledge level of the farmers and extension advisory/training services play significant role in changing the perceptions of the farmers regarding the use of untreated waste water for food crops and vegetables in the area. The regression analysis explained more than 98% variance in the dependent variable of perceptions. It is concluded that their perceptions could be changed by increasing their knowledge and intervention of extension advisory services. Farmers should give training and regular advisory services for use of waste water so that it will not become threat to the food safety. They should provide all required agricultural inputs on subsidized rates. Arrangement should be made for regular supply of fresh water.","[Ashraf, Ejaz; Luqman, Muhammad; Samiullah; Younis, Muhammad] Univ Sargodha, Univ Coll Agr, Sargodha, Pakistan; [Shah, Fawad] Washington State Dept Agr, Olympia, WA 98504 USA",University of Sargodha; Bahauddin Zakariya University,"Ashraf, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sargodha, Univ Coll Agr, Sargodha, Pakistan.",,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,1,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,25,+,,,,,,3,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600003,0

Drawing, instead, on Critical Theory as a tradition of social philosophy, I advance a proposal for assessment of the types of welfare capitalism conducted as 'immanent critique' of the key structural dynamics of contemporary capitalism. Normative criteria thus emerge within a diachronic dimension of social transformation, which in turn grounds the comparison among synchronic types of capitalism. This ultimately enables a research agenda for the operationalisation of a normative analysis of capitalism within which social justice is gauged by the degree of voluntary employment flexibility - a key factor in the distribution of life-chances in the early twenty-first century.","Univ Kent, Brussels Sch Int Studies, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",,"Azmanova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Brussels Sch Int Studies, 5 Bl Plaine, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",a.azmanova@kent.ac.uk,"Azmanova, Albena/JJC-1239-2023","Azmanova, Albena/0000-0002-2471-2016",,,,,48,10,11,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

So, a key quantitative research based on 120 self-administrated on-line questionnaires from Czech and UK higher education students will be presented where one university from each country was chosen as a representative sample.

In order to achieve the objective of this research, various econometric analyses such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Granger Causality test, Cointegration and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) were implemented on the time series data. The ADF unit root test showed that all variables were stationary at first difference. From the Johansen Cointegration Analysis, it was found that long-term relationships existed between gross domestic product, foreign direct investment, government expenditure and money supply. The Granger Causality test was also conducted to investigate short-term relationships and ascertain the direction of causality between the variables. The results suggested that there was a unidirectional Granger causality. The finding showed that gross domestic product can affect money supply in the short-run. Based on the Ordinary Least Square, significant relationships between money supply and foreign direct investment with the economic growth were found, but government expenditure has been considered as an insignificant variable. The study concluded that money supply and foreign direct investment play important roles as determinants of the economic growth in Malaysia.","[bin Hamzah, Khairul Hazwan; Hassan, Nik Suriati binti Nik; Huey, Aw Yang] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,887,894,,,,,,8,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600077,0

These include natural as well as anthropogenic factors, including air, water and soil pollution, arable land erosion, disposal of solid wastes, etc., that may ultimately contribute to reduction of food quality and agricultural production decline. Foodstuff security is together with energy stability and natural (biodiversity and landscape) protection and preservation one of the most topical and global environmental and economic themes. This paper discusses some of the issues on the natural resource management and the economy-related security on the example of the present national food-production strategy of the Czech Republic. The study illustrates a closed dependence of particular environmental, social and economic system segments. Environmental risk assessments of potential natural and anthropogenic accidents (including climate-triggered events, such as drainage floods, landslides, drought seasons with forest fires, as well as industrial pollutions and agricultural soil contaminations) thus play the key role in the short- and long-term evaluation of the food security status of the country. Effective plans and programs should be aimed to monitor, prevent and mitigate these risks that might potentially develop into full-scale ecological, food- and health-risk situations. Recognition of the main environmental (natural and industrial) hazards for the national food production security in frame of sustainable development belongs to the principal action priorities of the state's institutions and the central government.","[Chlachula, Jiri] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Dept Environm Secur, Zlin 76201, Czech Republic; [Chlachula, Jiri] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Geoecol & Geoinformat, P-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Sefcik, Vladimir; Lukaskova, Eva] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Dept Crisis Management, Zlin 76201, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Adam Mickiewicz University; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Chlachula, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Dept Environm Secur, Zlin 76201, Czech Republic.",chlachula@flkr.utb.cz; sefcik@flkr.utb.cz; lukaskova@flkr.utb.cz,,,,,,,10,1,1,1,14,HONG KONG EDUCATION SOC,TSEUNG KWAN O,"FLAT 16E BLOCK 3 THE PINNACLE, 8 WANG HANG RD, TSEUNG KWAN O, NEW TERRITORIES 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-988-19750-3-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,32,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BET96,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318122400005,0

The paper uses annual data to investigate the palm oil import demand in selected European countries, namely, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom; jointly, accounting for more than 70% of the biodiesel production in EU27. Six single equation models are specified to represent palm oil import demand functions in those countries. The models have been estimated using the augmented autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique. The findings of the study reveal that rapeseed and sunflower oils are the main substitutes for the palm oil in Europe. The palm oil price came out to be a major determinant of palm oil demand across the six models. It is also found that the industrial production index is an important factor affecting the demand in the all studied countries. The palm oil import demand in Austria, UK, and Germany is significantly, influenced by the start of the commercial production of biodiesel whilst the demand in France, and Spain was boosted by the introduction of the EU's directive on the promotion of the use of bio-fuels for transport. However, neither of them produced a significant impact on the demand in Italy that is significantly affected by the development in technology represented by an upward trend.","[Hameed, Amna Awad Abdel; Arshad, Fatimah Mohamed] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Food & Agr Policy Studies, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,157,166,,,,,,10,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600015,0

As outcomes we consider regular employment, other employment, and having dropped out of the registered labour market. By applying a matching approach that takes the timing of treatment into account, we identify the ex post effect of UI sanctions. According to our results, sanctions are effective in increasing the probability of regular employment for young sanctioned UI benefit recipients. Older women on average respond to a sanction by taking up jobs of lower quality.

Louis Bachelier is doubtless the best known French mathematician in the history of modern finance theory. While recent studies have given us a fairly complete picture of the man himself, his work and the results he arrived at, knowledge of his contribution to the development of ideas remains imprecise. Although the direct influence of his work is analysed on occasion, no study has assessed the dissemination of Bachelier's work, and hence its impact on all scientific disciplines. This is precisely the purpose of this article: to examine the dissemination of Bachelier's work in order to better assess his impact on the development of financial economics (Jovanovic (2010) makes a similar analysis of the dissemination of Bachelier's work in mathematics). Based on a bibliometric analysis of Bachelier's work, this study aims at shedding light on his influence and explaining how the idea of his 'rediscovery' in the 1950s gained credence. This article demonstrates that, contrary to the widely accepted view, Bachelier's work has never been forgotten; it also shows that the discovery of Bachelier's work by economists has had no significant influence on the development of financial economics.","CIRST UQAM, Montreal, PQ H2X 3P2, Canada",,"Jovanovic, F (通讯作者)，CIRST UQAM, 100 Sherbrooke W, Montreal, PQ H2X 3P2, Canada.",jovanovic.franck@teluq.uqam.ca,"jovanovic, franck/B-1016-2019",,,,,,92,14,15,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

J,"Kraay, A",,,,"Kraay, Aart",,,Instrumental variables regressions with uncertain exclusion restrictions: a Bayesian approach,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WEAK INSTRUMENTS; CAUSE GROWTH,"The identification of structural parameters in the linear instrumental variables (IV) model is typically achieved by imposing the prior identifying assumption that the error term in the structural equation of interest is orthogonal to the instruments. Since this exclusion restriction is fundamentally untestable, there are often legitimate doubts about the extent to which the exclusion restriction holds. In this paper I illustrate the effects of such prior uncertainty about the validity of the exclusion restriction on inferences based on linear IV models. Using a Bayesian approach, I provide a mapping from prior uncertainty about the exclusion restriction into increased uncertainty about parameters of interest. Moderate prior uncertainty about exclusion restrictions can lead to a substantial loss of precision in estimates of structural parameters. This loss of precision is relatively more important in situations where IV estimates appear to be more precise, for example in larger samples or with stronger instruments. I illustrate these points using several prominent recent empirical papers that use linear IV models. An accompanying electronic table allows users to readily explore the robustness of inferences to uncertainty about the exclusion restriction in their particular applications.

Enterprise Architecture implementation under a Business Process Management approach may be a useful way of looking into good practices to achieve and sustain business-IT alignment.

Supported on reflective one-on-one dialogues between researcher and practitioner, dialogical action research acknowledges the important role and contributions of the latter for enterprise architecture implementation when compared with the modest contributions from academia. Emerging from many years of practice, a particular praxis is under examination in this work particularly regarding the development of an organizational competences model considered as an important piece for enterprise architecture implementation. Such model fosters the discussion of the business strategy while making clear the interrelations among competences and more explicit the business model.

The aim of the paper is to analyse a degree of efficiency achieved in individual countries which is perceived as a reflection of the level of competitive potential in the reference years 2000 and 2010. The theoretical part of the paper is devoted to the fundamental bases of competitiveness and the methodology of factor analysis and DEA method. The empirical part is aimed at measuring the effectiveness of selected countries by selected DEA models. When applying factor analysis and DEA method, we used indicators, which are part of the Country Competitiveness Index (CCI) created by World Economic Forum (WEF) and EU. Indicators included in CCI are interrelated, therefore we use factor analysis for assessment of internal relations between indicators and for reduction of their high number to a smaller number of variables, but at a minimum loss of information contained in the original variables. Factor analysis allows to use a structure of common factors of all variables and create factors including the most important and convenient indicators for national efficiency evaluation. Results of factor analysis are used for calculations of selected DEA models - basic CCR and BCC models and additive SDM, FDH and FRH models. The DEA method evaluates the efficiency how countries are able to transform their inputs into outputs. Therefore, efficiency of countries can be considered as a 'mirror' of national competitiveness. The final part of the paper offers a comprehensive comparison of results obtained by using of all calculated DEA models.","[Melecky, Lukas; Stanickova, Michaela] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,lukas.melecky@vsb.cz; michaela.stanickova@vsb.cz,"Stanickova, Michaela/ABE-6334-2020; Melecky, Lukas/A-8078-2015; Melecky, Lukas/AAY-7847-2021","Stanickova, Michaela/0000-0001-6210-2377; Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400; Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400",,,,,11,16,16,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,575,580,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900099,0

Selected farmers in the study area form part of the primary data collected using a pre-tested questionnaire which contains demographic, farm specific and household food security information. A probability sampling method (that is pure or simple random sampling technique) was used to select the respondents. The total population of small-scale irrigators in Vhembe District are 3,236 and among this, 190 farmers were randomly selected. A logistic regression model was used to analyse the variables in the model, selected from factors identified by previous researchers that affect food security in rural areas. A comparison of the variables in the model was carried out among the irrigation farmers. The results obtained showed that the irrigation farming contributes in no small measure to the proportion of food secured households in the study area. Per capita aggregate production and irrigation were found from the analysis to have a positive influence on the probability of households being food secure. There are various indicators responsible for farmers on irrigation projects who are more food secure in the study area. The study also reveals that household food insecurity extends into other spheres such as those of marketing and distribution as well as pricing and affordability. With concerted support from government, and all stakeholders, food security can be enhanced at the household levels. The study also made recommendations on sustainability and the enhancement of economic growth and development in the area.","[Obadire, Olusegun Samson] Univ Venda, Ctr Rural Dev & Poverty Alleviat, Thohoyandou, South Africa",University of Venda,,,"Obadire, Olusegun Samson/V-5818-2019","Obadire, Olusegun Samson/0000-0001-7295-7627",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,35,43,,,,,,9,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600004,0

We have done the mechanical extraction of rapeseed (Brassica napus L. var. napus) with a mechanical cold pressing of seeds with screw press of continuous type in a two stage process. We determined the energy consumption for pressing seeds and distribution of heavy metals in the oil and cake. We chose to investigate the hybrid seeds D01 PR45, PR46 and PR45 W31 D03 rape (Brassica napus L. var. Napus), which in Slovenia is the most widely used for oil production. We found that with increasing pressing screw speed the specific energy consumption increases and the yield of oil is falling. In terms of energy consumption and yield of oil it is better to use lower speeds of pressing screw. If the levels of Pb and Cd in soil are higher also content of Pb and Cd is higher in plant parts (roots, stems and seeds) and therefore also in the cake and cold-pressed seed oils. According to Slovenian legislation, oil obtained from hybrids PR45 and PR46 W31 D01 after the first and second cold pressing exceed the Pb content in oil, as food, so the oil is only suitable for energy purposes.","[Romih, N.; Lasnik, C.

Moreover, international tourism contributes more to the economy than domestic tourism. Theoretically, tourist expenditure, or revenue of the tourism industry depends on price and income. The purpose of this study is to estimate the effect of price and the income of international tourists on the total tourism revenue of Thailand. In this study, the population is grouped into eight categories, including East Asia, ASEAN, Europe, the Americas, South Asia, Oceania, the Middle East and South Africa. Tourists from Malaysia, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, India, Australia, Israel and South Africa represent tourists from East Asia, ASEAN, Europe, the Americas, South Asia, Oceania, the Middle East and South Africa. According to the Tourism Authority of Thailand, revenues from these tourists are at the top of each category. Using econometric fixed and random effects models, panel data from 1998 to 2009 were obtained in order to estimate price elasticity and income elasticity. Results show that only income affects the consumption of international tourists significantly. A positive change in income has a positive effect on the consumption of international tourists. The demand for tourism of these tourists is considered as a luxury good. In terms of the estimation of price elasticity, tourism demand for Thailand is significantly influenced by a change of price of tourism goods.

The model of IWMS is designed as universal and is implemented as a combination of three models including environmental and economic point of view. The model allows evaluation of the economic and productive efficiency of the system due to own setting of input values and can be used for waste management planning as a decision support tool. Model involves composting, energy and material recovery of waste and landfilling. Its size (number of sources and facilities) depends only upon available data. The model was developed based on given input macroeconomic variables and it enables to inclusion or exclusion of certain equipment of waste management and the capacity of the equipment. It uses data from annual reports of municipalities (if available) on the production of municipal solid waste and estimates its quantity (if unavailable) by using a sophisticated model, including demographic and socioeconomic impacts.

The present paper investigates this issue by reviewing the literature on travel time elasticities for long distance rail travel and comparing these with elasticities observed when new HSR lines have opened. This paper also validates the Swedish long distance model, Sampers, and its forecast demand for a proposed new HSR, using aggregate data revealing how the air-rail modal split varies with the difference in generalized travel time between rail and air. The Sampers long distance model is also compared to a newly developed model applying Box-Cox transformations. The paper contributes to the empirical literature on long distance travel, long distance elasticities and HSR passenger demand forecasts. Results indicate that the Sampers model is indeed able to predict the demand for HSR reasonably well. The new non-linear model has even better model fit and also slightly higher elasticities.

After comparing the reported travel times with the actual corresponding travel times, we found that the average travel times were overstated by a factor of 1.5. We showed that driver- and link-specific characteristics partially explained these exaggerations. Using the stated and revealed preference data, we investigated whether the driver-specific reporting errors were consistent with the drivers' scheduling behaviors in reality and in hypothetical choice experiments. In both cases, we found no robust evidence that drivers behave as if they misperceive travel times to a similar extent as those they misreported, thereby implying that the reported travel times did not represent the actual or perceived travel times in a truthful manner. The results of this study suggest that caution should be recommended when reported travel time data are used in an uncritical manner during transport research and when determining policy.

We provide evidence that centers and forwards experienced increases in relative productivity with the introduction of the three-point line. Finally, we present evidence that the labor market in the NBA adjusted by increasing the demand for height in the NBA draft.

We estimate the substitution possibilities between fossil energy and other factors for households and firms. We build two versions of the model, the first with exogenous technical progress, and the second with an endogenization of the direction of technical progress. We show that if the energy-saving technical progress rate remains at its recent historical value, the magnitude of the carbon tax is quite unrealistic. When the direction of technical progress responds endogenously to economic incentives, CO2 emissions can be reduced by more than that allowed by the substitution possibilities, but not by a factor of four. To achieve this, an additional instrument is needed, namely a subsidy to fossil energy-saving research. The redirection of technical progress, which is a driver of energy transition, comes at a small cost in terms of the overall growth rate of the economy.","[Henriet, Fanny; Maggiar, Nicolas] Banque France, Paris, France; [Henriet, Fanny] CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, F-75700 Paris, France; [Schubert, Katheline] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, Banque France, F-75231 Paris 05, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Henriet, F (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",fanny.henriet@psemail.eu; nicolas.maggiar@banque-france.fr; schubert@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,20,2,2,1,22,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2014,35.0,4,,,,,1,37,,10.5547/01956574.35.4.1,0.0,,,37,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AP4HB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342036700001,0

We observe that compound independence and reduction of compound lotteries hold, whereas coalescing is systematically violated. This result provides support for theories which explain the common ratio effect by violations of coalescing (i.e., configural weight theory) instead of violations of compound independence (i.e., rank-dependent utility or cumulative prospect theory).","[Schmidt, Ulrich; Seidl, Christian] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Schmidt, Ulrich] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Seidl, C (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",cseidl@gmx.net,,,,,,,76,6,6,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2014,77.0,3,,,SI,,323,339,,10.1007/s11238-014-9456-x,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AO8VB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341632000005,0

The informal one is an effective system of economic and social organization insofar as it ensures a joint coordination beyond the spot market by forming reciprocal agreements based on trust and oral contractual relationships. However, the forms of coordination between formal agreements are between products-specificity contracts and production factors contracts in a framework governed by state regulations in terms of quantity, price and quality whose efficiency is higher for small private dairies in comparison with state-run dairy farms by the use of hybrid coordination mechanisms.","[Djermoun, Abdelkader; Belhadia, Mohamed] Univ Chlef, Inst Sci Agron, Chlef, Algeria; [Chehat, Foued] Inst Natl Rech Agron Algerie, El Harrach, Algeria; [Benchari, Abdelhamid] Inst Agron Mediterraneen Montpellier, Montpellier, France",Universite Hassiba Ben Bouali de Chlef; National Institute of Agronomic Research of Algeria (NIARA); CIHEAM; CIHEAM IAM Montpellier,"Djermoun, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chlef, Inst Sci Agron, Chlef, Algeria.",,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,5,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2014,13.0,3,,,,,39,49,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AU4UC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345605800005,0

Our main axiom, which requires that costless units of demands do not affect the cost shares, is used to characterize two classes of rules. Combined with anonymity and a specific stability property, this requirement picks up sharing methods that allow the full compensation of at most one technological contribution. If instead we strengthen the well-known dummy property to include agents whose technological contribution is offset by the cost of their demand, we are left with an adaptation of the Shapley-Shubik method that treats technologies as private and rewards their contributions.

Incorporating the most recent data, it compares the emerging trends in political participation to those observed in the established democracies of Western Europe. The findings reveal that post-communist citizens participate substantially less than their Western counterparts, and, contrary to some expectations, no convergence has been taking place. This is due to a host of factors, the importance of which seems to vary according to the type of political activity. It is subsequently shown that while political participation is lower than in Western Europe, it is not markedly more biased. The poor state of political participation therefore does not appear to seriously undermine the quality of the post-communist democratic process.","Sci Po, Ctr Etud Europeennes, Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Kostelka, F (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Ctr Etud Europeennes, Paris, France.",filip.kostelka@sciencespo.fr,"Kostelka, Filip/J-7457-2019","Kostelka, Filip/0000-0003-0591-5499",,,,,64,38,39,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,AUG,2014,66.0,6,,,,,945,968,,10.1080/09668136.2014.905386,0.0,,,24,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AM9GK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340188700005,0

Different monthly VRPs, such as expected and ex-post VRPs, are measured by using model-free implied and realized variances from option prices and high-frequency (HF) data, and their predictive ability is compared with that of VRPs using a realized measure based on coarser frequency return observations. The empirical results show that the VRPs in Japan with HF data are useful in predicting credit spreads and the composite index of coincident indicators, but lose their predictive ability for the Nikkei 225 returns. Such significant predictive power tends to be greater for the expected VRPs with HF data relative to the ex-post VRP with HF data and VRPs with daily data as well as for lower investment grade credit spreads.","[Ubukata, Masato] Kushiro Publ Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Kushiro, Hokkaido 0858585, Japan; [Watanabe, Toshiaki] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo 1868603, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Ubukata, M (通讯作者)，Kushiro Publ Univ Econ, Dept Econ, 4-1-1 Ashino, Kushiro, Hokkaido 0858585, Japan.",ubukata@kushiro-pu.ac.jp; watanabe@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780154, 26245028, 25245037, 25245034, 21243018] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,42,7,7,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

It theorizes the underlying institutional dynamics of integration by drawing upon the English School as to how more deep-seated informal institutions condition policy-making by EU institutions and Member States as well as the operations of transnational actors such as energy companies. The informal institution of sovereignty constrains the push of the market institution towards a convergent type of integration. Together with the bilateral energy diplomacy and great power management institutions, sovereignty also limits integration in the external gas trade. Internal integration overall remains dependent on the wider European context as is also seen in the functioning of the environmental stewardship institution. The ambiguities among actors occasioned by the implementation of the Third Energy Package suggest a further integration need, but that is constrained by several further driving forces.","[Aalto, Pami; Temel, Dicle Korkmaz] Univ Tampere, Tampere 33014, Finland",,"Aalto, P (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Sch Management Polit, Tampere 33014, Finland.",pami.aalto@uta.fi,,,,,,,51,40,40,0,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This article offers a case study of the industrial city of Volzhskiy, which, although once a stalwart supporter of the Communist Party (KPRF), has evolved into a highly pluralistic system with democratic municipal institutions. Drawing upon analysis of local publications, protest data, and interviews with local politicians, this article traces the interplay of formal institutions and informal political processes in Volzhskiy's local-level transition to democracy. Volzhskiy's pluralism and local democratic outcome can largely be explained by (1) the emergence of a more diverse set of economic and political interests and constituencies, and (2) a KPRF organization that was strong and provided robust competition that created the conditions for cooperation among the competitors to form fair and open local political institutions, which fostered the city's pluralism.","Univ Penn, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Evans, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",aevans2@sas.upenn.edu,,"Evans, Allison D./0000-0002-6443-3062",,,,,88,1,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Drawing on the literature on contemporary migrant selection and sorting, I argue that workers with greater potential for occupational upgrading may have selected themselves out of counties with low skill premiums and sorted themselves into counties with high skill premiums. Using linked data from the U.S. Census and county-level wage data, I present results consistent with this argument, with a focus on shorter distance movers. Conditioning on migrant status, I find that unskilled migrants who moved to places with high skill premiums were most likely to upgrade. I offer some evidence that migrant sorting explains much of this result. My results imply that previous research focusing solely on wage gains provides an incomplete picture of the factors motivating east west migration in nineteenth century America.

Because not all immigrants choose to live in these ethnic communities, identification of a causal effect on living in an ethnic community is problematic. The estimation of the effect of living in these ethnic communities is also difficult because it is ambiguous whether such residence will help or harm the labor market outcomes of immigrants. This study implements a number of approaches to help identify a causal effect, including using sample of adults whose residential location is plausibly exogenous with respect to their labor market outcomes and using the current recession as a source of exogenous variation. Results suggest that residence in an ethnic community after the recession increases the likelihood of working, albeit with longer commutes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A stochastic test of the number of revealed preference violations,EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nonparametric; Revealed preference; Stochastic,NONPARAMETRIC ANALYSIS; CONSUMER DEMAND; BEHAVIOR; MAXIMIZATION; CONSISTENCY; HYPOTHESIS; POWER; GARP,"Revealed preference tests are frequently used to check data on the behavior of agents for consistency with economic theory. Unfortunately these tests lack a stochastic element and thus one violation of revealed preference causes a rejection of the behavior being tested. To remedy this lack of a stochastic element in revealed preference analysis, we suggest a general, simple, and intuitive statistical procedure to test whether the observed number of violations is more consistent with a pre-specified type of non-degenerate behavior than with rational behavior. We illustrate this general procedure with an example using uniform random behavior that allows researchers to test whether the actual number of violations of revealed preference is more consistent with uniform random behavior than rational behavior. This statistical test takes advantage of the fact that nonparametric revealed preference tests involve known prices and expenditures. Our illustrative example is accompanied by some Monte Carlo exercises showing that the uniform test performs very well. We implement our test using datasets from two well-known economic experiments. One is a dataset on altruistic choices from Andreoni and Miller (Econometrica 70:737-753, 2002). The second is a dataset on the choices made by subjects who act within a token economy from Battalio et al. (West Econ J 11:411-428, 1973) and Cox (Econ J 107:1054-1078, 1997). We find that for a majority of subjects in one altruistic behavior sub-experiment uniform random behavior can be rejected in favor of rational behavior at the 10 % level of significance. For all but one subject, living in the token economy, uniform random behavior cannot be rejected. For that one subject in the token experiment uniform random behavior is rejected in favor of perverse economic behavior.","[Hjertstrand, Per] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Swofford, James L.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Econ & Finance, Mobile, AL 36688 USA",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); University of South Alabama,"Swofford, JL (通讯作者)，Univ S Alabama, Dept Econ & Finance, Mobile, AL 36688 USA.",Per.Hjertstrand@ifn.se; jswoffor@usouthal.edu,,,,,,,26,3,3,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In this article, we use a unique, longitudinal survey that follows the PISA 2000 students in their early educational and work-life careers. We find that a deviance in the PISA test scores from what one would have predicted based on easy-to-obtain observable characteristics influences the probability of succeeding in the transition from compulsory schooling to a firm-based apprenticeship significantly but in a non-symmetric way. Only those who had a test result below their predicted result have significantly lower chances of getting an apprenticeship. We also find evidence that the importance of hard-to-obtain information on ability is further revealed in the course of the apprenticeship.","[Mueller, Barbara] Swiss Fed Inst Vocat Educ & Training, Bern, Switzerland; [Wolter, Stefan C.] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland; [Wolter, Stefan C.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Wolter, Stefan C.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Bern; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Wolter, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland.",stefan.wolter@vwi.unibe.ch,"Wolter, Stefan C./IZE-6545-2023","Muller, Barbara/0009-0002-8442-0151; Wolter, Stefan C./0000-0003-2721-2284",,,,,26,10,11,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

During the nineties, the country experienced a period of insecurity and terrorism, which seriously disrupted the socio-economic situation of the farming system. The study area is predominantly rural; it includes nine municipalities and is one of the areas affected by this scourge. After a decade of instability, normal conditions were recovering again with the launch of a national program of agricultural aid in 2000, namely Plan National de Developpement Agricole (PNDA). This change will impact farming dynamics. The analysis of agricultural practices through nonlinear methods, namely the CATegorical Principal Components Analysis (CATPCA), aims to assess the behavior of farmers across time, which will be used as a decision-making tool for assessing and reorienting the government agricultural aid programs. The results showed two typologies: the first one consists of large-scale farming combining field crops (cereals) under rainfed regime and livestock; the second one consists of small farms practicing intensive irrigated crops such as arboriculture and market gardening. However, the economic performance of farms seems to be associated with two different criteria: the size of the farm and farming system as arboriculture and market gardening.","[Rouabhi, Amar; Hafsi, Miloud] Setif Univ 1, Fac SNV, Dept Agron, Setif, Algeria; [Kebiche, Mustapha] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Rouabhi, A (通讯作者)，Setif Univ 1, Fac SNV, Dept Agron, Setif, Algeria.",,,"ROUABHI, Amar/0000-0001-6226-662X",,,,,31,1,1,1,5,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2014,13.0,2,,,,,38,46,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AM7XC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340081000005,0

The results show that there are different demand elasticities for each origin market and that own price elasticity is lower than substituting price elasticity for most origin countries. These findings indicate that price-setting strategies should be specific for each origin market and that information about prices in competing destinations needs to be considered.

We identify the time trends of different components of the gender wage gap across all the wage distribution. Although the unconditional gender wage gap remained roughly constant over time, we find that the component of the gap due to different rewards of similar characteristics deteriorated women's relative wage. We show that especially women at the centre-top of the wage distribution swam against the tide: while the trend in female qualifications slightly reduced the gender wage gap, the gender-relative trends in the wage structure significantly increased it.","[Mussida, Chiara] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Social Sci, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Picchio, Matteo] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Marche Polytechnic University,"Picchio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",chiara.mussida@unicatt.it; m.picchio@univpm.it,"Picchio, Matteo/J-6633-2012","Picchio, Matteo/0000-0001-6996-4957",,,,,24,9,11,3,25,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

However, Japan has seen a steady increase in foreign mergers and acquisitions, which can challenge existing institutional patterns. Women have traditionally been excluded from core membership of the Japanese corporate community. Drawing on case studies of several companies, some acquired, some not, this article examines the impact of foreign ownership on the role of women in the Japanese workplace. Although prospects for women improve at foreign-acquired companies, this is not necessarily accompanied by a change in attitudes towards gender. The article concludes that while a change of ownership can cause changes in practice, wider societal shifts will be required to alter significantly the position of women in Japanese enterprises.","[Olcott, George] Univ Tokyo, RCAST, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Oliver, Nick] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Tokyo; University of Edinburgh,"Olcott, G (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538904, Japan.",olcott@rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Oliver, Nick/0000-0002-5410-8207",,,,,38,9,10,0,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We use insulin as our primary instrument to account for endogeneity between testosterone and self-employment. This is because prior research has identified a relationship between insulin and testosterone but not between insulin and self-employment.

Longevity is much more strongly related to the number of drugs than it is to the number of drug classes. Pharmaceutical innovation during 2000-2009 is estimated to have increased per capita pharmaceutical expenditure by $125 (26%) in 2009, but most (87%) of this increase was offset by a reduction in hospital expenditure. The baseline estimate of the cost per life-year gained from pharmaceutical innovation in France during 2000-2009 is about $8100. This estimate is fairly close to the mean of estimates obtained ($10,800) from U.S., German, and Australian studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The microeconomic environment in which early colonial farmers operated is reconstructed in this article with the use of modern Michael Porter's five forces of competition model. The article shows the high profit potential of crop farming - even when on a small scale - throughout the period, with the exception of the last few years when intensified competition among farmers affected their profits.","La Trobe Univ, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Ostapenko, D (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",d.ostapenko@latrobe.edu.au,,", Dmytro/0000-0002-1167-5404",,,,,71,2,3,1,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

However, so far, intermodal transport has revealed limited capacity for competing against road transport. New solutions aimed at expanding the limits of its competitiveness are needed. Some successful cases of short-distance intermodal transport reveal untapped market opportunities. The literature on mode choice fails to explain these successes. The research has focused mainly on long-distance services, and the findings are not necessarily transferable to the short-distance transport. This paper presents the results of research aimed at testing this assumption. A new agent-based model to simulate the transport operations and behavioural reactions of transport agents was developed, applying mode choice variables that are consensually referred to as pivotal in the mode choice process: price, transit time, reliability and flexibility. The use of the model was to ascertain the performance of competing transport modes (intermodal and road) under different demand scenarios. Applications of the model to a short-distance transport service show that only price could explain the Freight Forwarder choice for intermodality. The evidence produced by this research suggests that the mode choice process for short-distance transport services may be governed by other decision variables and that current intermodality-oriented policy options should be revised, as they exclude a potential market segment.

In this framework, it is more and more important to understand the consumer's choice dynamics in order to develop differentiated marketing, commercial and communication strategies. The purpose of this paper is to analyse and to point out the Italian consumer preferences for beef This research uses the choice model approach to assess consumer behaviour In November 2011, a visual discrete choice experiment was administered online by a specific provider to a sample of 1500 consumers, representative of the Italian population for sex, age and residence. The results highlight the crucial importance of beef cut in the final choice, and reaffirm the central role played by the country of origin labelling (COOL). On the contrary, breed information and price marginally affect the final purchasing decision. These insights provide strategic information for public and private agents involved in the beef sector.","[Scozzafava, Gabriele; Casini, Leonardo; Contini, Caterna] Univ Florence, GESAAF, Dipartimento Gest Sistemi Agr Alimentari & Forest, I-50121 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Scozzafava, G (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, GESAAF, Dipartimento Gest Sistemi Agr Alimentari & Forest, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",,"CONTINI, CATERINA/IUO-1064-2023","CONTINI, CATERINA/0000-0003-0626-574X; Scozzafava, Gabriele/0000-0002-2381-9938; CASINI, LEONARDO/0000-0001-8965-4390",,,,,51,18,18,0,35,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2014,13.0,1,,,,,66,72,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AG2VW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335276200009,0

One determinant of people's willingness to support investments in mass transit may be the price of fuel for transit's principal competition, the private automobile. In this paper, I examine the relationship between the cost of gasoline and stated willingness to invest public money in mass transit improvements.! hypothesize that fuel price volatility-in addition to price itself-is a determinant of support for more mass transit funding, controlling for other factors. As the price of gasoline becomes more uncertain, the public should, all else equal, support investment in mass transportation, a form of transportation that may provide some measure of protection from the price of fuel. Results suggest a strong effect of price volatility on consumers' willingness to support transit expenditures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Interest in resolving this question was revived with the emergence of exhaustive micro-databases on household incomes that are consistently comparable across countries. However, although practitioners employ a plethora of different approaches, a completely appropriate measurement model for dissecting the contributions of taxes and benefits has not yet been developed. This paper is the first to present a systematic review of the different methods used in this field of research, and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. After the methods review, this paper introduces new decompositions of the redistributive effect into vertical and horizontal effects, based on Kakwani's (In: Basmann RL, Rhodes GF (eds) Economics inequality: measurement and policy, pp 149-168, 1984) and Lerman and Yitzhaki's (Rev Econ Stat 67:151-156, 1985) models, which are both widely accepted by researchers. Applications of the methodology to hypothetical and real-world data indicate the effectiveness and suitability of the new decompositions for use in cross-country comparisons of tax-benefit systems.","Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Public Finance,"Urban, I (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",ivica@ijf.hr,"Urban, Ivica/J-5821-2012","Urban, Ivica/0000-0001-6734-2791",,,,,48,13,13,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2014,42.0,3,,,,,619,645,,10.1007/s00355-013-0747-x,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AD1XZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333028300006,0

Our econometric approach is based on a reduced-form model and takes account explicitly of parameter heterogeneity and cross section dependence, relying on ARDL modelling and panel estimators with multifactor structures. We find clear supportive evidence of short- and long-run relations between temperature and per-capita GDP growth, while the role played by rainfall appears to be less important and the evidence on its statistical significance is less clear-cut. Very similar results are reported when the analysis is carried out by focusing solely on Sub-Saharan African countries or considering GDP growth per worker. This evidence is in sharp contrast to the results obtained via standard MG estimation and this confirms that, by not controlling for cross section dependence, traditional panel estimators are likely to provide misleading inference. The empirical results suggest that, far from adapting quickly to weather shocks, African economies appear to be significantly damaged by them. In the absence of corrective measures, the current trends in climate change may impose a progressively heavier burden on African countries.","Univ Messina, Dipartimento Econ Stat Matemat & Sociol V Pareto, I-98122 Messina, Italy",University of Messina,"Lanzafame, M (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, Dipartimento Econ Stat Matemat & Sociol V Pareto, Via T Cannizzaro 278, I-98122 Messina, Italy.",mlanzafame@unime.it,"Lanzafame, Matteo/T-4799-2019","Lanzafame, Matteo/0000-0003-0737-3005",,,,,27,33,35,0,20,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

One can find a great number of domestic and foreign scientific researches, analysing the reasons of the high level of the energy intensity of Russian economy and other countries of the world, singling out the factors, causing them on the level of the country as a whole and on the level of certain enterprises. We can not deny the recent changes in the legislation of the Russian Federation and the approval of various programs in the sphere of energy efficiency. We should also mention the changes in the behaviour of top-managers of large enterprises, who realize the importance of energy-efficiency policy for ecology-efficiency and competitive ability growth. Though, a significant reduction of the level of energy intensity of Russian economy is not still achieved. Considering the fact that the territory of Russia includes a range of regions, the power intensity of which can vary significantly, the authors of the article analysed the power intensity of certain regions, and then made a more detailed analysis of the areas composing each region. Under these conditions, the energy intensity of the regions and areas was not considered to be an isolated characteristic. It was analysed in its interconnection with the economic growth rate and the economic structure of the regions. As the result of the analysis, it was established that the analysed areas (territorial entities) can be united in groups depending on the level of their energy intensity and economic growth rate. On this basis, the following proposal has been worked out: different target criteria of the reduction of energy intensity should be determined and special energy efficiency requirements should be formulated. They may differ significantly for each group (being more or less severe). The application of the selective approach to the formulation of the energy efficiency requirements and their document fixing will promote the reduction of energy intensity in certain areas and regions of the Russian Federation, and Russian economy as a whole.","[Anisimova, Tatiana; Khabibrakhmanov, Rishat] Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia",Kazan Federal University,"Anisimova, T (通讯作者)，Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia.",,"Anisimova, Tatiana/P-6917-2015","Anisimova, Tatiana/0000-0001-7452-8105",,,,,14,3,3,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,479,486,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800060,0

In particular, it has been argued that airport dominance is a more important source of market power in the US airline industry than route dominance. We examine this contention by analyzing a seventeen-year panel of airport-level prices in the United States. We demonstrate that even though on average airport-level concentration appears to be the strongest source of market power, concentration on routes originating at an airport is the strongest predictor of price levels for the sub-set of large and medium hub airports. There is little evidence that either airport or route dominance significantly affect prices in the sub-sample of medium and small hub airports. There is also little evidence that an airport's dominant carrier exerts market power beyond the level predicted by the airport or route dominance. Our results imply that consumer welfare losses due to airline consolidation can be concentrated in smaller communities, and related to changes in airport-level concentration. We provide a simple evaluation of the possible effects of two recent and one projected mergers (Delta-Northwest, United-Continental, and American-US Airways) in light of this finding, and suggest that the former consolidation event can potentially lead to non-trivial consumer welfare losses to travelers in over 30 small communities.

An objective of that scholarship is to identify patterns across RTAs. We investigate the following question: how have RTAs helped separatist and autonomous movements in their ambitions? We propose that both the left-and right-leaning movements have successfully appropriated, in positive and negative language, RTAs in their rhetoric to articulate not only their goals against their nation states but also their claims against those who oppose them. We identify four factors that might explain the observable differences in rhetorical approaches. The empirical evidence concerns the Quebecois nationalists in Canada,Converge`ncia i Unio in Spain, the Zapatistas in Mexico and the Lega Nord in Italy. We conclude by reflecting on the possible local and regional impact of the observed rhetorical leveraging across RTAs.","[Duina, Francesco] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Bok, Jared] Emory Univ, Dept Sociol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",University of British Columbia; Emory University,"Duina, F (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, 6303 NW Marine Dr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",francesco.duina@ubc.ca; jbok@emory.edu,"Duina, Francesco/O-4082-2019","Duina, Francesco/0000-0002-5871-1222; Bok, Jared/0000-0002-0579-444X",,,,,104,1,1,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Cultural heritage is widely recognized as strength in all Croatian tourism and strategic development documents, however, multisectoral cooperation for its commercialization and development of continental (inland) tourism is still lacking. The question is why numerous features of Croatian tourism have not been used for better positioning Croatia as the cradle of European culture. This paper addresses the need for recognition and acknowledgment of the significant role of archeology in the development of continental tourism. It also points out the need for cooperation between universities, institutions, business and civil society, and knowledge of the cultural and natural environment for the launch of the innovative development of tourist destinations, their commercialization and networking with the compatible regions of Europe. The starting point for this paper was found in the unique archaeological heritage of Pannonian Croatia and in the work of world known archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans in 1871. In order to develop and utilize this tourist potential, it is necessary to evaluate the key factors that influence the creation of innovative tourism product. Therefore, the PEST analysis was made. In addition to analyzing the existing intersectoral collaboration and analysis of Triple/Quadruple/Quintuple Helix dynamics, this paper offers recommendations for introducing commercial aspect of this particular tourism product and easier access to financial resources for its implementation The contribution of this paper is in identifying neglected potential of existing archaeological heritage as advantage for the development of continental tourism, placing the same in the context of crosssectoral cooperation, and pointing towards the need for strengthening cooperation in achieving a common goal.","[Durman, Aleksandar] Fac Philosophy, Dept Archaeol, Zagreb, Croatia; [Kukec, Ljiljana] Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia; [Coric, Gordana] Univ Appl Sci VERN, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Durman, A (通讯作者)，Fac Philosophy, Dept Archaeol, Zagreb, Croatia.",adurman@ffzg.hr; lkukec@inet.hr; gordana.coric@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,267,279,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600025,0

After a brief reconstruction of Malinvaud's argument, it is shown that the result is far less encouraging for neoclassical theory than it might seem. The most important problem is not the fact that change in the interest rate affects the average period of production associated with a technique, despite the concern this aroused in Hicks and Malinvaud, but rather that it affects the ranking of techniques. An example with two techniques is used to show that a rise in the rate of interest entails the use of a technique with a shorter average period even in the case of reswitching simply because the ranking of techniques is inverted at the two switch points.","Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, I-00145 Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Fratini, SM (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",fratini@uniroma3.it,"FRATINI, Saverio Maria/B-6417-2013","FRATINI, Saverio Maria/0000-0003-0766-0741",,,,,20,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

In this essay we consider these perennial questions of modern IPE scholarship in reverse order to ask whether the euro could ever have become, or seek to become, a true international currency rivalling the US dollar, used not only for passive foreign exchange reserves but also as a major commercial currency outside the EU. We argue that the EU lacks the will, the ideas and the capacity to promote the euro into the status of an international currency. In this article, we concentrate on this final issue of capacity, as the will and ideas issues have already been well explored. Capacity is an issue coeval with, if not prior to, the first two issues. The EU's current institutional arrangements and its economic geography create macro-economic consequences that diminish the euro's capacity to operate as a top currency. These conflicts go beyond the well-recognized issue that the euro-zone is not an optimum currency area. Examining the euro's debilities sheds light not only on the euro's (in) capacity to rival the dollar as an international currency, but also on the future of both the euro and the dollar in the aftermath of the euro-zone crisis.","[Germain, Randall] Carleton Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Schwartz, Herman] Univ Virginia, Dept Polit, Charlottesville, VA USA",Carleton University; University of Virginia,"Germain, R (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",,,"Schwartz, Herman Mark/0000-0002-5571-3644; Germain, Randall/0000-0003-2632-7784",,,,,75,35,38,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In the research a standard gravity model is tested and the results are compared with a model augmented by variables representing: border effect, war and post-war effects, minorities, difference in factor endowments, religious and language distance, FTA and FDI stock. In the panel data model, pooled OLS, fixed and random effects models are estimated in order to check for robustness of the results. The findings show that there are many determinants of trade specific for this region, which need to be included in the model in order to make it well suited to the data.

It will mainly focus on presenting the historical relationship that exists between trade and energy consumption, being brought into attention the global challenges that may arise at the intersection of trade, energy, and their influence upon the environment. Trade, energy and the conservation of the environment are each hugely complicated, not being mentioned the fact that being brought together, they are vital for the entire world. Therefore, the energy industry has a lot at stake as trade and environment rules are adopted and interpreted. All the challenges that can appear are discouraging but they are compounded in the absence of a focused, predictable and logical legal framework. The energy industry cannot supply the world's energy needs if the rules to which they are subject are loose, conflicting, insubstantial or constantly changing.","Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Popescu, MF (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Popescu, Maria-Floriana/R-6808-2016","Popescu, Maria-Floriana/0000-0003-2927-2432",,,,,7,0,0,2,11,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,789,795,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900102,0

The article finds that a combination of partisan politics and weak normative consensus thwarted the EU's ability to use the sanctioning mechanism of Article 7. The effectiveness of alternative instruments that EU institutions used - social pressure, infringement procedures and issue linkage - varied across issues and countries. In Hungary, changes to illiberal practices generally remained limited, but differences in the EU's material leverage explain cross-issue variation. The EU's relative success in Romania suggests that it is not necessarily powerless against democratic backsliding. It might require a demanding constellation of favourable conditions for both social and material pressure, but there are grounds for a more optimistic interpretation that material leverage might be unnecessary if the conditions for social pressure are favourable.","[Sedelmeier, Ulrich] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sedelmeier, U (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",u.sedelmeier@lse.ac.uk,"Sedelmeier, Ulrich/P-8452-2019","Sedelmeier, Ulrich/0000-0001-6963-4296",,,,,25,168,181,5,104,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this work is briefly explained the concept of biomass with a detailed focus on wood biomass as one of renewable source of energy. Aim of this work is to present the role and importance of wood biomass in Croatia as one of the most important energy sources in the near future. Use of wood biomass (in the form of firewood) has a long tradition in the Republic of Croatia. The Republic of Croatia has significant potential of wood biomass for energy production, which confirms the fact that forest and woodlands cover 47% of Croatian land surface. The role of wood biomass is multiply, both in environmental protection and in terms of sustainable development. Besides, it is important to highlight social and economic contribution of biomass whose exploitation creates independence from imported energy, creates new working positions, and opens the chances to export, strengthen the regions and promote environmental protection. These are important factors because of which biomass in the energy strategy of Republic of Croatia represents an important role as evidenced by international collaboration in this field as well as organizing traditional international scientific meetings.

Therefore, the establishment and proper management of ticket inspection teams deployed to tackle fare dodgers is highly important and represents a severe challenge. In this paper, an existent profit maximization model for estimating the optimum level of inspection has been extended, calibrated, and tested in a real case, using data available from an Italian transit operator, resulting from 98 days of checks and 3659 completed on-board interviews. Given the current network-wide inspection level per single verifier, and considering the level of fines currently applied, the optimal value of the total inspection rate is found to amount to 4.5%. The model provides empirical evidence towards understanding the fare evasion problem, besides highlighting the need for collaboration with the managers of the transit company. An overview of the manipulation of some control variables related to risk perception and the main implications of the findings are presented to transport companies using honour ticketing systems.

This paper presents a profile of enterprise demography and employment for the tourism industries in Ireland at county level, which corresponds with level 4 of the European Union spatial classification 'NUTS'. New metrics, entitled 'Tourism Dependency Ratios' are derived and mapped. These ratios illustrate how the tourism supply side can be analysed and understood from a spatial perspective.

We use several identification strategies and demonstrate that for about 20% of households company car possession increases car ownership. The annual welfare loss of distortionary company taxation through increased car ownership is generally rather small, maximally (sic)120 per company car, and much less than the welfare loss through increased expenditure on the company car. However, for policies that exempt households from paying tax on their company car, the annual deadweight loss is likely higher. Our first-best tax policy recommendation is to increase company car tax rates. However, our current results suggest that a second-best policy, which keeps average company car taxation constant but which reduces the marginal tax on cheaper cars and increases the marginal tax on expensive cars, would be welfare improving as overconsumption of company cars will be reduced.","[van Ommeren, Jos N.; Gutierrez-i-Puigarnau, Eva] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, FEWEB, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van Ommeren, JN (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, FEWEB, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jos.van.ommeren@vu.nl,,"Van Ommeren, Jos/0000-0003-4838-478X",,,,,29,3,3,2,24,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

For these systems, the European Commission envisages a common future in terms of an increase of efficiency and elimination of national borders. In this paper, we analyze the two systems in the perspective of their common development and we underline the main existing differences linked to the management of the infrastructure. These differences concern the processes implemented for specifying and allocating capacity, both in strategic planning and in real-time intervention. Our analysis suggests that the air transportation system is moving in the direction indicated by the European Commission, as well as the rail transportation system for what concerns international train paths (typically high-speed trains). However, a substantial separation still exists between conventional rail transportation systems of different countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Counterfactual exercises show that improvements in rainfall, altitude, or roughness of terrain would have a significant impact on average yields. The paper concludes that producers addressed the growing demand not by investing in increasing yields, but by extending the area of cultivated land, using the still abundant pastures. The low grain yields in Spain were in part a consequence of the rational behaviour of producers who faced an economic environment characterized by an elastic supply of land.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ciencias Sociales, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Santiago-Caballero, C (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ciencias Sociales, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",carlos.santiago@uc3m.es,"Santiago-Caballero, Carlos/B-8204-2011","Santiago-Caballero, Carlos/0000-0003-4040-108X",,,,,59,6,6,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

This trilemma is best understood as a trade-off between national autonomy and rules that promote globalisation. However, a contractual perspective on international law - recognising that states use international law to make exchanges of policy autonomy in ways that enhance each consenting state's welfare - suggests that there is no real trade-off between national autonomy and international legal rules that promote globalisation. The antiglobalisation paradox is that these rules of international law may be seen as an expression of national autonomy. There is no trilemma, and even the trade-off between national autonomy and globalisation must be understood instead as a trade-off between two ways of promoting national welfare: one through autarchy and the other through international legal exchange. It then becomes apparent that a bias in favour of autarchy is mistaken, as it inappropriately limits the ways in which governments may promote national welfare. Furthermore, international law does not necessarily need, at the international level, the same types of mechanisms for democratic accountability that are required at the national level, because states consent to international law through their national democratic processes. Globalisation can take place through international legal rules that have appropriate democratic credentials and that leave in place appropriate national autonomy.","Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Trachtman, JP (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",,"Trachtman, Joel/AAN-8482-2020",,,,,,19,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2013,36.0,11,,,SI,,1442,1454,,10.1111/twec.12101,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,248JB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326694200005,0

Our major disagreement is with Bonefeld's underlying assumption that the ideas of the Freiburgers on strong state authority were very durable and continued to be so across a divide as great as that of 1945 when a more strictly chronological use of the sources would have shown significant transformations. The earlier quasi proto-fascist ideas of the strong state were replaced with a much more muted role for the state in providing a constitutional framework in which the market forces could develop. It is through this break with their own initial sympathy with Hitler's strong state that the ideas of the Freiburger Ordnungspolitik underwent profound changes to a constitutional state as guarantor of economic stability, and only in this changed form do the ideas of a legal rule-based system of the Freiburger ordoliberals continue to play an important role in understanding Germany's role in resolving the Euro crisis.

To gain new insight into that success, this paper examines the striking heterogeneity in county-level support for Roosevelt. Even though the Depression's effects and the New Deal's benefits were famously widespread, only some parts of the country responded with large and durable partisan shifts. One reason is that several factors, including pre-New Deal economic hardship, Dust Bowl conditions, and New Deal spending, appear to have had effects that were largely transitory (i.e., faded by 1940). A complementary reason is that swing electorates can, and did, swing both ways. By contrast, several other variables - notably economic and demographic factors discussed in the previous literature - are related to relatively durable shifts. Finally, heterogeneity in marginal responses may have mattered greatly to national-level Democratic success. By demonstrating which factors were transitory and which were more durable, this paper illuminates the New Deal Realignment and, more generally, the influence of economic conditions and distributive policy on voter behavior.

Acknowledging the importance of momentum, the current study explores whether and how REIT return patterns are linked to the underlying characteristics of the REITs themselves, in the manner of Daniel and Titman's (Journal of Finance 52(1):1-33, 1997, Journal of Portfolio Management 24(4):24-33, 1998) characteristics model. Over the period 1993 through 2009, we find that after controlling for momentum, book-to-market, institutional ownership, and illiquidity are all strongly associated with REIT returns while size and analyst coverage are not. We further extend prior research by examining the influence of changes in interest rate cycles on REIT returns, and find that the characteristic-return relationships are heavily influenced by interest rates.","[Goebel, Paul R.; Harrison, David M.; Mercer, Jeffrey M.] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Whitby, Ryan J.] Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Goebel, PR (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",paul.goebel@ttu.edu; david.m.harrison@ttu.edu; jeffrey.mercer@ttu.edu; ryan.whitby@usu.edu,"Mercer, Jeffrey M/H-5196-2016","Whitby, Ryan/0000-0002-0047-0825",,,,,43,23,24,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The benefits of transformation in these countries have been unequally distributed among particular social groups and territorieswith the emergence of highly educated and internationally successful professionals and entrepreneurs located mainly in metropolitan areas on the one hand, and structural unemployment, persistent poverty and social exclusion in peripheral regions on the other. These regional imbalances are characterised by a process of metropolisation that has privileged a handful of dynamic urban centres while exacerbating the structural problems of old industrial regions, vast rural areas and regions located on borders, and especially the EU's eastern borders. Different as they are in social, cultural and geographical terms, these declining or stagnating regions share general problems of economic peripherality and many negative effects of structural change, such as rural depopulation, brain drain', disinvestment and, frequently, below-average levels of socio-economic well-being. This polarised economic and territorial development within CEE poses challenges not only for the respective countries, but also for European cohesion.","Univ Warsaw, Ctr European Reg & Local Studies EUROREG, PL-0927 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Smetkowski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Ctr European Reg & Local Studies EUROREG, Krakowskie Przedmiescie Str 30, PL-0927 Warsaw, Poland.",m.smetkowski@uw.edu.pl,"Smętkowski, Maciej/AAK-3986-2020","Smętkowski, Maciej/0000-0002-3978-192X",,,,,30,34,35,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,OCT 1,2013,65.0,8,,,,,1529,1554,,10.1080/09668136.2013.833038,0.0,,,26,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,293PC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329983900003,0

The measure employed, the ethnic diversity index (EDI), makes possible a more sophisticated interpretation of the dynamics of ethnic diversity than an analysis of the changing percentage shares of Latvia's various ethnic groups over time. At the national level, a trend of declining ethnic diversity prior to Latvia's incorporation into the Soviet Union was followed by a rapid increase during the Soviet period, before the onset of gradually decreasing diversity during the post-Soviet period. These national-level trends obscure a number of trends evident at the municipal level, including salient (depending on the period) ethnic diversity gradients Rga-Latvia, cities/towns-countryside, and the east-west. Latvia remains one of the most ethnically diverse countries of Europe, and the study outlines some of the implications of the recent stagnation of regional EDIs at rather high levels for the economic and political life of the country.","Univ Pecs, Inst Geog, Dept Human Geog & Urban Studies, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary",University of Pecs,"Németh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pecs, Inst Geog, Dept Human Geog & Urban Studies, Ifjusag U 6, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary.",nemethadam@gamma.ttk.pte.hu,,,,,,,91,5,6,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

A city council and a regional government (representing city and suburbs) decide respectively on parking fees and a road toll. Both charges are below the optimum when median voters in city and suburbs prefer cars to public transport sufficiently more than the average. Even if the city government would set an optimal road toll, the regional government blocks it when the median suburban voter prefers cars strongly enough. Letting the city control parking and road pricing may therefore increase chances of adoption of the latter. However, if the city controls parking and the region road pricing, the combined charges are higher than if the city controlled them both. Hence, when voters want all charges below the optimum, the involvement of two governments may be desirable. We also find that earmarking road pricing revenues for public transport is welfare-enhancing, compared to lump-sum redistribution, only if they are topped up by extra funds granted to the city by a higher level of government.

Discouraged workers are those who will search for work when the labor market is tight but do not search for work when the labor market is slack because they consider their chances of finding a suitable job too low. The theoretical point of departure is a search model where the worker evaluates the expected utility of searching for work and decides to participate in the labor market if the expected utility of search exceeds the utility of not working. From this framework, we derive an empirical model for the probability that the worker will be out of the labor force, unemployed, or employed. The model is estimated on a sample of married and cohabitating women in Norway covering the period from 1988 to 2008. The results show that the discouraged worker effect is substantial. On average, about one-third of those who are out of the labor force are discouraged, according to our analysis.","[Dagsvik, John K.; Kornstad, Tom; Skjerpen, Terje] Res Dept Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Dagsvik, JK (通讯作者)，Res Dept Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",John.Dagsvik@ssb.no; Tom.Kornstad@ssb.no; Terje.Skjerpen@ssb.no,,,,,,,30,25,28,0,18,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper analyses the case of Brazil at the World Trade Organization (WTO), a core institution in global economic governance. In the last decade, Brazil successfully waged two landmark trade disputes against the US and EU and created a coalition of developing countries - the G20 - which brought an end to the dominance of the US and EU at the WTO and made their trade policies a central target of the Doha Round. Brazil's activism has been widely hailed as a major victory for developing countries. However, I argue that rather than challenging the neoliberal agenda of the WTO, Brazil has emerged as one of the most vocal advocates of free market globalisation and the push to expand and liberalise global markets. I show that Brazil's stance has been driven by the rise of its export-oriented agribusiness sector. This case demonstrates that business actors from the Global South are becoming significant new protagonists in global economic governance; they are taking the tools created by the states and corporations of the Global North - in this case, the WTO and its neoliberal discourse - and turning them against their originators. At the same time, their interests are being wrapped in and advanced through a discourse of development and social justice and a strategic mobilisation of the politics of the North-South divide.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Hopewell, K (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, 3333 Univ Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",kristen.hopewell@ubc.ca,,,,,,,89,49,52,3,67,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

These MMIR do not perform well in predicting preferences over simple sets of monetary outcomes. In this paper, we investigate the axiomatic underpinnings of these models by means of pairwise choice experiments. From this investigation, some important conclusions can be drawn: Axioms that prevent rankings to be based on total-goodness, as well as monotonicity conditions (ensuring that replacing a set element with a better one results in a better set) cannot be refuted. Axioms that rule out any utilization of the relative difference in the values of the outcomes and axioms that prevent rankings to be based on average-goodness are all systematically violated. The Uniform Expected Utility (UEU) criterion seems to meet the apparent shortcomings of the MMIR. Some frequently occurring preference patterns, however, suggest that a significant portion of the participants uses neither a Min- or Max-induced ranking, nor UEU, but some other unspecified decision rule, possibly characterized by the tendency to prefer a diversification of uncertainty.","Univ Ghent, Dept Data Anal, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Vrijdags, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Data Anal, Henri Dunantlaan 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",amelie.vrijdags@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2013,75.0,2,,,,,233,266,,10.1007/s11238-012-9339-y,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,185GT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321955900005,0

The modified Diebold-Mariano test of Harvey etal. (International Journal of Forecasting, 13, 1997, 281) indicates that our futures-based model significantly outperforms the ARIMA model and static model in terms of 1-month-ahead out-of-sample forecasts of net imports. Moreover, the market timing test of Clements (Evaluating Econometric Forecasts of Economic and Financial Variables, 2005, Palgrave Macmillan, Xxxxx) indicates that there is a significantly high correlation between the predicted signs of our model and the actual outcomes. When sorting all sign predictions according to the absolute magnitude of the out-of-sample movements, our proposed model achieves a 100 per cent forecasting accuracy for both copper and aluminium when predicting the largest movements at the top 10 percentile.","[Chen, Tao] Open Univ Hong Kong, Lee Shau Kee Sch Business & Adm, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Liang; Yan, Isabel Kit-Ming] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Metropolitan University; City University of Hong Kong,"Chen, T (通讯作者)，Open Univ Hong Kong, Lee Shau Kee Sch Business & Adm, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"Chen, Tao/Q-3649-2019","YAN, Kit Ming Isabel/0000-0002-6098-8087; chen, tao/0000-0003-1326-864X",,,,,19,0,0,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2013,36.0,7,,,SI,,861,879,,10.1111/twec.12073,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,182NN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321750400003,0

The representative farms considered are located in Emilia-Romagna and Lombardia, which are potentially most affected by the Directive given their high livestock density. The study simulates two different farm response scenarios to the Directive. Simulation results show the importance of the creation and use of a manure market to dispose nitrogen from livestock surpluses in order to reduce the negative effects of the Directive on farm income. The herd reduction option is unfavourable, as it causes much larger income drop, which, for some farms, reaches one third of their income.","[Arata, Linda; Sckokai, Paolo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Econ Agroalimentare, Piacenza, Italy; [Peerlings, Jack] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Wageningen University & Research,"Arata, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Econ Agroalimentare, Piacenza, Italy.",,"SCKOKAI, Paolo/AAU-1437-2020; Sckokai, Paolo/ABF-2198-2020; Peerlings, Jack/C-8473-2015","Sckokai, Paolo/0000-0001-8278-9663; ARATA, Linda/0000-0002-3011-5381",,,,,20,1,1,0,3,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2013,12.0,2,,,,,22,33,,,,,,12,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AG2VQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335275600003,0

Then I utilize this expected inflation along with other macroeconomic variables as inputs to the monetary policy function in a recursive VAR model to identify exogenous policy shocks. To calculate inflationary expectations, I assume that ex ante real interest rate shocks do not have a long-run effect on the nominal interest rate. This article finds that the public expects lower inflation for the future during periods of high inflation. Estimated results from the recursive VAR suggest that a contractionary policy shock increases the real interest rate, appreciates domestic currency, and lowers inflationary expectations and industrial output.

The first is whether country specific data actually bear any relevance for the future path of area wide price growth, over and above that already contained in area wide data. The second is whether to track ECB monetary policy decisions it is useful to take into account national information and not only area wide statistics.

A simple theoretical framework accounts for the possibly nonmonotonic variations of fertility in the course of economic development. As predicted by unified growth theory, I find that primary schooling, rather than income or health-related variables, is the most robust determinant of the fertility transition. As regards the health transition, both education and income are significant determinants of mortality rates, but education alone accounts for the bulk of their time variation over the twentieth century. Thus, education can be viewed as the main long-term determinant of the demographic transition.","OECD, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Murtin, F (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,58,58,65,3,37,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This article seeks to explain that rise using national surveys of local government economic development practice for 2004 and 2009. The authors differentiate business incentive use by three types (tax abatements, labor support, and planning) and by new and experienced users. We find that higher business incentive use is a response to lower property tax and higher unemployment. We also find that higher business incentive use is associated with greater attention to accountability, even among the new business incentive users. Governments that rely more heavily on tax incentives to firms face more competition and lower tax revenue than governments that use more incentives focused on labor and planning. We also find broadening attention to accountability measures and a widening of community development investment to arenas that target improved quality of life.","[Warner, Mildred E.; Zheng, Lingwen] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Warner, ME (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, W Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mew15@cornell.edu,,"Warner, Mildred/0000-0002-0109-338X",,,,,54,35,45,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Attitudes towards exercise, social interaction, and the environment are central motivations affecting individual's choice of mode. Trip satisfaction is a complex element that has important ramifications for understanding travel behavior. Using clustering techniques, walkers are stratified into one of six distinct groups based on underlying values and motivations. Among other findings, people who are most concerned with environmental issues and physical activity are walking much longer distances than average and are much more satisfied with their commute. In addition, a new conceptual model of walking behavior is presented that suggests that underlying values lead to home location decisions while simultaneously having a moderating effect on the perception and satisfaction with travel. This research adds to the burgeoning debate surrounding how various aspects of travel can best be measured, conceptualized and modeled for better public policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This theory suggests that consumption in one region is closely related to that in other regions if the capital market is open. We test this theoretical implication in the panel data context using the dynamic factor model which enables us to estimate unobservable common factors. Then we provide evidence of perfect capital mobility and capital integration having advanced rapidly between 1965 and 1975. Furthermore, the common factor is found to affect regional consumption heterogeneously and to be closely associated with stock returns.","Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Nagayasu, J (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",nagayasu@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

It fills a gap in the literature on competition in commercial passenger rail by relying on newly collected stated preference data from about 700 on-train interviews. Our multinomial Logit estimations reveal two important effects that are closely connected to (psychological) switching costs. First, the customers on the route Cologne-Amsterdam, for whom competition is a purely hypothetical situation, value a competitive market structure lower than customers on the already competitive route Cologne-Brussels. Second, travellers show a status quo bias with a preference for the service provider on whose trains they were interviewed. This effect goes beyond the impact exercised by explanatory variables capturing the observable differences of the services and customers, including loyalty-enhancing effects like the possession of customer cards. Our results imply that entry into the commercial passenger rail market may be more difficult than often thought. Thus, the study contributes to explaining the low level of competition in these markets in Europe. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, given the proportional and the bounded nature of leverage ratios, models such as the tobit, the fractional regression model and its two-part variant are a better alternative. In this article, we discuss the main econometric assumptions and features of those models, provide a theoretical foundation for their use in the regression analysis of leverage ratios and review some statistical tests suitable to assess their specification. Using a dataset previously considered in the literature, we carry out a comprehensive comparison of the alternative models, finding that in this framework the most relevant functional form issue is the choice between a single model for all capital structure decisions and a two-part model that explains separately the decisions to issue debt and, conditional on the first decision, on the amount of debt to issue.","[Ramalho, Joaquim J.

The article analyses arguments for the autonomy thesis by J. Elster, A. Etzioni, and J. G. March and J. P. Olsen. Finally, the general claim is discussed whether norm following and norm emergence are utility maximizing. The conclusion is that the autonomy thesis is not tenable if one applies a wide subjectivist, social psychological version of RCT that includes the assumption of bounded rationality. The autonomy thesis is only compatible with a narrow version of RCT that excludes internal outcomes and that refers to norms that do not have external outcomes. It is argued that such a narrow version is not capable of explaining many forms of behavior social scientists are interested in.","Univ Leipzig, Hamburg, Germany",Leipzig University,"Opp, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Hamburg, Germany.",kdopp@arcor.de,"Opp, Karl-Dieter/HHT-1314-2022","Opp, Karl-Dieter/0000-0002-7154-6735",,,,,84,40,46,1,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2013,74.0,3,,,,,383,409,,10.1007/s11238-012-9315-6,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,077RT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314045900004,0

However, few studies have examined the relationship between child/adolescent socioeconomic position and adult height in a racially/ethnically diverse cohort. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examined the association of child/adolescent SEP (maternal education and maternal report of household income) and measured adult height in a diverse cohort of US adolescents/young adults. We found a positive gradient effect of maternal education on height in the overall population and in White and Mixed race males and females: no such gradient existed in Hispanic, Asian, or Black males or females. Only in Mixed race females was household income positively associated with height.

Price and income are shown to be highly significant as are the quality factors included. The price elasticity is around -0.3 indicating price-inelastic demand and the income elasticity roughly 1.0 which is shown to be the net effect of two opposing forces, a gross income effect and a price-of-leisure effect. Additionally, two objective output characteristics which can positively influence concert attendance are examined. This analysis was undertaken by applying an exceptionally large panel data set for 79 orchestras over the period from 1972 to 2004 (1,313 observations). No previous study of orchestra demand was based on such a rich data set, nor used such a range of extensive variables. Some policy implications are considered in the concluding section.","[Zieba, Marta; O'Hagan, John] Trinity Coll Dublin, Coll Green, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Zieba, M (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Coll Green, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland.",ziebam@tcd.ie; johagan@tcd.ie,"Zieba, Marta/A-8283-2018; Zieba, Marta/JAZ-0878-2023","Zieba, Marta/0000-0002-9116-2413;",,,,,28,7,7,0,9,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The model considers both infrastructure and environmental attributes as production factors, characterized by a predator prey relationship arising from the negative influence of the development of physical infrastructure on the natural capital. A general condition for economic sustainability is derived from the model analysis. In addition, the transitional dynamics obtained by using specific functional forms depict the empirically observed tourist life cycle and extend the optimal paths obtained from the classical Ramsey model to the context of tourism-based economies strongly dependent on fragile environmental resources.","[Hernandez, Juan M.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Quantitat Methods, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Leon, Carmelo J.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Appl Econ Anal, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Hernández, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Quantitat Methods, C Saulo Toron S-N, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",jhernandez@dmc.ulpgc.es; cleon@daea.ulpgc.es,"Suárez, Beatriz/L-6377-2014; Hernandez, Juan/JAX-4722-2023; Hernandez, Juan M./D-7096-2013","Suárez, Beatriz/0000-0001-7132-9346; Hernandez, Juan M./0000-0001-6897-5179",,,,,34,16,17,4,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

They impose standard monotonicity, non-degeneracy, and independence axioms, together with either exclusive self-determination (opinions by disqualified persons about qualified persons should not matter) or affirmative self-determination (social decision on who are qualified should coincide with social decision on who should be the qualifiers). Dropping monotonicity (and also non-degeneracy in a result) and considering a more general domain to allow neutral opinions, we characterize a larger family of self-dependent rules that share the important feature of liberalism that qualification of i depends only on i's own opinion about himself or herself.

Also, the aim is to evaluate the potential types and special interest tourism, which have the biggest opportunities for future tourism development. The emphasis in this paper is put on various forms of rural tourism which could be developed jointly with urban tourism, by using a common strategy. Namely, urban tourism in Eastern Croatia has reached a certain development stage, especially in the biggest cities. Even though this area is rich in various attractive natural resources, alongside cultural and historical heritage of high value, the former tourism development was far behind other regions, especially Adriatic region. According to the official tourism data, this region (consisted out of five counties), disposes with modest 0.7% in the total number of Croatia commercial accommodation facilities, and its share of overnight stays 0.5%, which is far below the real potentials. In this paper the reasons of inadequate tourism development are analyzed, the critical evaluation of the development of the existing tourism capacities is provided and the potentials of future tourism development in this region are analyzed. By using the SWOT analysis, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the future urban and rural tourism development in Eastern Croatia are analyzed. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to critically analyze the former tourism development and to provide certain guidelines for its future development in this region. The main hypothesis in this paper is that rural tourism in Eastern Croatia can be successfully developed jointly with urban and other special interest tourism, and that it could be economically sustainable. After the Republic of Croatia joins the EU, new market possibilities will occur, as well as the new sources of financing the development of various forms of rural and urban tourism. This is pointed out in the new Strategy of tourism development in Croatia, in which the rural tourism is treated as one of the strategic directions of tourism development in Croatia. This paper points out the authors. understandings that rural tourism together with urban tourism can be the driver of the total tourism development in Eastern Croatia. For the purpose of this paper the method of deck research was used. All relevant scientific and professional papers by domestic and foreign authors related to the research topic were studied. The results were interpreted by using the methods of comparative analysis, economic analysis and the method of description.","[Bartoluci, Mato; Hendija, Zvjezdana; Budimski, Vanja] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,mbartoluci@efzg.hr; zhendija@efzg.hr; vbudimski@efzg.hr,"Alves, Juliano/GQO-7605-2022; Krajinović, Vanja/AAI-9101-2021","Krajinović, Vanja/0000-0002-8369-3599",,,,,22,1,1,0,9,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,190,200,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400021,0

Much of the success of microfinance has been attributed to attempts to overcome the challenges of information asymmetries in uncollateralized lending. However, very little is known about the optimal contract structure of these loans, and there is substantial variation across lenders, even within a particular setting. This paper exploits a plausibly exogenous change in the liability structure offered by a microfinance program in India, which shifted from individual to group liability lending. We find evidence that the lending model matters: for the same borrower, the required monthly loan installments are 11 percent less likely to be missed under the group liability setting in comparison with individual liability. In addition, compulsory savings deposits are 20 percent less likely to be missed under group liability contracts.","[Carpena, Fenella] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cole, Shawn] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shapiro, Jeremy] McKinsey & Co Inc, New York, NY 10022 USA; [Zia, Bilal] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University; McKinsey & Company; The World Bank,"Zia, B (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC USA.",fenella@econ.berkeley.edu; scole@hbs.edu; jeremypshapiro@gmail.com; bzia@worldbank.org,"Carpena, Fenella/AAR-2497-2021","Carpena, Fenella/0000-0001-6535-4772",,,,,30,16,17,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

More specifically, we analyze and distinguish the type of seasonality around the year that prevails in the case of coal and electricity production of each individual Chinese province. Our results indicate that for the majority of the provinces seasonality is stochastic in both types of energy considered. Our findings provide new evidence of a Lunar New-Year effect in February and Summer as well as Winter effects in coal and electricity production.

Although such preferences are common in many situations (rankings of enterprises, products, sportsmen, political parties, favourite meals, etc.), the theory focused mainly on a group decision making with the one overall criterion (a part of the social choice theory), and ordinal information about multiple criteria was usually converted into cardinal information by Borda-Kendall's method of marks or a similar method. So far, there is no theory of MCDM with strictly ordinal preferences. Hence, the aim of the article is to propose a method for the solution of the MCDM with ordinal preferences based on pair-wise comparisons of all alternatives with regard to each and every criterion and a dominance relation enabling the selection of the best alternative. The proposed approach is natural, computationally simple and can be useful in many areas of human action.

Since investors maximize an expected state-dependent utility function, we analyze stochastic orderings that take into account of possible investors' benchmarks. We begin by analyzing the links among continua stochastic dominance orders, survival and inverse stochastic dominance rules. Then we tie together the consistency-isotonicity of risk and reward multivariate measures with classical orderings and we show how risk/variability multivariate measures are used to obtain non dominated choices. In second analysis we discuss an extension of the classical orderings using probability functionals that satisfy an opportune identity property and the basic rules of the theory of integral stochastic orders. In the discussion we propose several examples that clarify the main developments of the proposed analysis. In particular we describe new multivariate orderings that are consistent with a particular ordering of preferences. We discuss how to better distinguish and classify the multivariate choices using the fractional integral properties. We draw upon a recent classification of risk measures and orderings that is based on the theory of probability metrics. Employing the techniques of probability metrics theory, we then present further extensions and representations of probability functionals which are consistent with classic and dual orderings. Finally, we analyze some potential applications in finance of the new orderings.","[Petronio, Filomena; Tichy, Tomas] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Finance, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Ortobelli, Sergio] Univ Bergen, Dept Mat, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Petronio, F (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Finance, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",filomena.petronio@gmail.com; sergio.ortobelli@unibg.it; tomas.tichy@vsb.cz,"Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020; Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Ortobelli Lozza, Sergio/F-1524-2018","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330;","Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [13-13142S, SP2013/3]; European Regional Development Fund in the IT4 Innovations Centre of Excellence [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0070]; European Social Fund [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296, CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0016]; Italian funds; MIUR PRIN MISURA",Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); European Regional Development Fund in the IT4 Innovations Centre of Excellence; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Italian funds; MIUR PRIN MISURA,"The research was supported through the Czech Science Foundation (GACR) under project 13-13142S and SP2013/3, an SGS research project of VSB-TU Ostrava, and furthermore by the European Regional Development Fund in the IT4 Innovations Centre of Excellence project (CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0070), including the access to the supercomputing capacity, and the European Social Fund in the framework of CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296 (second and third author) and CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0016 (1st author) and the state budget of the Czech Republic.

We seek to understand what trends have emerged in the certain HR practical applications and roles in our region in response to the socio-economic changes. In the research project we examined the HR functions and practical applications of Multinational Company (MNC) subsidiaries in Croatia. Croatia's competitive advantages over other countries in the region are based on developed infrastructure, a highly educated workforce and proximity to raw materials and resources allow. Persistent economic problems still remain and include a rather high labor cost, the slow progress of necessary coordination of economic activities and the government has done very little to improve the situation regarding climate of the foreign direct investments. The Croatian labor force is the second most expensive in the region. In order to avoid competition with countries with low operating costs (Romania and Bulgaria), Croatia should focus on higher value-added sectors and knowledge-intensive activities. Foreign investors report high profitability and quality standard. Croatia's greatest strength is the relatively stable economy and excellent infrastructure. Last but not least, the proven ability of the country that high-tech industries are performing well and there is a high level of engineering and design skills. In Croatian economy employees have extremely good attitude, which includes the low level absenteeism, high levels of motivation, labor productivity and accuracy. As negative factors of Croatian economy include employment of unskilled workers at high costs compared to regional competitors. It should be remembered there is a shortage in the labor market of experienced professionals. Labor taxes are considered relatively high, which is illustrated with a significant difference between net wages and total labor costs of employment. The above findings are the results of our CEEIRT research. We used same questionnaires. The mostly paper-based ones and a small part of the web-survey was supplied via a Web interface.

Managerial approaches were assessed using a 42-item questionnaire based on the EFQM model. The EFQM model recognizes five enabler areas of managerial approaches. Therefore, the theoretical prediction is that five factors will be discovered. However, we discovered nine underlying factors. The factors seem to represent Communication with stakeholders, Leadership, Improvement management, Innovations, Pro-customer motivation of employees, Cash-flow management, Cooperation with partners, Improvement as a priority, and Information security. Thus, we can observe that the initial areas suggested by the EFQM model theory are mapped onto nine empirical factors. The fact that the empirical factors do not exactly correspond to the EFQM areas is no cause for concern, though - for example Quanzi et al. (1998) [Critical factors in quality management and guidlines for selfassessment: The case of Singapore. Total Quality Management, 9, 35-55] indentified 16 empirical factors. It is useful to do factor analysis of managerial approaches for Czech companies, not just to rely on past findings, as we discuss in the paper.","[Vesely, Josef] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Management, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,vesely@fbm.vutbr.cz; stepan.vesely@seznam.cz,,"Vesely, Josef/0000-0001-6491-4168",Specific Research of Brno University of Technology; The Determinants of Management and Marketing Development in Context of Transforming European Union (Standard research) [FP-S-13-2053],Specific Research of Brno University of Technology; The Determinants of Management and Marketing Development in Context of Transforming European Union (Standard research),"Josef Vesely was supported by Specific Research of Brno University of Technology, 2013: The Determinants of Management and Marketing Development in Context of Transforming European Union (Standard research FP-S-13-2053).",,21,0,0,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,986,991,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000167,0

In recent years, the efficiency of inter-bank bond market has been improved, and there is an asymmetric volatility in bond return in SSE bond market.

Other climate variables (e.g., temperature, rainfall, and tornadoes) do not conform to this pattern. A viable explanation is that lightning influences IT diffusion. By causing voltage spikes and dips, a higher frequency of ground strikes leads to damaged digital equipment and thus higher IT user costs. Accordingly, the flash density (strikes per square kilometer per year) should adversely affect the speed of IT diffusion. We find that lightning indeed seems to have slowed IT diffusion, conditional on standard controls. Hence, an increasing macroeconomic sensitivity to lightning may be due to the increasing importance of digital technologies for the growth process.","[Andersen, Thomas Barnebeck] Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark; [Bentzen, Jeanet; Dalgaard, Carl-Johan; Selaya, Pablo] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Copenhagen,"Andersen, TB (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark.",,"Bentzen, Jeanet/JCP-4257-2023; Andersen, Thomas Barnebeck/JNE-6693-2023","Andersen, Thomas Barnebeck/0000-0002-7002-7087; Bentzen, Jeanet Sinding/0000-0003-2099-093X",,,,,36,18,20,1,23,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The empirical results indicate that the asymmetric double exponential jump diffusion performs better than the log-normally distributed jump diffusion and the Black-Scholes model, generally used in previous literature, to fit the single-family mortgage national average of all home prices in the US. Finally, the sensitivity analysis shows that the MI premium is an increasing function of the normal volatility, the mean down-jump magnitudes, the shock frequency of the abnormal bad events, and the asset-liability structure of the mortgage insurer. In particular, the shock frequency of the abnormal bad events has the largest effect of all parameters on the MI premium.

We show that firms that sell products with higher demand choose to establish their plants in larger countries, which provide better access to the most frequently demanded and valuable varieties. The impact of spatial sorting depends on the skewness of the distribution of demand intensity across varieties. In a model in which only capital moves across regions, demand heterogeneity diminishes the amount of capital invested in larger countries. In a model in which the work force moves across regions, demand heterogeneity is found to eliminate dramatic changes in the location patterns and to result in the asymmetric dispersion of workers rather than their symmetric dispersion or complete agglomeration in a specific region.

Our approach, an IV version of the technique devised by Stewart (Rev Econ Stud 50(3):737-753, 1983), is fully parametric and two estimators are proposed: a two-step estimator and a limited-information maximum-likelihood estimator. The results can be summarized as follows: the two-step estimator has an intuitive appeal, and a Monte Carlo experiment suggests that its relative efficiency is rather satisfactory. The limited-information maximum-likelihood estimator, however, is probably simpler to implement and has the advantage of providing a framework in which several testing procedures are more straightforward to perform. The application of two-stage least squares to a proxy of the dependent variable built by taking midpoints, on the other hand, leads to inconsistent estimates; Monte Carlo evidence suggests that the bias arising from the midpoint technique is much worse than the effect of distributional misspecification. An example application is also included, which uses Australian data on migrants' remittances; endogeneity effects are substantial and using conventional estimation methods leads to substantially misleading inference.","[Bettin, Giulia; Lucchetti, Riccardo] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Econ, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Lucchetti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Econ, Ple Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",g.bettin@univpm.it; r.lucchetti@univpm.it,"BETTIN, GIULIA/AAF-4345-2021; Lucchetti, Riccardo/O-9754-2015","BETTIN, GIULIA/0000-0001-6711-0253; Lucchetti, Riccardo/0000-0002-0401-3445",,,,,25,11,15,0,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Not surprisingly, interest in the sector over this period, from both the popular media and public representatives, declined. However, since the start of the downturn in Irelands economic fortunes in late 2007, there has been a renewed interest in the sector. The Irish governments Food Harvest 2020 strategy has set ambitious targets for the expansion of the Irish agricultural fisheries and food sector, but the achievement of these targets will be dependent on overcoming a number of structural and environmental constraints. This paper examines the characteristics of this important indigenous sector in the Irish economy and the major constraints facing it. This study concludes with a discussion on whether or not the agriculture, fisheries and food sector is in a position to contribute to Irelands economic recovery.","[Hynes, Stephen] Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairns Sch Business & Econ, Socioecon Marine Res Unit, Galway, Ireland; [Hennessy, Thia] TEAGASC, Agr Econ & Farm Surveys Dept, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Teagasc,"Hynes, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairns Sch Business & Econ, Socioecon Marine Res Unit, Galway, Ireland.",,,"Hennessy, Thia/0000-0002-6137-1249",,,,,33,8,8,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2012,35.0,10,,,SI,,1340,1358,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01487.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,021MY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309890100009,0

In the single-family residential market, discount brokers offer to list a house for a lower price and thus reduce the transaction costs associated with obtaining a match. In this article we obtain empirical estimates of the price and liquidity impact of a seller selecting a discount broker to market a single-family residential property. The unique data set allows for the identification of residential properties that were listed by a discount brokerage firm. The empirical results confirm the predictions of our theoretical model. Using a sample of 318,221 listings and 243,625 sales, we find that houses listed by discount brokers sell at prices similar to non-discount brokerage listings, but are less likely to sell, and when they do sell, take approximately three days longer to sell. The results indicate that lower transaction costs do not impact housing prices in this market, but that they are related to asset liquidity.","[Rutherford, Ronald] Univ S Florida, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Yavas, Abdullah] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Rutherford, R (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",rrutherford@usf.edu; ayavas@bus.wisc.edu,,,,,,,26,23,29,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2012,40.0,3,,,,,508,535,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2011.00319.x,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,996KV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308086900004,0

We develop a theoretical search model that puts forward the trade off faced by returnees since overseas migration provides an opportunity for human and physical capital accumulation but, at the same time, may lead to a loss of social capital back home. We test the predictions of the model using data from Egypt. We find that, even after controlling for the endogeneity of the temporary migration decision, an overseas returnee is more likely to become an entrepreneur than a non-migrant.

At the same time, a number of important dynamic optimal policy problems in economics are athirst of computing power to help overcome dual curses of complexity and dimensionality. We investigate if computational economics may benefit from new tools on a case study of imperfect information dynamic programming problem with learning and experimentation trade-off, that is, a choice between controlling the policy target and learning system parameters. Specifically, we use a model of active learning and control of a linear autoregression with the unknown slope that appeared in a variety of macroeconomic policy and other contexts. The endogeneity of posterior beliefs makes the problem difficult in that the value function need not be convex and the policy function need not be continuous. This complication makes the problem a suitable target for massively-parallel computation using graphics processors (GPUs). Our findings are cautiously optimistic in that the new tools let us easily achieve a factor of 15 performance gain relative to an implementation targeting single-core processors. Further gains up to a factor of 26 are also achievable but lie behind a learning and experimentation barrier of their own. Drawing upon experience with CUDA programming architecture and GPUs provides general lessons on how to best exploit future trends in parallel computation in economics.","[Morozov, Sergei] Morgan Stanley, New York, NY USA; [Mathur, Sudhanshu] Deutshe Bank, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Morgan Stanley,"Morozov, S (通讯作者)，Morgan Stanley, New York, NY USA.",Sergei.Morozov@morganstanley.com; Mathur.Sudhanshu@gmail.com,,,,,,,75,9,9,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Consumers are assumed to explicitly consider driving inconvenience in the choice of vehicle sizes, and the resulting commuting cost is a function of residential density. This vehicle-type choice problem is embedded in an otherwise standardmonocentric city model. A convenience-related advantage in less-dense areas makes our bid-rent curve flatter than that in the standard model. Comparative static analyses suggest that an increase in commuting cost per mile, especially from increasedunit cost of driving inconvenience, may induce spatial expansion of the city. Since driving inconvenience is lower in less-dense suburbs, the increased unit cost of driving inconvenience pulls people toward suburbs, potentially leading to urban sprawl. Part of comparative static analysis shows how the city's vehicle fuel efficiency depends on the city characteristics such as population and agricultural rent. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Cyclists' value of travel time savings turns out to be high, considerably higher than the value of time savings on alternative modes. Cyclists also value other improvements highly, such as separated bicycle lanes. As to additional benefits of cycling improvements in the form of health and reduced car traffic, our results do not support the notion that these will be a significant part in a cost-benefit analysis. Bicyclists seem to take health largely into account when making their travel choices, implying that it would be double-counting to add total health benefits to the analysis once the consumer surplus has been correctly calculated. As to reductions in car traffic, our results indicate that the cross-elasticity between car and cycle is low, and hence benefits from traffic reductions will be small. However, the valuations of improved cycling speeds and comfort are so high that it seems likely that improvements for cyclists are cost-effective compared to many other types of investments, without having to invoke second-order, indirect effects. In other words, our results suggest that bicycle should be viewed as a competitive mode of travel and not primarily as a means to achieve improved health or reduced car traffic.

The research utilises data on such measures that are available from Global Trade Alert, combined with bilateral FDI data between OECD countries and a large number of partner countries for 2006 to 2009. This allows us to examine the short-run effect that protectionist measures may have had on bilateral FDI flows. The verdict from this analysis is clear: a country that implements new protectionist measures may expect that this may result in lower foreign direct investment inflows into the economy. The point estimates from our preferred specifications suggest that, depending on the empirical model, the implementation of a trade protection measure is associated with about 40 to 80 per cent lower FDI inflows. Trade protection does not appear to have any implications for the countrys FDI outflows, however. The negative effect on FDI inflows does not appear to be due to direct investment measures but rather to actions related to intellectual property rights protection and other more trade-related measures.","[Goerg, Holger] Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Goerg, Holger] CEPR, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Görg, H (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",,,,,,,,12,4,5,3,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2012,35.0,5,,,,,525,544,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01439.x,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,936NV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303598200001,0

These two groups grew rapidly both in the total labor force and among the self-employed in Atlanta. It is found that living in central city and inner-ring suburbs depresses Latino immigrants' entrepreneurial activities. The growth of trade jobs and concentration of immigrants in a local area both give rise to immigrant entrepreneurship. Results suggest that traditional theories such as disadvantage theory need to be reassessed in the context of new immigrant gateways, while the ethnic enclave hypothesis is still validated.

Although these variables may be unit-root non-stationary, there exists a nonlinear combination of them that takes account of such non-stationarity. We then introduce an estimation technique that allows us to test for the presence of this generalized cointegration in the absence of knowledge as to the true nonlinear functional form and the full set of regressors. We outline the basic stages of the technique and discuss how the issue of unit-root non-stationarity and cointegration affects each stage of the estimation procedure. We then apply this technique to the relationship between health expenditure and health outcomes, which is an important but controversial issue. A number of studies have found very little or no relationship between the level of health expenditure and outcomes. In econometric terms, if there is such a relationship, then there should exist a cointegrating relationship between these two variables and possibly many others. The problem that arises is that we may be either unable to measure these other variables or that we do not know about them, in which case we may incorrectly find no relationship between health expenditures and outcomes. We then apply the concept of generalized cointegration; we obtain a highly significant relationship between health expenditure and health outcomes.","[Hall, Stephen G.] Univ Leicester, Bank Greece, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; NIESR, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Swamy, P.

We perform the estimations by allowing for a break in monetary policy at the time of Volcker's appointment as chairman. This enables us to capture changes in the monetary policy regime introduced by Volcker during the VolckerGreenspan period. We find support for the assumption that monetary policy in the VolckerGreenspan period performed optimally under commitment. Our estimation strategy allows us to estimate the preferences of the US Federal Reserve in the VolckerGreenspan period, where the main objective of policy appears to be inflation, followed by interest rate stabilization, output growth and interest rate smoothing. We find that the Great Moderation of output growth is explained by a combination of two factors: the decrease in the volatility of the structural shocks and the improved monetary policy conduct. Inflation Stabilization, however, is mainly due to the change in monetary policy that took place at the beginning of Volcker's mandate.

This process developed in parallel to the growing market integration of goods and factors as a result of the liberal reforms and the construction of the railway network, with the subsequent fall in transport costs. In that period, there were major changes in the pattern of industrial location across Spain, with an increasing spatial concentration of industrial activities between the 18505 and the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) and a deeper regional specialisation. What were the forces behind these changes? On the theoretical side, the Heckscher-Ohlin model suggests that the spatial distribution of economic activity is determined by comparative advantage due to factor endowments. In turn, New Economic Geography models show the existence of a bell-shaped relationship between the process of market integration and the degree of concentration of industrial activity in the territory. This paper examines empirically the determinants of industrial location in Spain between 1856 and 1929 estimating a model that nests both Heckscher-Ohlin and NEC factors and tests the relative strength of these forces, since they are not mutually exclusive and might be at work simultaneously. The analysis of the results shows that both comparative advantage and NEC-type mechanisms were determinant drivers of industrial location in Spain, although their relative strength changed over time.

Many anomalies have been found in different contexts. This finding leads to a divergence between normative and descriptive analyses. There are several ways of facing this problem. In this paper we argue in favour of debiasing observed choices in such a way that the true preferences are discovered. Our procedure is based on quantitative corrections derived from assuming the descriptive validity of prospect theory and the normative validity of expected utility theory. Those corrective formulas were first applied by Bleichrodt et al. (Manag Sci 47:1498-1514, 2001). We explain here how such formulas can be used to avoid inefficient allocation of health care resources. This approach shares the philosophy of libertarian paternalism (LP). However, it reduces some of the potential problems of LP: the definition of error (and the need to nudge people) is more clear and objective. In this sense, it reduces the chances that the regulator tries to nudge people toward behaviour based on her preferences rather than those of the people she is nudging.","[Pinto-Prades, Jose-Luis] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain; [Abellan-Perpinan, Jose-Maria] Univ Murcia, Dept Appl Econ, Murcia, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; University of Murcia,"Pinto-Prades, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain.",jlpinto@upo.es; dionisos@um.es,"Perpiñan, Jose Maria Abellan/B-8166-2009; prades, jose luis pinto/AGJ-9700-2022; PERPIÑAN, JOSE MARIA ABELLAN/AAB-6483-2019; prades, jose luis pinto/B-7069-2008","prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410",,,,,49,10,13,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2012,38.0,4,,,,,569,584,,10.1007/s00355-012-0655-5,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,918PI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302262200002,0

In this model, the share of intra-industry trade (IIT) in bilateral trade volume decreases as trading partners become more different in terms of the industry distribution of labour productivity. We show that this relationship is a special case of a general accounting identity: the intensity of IIT is decreasing in a specialisation index. The specialisation index is equal to the difference in the industry distribution of labour productivity in our CournotRicardo model, while it is equal to the difference in factor endowments in the well-known monopolistic competition model. As both technologies and factor endowments would play important roles in shaping specialisation patterns, we conjecture that the share of IIT is decreasing in both measures of specialisation. Using the data from Nicita and Olarreaga, we test this conjecture. Our pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) estimations strongly support this conjecture. However, in fixed-effect panel estimations, only the industry distribution of productivity is significant in the entire sample. Subdividing the sample, we find that the difference in the industry distribution of productivity is significant in explaining NorthNorth IIT, while the difference in factor endowments is significant in explaining NorthSouth IIT.","[Song, E.

The aim of this study was to examine these relationships and to try to find a level of GDP, which provides for sustainable economic activity, optimal happiness and healthy levels of mean body mass index (BMI). Spline regression analyses were conducted using national indices from 175 countries: GDP, adult BMI, mean happiness scores, and carbon footprint per capita for the year 2007. Results showed that GDP was positively related to BMI and happiness up to similar to$US3000 and similar to$5000 per capita respectively, with no significant relationships beyond these levels. GDP was also positively related to CO2 emissions with a recognised sustainable carbon footprint of less than 5 tonnes per capita occurring at a GDP of <$US15,000. These findings show that a GDP between $US5 and $15,000 is associated with greater population happiness and environmental stability. A mean BMI of 21-23 kg/m(2), which minimises the prevalence of underweight and overweight in the population then helps to define an ideal position in relation to growth, which few countries appear to have obtained. Within a group of wealthy countries (GDP > $US30,000), those with lower income inequalities and more regulated (less liberal) market systems had lower mean BMIs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Due to favorable horizon effects in risk and return, the allocation to real estate in a portfolio with stocks, bonds and cash increases strongly with the investment horizon. Examining the relative importance of return predictability, transaction costs and marketing period risk for the optimal allocation to real estate, the article finds that the consideration of return predictability is very important, except for short-term horizons. Accounting for transaction costs is crucial for short- and medium-term investors. Marketing period risk appears to be negligible.

Since the economies have bureaucratic structures that cause delays, we introduce in the equations a mathematical memory formalism represented by a derivative of fractional order, which leads to a system of integro-differential equations. The solution of the equations in the Laplace domain is presented as solution of a set of m linear equations in the Laplace Transform (LT) of the yi(t). It is found that the asymptotic values of the state of evolutions of the economies are equal. The case of a system of two economies with different memories is then considered obtaining their evolutions in the time domain expressed as simple monotonically decreasing closed form functions.

Simulating the impact response of fruits has an important role in prediction of the characteristics of impact as required in the estimation both of their mechanical injuries and their correlation with fruit ripeness degree. In this paper we develop a mathematical model of response to the impact of fruits in the form of differential equations based on the assimilation assumption of fruits, with rheological Kelvin - Voight linear viscoelastic bodies. The numerical integration of the differential equation of simulation it was made, applying the Runge - Kutta method, using a program developed in Turbo - Pascal by the authors. For integration were considered the mechanical characteristics for 3 local apples varieties determined by our own experiments. Were determined the force - time and force - deformation curves during the impact. These curves which simulated the real curves, obtained from experiments and known both in the scientific literature, being similar to them, and witch are obtained in our experiments for 3 varieties of apples: Jonathan, Golden Delicious and Idared. It was tested and comparing the estimated values by simulating and measured at experiments for the most important impact characteristics - the peak force, ascertaining the insignificant differences between them. Knowledge of these curves allows to obtain the Fmax at impact, which are necessary to evaluation the rank of injury of apples and/or the functional and structure parameters of various mechanical systems, from the post harvest operations chain. Also, these characteristics can be correlated with the degree of ripeness of the fruits, proper used in some sorting systems implementation.","[Casandroiu, T.; Stan, G.

It is believed that when spatial distance between employees increases, their frequency of communications decreased drastically. Furthermore, some studies found that people liked to interact more in private individual workspaces than in semi-public and public areas of any office setting. The possibility of working as a team could increase by rising the possibility of interacting with other employees. Teamwork can also improve the exchange of information, retention of data and in turn lead to higher productivity. The aim of this paper is the investigation of two important variables of workplace layout and their impacts on productivity based on the level of face to face interaction in the workplace. In this paper, the variables used to improve the possibility of communication and ease of interaction within the work area category are proximity and privacy. This study was conducted on relatively two large companies in Iran. The engineering and technical staffs of the two companies were given a self-report survey that measured each of the study variables. They received the questionnaire that includes the measures of each of the key variables. Some of these measures were taken from a survey created for a large corporation, and others were established measures from the organizational literature. SPSS statistics and space syntax were used to analyze the data. The results indicate that the proximity between the two staffs is highly positively correlated with productivity. However, this study found no significant correlation between the variable privacy and productivity. The study highlights the importance of workplace productivity and manipulating interaction as a measurement for productivity in the office space and helps designers, scholars and managers to better understanding the role of these factors through workplace setting design.","[Chaboki, Hossein Motamed; Wahab, Ahmad Fauzi A.] Univ Technol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm, Skudai, Malaysia; [Ansari, Majid] Univ Technol Malaysia, Fac Human Resource Management, Skudai, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Chaboki, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm, Skudai, Malaysia.",,"Ansari, Majid/IXD-7016-2023",,,,,,23,0,0,0,9,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,461,+,,,,,,3,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600040,0

A structural change is found around March 2008 in the pairwise dynamic correlations between the prices in a multivariate GARCH model. A structural VAR (SVAR) model is then estimated on two subsamples, one before and one after the identified change point. Using the novel method of identification through heteroscedasticity, we exploit the time-varying price volatilities to fully identify the SVAR model. In the more recent period, ethanol, gasoline, and corn prices are found to be more closely linked with a strengthened corn-ethanol relation, which can be explained by the new developments of the biofuel industry and related policy instruments. Variance decomposition shows that for each market a significant and relatively large share of the price variation could be explained by the price changes in the other two markets. The results are robust to the inclusion of seasonal dummies and various representative macroeconomic and financial indicators.","[Du, Xiaodong] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [McPhail, Lihong Lu] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Du, XD (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 405 Taylor Hall,427 Lorch St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",xdu23@wisc.edu; lmcphail@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,39,58,61,0,30,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2012,33.0,2,,,,,171,194,,10.5547/01956574.33.2.8,0.0,,,24,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,916OE,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302112300008,0

The beginning of Belje dates back to 1697th year when Prince Eugene of Savoy, for his many military successes, especially for the victory over the Turks at Senta, received a feudal estate as a gift from the Austrian Emperor Leopold I which he called Bilje (the Hungarian pronunciation of the village, Bellye). For centuries, Belje has been and still is the mainstay of the development of Baranja. This paper will focus particularly on the development of Belje and Baranja, since Agrokor's entering as a majority owner, and on many capital investments that were carried out during this period, which greatly helped the development of Baranja. Entering Agrokor concern on 21st March 2005, Belje builds its future within the largest food manufacturer in this part of Europe. Agrokor connects all companies in the concern into a unique managing, financial and business system. This way the strategic position and development of Baranja and Belje were influenced, while exploiting all the synergies and other potentials in order to achieve maximum results, winning market positions in Croatia and abroad, ensuring full employment, utilization of production capacity, achieving maximum revenue and profit for both the Belje, and for the region where the company gravitates. Introducing the world's most advanced technology, Belje also follows the trend of organic food production, environmental standards and is completely market oriented. As it can be seen from the title of the paper, the purpose of the research is to determine the effect of a large company like Belje d.d. on the development of a region, in this case, Baranja. The primary method of the research is analysis, with emphasis on the analysis of the impact of the development of Belje, primarily towards Baranja. Years after Agrokor's entering were marked by significant investments, new pig and cattle farms, new crops, new livestock products factory, Vina Belje wine complex, complete renovation of agricultural machinery ...

IV Methods to Reduce Measurement Error Bias, with an Application to Vietnam",WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EARNINGS; DYNAMICS,"Research on economic growth and inequality inevitably raises issues concerning economic mobility because the relationship between long-run inequality and short-run inequality is mediated by income mobility; for a given level of short-run inequality, greater mobility implies lower long-run inequality. But empirical measures of both inequality and mobility tend to be biased upward due to measurement error in income and expenditure data collected from household surveys. This paper examines how to reduce or remove this bias using instrumental variable methods, and provides conditions that instrumental variables must satisfy to provide consistent estimates. This approach is applied to panel data from Vietnam. The results imply that at least 15 percent, and perhaps as much as 42 percent, of measured mobility is upward bias due to measurement error. The results also suggest that measurement error accounts for at least 12 percent of measured inequality.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Glewwe, P (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",pglewwe@umn.edu,,,,,,,26,13,14,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

The aim of this work is to show how the architecture of payment systems (payment instruments, processing, participants and etc) influence to payment industry (microeconomic approach) and for the role of central bank in payment systems (macroeconomic -public approach). We use the method of qualitative analyse, not empirical measures. Central banks, as issuers of money, have always had a keen interest in the smooth functioning of the national payment system and the way it affects the economy. Their involvement has, however, evolved over time, as central banks have increasingly taken on a prominent role in the pursuit of the public good of maintaining trust in the currency and ensuring its smooth circulation. Consequently, their involvement in payment, clearing and settlement has changed. Also, the aim of this work is to paint a broad-brush picture of the economic links between central banks and payments in the present and the future. We research contemporary trends that affecting the role of the central bank, and trends in the future. In the work we offer some ideas about the future direction of payments and central bank involvement in payment systems.

By considering attitudes towards the death penalty, it identifies different strands of thought in the Russian elite, and argues that an assertive Europeanism is now dominant as Russia seeks to be an equal participant in the development of common norms. However, there is a tendency for Russia's 'Europeanness' to be questioned because of behaviour that is considered out of step with European Union standards. I argue that even in an area of significant controversy between Russia and other European states, self-determination for national minorities, there is potential for the delineation of common principles, but only as an inclusive process on the basis of consensus.","Univ Otago, Dept Polit, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Headley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Polit, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",jim.headley@otago.ac.nz,,,,,,,53,16,16,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,3,,,SI,,427,447,,10.1080/09668136.2012.661924,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,943ZT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304167900003,0

This has important implications for the extent to which developing countries remain governed by the institutional and ideological imperatives of development. Optimists suggest that this could herald a new era of sovereignty that enables African countries to take fuller control of their governance and development priorities, including a shift towards a 'southern consensus' around structural transformation, whilst pessimists argue that the hegemony of orthodox development ideas has only been partially reordered and that new problems of sovereignty are now emerging. Insights from Uganda suggest that both of these scenarios are currently unfolding, leaving the outcomes uncertain and much to play for. What remains of the 'good governance' agenda has yet to adapt itself to this new politics of development, which requires the emergence of new forms of developmental state in Africa.","Univ Manchester, Effect States & Inclus Dev ESID Res Ctr, IDPM, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Hickey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Effect States & Inclus Dev ESID Res Ctr, IDPM, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Sam.Hickey@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,18,23,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Life insurance, although with long history, has made its break through just in modern days, as a product of long development in which main development forces are the need for economic protection from risks, in one hand, and economic benefits from life insurance in other. Life insurance is an agreement in witch the insurance company obligates to pay certain amount of money (based on paid insurance amount) to an insured person (beneficiary) or person pointed by the insured person contingent beneficiary, in case of death or in case of reaching some age. Life insurance is applying to all insurances in which death in one or more persons brings a payment of agreed amount of money by the insurance company. Life insurance includes all types of insurances which cover from risks for life or health of a person: life insurance, rent insurance, tontine insurance, additional insurance with life insurance, insurance from accidents, voluntarily pension insurance, voluntarily-private health insurance etc. Life insurance has a central spot in insurance market. It is a specific form of insurance which successfully combines insurance and saving. Life insurance is specific financial activity, interesting not only for insurance company and insured person, but the whole economy and society in general. Today, in modern trade terms of living and working, when global economy crisis is deeply eroding every economy, life insurance measures a light increase in global and domestic market in Macedonia.

Investment funds are financial institutions which have a particularly important role in capital markets in many countries and they have become major players affecting numerous events both inside and outside financial markets. The analysis of the participation of investment funds shows that their presence and circulation by regions is different. Namely, they are present in the U. S. and in Europe to a great extent, followed by Africa and Asia. In recent years, we have seen a trend of increased investment in investment funds in transition economies, as opposed to classical saving (9.4 billion U. S. $ in Poland, 4.2 billion U. S. $ in the Czech Republic, 4.1 billion U. S. $ in Hungary and 1.4 billion U. S. $ in Slovakia). Investment funds in the financial system of the Republic of Macedonia were established in 2000 with the Investment Funds Act. In fact, due to the movement of stock exchange, which has had downward trend since 2007, the postponement of Macedonia's entry into NATO, and the global economic crisis, the functioning of investment funds has shown changeable trends of declining growth in the number of shares issued, net assets value of funds, and the price of shares. This paper will present statistical analyses of the functioning of three investment funds in Macedonia in terms of changing environment as a result of the movements in the overall economy, and will offer some directions and measures for their improvement.","[Mojsoska, Snezana; Gerasimoski, Sase] Univ St Kliment Ohridski Bitola, Fac Secur, Skopje 1000, Macedonia",St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola,,smojsoska@gmail.com,"mojsoska, snezana/C-8214-2014","mojsoska, snezana/0000-0002-2220-0703",,,,,2,1,1,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1877-0428,,,PROCD SOC BEHV,,,2012,44.0,,,,,,446,452,,10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.049,0.0,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BDQ20,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314406100049,0

While it is often argued that higher education plays a lead role in training and educating communities, industries and societies toward sustainability cause, often times the enhancement of human capital within higher education itself seems to be ignored. In order to create constructive relationships between the entity of higher education and the industries and communities it is in touch with -thus culminating in the development of the human capital, higher education must therefore adopt initiatives that aspire to develop its human capital toward sustainability. This concept is currently more vital as the economic productivity and services are being increasingly based on knowledge-intensive activities that rely more on intellectual capabilities than on physical inputs or natural resources. Higher levels of education are necessary for greener and more sustainable jobs. The human capital trained through higher education can increase productivity, help achieve MDGs more quickly and raise standards of living. Therefore, this paper examines and argues the ways in which human capital in higher education sectors (encompassing both administrative and academic staffs) can be trained and developed in terms of knowledge production, dissemination and technology transfer to ensure the inclusivity and progress of the economic growth. This process would also enable the higher education sector to extend its sustainability outreach activities in developing human capital beyond its borders. For this reason, some of the most important elements in developing knowledge-based human capital in higher education sectors such as personnel selection, developing university-industry relations, motivation, indicators, leadership and management policies, codes and auditing will be further discussed in this paper.","[Nor, Norizan Md; Khelghat-Doost, Hamoon; Jegatesen, Govindran] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Global Sustainabil Studies, Georgetown, Pulau Penang, Malaysia; [Baseri, Laleh Etminan] Univ Sains Malaysia, Grad Sch Business, Georgetown, Pulau Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Nor, NM (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Global Sustainabil Studies, Georgetown, Pulau Penang, Malaysia.",,"Khelghat-Doost, Hamoon/N-7516-2019",,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,275,+,,,,,,3,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600025,0

The failure of projects may be due partly to overlooking these issues. In this study within a single organization an exploratory framework was developed to research relations between group dynamics (team mindfulness, safety, learning and defensive behaviour, complexity of projects and the outcomes of team performance.

Information derived from travel census studies, in contrast, covers the entire population of a specific study area of interest. In such cases where reliable historical data exist, statistical methodology may serve as a flexible alternative to traditional travel demand models by incorporating estimation of trip-generation, trip-attraction and trip-distribution in one model. In this research, a statistical Bayesian approach on OD matrix estimation is presented, where modeling of OD flows derived from census data, is related only to a set of general explanatory variables. A Poisson and a negative binomial model are formulated in detail, while emphasis is placed on the hierarchical Poisson-gamma structure of the latter. Problems related to the absence of closed-form expressions are bypassed with the use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method known as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methodology is tested on a realistic application area concerning the Belgian region of Flanders on the level of municipalities. Model comparison indicates that negative binomial likelihood is a more suitable distributional assumption than Poisson likelihood, due to the great degree of overdispersion present in OD flows. Finally, several predictive goodness-of-fit tests on the negative binomial model suggest a good overall fit to the data. In general, Bayesian methodology reduces the overall uncertainty of the estimates by delivering posterior distributions for the parameters of scientific interest as well as predictive distributions for future OD flows.

Strategies aimed at poverty reduction need to identify factors that are strongly associated with poverty and agreeable to modification by policy action. This study uses the integrated Household Survey (2009-10) data collected by the Federal Bureau of Statistics in Pakistan to examine probable determinants of poverty status, employing the Polychotomous discrete choice model for poverty modeling. In general, this study tries to seek out the factors like demographic and human capital variables that account for poverty differentials and craft a difference in rural-urban poverty concentrations, with an emphasis on unusually prominent education-deprived bands of poor households. The demographic variables show significant impact on poverty status of the households, especially dependency ratio, the sex of the head of the household, family types and household sizes. These factors all are found to be of supreme importance in defining poverty with feeble discrepancies discovered between rural and urban regions. The educational attainment of the head of the household is found to be a very important factor that is associated with poverty. If policy makers target the elevation of education levels of the head of households in order to get rid of the vicious circle of poverty, for given transitory bands of poor households as a specific policy, then it might become an established tool for more effective, powerful and sustainable efforts of poverty erradication.","[Riaz, Madiha] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,,"Riaz, Madiha/L-3627-2019; Riaz, Madiha/HTR-1440-2023; riaz, madiha/N-1244-2019",,,,,,27,0,0,0,3,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,581,594,,,,,,14,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600050,0

Rewards versus charges for a congested bottleneck,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Traffic congestion; Road pricing; Subsidies; Rewards; Bottleneck model,,"This paper analyzes the possibilities to relieve traffic congestion using subsidies instead of Pigouvian taxes, as well as revenue-neutral combinations of rewards and taxes ('feebates'). The model considers a Vickrey-ADL model of bottleneck congestion with endogenous scheduling. With inelastic demand, a fine (time-varying) reward is found to be equivalent to a fine toll, and to a continuum of combinations of time-varying tolls and rewards, including fine feebates. When demand is price-sensitive, a reward becomes less attractive from the efficiency viewpoint, because it attracts additional users to the congested bottleneck. As a result, both the second-best optimal fraction of rewarded travelers in the scheme, and the relative efficiency that can be achieved with it, decrease when demand becomes more elastic. Our analytical and simulation results for coarse schemes reveal that a coarse reward is less effective than a coarse feebate, which is itself less effective than a coarse toll. The most efficient coarse system is the step toll, which is also allowed to be positive in the fringes of the peak. Despite the smaller efficiency gains, rewards and feebates may be attractive to use in circumstances where public and political acceptability of tolling is especially low, so that its implementation is unlikely, including the temporary use of price incentives in case of road works and large-scale events.

Over the last decade, and again after the onset of the financial crisis, tax havens have come under sustained pressure from powerful developed states and the international organisations they dominate. Despite their diminutive geographic and power profile, the havens have shown a puzzling resilience. Although like other economies havens have suffered from the financial crisis, they have nevertheless confounded predictions of decline premised on their purported vulnerability to discriminatory financial regulations imposed from onshore. This article explains the continued growth in offshore finance by the rise of new developing country markets. More broadly, the increasing availability of alternative markets means that G7 states are losing the crucial leverage they previously enjoyed by threatening to close their markets.

First, we revise the basic existing ANN architectures for time series forecasting and describe their application on CZK/EUR exchange rate prediction. Next, we introduce a hybrid version of the ANN that builds upon the same network strategy but tries to enhance the prediction accuracy by first decomposing the signal into individual frequency bands and then training the perceptron parameters on each frequency band separately. The time-frequency signal analysis is obtained using discrete wavelet transform. Different signal segments in various levels of decomposition are reconstructed separately. The resulting signals (in time domain again) are samples for ANNs as above. Finally, we compare the accuracy of the hybrid approach to that of the traditional ANN setting for the case of CZK/EUR exchange rate data.","[Sindelarova, Irena] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,isin@vse.cz,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,4,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,875,878,,,,,,4,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900150,0

Balance of payment indicates real economic condition of a country; in fact, countries with positive pay balance are sufficient and otherwise. Countries can reduce their negative balance of payment and also convert it into positive with incomes realized on trade in logistic services. It must be considered that effects of logistic services on balance of payment are hard to determine because of the complexity of logistic industry as well as lack of necessary data, and there is a need to mark all those elements that can not be calculated in logistic services trade balance.

Two alternatives are considered: norms and interests. Norms underlying the EU's stance include its belief in multilateralism, sustainable development and the precautionary principle. Interests comprise economic opportunities and the climate changesecurity nexus. It is argued here that the normative orientation has dominated the EU's leading by example strategy in global negotiations. In Copenhagen, it yielded little influence as it was insufficiently geared towards the context of the negotiations. This challenges the notion of normative power Europe and makes a review of the Union's external climate policy necessary.","[Schunz, Simon] Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Van Schaik, L (通讯作者)，Clingendael Inst, POB 93080, NL-2509 AB The Hague, Netherlands.",lschaik@clingendael.nl,,"Schunz, Simon/0000-0001-7794-004X",,,,,46,84,87,1,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The rise of job polarisation and income inequality coincides with a long period of macroeconomic stagnation, both continuing through to the present (with the exception of a brief period of strong growth and declining inequality in the second half of the 1990s). The corporate scramble to restore profit rates after the crisis of Fordism has transformed the institutional configuration of the political economy. In particular, institutions supporting upward mobility and middle-class incomes in the economy have been eroded by the twin forces of internationalisation (leading to the re-emergence of wage-based competition) and employment externalisation (outsourcing, downsizing, antiunionism, etc). The current growth regime, which may be characterised as Waltonist, based on the Wal-Mart model of buyer-driven global supply chains focused on cutthroat wage-based competition and deunionisation, is not transitional but rather embedded in apparently long-term institutional settlements that amount to a dysfunctional regime.","Kings Coll London, Dept Management, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Vidal, M (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Management, Franklin Wilkins Bldg,150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",matt.vidal@kcl.ac.uk,"Vidal, Matt/M-8841-2015",,,,,,61,9,10,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Especially with the emergence of distribution center and continuous business expansion of joint distribution business, more uncertainties arise in distribution center. If more orders come to the distribution center while relevant service workers and equipment are allocated insufficiently, then orders will be piled up constantly and under extreme conditions, orders to be handled will be increased limitlessly; if more personnel and equipment are allocated for prompt delivery of goods indiscriminately, then the work efficiency of distribution center will be lowered. In this paper the changes in the quantities of the goods that have been distributed for shipment (referred to as goods to be shipped) and vehicles are studied using the stochastic process theory by analyzing a series of stochastic variable of each key status in the distribution process, and a one-step transition probability matrix that describes the change in the quantity of the goods to be shipped in the center before departure of vehicles is constructed. According to the Markov chain and properties of generating function, assuming that order arrival is subject to Poisson distribution, we can induce the sufficient conditions and necessary conditions ensuring the distribution center are under flexible operation status. It is thought that if the mean value of the interval time at which the two adjacent vehicles in sequence leave the center is guaranteed to be less than the ratio of the maximum loading capacity of the vehicles to the intensity of order arrival at the center, then the quantity of the goods to be shipped will not be increased limitlessly. Reduction of waiting time for goods or vehicles can raise work efficiency of the center and achieve the timeliness of goods delivery.","[Yu, Sun] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sch Econ &Management, Shanghai 200135, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University,,xiaojun4@sh163.net,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,HONG KONG EDUCATION SOC,TSEUNG KWAN O,"FLAT 16E BLOCK 3 THE PINNACLE, 8 WANG HANG RD, TSEUNG KWAN O, NEW TERRITORIES 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-988-19750-3-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,686,692,,,,,,7,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BET96,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318122400122,0

It compares German and US FDI in the automotive and chemical industry. The article shows that FDI is influenced by labour standards (in particular protection against dismissals) and industrial relations factors and can be a social dumping mechanism. There are, however, differences according to the industries and the home countries of the investors. US companies try to avoid coordinated collective bargaining, while German companies consider government intervention in collective bargaining negative.

The core argument is that nuclear power was brought to Japan as a consequence of US hegemony. Rather than a simple manifestation of one state exerting material 'power over' another, bringing nuclear power to Japan involved a series of compromises worked out within and between state and civil society in both Japan and the USA. Ideologies of nationalism, imperialism and modernity underpinned the process, coalescing in post-war debates about the future trajectory of Japanese society, Japan's Cold War alliance with the USA and the role of nuclear power in both. Consent to nuclear power was secured through the generation of a psychological state in the public mind combining the fear of nuclear attack and the hope of unlimited consumption in a nuclear-fuelled post-modern world.","Univ Warwick, PAIS, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Kelly, D (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, PAIS, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",dominic.kelly@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,127,2,4,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Furthermore, it investigates the source of Monnet's power and influence, which helped to persuade various leaders at different times. By adopting a transnational network approach, it concludes that policy-makers' acceptance of the coal and steel plan was the result of Monnet's special method of persuasion, developed and refined over the years, and the activity of and pressure exerted by his close network of influential transatlantic friends.","[Chira-Pascanut, Constantin] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Chira-Pascanut, C (通讯作者)，50 Ave Grands Prix, B-1150 Brussels, Belgium.",chirac@uvic.ca,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using an OLG (Overlapping Generations) model in which agents have heterogeneous preferences and investment horizons, with transaction costs, short term investors are more sensitive to changes in economic fundamentals and are less likely to own (and trade) in a declining market. The model predicts that the ownership composition contains information about current and future house prices and trading dynamics.

However, context factors are not per se stable; they tend to vary over time which is particularly relevant during economic cycles. In Germany, for instance, the rapid economic downturn of 2008/2009 was preceded by a period of growth and followed by an economic upswing in many regions. However, the impact of this crisis on entrepreneurship has not been empirically studied comprehensively. Using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), we analyse entrepreneurial activities in the 39 German NUTS2 regions covering a 13-year period before, during and after the Great Recession of 2008/2009. Applying multilevel regression techniques, we hypothesize that both space and time matter for individual entrepreneurial behaviour. Our results show, first, that space and time can be regarded as two interrelated dimensions that jointly impact entrepreneurial activities. Second, similar individual attributes are associated with diverging likelihoods of becoming an entrepreneur in case individuals are nested in different regions or different time periods and are thus exposed to dissimilar context conditions. Third, the type and number of individual, context and interaction effects are motive-related, i.e. they depend on whether the entrepreneurial action is either opportunity-driven or necessity-driven.","[Hundt, Christian] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Geog, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Sternberg, Rolf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum; Leibniz University Hannover,"Hundt, C (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Geog, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",christian.hundt@ruhr-uni-bochum.de; sternberg@wigeo.uni-hannover.de,,"Hundt, Christian/0000-0002-5202-830X",,,,,87,15,15,0,28,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Thus, our research is concerned with the perception of paternalism by those who are directly affected by it, rather than with the justifiability of paternalism from an ethical perspective. We find that the prot,g,s punish a paternalist restricting their freedom of choice. Yet, this negative reaction is not based on principled grounds because, with the wisdom of hindsight, the prot,g,s punish the paternalist only if the restriction makes them worse off. Conversely, if the restriction makes them better off, the prot,g,s on average do not punish and, sometimes, they even reward the paternalist. This suggests that the prot,g,s take predominantly a consequentialist stand on paternalism.

As emphasised in the literature, the observed consumption drop might be due to unexpected wealth shocks at retirement which modify optimal consumption plans. Using an Euler equation approach, we test the impact of unexpected retirement on the consumption patterns of individuals around the age of retirement by using the panel component of the Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW). This dataset contains information on the expected age of retirement which can be used to distinguish between expected and unexpected retirement. Furthermore, we investigate the heterogeneous behaviour of individuals with different levels of education and wealth. We find evidence of a consumption drop at retirement especially for low educated people and individuals with little wealth. The consumption drop at retirement, on average, does not seem to be a response to unexpected retirement. Disaggregating our sample, we find that the consumption drop persists among low educated people with little wealth available, irrespective of whether retirement was expected or not. Highly educated people, conversely, do smooth their consumption, unless they have low wealth and are hit by an unexpected shock at retirement in which case they are forced to drop consumption.","[Borella, Margherita; Moscarola, Flavia Coda] Univ Turin, CeRP Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy; [Borella, Margherita; Rossi, Mariacristina] NETSPAR, Turin, Italy; [Rossi, Mariacristina] Univ Turin, CeRP Coll Carlo Alberto CEPS Instead, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; University of Turin,"Borella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, CeRP Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy.",margherita.borella@unito.it; flavia.codamoscarola@carloalberto.org; mariacristina.rossi@unito.it,"Coda Moscarola, Flavia/GXA-2744-2022","Coda Moscarola, Flavia/0000-0003-0740-7471; BORELLA, Margherita/0000-0001-7514-9203",,,,,19,5,5,1,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The empirical analysis is based on a panel survey of males from the 2006 and 2008 rounds of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP). The paper develops a behavioral model of the belief-risky behavior relationship and estimates the causal effect of beliefs on risky behavior using the Arellano and Carrasco (2003) semiparametric panel data estimator, which accommodates both unobserved heterogeneity and belief endogeneity arising from a possible dependence of current beliefs on past risky behavior. Results show that downward revisions in the belief assigned to being HIV positive increase risky behavior and upward revisions decrease it. For example, based on a linear specification, a decrease in the perceived probability of being HIV positive from 10 to 0 percentage points increases the probability of engaging in risky behavior (extramarital affairs) from 8.3 to 14.1 percentage points. We also develop and implement a modified version of the Arellano and Carrasco (2003) estimator to allow for misreporting of risky behavior and find estimates to be robust to a range of plausible misreporting levels.

Controlling for residential location is important as ethnic minorities often live in distressed neighborhoods. It is also challenging because spatial sorting is likely to differ across ethnicities because of labor-or housing-market discrimination. This paper shows that controlling for neighborhoods and observed individual characteristics fails to provide a consistent estimate for the component of the gap accountable to ethnicity only. However, under some assumptions, the quantity of interest is set identified even when heterogeneous sorting patterns across ethnicities are allowed for and the set estimate can still be informative. A two-step estimation method is presented and applied to explain the ethnic employment differential in France, between French individuals of North African ancestry and those with non-immigrant parents. Most of the gap is not due to differences in residential location or individual characteristics, but rather to ethnicity itself. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The effects are estimated using four different formulations based on four different behavioral assumptions. Incorporating stochastic features in link cost estimation rather than in route choice, we provide a novel modeling approach that enables us to use transportation planning models of major metropolitan areas without a need for major computationally-expensive changes in the existing models. We examined the effects of an ATGIS on the Fresno, CA, road network and found several interesting results. First, the ATGIS impact is closely related to pre-system (prior to the implementation of an ATGIS) perceived fuel and emissions costs. Total travel time in the city can be reduced by 17% (no pre-system perceived costs) to 1% (accurate pre-system perceived costs), and even increased by 1% (higher-than-actual pre-system perceived costs). Second, the addition of emissions costs, although negligible relative to fuel and time costs, can effectively reduce total system-wide travel time by up to 1% and fuel consumption by up to 0.6% during peak hours. Third, the ATGIS can reduce annual social costs by as much as $1053 million (high gas price, no pre-system perception) to $48 million (medium gas price, accurate pre-system perception), which are comparable to social cost savings by a congestion pricing (CP) scheme in the study area.

Musicians may make conscious decisions to pursue types of work which enable greater creative autonomy, but in doing so they may exacerbate fatalism about poor working conditions and undermine professional solidarity. The article also explores how pressures towards entrepreneurialism' in other forms of music work constitute further barriers to collective contestation of working conditions.

The data include information on several typically unmeasured domains: self-perceptions of ideal weight, attractiveness ratings, and measured weight information, along with ties to a series of adult outcomes. Results show important gender and racial differences in ideal weight as well as differences for both self-perceived attractiveness and interviewer rated attractiveness. Findings also suggest the existence of large differences in socio-cultural rewards and sanctions for weight status. Black respondents, particularly women, appear to receive lower obesity penalties in both their self-perceived and interviewer accessed attractiveness ratings than other groups. These findings suggest the need to consider new classes of policies directed at shifting relative social benefits and consequences to weight status. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The concept of conjectural variations is proposed to account for imperfect competition in the permits market. We demonstrate the model using a WECC 225-bus system with a detailed representation of the California market. In particular, we examine the extent to which permit trading strategies affect the market outcome.

Research on the economics of obesity typically assumes a calories in, calories out framework, but a weight production model separating caloric intake into carbohydrates, fat, and protein, has not been explored in an economic framework. To estimate the contributions of changes in macronutrient intake and physical activity to changes in population weight, we conducted dynamic time series and structural VAR analyses of U.S. data between 1974 and 2006 and a panel analysis of 164 countries between 2001 and 2010. Findings from all analyses suggest that increases in carbohydrates are most strongly and positively associated with increases in obesity prevalence even when controlling for changes in total caloric intake and occupation-related physical activity. Our structural VAR results suggest that, on the margin, a 1% increase in carbohydrates intake yields a 1.01 point increase in obesity prevalence over 5 years while an equal percent increase in fat intake decreases obesity prevalence by 0.24 points.

Although the demographic and financial characteristics of ARM and fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) borrowers are somewhat similar, ARM borrowers differ from FRM borrowers in their uses of credit and attitudes toward it.

They also examine the role of the status quo effect on CSR actions in tourist destinations. The status quo effect occurs because people generally place much more value on avoiding a loss than on acquiring a gain. Visitors to Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) were presented with alternative profiles of CSR measures and were given one of two treatments that varied according to the definition of the status quo alternative and the valuation question. The design of the experiments enabled the authors to compare the respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) a higher price for their holiday in a destination that has in place several CSR measures and willingness to accept (WTA) a lower price for the same destination with a lower CSR profile. The data are modelled using a flexible approach that allows for the consideration of alternative decision rules in the visitor's decision process. The results show that tourists care about CSR attributes and are likely to make their vacation choices on the basis of such attributes. Moreover, in this context the standard economic theory assumption of preferences symmetry is not satisfied. In other words, the cost of not implementing CSR actions is higher than the benefits of implementing them. When a destination increases CSR actions the number of visitors and their WTP for their visit are likely to increase, but at substantially lower rates than the WTP for alternative destinations (WTA) when the destination reduces its CSR actions. These results may explain why conventional studies find ambiguous effects of CSR action on tourist choice.","[Leon, Carmelo J.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, UNESCO Chair Tourism Planning & Sustainable Econ, Inst Tourism & Sustainable Dev Econ TIDES, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Arana, Jorge E.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Turismo & Empresa, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Arana, Jorge E.] Univ S Alabama, Inst Choice I4C, Mobile, AL 36688 USA",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of South Alabama,"León, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, UNESCO Chair Tourism Planning & Sustainable Econ, Inst Tourism & Sustainable Dev Econ TIDES, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain.",Jorge.arana@ulpgc.es,"Araña, Jorge E./D-1139-2011","Araña, Jorge E./0000-0003-0878-9934",,,,,64,14,14,0,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

If jurisdictions differ with respect to population sizes or with respect to preferences for public goods, the Subgame perfect equilibria (SPE) are the two sequential Stackelberg outcomes. If jurisdictions differ with respect to productivities or with respect to capital endowments, the SPE are (i) the two sequential Stackelberg outcomes, (ii) the simultaneous Nash outcome at which both jurisdictions move early or (iii) the single sequential Stackelberg outcome at which the more productive or capital-poorer jurisdiction leads. The differences between the SPE (i)-(iii) are explained with the help of the externalities caused by the jurisdictions' tax rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A detailed historical analysis reveals how the European Parliament (EP) gradually developed into the hub of a transnational advocacy network that promoted gay rights to the European Commission and the Council. The dynamics of the intergovernmental conference enabled the EP to introduce sexual orientation into the treaty-making process, while the use of naming-and-shaming tactics vis-a-vis the Dutch Presidency secured the ground's final inclusion. This political history has theoretical implications since it presents a challenge to extant liberal intergovernmentalist and institutionalist analyses of the Amsterdam Treaty and suggests that the EP should be afforded more attention by neofunctionalist scholars.","[Mos, Martijn] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Mos, M (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, 214 White Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mm2486@cornell.edu,,"Mos, Martijn/0000-0001-8006-2970",,,,,56,22,24,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The economic success of ski tourism regions depends on both the quantity and quality of the ski resorts' (Telling, days. However, to date there has been little research on the quality of ski season opening days. The purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a parameter that enables us to assess the future development of ski seasons in a differentiated way. The results show a decrease of ski area opening days from 2011 to 2060 in the investigation area in general and a trend to an intra-seasonal postponing of optimal ski days, labelled the 'Christmas-Easter shift'. The parameter developed contributes to our understanding of climate change effects on the tourism supply-side at a regional scale and offers decision support to ski lift operators or tourism associations in terms of adaptation measures.","[Berghammer, Anja; Schmude, Juergen] Univ Munich, Dept Geog, D-80333 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Schmude, J (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",juergen.schmude@geographie.uni-muenchen.de,"Schmude, Juergen/K-1692-2013",,,,,,44,22,23,5,108,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We differentiate between the situation where the choice function is considered to select all Pareto optimal alternatives from a choice set and the situation where it only contains one or several Pareto optimal alternatives. In the former case we find that Pareto rationalizability is an NP-complete problem. For the latter case we demonstrate that, if we have no additional information on the individual preference relations, then all choice behavior is Pareto rationalizable.

We implement our approach by estimating a discrete-choice model of female participation and fertility using individual data from the French Labor Force Survey and a detailed representation of the French tax-benefit system. Our results suggest that financial incentives have had a significant effect on fertility decisions in France.

Yet Russia's unique history of imprisonment has provided an unusually positive trope for women who have to come to terms with their partners' incarceration: the Decembrist wife' (dekabristka). This trope originated in the aftermath of the 1825 Decembrist' uprisingthe first anti-monarchist revolt in modern Russian history. A handful of wives of the perpetrators voluntarily joined their husbands in Siberian exile and, in leaving behind families and comforts, created a precedent to be glorified for future generations. Upheld in Russian national mythology as a model of the exemplary wife, the dekabristka identity lives on. This paper examines its enduring power and significance in contemporary Russia.","[Katz, Elena] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Pallot, Judith] Univ Oxford Christ Church, Oxford OX1 1DP, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Katz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",elena.katz@ouce.ox.ac.uk; judith.pallot@chch.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,70,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,FEB 7,2014,66.0,2,,,,,204,224,,10.1080/09668136.2014.883832,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AB7TW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331994600002,0

Expected earnings differential had a stronger effect among Canadian-born fathers than among immigrant fathers.

Host domestic markets have been generally neglected in the conceptual construct and empirical analysis of export-oriented development. Drawing upon the global production networks (GPNs) perspective, the study advances an evolutionary framework to shed light on the rising domestic market in China as emerging dynamics of regional transformation in contemporary economic globalization. The study is conducted based on updated investigations of the market rebalancing of transnational corporations (TNCs) in China, and particularly the Pearl River Delta (PRD), in response to the post-crisis global-local interaction. It argues that the institutional and network embeddedness of TNCs in the processing trade regime have hampered their 'recoupling' with the domestic market and 'decoupling' from external markets. Instead, a domestic market oriented production network is emerging, driven by strategic contract manufacturers through relocation to inland China. As a pilot attempt to articulate the domestic market in the GPN framework, this study urges more research to reflect the implications of the restructuring of GPNs and market reorientation of TNCs for reshaping regional trajectories in the post-Washington Consensus global economy.","Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Yang, C (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"Yang, Chun/AFP-6023-2022","Yang, Chun/0000-0002-0169-3449",,,,,64,50,62,4,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Different adaptive capacity for the new situation in the world markets deepened differentiation processes undergoing within it. At the expense of the EU expanded mainly Asian countries. Their growing export involvement, which caused high negative balances of trade, is gradually supplemented by the growing interest of Chinese investors in the European area. By acquisitions of companies owning the technological know-how or unique patents, China is gradually assuming its positions on domestic and international markets. The EU is thus losing its positions not only in the segment of medium and high technologies and their commercial application, but also its main source for payments of its growing imports. The Slovak economy, which is absolutely dependent on own production export, is getting into deep interdependency and gradually loses the ability to positively influence the growing risks that arise from this development through its trade policy. The objective of this paper is to examine these relations and identify potential opportunities for the Slovak economy (EU) in order to be able to reverse this negative trend.","[Balaz, Peter; Pasztorova, Janka] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Int Business, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Baláz, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Int Business, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",balaz@euba.sk; jpasztoro@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,2,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3995-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,13,22,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BF6XQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383767900001,0

All vehicles that meet certain criteria must pass an emissions test as part of the vehicle registration process. States use different criteria to determine which vehicles must be tested; however, the equity impacts associated with various screening criteria are unknown. This is due to difficulties researchers have faced in linking vehicle and household characteristics. We investigate the relative influence of vehicle and household characteristics on emissions failures in Atlanta, Georgia, by linking its emissions testing database to a targeted marketing database; the latter contains information about vehicle owners. We use count and hurdle models to predict vehicle emissions failures. Our model finds a relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and emissions failures after controlling for vehicle characteristics; that is, given two identical vehicles, the one owned by a low-income or minority household is more likely to fail emissions. We use our model to investigate the impacts of different emissions testing policies by income and ethnic groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This is despite the identified difficulties that are encountered when attempting to access goods and services in these peripheral economies. Limitations in the transport infrastructure, inconsistent supply and restricted availability have all been acknowledged as issues affecting local retail provision. Island residents have also traditionally been required to travel to the main town or mainland in order to shop for key items. This research study examines the extent to which on-line provision has reconfigured the mobility patterns of residents in the Scottish isles and whether e-commerce has reduced the propensity of individuals to undertake shopping related travel. The findings suggest that e-commerce has had only a modest impact upon consumer travel patterns and that other situational factors moderate the identified benefits that accrue from purchasing on-line.

If the economic operators did the contrary, they could not hope for survival based on obsolete knowledge and skills of its employees. This paper outlines the role and significance of professional development of employees as one of the governing processes and functions of the human resources management. The importance of investment into professional development of employees is foremost seen in creation of superior workforce resulting in increased income of both the economic operator and the region as a whole. The stated theoretic knowledge has also been tested in the research part of the paper, which shows to what extent investment into professional development of employees through various forms of training and education is present in five counties of Eastern Croatia and three counties of Central Croatia. The analyses of results derived from the research part of the paper show the need to continuously change the old paradigm of frequent lack of investment into human resources and impose a fresh view of investment into new knowledge of employees.","[Fosic, Ivana] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Turkalj, Davorin; Kristic, Jelena] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Agr Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Fosic, I (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",ifosic@efos.hr; dturkalj@pfos.hr; jkristic@pfos.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,143,152,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600012,0

Every existing activity in any project is, to a higher or lower extent, determined by the effect of the human agent, which commonly takes the Student's syndrome form. The inefficiency of a number of projects in practice is largely caused by an unsuccessful realization of partial activities. The effect of the human agent is in this respect fundamental. The human agent, as an allocated resource in the activity, is liable to a number of non-specified impacts and stimuli, and as such s/he is rather versatile in his/her behaviour. The versatility of the human agent in projects can be described by the Student Syndrome phenomenon. If the Student Syndrome phenomenon could be completely expressed by means of a mathematical model, it would be possible to improve the prediction of its impact on project activities, and therefore to exploit the resources allocated in the project more efficiently and prevent project crises. We can not expect that the Student Syndrome phenomenon can be expressed in a trivial way and using only one mathematical function. This paper proposes several functions for this representation. The proposed functions are compared in terms of their course and the possibility of work schedule resources parameterization. We can regard this original viewpoint as suggestive for the area of human resources management in projects.

For data processing was carried the large-scale expert study based on a survey of entrepreneurs (over 6,700 units), which have in their product portfolio of innovative projects. Was assembled a vast array of information and found exactly which uncertainty can arise before, at the moment, and at the end all over innovation activities.

The next unit was to determine exactly which uncertainties accompany the organization depending on its size (small, medium, large, very large) and the establishment of the degree of controllability. It was put forward the idea of the existence of certain properties of the system uncertainties, i.e. they cannot occur spontaneously, there are chaotic and remove ourselves to a certain time. With using tools SPSS was found that an uncertainties generated by the causal conditions exist, as long as these conditions will not delete.

Three local government areas (LGAs), comprising two urban and one peri-urban LGA were chosen among the 11 which make up the metropolitan city for the study. They were selected because of their high number of agricultural activities. From the estimated list of 5,082 farmers in the selected LGAs, 210 respondents were randomly selected. Data were collected from the farmers using a schedule of structured interviews. Marketers, processors and supplies dealers were also interviewed using focal group discussions of between 8 and 10 interviewees per session to generate qualitative data about their involvement in the vegetable-value chain in the city. Other stakeholders, in particular key informants from institutions (academic and research institutions, and extension, health, land and finance services) were interviewed. Because of the exploratory nature of the study, data were analyzed with descriptive (frequency counts, percentages, measures of central tendencies) statistics and rankings. An informal network of producers-marketers-consumers exists for the vegetable value chain in the city. The network provides income ranging from N 50,000.00-500,000.00 (N 150 = $ 1.00) per annum for participants based on activities within the chain. Vegetables (Amaranthus, Corchorus, Celosia, okra and pepper) production accounts for 42% of the crop production enterprise. The crops are planted on roadsides (23%), in backyards (22%), and near streams (14%), among other locations.

The authors in this paper analyzed the public-private partnership (PPP) as a form of public-private sector cooperation, where the partnership and market relationships are established, while achieving mutual interests and protecting public interest. The aim is to investigate the characteristics of PPP in Europe, with a special focus on the transition economies and Serbia, and in particular to highlight the problems in the implementation of PPP projects. The economic crisis that has gripped the financial sector has weakened the ability to borrow in the public and private sectors, has led to a reduction in public funding and has increased the state intervention in the market. This has caused stagnation in the establishment of the PPP. On the other hand, the consequences of the financial crisis, the growing budget deficit, inefficiency in the provision of public sector services are paving the way for new forms of PPP. The methodological approach for this framework research includes using different methods such as comparative method, analytic-synthetic approach (involving the collection of data, set of assumptions, analysis of cases and the execution of deductive conclusions). A combination of methods used by law and economics was necessary, regarding the choice of the topic. The results of these problems indicate that on the level of the EU, there is a tendency to develop PPP projects in some areas of importance for the economic recovery, while in the transition economies and Serbia there is the lack of capital for these projects and lack of appropriate regulatory framework, which is in Serbia largely resolved by adoption of new legislation in this area. The authors have encountered some obstacles and limitations while collecting empirical data, because PPP projects data, especially about the reasons that led to the failure of these projects are not sufficiently transparent. The questions that interested the authors have practical implications, since successfully implemented PPP projects contribute to economic recovery and better overall picture of a country. Without prejudice to the classic forms of PPP, using the freedom of scientific research, the authors suggested some new forms of PPP in Serbia that will not fit into the classical form, that is PPP in health sector and in education, and PPP is achieved through the issuance of municipal bonds.","[Todorovic, Nada; Stankovic, Jasmina Labudovic] Univ Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia",University of Kragujevac,"Todorovic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Fac Law, Kragujevac, Serbia.",,"; Labudovic Stankovic, Jasmina/V-2454-2017","Todorovic, Nada/0000-0002-3654-4849; Labudovic Stankovic, Jasmina/0000-0001-8983-8173",,,,,8,0,0,2,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,449,456,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800056,0

In order to understand the phenomenon of spatio-temporal dynamics of land occupation, map projections for the following years are presented: 1959, 1972, 1992 and 2006. A rapid diagnosis of plot ownership by group makes it possible to clearly see how land is currently being utilized. Basic ownership and water usage units remained stable. Declining ecosystem units are rain and semi-evergreen rain forests and palm oil crop rotation; increasing units are crops, fallow land, industrial plantation of teak, palm oil, fruit trees and built-up areas. A new form of peri urban farming activities representing 13.61% of the total area is emerging. In the context of new land ownership, tree planting stabilizes the land, raises money and provides shade. Natural resource consumers, urbanization and preservation and/ or protection of natural resources are not necessarily in conflict. However, the inclusion of urban agriculture and afforestation in urban planning has become a challenge for the sustainable development of urban expansion.","[Tossou, C.

This paper exploits variations in exposure to conflict by birth cohort, survey date, and district to estimate the impact of the insurgency on education outcomes. Overall conflict intensity, measured by conflict casualties, is associated with an increase in female educational attainment, whereas abductions by Maoists, which often targeted school children, have the reverse effect. Male schooling tended to increase more rapidly in areas where the fighting was more intense, but the estimates are smaller in magnitude and more sensitive to specification than estimates for females. Similar results are obtained across different specifications, and robustness checks indicate that these findings are not due to selective migration.","Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Valente, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.",christine.valente@bristol.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,29,38,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Second, the negative effect of grabbing hand has a remarkable regional heterogeneity. The grabbing hand has a stronger negative effect upon the environment in regions of net outflow for tax revenue.

The only methods currently available for developing such tests are smoothed maximum score and subsampling. We propose a new method that uses a discretization'' argument to circumvent the intractable asymptotic distribution of the maximum score estimator. The resulting tests require fewer assumptions than smoothed maximum score, less computational time than subsampling and can be applied to a wide range of nested and non-nested hypotheses. The tests are based on a certain asymptotic equivalence that is obtained by discretizing the continuous covariates with the discretization becoming finer as the sample size increases. The discretization parameters (analogous to bandwidths) are specified so that discretization vanishes asymptotically which is critical for the test to be consistent. The test statistics reflect differences in the predictive accuracy of the maximum score estimates under the null and alternative hypotheses. The tests are shown to be asymptotically normal under the null, and converge to infinity under the alternative. We also investigate the size and power properties of the test through Monte Carlo simulations.","[Mayer, Walter J.] Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA; [Wu, Chen] Black Hills State Univ, Spearfish, SD 57799 USA",University of Mississippi; Black Hills State University,"Mayer, WJ (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Main Campus, University, MS 38677 USA.",wmayer@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Most research to date examines the structures and representations involved with various consumer activist efforts, particularly those related to alternative trade such as the fair trade movement. This study problematises the subjectivity of the consumer activist who engages in alternative trade. Research on neoliberal subjectivity, and specifically the Foucauldian subjectivity of homo economicus, are drawn upon in addition to the work of Ulrich Beck and others addressing risks and uncertainty in late modernity. Findings from open-ended questionnaire responses are analysed for emergent themes. The analyses indicate consumer activists are influenced in part by a homo economicus subjectivity rather than a collectively oriented subjectivity. Findings also suggest consumer activists, operating as homo economicus, act self-reflexively to environmental risks stemming from late modernity and, in the process, commodify social relationships in an effort to manage various risks. Theoretical implications arising from the recognition that the anti-capitalist activism of consumer activists are being advanced by individuals motivated in part by a homo economicus subjectivity are discussed and suggestions for future research provided.","New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",New Mexico State University,"Rice, JS (通讯作者)，New Mexico State Univ, POB 30001,MSC 3WSP, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",ja_rice@nmsu.edu,,,,,,,43,1,2,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We analyze European influence on the death penalty in Russia over the imperial, Soviet, and post-Soviet periods, using two parameters: the changing mechanisms of influence in each period and the death penalty's significance in the broader spectrum of punitive violence. On the first parameter, in the tsarist period, European influence on Russian policy was productive - exercised through prestige, moral suasion, and diffusion. In the Soviet period, European influence was blocked. In the post-Soviet period, European influence is coercive, as the Council of Europe has unsuccessfully sought to compel Russia to abolish its death penalty. On the second parameter, the death penalty in Russia has always been only one of many forms of state-sanctioned punitive killing. In consequence, the Council's involvement in Russia's death penalty has produced an incoherent policy outcome and has entangled the Council in Russia's authoritarian politics. Russia thus exemplifies the hazards of external involvement in death penalty abolition.","[Light, Matthew] Univ Toronto, Ctr Criminol & Sociolegal Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kovalev, Nikolai] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Criminol, Brantford, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Wilfrid Laurier University,"Light, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Ctr Criminol & Sociolegal Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada.",matthew.light@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,166,2,4,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The empirical results show incomplete catching-up in six cases with respect to both EU and EZ, and complete catching-up in nine with respect to EU and four with respect to EZ. When taking into account the behaviour of both gaps and loggaps, we further get four cases of cointegrated regions with respect to EZ and only one with respect to EU.

Interviews and focus groups were conducted with office workers from four organizations in two Dutch provinces. Environmentally-relevant behavior related to commutes and business trips (i.e. travel frequency, travel mode, teleworking, and teleconferencing) was examined. Evidence from interorganizational comparisons suggests that organizational measures did not have uniform effects on employee behavior which was partially due to differences in attitude and personal income. The salience of social norms pertaining to work-related travel behavior also differed between organizations and organizational subpopulations. Differences in attitudes between employees, however, did correspond to some extent to organizational culture or focus differences at the organizational level. Finally, the results underscore the possibility that similar outcomes at the behavioral level might be the result of different underlying dynamics. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A general analytical approach is first developed which suggests that, other things equal, a rise (fall) in any advanced economy's fiscal deficit should be fully matched by a rise (fall) in its net foreign borrowing, in accordance with the so-called twin deficits hypothesis. In the case of Australia, one of the world's largest foreign borrower economies for its size, empirical estimation yields the novel result that Australia's consolidated budget imbalance and its foreign borrowing were approximately twinned on the basis of quarterly data for 1983-2009, when Australia's exchange rate floated and international capital mobility was high. This result is consistent with the conceptual framework and suggests that fiscal policy is likely to be ineffective as an instrument for influencing the real economy.","[Makin, Anthony J.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Gold Coast 4222, Australia; [Narayan, Paresh Kumar] Deakin Univ, Financial Econometr Grp, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood 3125, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Deakin University,"Makin, AJ (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.",t.makin@griffith.edu.au; paresh.narayan@deakin.edu.au,"Narayan, Paresh/AAE-8777-2019; Narayan, Paresh Kumar/AEM-2143-2022; Makin, Anthony/C-6738-2017","Makin, Anthony/0000-0002-5556-9590; Narayan, Paresh/0000-0001-7934-8146",,,,,31,13,15,0,18,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The first is the IPE component of a 20-country survey of international relations (IR) faculty, the second a database of books in the field. The third, and most important, is derived from coding 326 RIPE articles published 2000-10 to discover key cleavages and trends. These results are compared with those from prior studies of the 12 IR journals identified as the leading' journals by the Teaching, Research and International Politics (TRIP) project. The article concentrates on five key issues: paradigmatic orientation, epistemology, methodology, policy orientation, and demography. The results provide ground for scepticism that the American School' of IPE does or will define the mainstream. The findings further tend to confirm that RIPE has stayed relatively true to its founders' intentions in representing diversity in the global study of IPE.","[Sharman, J.

This paper aims to provide empirical evidence in support of increased differentiation in airport charges on the basis of marginal passenger costs being sensitive to the type of airline, i.e. full-service, low-cost, and charter. To that end, both long- and short-run multi-output cost functions are estimated over an unbalanced pool database of 29 UK airports observed between 1995 and 2009. The passenger output is hedonically-adjusted in order to introduce the desired level of disaggregation while also keeping a parsimonious specification. Results show that low-cost passengers impose significantly lower costs to airport infrastructure than those from either full-service or charter airlines. A full schedule of marginal and average incremental cost estimates for the combined passenger categories is provided for all sample airports. Taking into account the existence of returns to scale and economies of capacity, this provides a useful guide for optimal pricing of aeronautical infrastructure under either single- or dual-till regulations.

On the one hand, the complexity metaphor - as other crisis metaphors commonly do - naturalised turmoil and obscured agency as it subjectified complexity itself as a key driver of instability. On the other hand, it marked a departure from narratives of recent crises insofar as it has pointed explicitly to an epistemological crisis underlying financial turmoil. Such framing of the crisis yielded a powerful theoretical challenge to classical neoliberal assumptions about the exogenous nature of financial turmoil and helped shape a new consensus around the imperative of macroprudential regulation. However, the embrace of the complexity lens may remain relatively ambiguous.

Additionally, while most studies use micro-level data, some have used summary statistics such as the median housing value. Assessing community housing price indices in Los Angeles, we find that indices based on transaction prices are highly correlated with indices based on self-reported values, but that the former are better correlated with public goods. Moreover, rental values have a higher correlation with public goods and income levels than either asset-value measure. Finally, indices based on median values are poorly correlated with the other indices, public goods, and income. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Banzhaf, H.

The acquisition of Aral stations from BP in the Austrian gasoline market in 2003 provides a 'quasi-experiment' for identification of the causal effects of changes in spatial clustering on retail prices for a panel of gasoline stations. Our econometric analysis suggests that spatial clustering of gasoline stations reduces the degree of competition between firms and increases equilibrium prices.

Past work shows that the initial share allocation, interdependence of partners' valuations, and asymmetric control all affect the possibility of efficient dissolution. In this paper, I show, in a novel class of cooperative partnerships characterized by ex ante interdependence of valuations, that effectiveness is significantly more important than the initial share allocation. Intuitively, as the effectiveness of cooperation between partners (and thus partnership value) increases, the gains from dissolving decrease but the informational rents remain constant, so efficient dissolution is more difficult to achieve. For sufficiently high effectiveness, efficient dissolution is impossible for any initial share allocation. For sufficiently low effectiveness, however, efficient dissolution is possible for all initial share allocations. The possibility of efficient bargaining depends on the initial share allocation only for moderately effective partnerships.","Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Turner, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Brooks Hall 5th Floor, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jlturner@uga.edu,,,,,,,29,4,6,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2013,41.0,2,,,,,321,335,,10.1007/s00355-012-0690-2,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,155TE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319770300006,0

We construct multivariate dynamic models based on Friedman's quantity theory of money (but permitting money to be endogenous) and Meltzer's monetarist model. The empirical results provide robust evidence that there is a bilateral causal relationship between monetary growth and inflation as well as between monetary growth and output growth. An indirect and implicit causal relationship between monetary growth and inflation is found through the asset inflation channel. There are also long-run equilibrium relationships between money stock, price index and other relevant variables. The present paper further provides a historical exploration of the mechanism of the monetary dynamics of inflation in China over the underlying period. We conclude that the monetary growth rule is likely to be the most promising policy orientation for China to manage its inflation.","Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Zhang, CS (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,31,6,7,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2013,36.0,6,,,,,737,760,,10.1111/twec.12021,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,168LP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320707600004,0

A dearth of direct information on intra-household processes makes it hard to answer. Instead reliance has to be placed on indirect evidence. Here, we investigate these processes more rigorously. We start by outlining theoretical models of household decision making (unitary, a particular variant of this, the impoverished unitary, and bargaining) and identify how gender bias in various outcomes might manifest itself under each of these scenarios. We then review a range of empirical results to ascertain if they indicate gender bias and how they accord with these alternative scenarios. In particular, we reconsider our own results which identified gender bias through econometric analysis of expenditure data, analyse household nutrition, refer to recent work which has indicated a differential impact of regional dietary patterns on the heights of men and women, report our findings on male and female body mass over the life cycle, and review the literature on differential mortality. These results indicate that household decision making may have resulted from bargaining and, while remunerated work played a role in determining the bargaining positions of men and women, the story was often more complex. Other factors, which affected relative worth, emerge as important.","[Horrell, Sara] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Horrell, Sara] Murray Edwards Coll, Murray, KY USA; [Oxley, Deborah] Univ Oxford, Fac Hist, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Oxley, Deborah] Univ Oxford All Souls Coll, Oxford OX1 4AL, England",University of Cambridge; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Horrell, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",sh111@cam.ac.uk; deborah.oxley@all-souls.ox.ac.uk,,"Oxley, Deborah/0000-0001-6871-143X",,,,,45,16,17,1,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

A significant improvement in the condition of the US transportation infrastructure must be grounded on a more sustainable and proactive approach to address the existing gap between short-term commitments and long-term needs. This paper demonstrates in quantitative terms the value of long-term investments to overcome the historical impediments to infrastructure rehabilitation, including the need for a proactive political structure that compensates for the apparent lack of public accountability, and for the poor understanding of the socio-economic effects caused by transportation infrastructure failures. Such a process could avoid impending catastrophes. This paper presents a modeling paradigm that accounts for multiple stakeholder perspectives and relates the formulation of public policy to a long-term horizon through the modeling of the transportation infrastructure as a system of systems. The methodology enables involved stakeholders and decision makers to visualize their shared interests and to promote coordinated individual decisions in order to achieve a more acceptable level of the overall system of systems objectives. To illustrate the relevance of the proposed modeling approach, we apply it to a bridge maintenance problem and we discuss the synthesis of existing engineering practice with socio-economic factors that aids in streamlining long-term infrastructure goals with immediate short-term needs. The insights obtained from the proposed system of systems methodological approach point to the need to adopt a more forward-looking and collaborative public policy for infrastructure maintenance.

Our model indicates that the behavior of physicians in medical subspecialties and surgical subspecialties is consistent with a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium.","[Gunning, Timothy S.] Ernst & Young LLP, Transfer Pricing & Econ, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Sickles, Robin C.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA",Rice University,"Gunning, TS (通讯作者)，Ernst & Young LLP, Transfer Pricing & Econ, 5 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036 USA.",timothy.gunning@ey.com,"Sickles, Robin/IRZ-2742-2023",,,,,,43,5,7,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In this study we assess a potential pre-colonial legacy hypothesis for the case of the Andean region. In order to analyze the hypothesis, we study the human capital of Inca Indios, using age-heaping-based techniques to estimate basic numeracy skills. We rind that Peruvian Inca Indios had only around half the numeracy level of the Spanish invaders. The hypothesis holds even after adjusting for a number of potential biases. In addition, we find evidence on inequality in pre-Columbian times. Given the low educational level and the high inequality reigning before the Spanish Conquest in the Andean region, we argue that more attention should be paid to the pre-colonial legacies when assessing the genesis of the long-term path of only modest economic growth in the countries of Latin America.

His most important refinement of the theory, derived from his recognition of bank deposits as means of exchange, was to treat their out of equilibrium recursive interaction with inflation as integral to it. This treatment underlay both his 1920s work on the business cycle as a dance of the dollar and his advocacy of subjecting monetary policy to a legislated price stability rule, initially to be based on his compensated dollar scheme. Fisher's failure to recognise the onset of the Great Depression even as it was happening was directly related to his faith in the quantity theory's seeming implication that price level stability in and of itself guaranteed the continuation of prosperity, while his subsequent work on the debt deflation theory of great depressions initially failed to repair the damage that this failure did to his reputation, and to that of the quantity theory. In the 1930s Fisher nevertheless remained an active supporter of various schemes to reflate and then stabilise the price level. His subsequent influence on the quantity theory based Monetarist counter-revolution that began in the 1950s lay, directly, in its deployment of his analysis of expected inflation on nominal interest rates, and, indirectly, in its espousal of the case for subjecting monetary policy to a legislated rule.","Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Laidler, D (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",laidler@uwo.ca,"Laidler, David/AAI-9243-2020",,,,,,101,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

By means of unit root tests and fractional integration it is shown that, in general, the ratio of the current account to gross domestic product is a stationary and mean reverting process.

These difficulties raise the question of which strategies can be successfully pursued to break path dependencies in urban policy making. This article is focused on corporate mobility management as one specific example of sustainable mobility initiatives, and analyses the formation and implementation of a travel policy for employees at the city administration of Orebro, Sweden. The analysis reveals how controversies can evolve into major implementation barriers for sustainable mobility initiatives. The analysis centres on the playing out of power relations between politicians and groups of officers in the development of interventions to break path dependencies. The strategy pursued in Orebro turned out to be very challenging within the municipality, since it required significant transformation of the officials' personal travel behaviour, and so led to open conflicts within the city administration. The case demonstrates that radical and confrontational attempts to break path dependencies may result in the same watering down as less controversial, more consensual strategies. When handling controversial sustainable mobility measures there may be more benefit in deliberative strategies of raising awareness, creating new consciousness or institutionalising desired discursive shifts.

In this paper, we evaluate the potential for CO2 abatement and the emissions leakage' effect in the copper industry, a prominent energy-intensive trade-exposed sector. We formulate a plant-level spatial equilibrium model for copper commodities in which parameters describing the behavioural response of agents are calibrated to a set of estimated price elasticities. We find producers and consumers to be price inelastic even in the long run, making the copper industry unresponsive to climate policies. Monte Carlo simulations with our model based on statistical uncertainty on elasticity estimates suggest that around 30per cent of emissions reductions in industrialised countries would be compensated by an increase of emissions in nonabating countries.","[Lanz, Bruno; Rutherford, Thomas F.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rutherford, Thomas F.] Univ Wisconsin, Agr & Appl Econ Dept, Madison, WI USA; [Tilton, John E.] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Tilton, John E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Min Engn, Santiago, Chile",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Colorado School of Mines; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Lanz, B (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,46,12,12,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2013,36.0,3,,,SI,,254,279,,10.1111/twec.12051,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,107OY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316229000002,0

The possibility to derogate from some, but not all, of the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) during declared and officially notified states of emergency provides a hitherto unexplored test case. If governments were increasingly violating non-derogable rights during derogation periods then this provides evidence that the ICCPR has no sufficient constraining effect on state parties. I analyze whether specific individual human rights as well as two aggregate rights measures are systematically more violated during derogation periods in a global sample over the period 1981 to 2008. I find that regime type matters: autocracies step up violation of both non-derogable and derogable rights, anocracies increasingly violate some derogable and some non-derogable rights, whereas democracies see no statistically significant change in their human rights behavior during derogation periods. This result suggests that the main general international human rights treaty fails to achieve its objective of shielding certain rights from derogation where, as in autocracies and anocracies, a constraining effect would be needed most.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Neumayer, E (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",e.neumayer@lse.ac.uk,"Neumayer, Eric/ABF-3741-2021; Neumayer, Eric/A-3971-2012","Neumayer, Eric/0000-0003-2719-7563; Neumayer, Eric/0000-0003-2719-7563",,,,,51,18,20,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Transferred farther east, the continent's re-division condemned Russia to Europe's fringes where it remains today. Some scholars trace the origins of this fault line to 19891990, blaming the United States, Germany and the USSR for failing to erect pan-European security foundations. Few, however, focus on the not insubstantial role of France in this story. Mikhail Gorbachev's close ties with his intellectual mentor Francois Mitterrand contributed to the failure in unexpected ways. This essay explains this element in the history of the pan-European idea while also shedding light on the politics behind the birth of the EU.","Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Oxford OX2 6JF, England",University of Oxford,"Newton, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, 62 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6JF, England.",julie.newton@sant.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,62,6,9,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,MAR 1,2013,65.0,2,,,SI,,290,320,,10.1080/09668136.2012.759716,0.0,,,31,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,100IO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315692100007,0

The forecasting results show that the informational shocks have permanent effects on volatility and the SEMIFARMA-HYGARCH model has better performance over some other models for long and/or short horizons. The predictions from this model are also better than the predictions of the random walk model; accordingly, the weak efficiency assumption of financial markets seems violated for Dow Jones returns studied over a long period.","[Chikhi, Mohamed] Univ Ouargla, Ouargla, Algeria; [Chikhi, Mohamed; Terraza, Michel] Univ Montpellier I, Fac Sci Econ, LAMETA CNRS, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Peguin-Feissolle, Anne] Univ Aix Marseille 2, Ctr Charite, GREQAM CNRS, F-13236 Marseille 02, France",Universite Kasdi Merbah Ouargla; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Péguin-Feissolle, A (通讯作者)，Univ Aix Marseille 2, Ctr Charite, GREQAM CNRS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille 02, France.",chikhi@lameta.univ-montp1.fr; Anne.Peguin@univmed.fr; mterraza@lameta.univ-montp1.fr,"CHIKHI, Mohamed/A-5494-2017","CHIKHI, Mohamed/0000-0003-4955-9545",,,,,47,4,4,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Against the deluge of literatures in comparative capitalisms debates which suggest that liberal market economies typically breed radical' innovation cycles based on the relative absence of states, internal corporate hierarchies, and competitive market arrangements, this article uses a regulationist framework to understand how critical tensions and contradictions inherent to liberal market economies serve to engender new forms of direct state intervention, particularly within the innovation process. Building on Block's (2008) concept of a hidden developmental network state' emerging in Washington beginning in the late 1970s, this article explores the tensions that have led to the use of such developmental policies in the climate and energy realms, and provides a description of how these policies function.","Univ Ottawa, Sch Polit Studies, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"MacNeil, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Sch Polit Studies, 75 Laurier Ave, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",rmacn028@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,36,15,15,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Specifically, the analysis designates those closest to the site as the treated, while those slightly farther away act as the comparison group. The discovery of a methamphetamine laboratory has a significant effect on the property values of those homes close to the location that peaks from 6 to 12 months after each lab's discovery.

Therefore, a fast heuristic model was developed based on the minimum-cost algorithm, using the unimodular properties of the model for obtaining integral results. The heuristic algorithm was compared to the optimal algorithm (both based on ILOG CPLEX) on various network scenarios and produced on average 10% higher construction costs than the optimal algorithm. On the other hand, the execution time of the heuristic algorithm was significantly faster than the optimal algorithm. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The article compares the development, structure and strategies of pensioners interest organisations in the Czech Republic and Slovenia. It finds that sizeable, if poorly resourced, membership-based pensioners interest organisations have emerged, largely independently of trade unions, and integrated into interest representation systems. Although lack of resources and organisational problems hamper lobbying capacity, these groups retain mobilisation potential. Comparison suggests that legacies and modes of transition still shape pensioners interest organisations more than institutional structures or new population ageing strategies.","UCL, Sch Slavon & E European Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Hanley, S (通讯作者)，UCL, Sch Slavon & E European Studies, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",s.hanley@ssees.ucl.ac.uk,,"Hanley, Sean/0000-0002-5737-7576",,,,,95,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JAN 1,2013,65.0,1,,,,,45,74,,10.1080/09668136.2012.734555,0.0,,,30,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,076II,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313949600003,0

It was also discovered that there is distinctive difference in the strategic focus in achieving competitive advantage between the services companies and the manufacturers.

Business schools and programs all around the world are tapping into this marketing opportunity and try to free business leaders from daily tie-ups and really pay attention to the above-mentioned agenda. Their diagnosis and treatment advice are diversified, demanding, and even conflicting. Still leaders are in urgent need of a strategic tool and model to help them to secure their business and their own leading position. In this paper, an ideal type of Integrative 5C Business model is proposed and it is highly advised that business leaders should use this business model to align their business so that global competitiveness could be attained. The five essential parts of this model include: Creativity, Catch, Cash, Commitment and Culture. The culture factor is most important and it integrates all other four factors together and let them work to deliver the irreplaceable value to customers. We also use several famous business cases to show how their brand value and business position are strengthened in the context of 5C business model.

Main objective of central banks function in V4 countries lies in maintaining price stability. For this purpose, inflation targeting regime is realized in a medium-term focus in V4, which means that there is a certain lag between a monetary policy operation and its influence on an inflation target. The monetary policy of each country can be described by suitable VAR model with appropriate variables. We suppose inflation, interbank interest rate and central bank key interest rate as appropriate variables. We would like to know if there is a continuity of the monetary policy before and after crisis in particular countries. We use one-dimensional and multi-dimensional calibration technique for this purpose. Based on estimated parameters of the one-dimensional calibration model with linear or quadratic calibration function, respectively, we can identify changes in monetary transmission in all countries during crisis. We can conclude on some similarities from estimated parameters of multi-dimensional calibration model, but not on the some transmission mechanism in all countries.","[Myskova, Katerina; Dobesova, Anna] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Mysková, K (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",myskova@mendelu.cz; xdobeso5@node.mendelu.cz,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,0,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,649,654,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000110,0

It shows that not all NIE oriented scholars rely now exclusively on the rules of methodological individualism. Not all OIE oriented ones are now building their explanatory analyses upon the rules of methodological holism. A different middle way mode of explanation exists and is being used in both traditions. It was Agassi (1960) who firstly referred to it as institutional individualism. Individual agency and social structure are now being combined also in a way that assigns analytical primacy to both of them, not to one or the other as is usually done in reductionist and holist economic explanations. The paper shows that the three rules of institutional individualism allow for building non-systemic and non-reductionist explanations as the same time as they allow for the incorporation into economic models and theories of the many formal and informal institutional aspects surrounding all human interactions. Some examples of analyses so built in both camps are mentioned, including contributions by Nobel laureates such as North and Ostrom. This is not to mean that a kind of convergence is occurring between different approaches in institutional analysis. No statement in favor of such a convergence is made in the present article.

This article attempts to explore an effective way to promoting Chinese culture and art communication, so as to better spread Chinese culture and art, from the perspective of the oversea Chinese youth.","[Wang Hongzhu] Jinan Univ, Arts Coll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ye Zhihai] Jinan Univ, Students Art Qual Educ Dept, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Jinan University,"Wang, HZ (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Arts Coll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yezhihai@jnu.edu.cn; twhz@jnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,5,0,0,3,11,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,21.0,,,,,,376,380,,,,,,5,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA3ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335241700071,0

The first method calculated how the mobility behavior of respondents would hypothetically be at the present time if car2go was not available. The second method determined the respondents' past mobility behavior before using car2go. Confounding circumstances were corrected in both approaches through different mechanisms. Comparable methods calculating carsharing impacts have only been applied individually in past studies. This is the first study applying two measurement methods within the same survey, which enables a triangulation. As other influencing parameters were equal (e.g. sampling frame, nonresponse bias, mode of asking, point in time of the survey), the deviating results are assumed to have resulted from the different measurement techniques. The findings indicate a primacy effect (disproportionally high selection of first answer options) having influenced the first measurement and an overestimation of the impact on total kilometers travelled in the second measurement. The comparative findings of this dual-measurement could contribute to research designs of greater precision in future work on carsharing impacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These new methods of estimating the ridge parameter in LRR are evaluated by means of Monte Carlo simulations along with the some other estimators of k that has already been evaluated by MAyennsson and Shukur (Commun Stat Theory Methods, 2010) together with the traditional maximum likelihood (ML) approach. As a performance criterion we use the mean squared error (MSE). In the simulation study we also calculate the mean value and the standard deviation of k. The average value is interesting firstly in order to see what values of k that are reasonable and secondly if several estimators have equal variance then the estimator that induces the smallest bias should be chosen. The standard deviation is interesting as a performance criteria if several estimators of k have the same MSE, then the most stable estimator (with the lowest standard deviation) should be chosen. The result from the simulation study shows that LRR outperforms ML approach.

Two exogenous variables, equity returns and gross domestic product growth, outperform other variables as regime indicators and appear to capture risks of downturns in real estate. We extend the model to the smoothing equation, allowing for switching behavior by appraisers, using two new techniques: the TAR-AR and TAR-TAR approaches. The co-switching specification opens up a new frontier of empirical research. We estimate the TAR-TAR using FT returns as the regime indicator, and we find results that outperform conventional smoothing models and have plausible economic explanations.","[Lizieri, Colin] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Satchell, Stephen] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Satchell, Stephen] Univ Cambridge Trinity Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TQ, England; [Wongwachara, Warapong] TMB Bank Publ Co Ltd, TMB Analyt, Bangkok 10900, Thailand",University of Cambridge; University of Sydney; University of Cambridge,"Lizieri, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",cml49@cam.ac.uk; ses999gb@yahoo.co.uk; warapong@cantab.net,,"Lizieri, Colin/0000-0002-7111-8052",,,,,45,17,18,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2012,40.0,4,,,,,772,804,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2012.00331.x,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,062UJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312947900005,0

Adolescents with low perceived social support may be at particular risk. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between adolescent overweight and obesity, indices of perceived peer and family social support, and their interaction in the use of unhealthy weight control behaviors among adolescents. The present study used data from the 2001-2002 Health Behavior in School-Aged Children collaborative survey. Participants included 4598 adolescent girls and boys in the ninth and tenth grades. Results of binary logistic regression analyses showed that obese boys and girls were more likely to use unhealthy weight control behaviors than their healthy weight peers. Boys and girls who endorsed difficult communication with their parents, low levels of parent school support, or frequent bullying were more likely to engage in unhealthy weight control behaviors than relevant comparison groups. Among girls, poor classmate relationships were associated with increased use of unhealthy weight control behaviors whereas fewer friendships were associated with decreased use. Results suggest that adolescents are at high risk for use of unhealthy weight control behaviors and would benefit from interventions to increase knowledge and social support for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.

We explore this idea using very rich firm-level data on Italian manufacturing, which enables us to control for many confounding factors in the exportingproduct innovation link (i.e. selection on observable variables). We also make an attempt to address the potential self-selection of firms into exporting according to unobservable characteristics using an industryprovince specific measure of firm distances from their most likely export markets, and of these export markets potentials as sources of presumably exogenous variations in export status using an instrumental variables strategy. We find that export status significantly increases the likelihood of introducing product innovations and that this effect is not fully captured by the channels commonly stressed by the theoretical literature, such as larger markets (and accordingly firm size) or higher investments in R&D.

When sectoral interactions are explicitly accounted for, a contemporaneous technology shock to all manufacturing sectors implies a positive response in both output and hours at the aggregate level. Otherwise there is a negative correlation, as in much of the existing literature.

To do so, we model the behavior of a household composed of one adult and one child. We then show that 'favorable' distortions from price subsidies may allow redistributing toward the child and then derive the conditions under which this redistributive scheme is more efficient than cash transfers. The framework is extended to account for possible paternalistic preferences of the social planner and for households composed of two adults with different preferences. Applied to a continuum of households, our approach is extended to the problem of child poverty alleviation. In contrast to the traditional view, we show that well-chosen subsidies may be more cost effective than cash transfers in reducing child poverty.","[Donni, Olivier] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, F-95800 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Donni, Olivier] IZA, F-95800 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Bargain, Olivier] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, CHILD, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Bargain, Olivier] IZA, Dublin, Ireland",CY Cergy Paris Universite; University College Dublin,"Donni, O (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, 33 Blvd Port, F-95800 Cergy Pontoise, France.",olivier.donni@u-cergy.fr,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019",,,,,,37,4,5,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2012,39.0,4,,,,,783,808,,10.1007/s00355-011-0556-z,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,015VE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309473700005,0

In the case of Ireland, this signal was ignored, and a failure of banking regulation together with wholly inappropriate fiscal policy allowed the current crisis to happen. In the aftermath of the recession, domestic costs have been cut, producing a substantial increase in tradable sector output. This output response will play a crucial role in eventually returning the economy to growth. Tackling the huge government deficit will be necessarily painful and, until completed, will weigh heavily on domestic demand, delaying a full recovery.

Our cost estimates provide several new insights into this extensively studied topic. First, our estimate of the number of removal-related fatalities is considerably lower than the commonly accepted figure of 4000. Second, the uncompensated value of ceded Cherokee land in the southeast was the largest cost borne by the Cherokees, followed in magnitude by the value of lost agricultural output due to removal. Third, American taxpayers paid for roughly 44% of the total social costs of removal. Also, the cost burden of Cherokee removal, as a share of 1 year's GDP. was greater for the Cherokees than the cost burden of any major war for the American population. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We classify, and characterize farmers according to the relative importance of their multi-functional goals. The empirical analysis uses farm-level data collected through a face-to-face questionnaire to a sample of rice farmers. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (A HP) is used to measure farmers' primary and secondary objectives importance in planning their activities, and Cluster Analysis (CA) to classify and characterize fanners according to their priorities. Results suggest that within the economic role, the most important goals are maximization of total farm income followed by improving rice quality. They tend to minimize fertilizers use, both to reduce cost and to preserve the environment. Farmers recognize their potential role in minimizing illegal immigration. Results can be useful in guiding policy makers by considering farmers' priorities at local level.","[Kallas, Zein; Rabell, Crstina] Catalonia Polytech Univ Barcelona, Ctr Agrofood Econ & Dev, CREDA UPC IRTA, Barcelona, Spain; [Baba, Yasmina] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Sch Agr Engn Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",IRTA; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Kallas, Z (通讯作者)，Catalonia Polytech Univ Barcelona, Ctr Agrofood Econ & Dev, CREDA UPC IRTA, Barcelona, Spain.",,"kallas, zein/G-5620-2010","kallas, zein/0000-0003-2870-3691",,,,,19,1,1,0,2,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2012,11.0,3,,,,,66,74,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,046MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311769300008,0

Moving from the origins of the Community regime for export control, mainly in the context of the completion of the internal market in the early 1990s, particular attention will be devoted to the limits of Regulation 1334/2000 setting up a Community regime for the export control, and of subsequent Regulation 428/2009.","Univ Milan, Dept Int Studies, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Micara, AG (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Int Studies, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",anna.micara@unimi.it,,,,,,,36,12,12,4,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Despite this, only a few studies have focused on the determinants of tourist expenditure at the individual or household level. This paper sheds further light on this issue. For this purpose, the authors use information gathered by interviewing visitors about their levels of expenditure. The analysis focuses on total expenditure and expenditures on lodging, restaurants, shopping and car rental, and uses OLS, quantile regression and instrumental variable techniques.

Although there is a trend for governments to centre their transport policies on the supply side, promoting the development of different infrastructures and services or intervening in tourism markets, this paper presents an alternative way of thinking by analysing tourist demand profiles to detect those that tend to opt for private transport. The authors investigate different strategies in tourism policies designed to reduce the number of tourists using private motor vehicle transport and to promote public, group or charter transport at destinations. Taking the Balearic Islands as a case study, discrete choice models are employed to assess different ways of modelling the transport demand function for hire cars, other private cars, public buses and coaches, and thus to identify the corrective potential of the proposed policies.","[Aguilo, Eugeni; Palmer, Teresa; Rossello, Jaume] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Rosselló, J (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Carretera Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",jrossello@uib.es,"Rosselló, Jaume/GQH-9044-2022; Rosselló, Jaume/A-1181-2012","Rosselló, Jaume/0000-0001-9467-2067; Rosselló, Jaume/0000-0001-9467-2067",,,,,42,18,20,1,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

It is also found that the Mainland Chinese markets are actually less volatile than the Taiwan and Hong Kong stock exchanges in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

(2003). This copula can capture asymmetric and extreme dependence between variables, and is one of the few copulas that can do so and still be used in high dimensions effectively. However, it is difficult to estimate the copula model by maximum likelihood when the multivariate dimension is high, or when some or all of the marginal distributions are discrete-valued, or when the parameters in the marginal distributions and copula are estimated jointly. We therefore propose a Bayesian approach that overcomes all these problems. The computations are undertaken using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation method which exploits the conditionally Gaussian representation of the skew t distribution. We employ the approach in two contemporary econometric studies. The first is the modelling of regional spot prices in the Australian electricity market. Here, we observe complex non-Gaussian margins and nonlinear inter-regional dependence. Accurate characterization of this dependence is important for the study of market integration and risk management purposes. The second is the modelling of ordinal exposure measures for 15 major websites. Dependence between websites is important when measuring the impact of multi-site advertising campaigns. In both cases the skew t copula substantially outperforms symmetric elliptical copula alternatives, demonstrating that the skew t copula is a powerful modelling tool when coupled with Bayesian inference.

We investigate the impact of a law introducing a minimum length of stay for discharges with complications. We analyze its effects on the probability of a discharge with complications, on its length of stay and on its reimbursement. We show that the policy has been effective in limiting upcoding, since, after the law, (1) the probability of a discharge with complications has decreased by 3%; (2) its length of stay has risen by 0.17 days more than the observed corresponding variation in the length of stay of a discharge in the control group; (3) the hospital's revenue on a discharge with complications has decreased by 8.5% more than the observed revenue change on a discharge in the control group. Furthermore, we find evidence of an ownership effect on upcoding, since not-for-profit and for-profit hospitals have been more affected by the law than public hospitals.","[Vittadini, Giorgio; Berta, Paolo] Univ Milano Bicocca, CRISP, Dept Quantitat Methods, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Martini, Gianmaria; Callea, Giuditta] Univ Bergamo, Dept Econ & Technol Management, Bergamo, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Bergamo,"Berta, P (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, CRISP, Dept Quantitat Methods, Viale Innovaz 10, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",paolo.berta@crisp-org.it,"Vittadini, Giorgio/J-8543-2016; Martini, Gianmaria/N-6165-2016","Vittadini, Giorgio/0000-0002-0375-9763; Martini, Gianmaria/0000-0001-9503-4999; Berta, Paolo/0000-0003-0984-4288; Callea, Giuditta/0000-0002-7178-3781",,,,,28,6,7,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The effect of CLPs on further training is analyzed utilizing the JAB Establishment Panel data of the years 2003 to 2007. CLPs are agreements between firms' management and their respective workforce that are characterized by reduced wages or prolonged working hours in exchange for employment guarantees or investment programs, such as further training. CLPs not only explicitly contain clauses concerning further training, but also increase employment stability and may increase the firms' incentives for human capital investments, due to the employees' wage concessions. In order to test this hypothesis we apply parametric as well as semi-parametric cross-section time-series regression models. However, our findings suggest that CLPs do not exert positive causal effects on human capital formation as measured by further training incidence and intensity variables.","[Bellmann, Lutz] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Labour Econ, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Bellmann, Lutz; Gerner, Hans-Dieter] Inst Employment Res, Dept Estab & Employment, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Bellmann, L (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Labour Econ, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",Lutz.Bellmann@iab.de; Hans-Dieter.Gerner@iab.de,,,,,,,42,4,4,0,7,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The objective of this study is to analyse Italy's international trade of small pelagics to point out the main weaknesses of the sector and suggest possible improvement strategies for the involved stakeholders, i.e. public policy makers and private firms. As a first step, the dynamics and composition of import and export flows is examined with regard to the world market, as well as with other EU Countries, highlighting the distinctive features of the coastal regions on the Adriatic sea. As a second step, the competitive position of Italian exports is assessed with respect to other three important producing countries in the Mediterranean Region, namely Spain, France and Morocco, calculating their Relative Export Advantage.

The existing empirical literature has produced remarkably disparate results and the wide variety of empirical approaches reflects the uncertainty about the correct set of explanatory variables that ought to be included in the analysis. To account for the model uncertainty that surrounds the validity of the competing PTA theories, we introduce Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to the PTA literature. Statistical theory shows that BMA successfully incorporates model uncertainty in linear regression analysis by minimizing the mean squared error, and by generating predictive distributions with optimal predictive performance. Once model uncertainty is addressed as part of the empirical strategy, we find strong evidence of trade creation, trade diversion, and open bloc effects. Our results are robust to a range of alternative empirical specifications proposed by the recent PTA literature.

Empirical Evidence for the UK,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; SKILL STRUCTURE; LEVEL EVIDENCE; US; PRODUCTIVITY; EMPLOYMENT; FRANCE,"This paper provides new empirical evidence on the relationship between the structure of firms overseas FDI and the performance and organisation of their home-country operations in both manufacturing and business services. It addresses two questions. First, does sorting into multinational status on the basis of productivity extend to the scale of overseas activity? Second, is there evidence that off-shoring to low-wage countries has asymmetric effects on high and low-skill activities in the home economy? The paper considers heterogeneity in firms outward FDI strategies and in their behaviour at home, distinguishing between low-skill and high-skill-intensive activities. I differentiate between firms that invest in relatively low-wage economies and hence might be engaged in vertical FDI, and those that only invest in high-wage economies. I find that firms that invest in low-wage economies simultaneously invest in a large number of high-wage economies, employing complex FDI strategies. I add to existing evidence by demonstrating that selection into multinational status on productivity extends beyond the decision of whether or not to engage in FDI, to the geographic scope of overseas operations. This is consistent with the highest productivity firms being best able to overcome large fixed costs of establishing multiple overseas facilities. I find evidence consistent with differential effects of vertical FDI on firms high and low-skill manufacturing activity in the UK. Relocating low-skill activity to relatively low-wage economies could enable a firm to expand output, with potential positive effects on investment, employment and output in complementary (high-skill) activities at home. For firms investing in relatively low-wage economies, I find that labour in these countries may substitute for relatively low-skilled labour in the UK. In high-skill manufacturing industries I find that multinationals that invest in low-wage economies are larger, more capital intensive and more intensive in their use of intermediate inputs than other UK-owned firms.","[Simpson, Helen] Univ Bristol, IFS, CMPO, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England; [Simpson, Helen] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Bristol; University of Oxford,"Simpson, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, IFS, CMPO, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.",,"Simpson, Helen D/B-7696-2008",,"Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H005331/1, ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H005331/1, ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,42,16,16,0,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2012,35.0,3,,,,,243,272,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01402.x,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,904FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301180500001,0

The objective of this paper is to examine efficiency, distributional, environmental (CO2 emissions) and spatial effects of increasing different kinds of passenger transport subsidies discriminating between household types, travel purposes and travel modes. The effects are calculated by applying a numerical spatial general equilibrium approach calibrated to an average German metropolitan area. In extension to most studies focusing on only one kind of subsidy, we compare the effects of different transport subsidies within the same unified framework that allows to account for two features not yet considered simultaneously in studies on transport subsidies: endogenous labor supply and location decisions. Furthermore, congestion, travel mode choice, travel related CO2 emissions and institutional details regarding the tax system in Germany are taken into account. The results suggest that optimal subsidy levels are either small or even zero. While subsidizing public transport is welfare enhancing, subsidies to urban road traflic reduce aggregate urban welfare. Concerning the latter it is shown that making investments in urban road infrastructure capacity or reducing gasoline taxes may even be harmful to residents using predominantly automobile. In contrast, pure commuting subsidies hardly affect aggregate urban welfare, but distributional effects are substantial. All policies cause suburbanization of city residents and (except for subsidizing public transport) contribute to urban sprawl by raising the spatial imbalance of residences and jobs but the effect is relatively small. In addition, the policies induce a very differentiated pattern regarding distributional effects, benefits of landowners and environmental effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our main purpose is to analyze the impact of the uncertainty of the mean appreciation rate on the pricing and investment timing of the option to invest under incomplete markets with partial information. We assume that an investor aims to maximize expected discounted utility of lifetime consumption. Based on consumption utility indifference pricing method, stochastic control and filtering theory, we obtain under CARA utility the implied values and the optimal investment thresholds of the option to invest, which are determined by a semi-closed-form solution to a free-boundary partial differential equation (PDE) problem. The solution is independent of the utility time-discount rate. We provide numerical results by finite difference methods and compare the results with those under a fully observable case. Numerical calculations show that partial information leads to a significant loss of the implied value of the option to invest.

Accordingly, the Ministry of Education in Kingdom of Bahrain started applying this Technology in some schools and they are in their way to apply it in other schools. However, IWB impact on students' engagement is not measured empirically so that it can be applied in other schools. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the impact of Interactive Whiteboard use on students' engagement in classroom. Thirty three students at two different classes in private schools were observed during the second semester of the school year. Data were collected using an at-task checklist, and students completed an attitude survey regarding their perception of their own engagement with Interactive whiteboard use. Significant differences were noted in student behavior between instruction without Interactive Whiteboard use and instruction with Interactive Whiteboard use. No significant correlations were found between the variables gender. Results indicate that use of the Interactive Whiteboard as an instructional tool has a beneficial effect on students' engagement in classroom lessons and leads to improve students' behavior. Suggestions for further research are incorporated as part of the study results.","[Ali, Hayat] Univ Bahrain, Isa Town, Bahrain",University of Bahrain,,hali@uob.edu.bh,,"AL-Kaabi, Reem/0000-0002-0070-2358",,,,,20,0,0,1,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1384,1399,,,,,,16,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549701021,0

Considering the evolution of final consumption expenditure as proxy for the business cycles, the underlying study is calibrated on the second key feature of Burns and Mitchell's (1946) definition about business cycles, namely the cycles are divided and also treated differently for cases of expansionary and downward regimes. Therefore a cyclical convergence between Romanian and Euro Zone's business cycles is characterized by synchronization in the occurrence of different regimes (states) and also in the time for which these regimes are standing up. For this purpose, I called a Markov Switching model in order to estimate the probability of being in economic expansion or recessions for both business cycles. In that sense, I use both a Hamiltonian approach and a standard AR parametisation for dependent variable's dynamics. Additionally, the Markov Switching analysis was completed by a Bayesian Switching approach in order to cross check the statistical significance of resulted estimates. Also other econometric and statistical methods were engaged to verify the accuracy of obtained information.","[Alupoaiei, Alexie Ciprian Iancu] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,alex.alupoaiei@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2012,,,,,,,314,320,,,,,,7,Economics; Information Science & Library Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BDG67,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313136800058,0

Traders are boundedly rational expected utility maximizers with different beliefs about future prices and different investment horizons. In particular, we analyze the effects of the latter source of heterogeneity on the dynamics of price. We find that in the case with homogeneous agents, longer investment horizons lead to more stable dynamics. This is not true, however, in the case of a mixed population of traders, when the increase of heterogeneity in the investment horizons can introduce instability in the system. Furthermore, the role of heterogeneity turns out to be different for different trading behaviors and its effect on the aggregate dynamics depends on the whole ecology of agents' beliefs.","[Anufriev, Mikhail] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Anufriev, M (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Mikhail.Anufriev@uts.edu.au; bottazzi@sssup.it,"Anufriev, Mikhail/B-6099-2019; Anufriev, Mikhail/AAW-5452-2020","Anufriev, Mikhail/0000-0002-1842-6814; Anufriev, Mikhail/0000-0002-1842-6814; Bottazzi, Giulio/0000-0003-2565-4732",,,,,40,3,3,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.
