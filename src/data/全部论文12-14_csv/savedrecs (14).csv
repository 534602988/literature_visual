The model demonstrates that a tighter emissions cap will reduce the scale of fossil fuel usage and that this will diminish incentives to improve fossil fuel efficiencies. In addition, such policies may stimulate the relative demand for innovations that improve the efficiency of alternative energy but carbon scarcity may diminish innovation incentives overall. Only for technologies that directly abate carbon pollution will there be an unambiguously positive impact on innovation. These results have implications for climate change targets and the design of climate change policy.

Only few papers have considered the Italian Electricity Spot market since it has been deregulated recently. Therefore, this contribution is an investigation with emphasis on price dynamics accounting for technologies, market concentration, congestions and volumes. We aim to understand how these four variables affect zonal prices since these ones combine to bring about the single national price (prezzo unico d'acquisto, PUN). Hence, understanding its features is important for drawing policy indications referred to production planning and selection of generation sources, pricing and risk-hedging problems, monitoring of market power positions and finally to motivate investment strategies in new power plants and grid interconnections. Implementing Reg-ARFIMA-GARCH models, we assess the forecasting performance of selected models showing that they perform better when these factors are considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Even when voting is costly, participation rates are such that, in the limit, the correct candidate is elected-that is, information fully aggregates.

This paper considers one particular model of this class with firms competing in prices and shows continuity of the model as the elasticity of substitution between goods goes to infinity. This result contrasts with the conjecture of prior literature. Continuity of the model ensures consistency of its outcomes when the elasticity of substitution approaches infinity. Therefore, researchers who were reluctant to use this model because of the lack of proof of continuity can now rely on this paper's result to employ the model in their research.

Optimal policy depends on the forthcoming shock. A better predicted realization of the shock that increases both marginal and total product always increases next period's optimal output. We derive conditions on the degree of relative risk aversion and the elasticity of marginal product under which optimal investment increases or decreases with a better shock. Under fairly regular restrictions, optimal outputs converge in distribution to a unique invariant distribution whose support is bounded away from zero. We derive explicit solutions to the optimal policy for three well-known families of production and utility functions and use these to show that volatility of output, sensitivity of output to shocks, and expected total investment may be higher or lower than in the standard model where no new information is acquired over time; the limiting steady state may also differ significantly from that in the standard model.","[Zilcha, Itzhak] Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Berglas Sch Econ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Roy, Santanu] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Tel Aviv University; Southern Methodist University,"Zilcha, I (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Berglas Sch Econ, POB 39040, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",sroy@smu.edu; izil@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,39,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We generalize the model to allow for inter-day response, as well as threshold prices, above which individual customer response may increase or decrease. With these inclusions, we find hourly elasticity for the group of customers to be as large as -0.7, larger than previous studies. We apply the method to examine a recent finding that time-differentiated rates could increase electric utility emissions. However, that result did not differentiate between real-time and TOU rates, and furthermore held energy use constant in comparing flat rates and time-differentiated rates. We perform a case study to examine emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 based on predicted energy use changes as well as for an energy-neutral case for real-time, TOU and flat rates. Employing energy use predictions from the model, increased energy use results in increased emissions in almost all cases. For the energy-neutral case, time-differentiated rates increase CO2 as compared to flat rates, and the TOU rate causes a larger increase than does real-time pricing. But both rates decrease other emissions in the majority of years, particularly SO2 In addition, time-differentiated rates reduce NOx potency by shifting it to non-daylight hours when conditions for the formation of smog are less favorable.

The presence of self-control problems induces individuals to save less because of their urge for temptation towards current consumption. Individuals' efforts to balance between the short-term urge for temptation and the long-term commitment for consumption smoothing result in self-control costs. In this environment PAYG social security works as a self-control cost reducing device. In contrast, the presence of altruism induces individuals to save more. This in turn mitigates the adverse effects of self-control problems and PAYG social security on savings but magnifies the self-control costs. We find that in our environment the adverse welfare effects of a PAYG system are further mitigated relative to the environments that incorporate altruism and self control issues separately. However, the level of mitigation is quite modest. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, the previous literature focuses on North-South setups in which the South is restricted to imitating northern inventions. To analyze the effects of IPR policies on developed and developing countries, we extend this literature to allow not only for southern innovation and imitation of northern goods, but also for imitation targeted at southern innovations. We find the effects of IPRs on R&D and welfare to be non-monotonic and dependent on innovation efficiency and an innovation threshold in the South. For sufficiently strong IPRs the South engages in original R&D and stronger IPRs promote southern innovation, welfare, and a reduction in the North-South wage gap. Below the threshold, a strengthening of IPR protection fails to promote innovation and decreases welfare. Stronger IPRs exclusively for southern firms can benefit both regions by shifting southern resources from the imitation of northern goods to original southern innovation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, recent empirical work finds evidence of a Tobin effect in high income countries and a reverse Tobin effect in less developed economies. We present a neoclassical growth model where money is required for investment and consumption purposes. In contrast to standard cash-in-advance models, the reliance on cash is inversely related to the extent of capital formation. In this setting, we demonstrate that the effects of monetary policy depend on the level of development. In particular, inflation adversely affects capital formation at low levels of income because there is a high reliance on cash and a high cost of capital. By comparison, the financial system operates more efficiently in advanced countries. Consequently, monetary policy generates a Tobin effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Roughly speaking, workers in these fields can be divided into two categories: specialists, who have a deep knowledge of a single area, and generalists, who have knowledge in a wide variety of areas. In this paper,! examine an individual's choice to be a specialist or generalist. My model addresses two questions: first, under what conditions does it make sense for an individual to acquire skills in multiple areas, and second, are the decisions made by individuals optimal from an organizational perspective? I find that when problems are single-dimensional, and disciplinary boundaries are open, all workers will specialize. However, when there are barriers to working on problems in other fields, then there is a tradeoff between the depth of the specialist and the wider scope of problems the generalist has available. When problems are simple, having a wide variety of problems makes it is rational to be a generalist. As these problems become more difficult, though, depth wins out over scope, and workers again tend to specialize. However, that decision is not necessarily socially optimal - on a societal level, we would prefer that some workers remain generalists. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model shows that the network works as a perfect risk-pooling mechanism, when it is both strongly connected and symmetric. But the risk-sharing does not necessarily reduce default rates, unless the shock firms face is lower on average than their financial capacity.

Within the framework of spatial econometrics, we investigate empirically the consequence of such an institutional setting. Using city-level data for China, the present study finds that city governments behave strategically in making spending decisions regarding environmental protection. This paper finds that a city government appears to cut its own spending as a response to the rise in environmental protection spending by its neighbors. Hence, environmental protection tends to be underprovided. As a result, we suggest that centralizing the environmental protection responsibility to a higher level of government would be beneficial in terms of controlling pollution in China.","[Deng, Huihui] Univ Int Business & Econ, Inst Int Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xinye; Huang, Nan] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Fanghua] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of International Business & Economics; Renmin University of China; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Zheng, XY (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",denghuihui@126.com; zhengxinye@ruc.edu.cn; huangnan11@ruc.edu.cn; fhleecon@msn.com,,"Li, Fanghua/0000-0001-6527-1192",,,,,41,50,55,7,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2012,20.0,5,,,,,103,120,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01304.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,014SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309395400006,0

It also allows examination of unbalanced trade, not considered in previous work. Noncooperative regulators tend to overregulate for profit-shifting reasons, though only when producers can vary standards across countries.

In consistency with the theory, the key explanatory variables in Tunisia's fertility model are real GDP per capita, infant mortality, contraceptive use ratio, and education. As opposed to most empirical works, the present study takes into consideration three educational levels, i.e., primary, secondary and higher. Also unlike most empirical research, this study attempts to analyse the impact of fertility transition on education and economic growth. To deal with too little or incomplete data, time series data for Tunisia are computed over 45 years. A multivariate cointegration analysis is carried out and shows that a long-term triangular relationship exists. A short dynamic run analysis based on the vector correction error model displays results in coherence with and close to those of the long term. Among our key results, education is found to trigger fertility transition both in the short and long run. In addition, education has relatively fostered economic growth but hardly boosted it through its dynamic interaction with fertility. Furthermore, the variance decomposition and the impulse function show that the fertility transition has produced a feedback effect on both education and economic growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

If an agent's health type is private information there will be a pooling equilibrium in the private annuity market. We also study the implications for the macro-economy and welfare of a social security system with mandatory contributions that are constant across health types. These social annuities are immune to adverse selection and therefore offer a higher rate of return than private annuities do. However, they have a negative effect on the steady-state capital intensity and welfare. The positive effect of a fair pooled rate of return on a fixed part of savings and a higher return on capital in equilibrium is outweighed by the negative consequences of increased adverse selection in the private annuity market and a lower wage rate.","[Heijdra, Ben J.; Reijnders, Laurie S.

A similarly unique combination of circumstances surrounded European efforts in the 1970s and was later to create, through the European Monetary System, a scaled-down version of Bretton Woods.

Since there is no available Czech panel data we modelled pseudo-panel data on lifetime earnings of employees on the basis of real cross-sectional data. Then the present values of lifetime contributions paid to and lifetime pensions received from the system were derived from the simulated lifetime earnings. The analysis revealed that the Czech pension security redistributes the funds from the higher-income participants to the lower-income ones and from men to women. Furthermore the Gini coefficients confirmed that the scheme reduces income inequality. The results proved that the solidarity principle built in the pension formula prevails over the benefit principle, which is also present in the formula, when the benefit component is relatively more favourable for the rich employees because of the shape of the lifetime earnings function.","[Klazar, Stanislav; Slintakova, Barbora] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Klazar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",klazar@vse.cz,"Klazar, Stanislav/C-4619-2008","Slintakova, Barbora/0000-0002-7412-479X",,,,,26,9,9,0,15,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Each of these models was estimated based on three error distributional assumptions. The findings of the study are as follows: First, volatility is largely persistent and asymmetric. Second, risk at both aggregate and disaggregate level is generally not a priced factor on the South Africa (SA) stock market. Third, the threshold autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (TARCH) model under the generalised error distribution is the most appropriate model for conditional volatility of the SA stock market. Fourth, volatility generally increases over time, and its trend structurally breaks during financial crises and major global shocks. The policy and investment implications of the findings are outlined.","[Chinzara, Zivanemoyo] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Mandimika, Neville Zivanayi] Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Rhodes University,"Chinzara, Z (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Finance & Econ, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",nev.mandimika@gmail.com; zchinzara@yahoo.com,,,,,,,60,17,17,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Unfortunately, most of the countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol have not taken effective action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, with many Kyoto countries not looking likely to reach their targets. There is also a lack of enthusiasm from major developing countries to take on the binding targets that form the basis of the Kyoto Protocol Approach. This has raised serious doubts about the viability of the Kyoto policy of committing countries to targets and timetables especially as a model for the current negotiations. As the science becomes more compelling that action is needed to curb greenhouse gas emissions, countries are beginning to look for more sustainable alternatives for the period beyond 2012. This paper outlines the key features that are needed in a new climate change framework beyond Kyoto drawing on lessons from monetary history. Using the analogy to the way modern central banks run monetary policy, it outlines an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, which is a system of national climate policies coordinated around a common global price for carbon.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, CAMA, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Mckibbin, WJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, CAMA, Crawford Bldg 132, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia.",warwick.mckibbin@anu.edu.au,"McKibbin, Warwick J/A-4919-2008","McKibbin, Warwick J/0000-0002-1604-1021",,,,,15,4,4,0,14,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

In this paper I suggest an additional way of assessing inequality of opportunity with two indices of dissimilarity across distributions. The indices are based on a traditional homogeneity test of multinomial distributions and are similar to the square coefficient of variation (Reardon and Firebaugh, Sociol Method 32:33-67, 2002). Their properties are studied, as well as their usefulness and limitations in applications when both circumstances and advantages/outcomes are multidimensional. An empirical application measures changes in inequality of opportunity from an old to a young cohort in Peru.

According to the official data. Taiwan's private enterprises have cumulatively invested about US$ 150-280 billion in China since 1987. However, the figures are widely perceived to be an underestimation and there exists a huge gap even between the estimations conducted by different government departments. The purpose of this paper is to re-estimate Taiwan's net foreign assets (NFA) against China, revising the so-called dark matter hypothesis proposed by Hausman and Sturzenegger (2006, 2007). In contrast to the current statistics being limited to registered direct investment or census investigation, the advantage of our model is that direct investment, portfolio investment, and the possible knowledge and property spillovers are included. We show that changes in Taiwan's NFA against China over GDP are negative in economic and political turmoil, such as the missile crisis in 1995, Asian financial crises in 1997-98, and global tsunami in 2007-09. From 2000, the growth rates we simulate are never lower than the official data till 2009. We also suggest some possible economic causes that lead to the huge Taiwan's NFA against China.

The first saving puzzle is identified by the time trend of household saving rates, which were stable before 1998, but surged subsequently. The second saving puzzle is associated with the various age profiles of household saving rates, which are not only inconsistent with the prediction of the Life Cycle Hypothesis, but also different from the patterns observed in other economies. This paper constructs pseudo-panel data and empirically examines the applicability of the habit-formation model in solving the second saving puzzle through the existence of saving rates and the effects of income-related variables. On the other hand, the parametric changes of such variables help explain the first saving puzzle. The parametric changes possibly stem from the adjustment of habit stock, the rising transitory shocks of income, and the higher expenditure needs for housing.","Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Zhou, SJ (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhoushaojie@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,34,6,6,2,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Daily data on the Japanese foreign exchange intervention and the Yen/Dollar exchange rates among other macroeconomic variables over the period 1992-2004, in an EGARCH time series model is used to measure the impact of intervention on both the level and volatility of the exchange rate. This paper offers two important results in regard to the effectiveness of the Japanese FXI. First, this study tests whether the pattern of FXI leads to conflicting outcomes with respect to the desired level and volatility of the exchange rates. Second, this study examines the asymmetric impact of the frequency and size of the Japanese FXI on the level and volatility of the exchange rate. This paper finds that successful depreciation of the yen has always been achieved at the expense of higher volatility, a result that supports the conflicting outcomes of the Japanese FXI. In addition, the frequency of intervention is found to be a crucial factor in affecting the level of the exchange rate while the size of intervention is more influential in affecting its volatility.

This study takes the joke seriously by investigating whether an agent's wish for a scientific hypothesis to be true affects the agent's belief that the hypothesis is true. Using theories in psychology of cognitive bias we argue that, given certain circumstances, a positive preference-expectation relationship is actually expected, and we test the theoretical prediction using a sample of students in economics and science. The scientific hypothesis used in our empirical inquiry is the highly debated Porter hypothesis. The Porter hypothesis suggests that environmental regulations, such as those restricting firms to reduce pollution, stimulate innovations and create a win-win situation for the environment and for firms. Our results show that the students in economics who care more about the environment are more likely to believe in the Porter hypothesis. The results are in line with Fuchs et al.

A test of rational expectations,ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Animal spirits; Imperfect information; Boom-bust cycles,STOCK-MARKET,"Using data for the US economy from 1995 to 2008, I estimate a business cycle model in which consumers form expectations rationally, and an alternative model that explicitly allows for deviations from rational expectations in the form of overreaction to noisy signals. The second model does not have any advantage in explaining the movements in consumption and productivity in this period. Therefore, I cannot reject the hypothesis that consumers behaved rationally. The rather exuberant movements of this episode are rationalized by a story in which permanent income consumers find it hard to distinguish between permanent movements in productivity and temporary ones. Consumers who update their beliefs about trends in productivity on the basis of fairly noisy signals adjust their behavior very slowly. After the 1995-2000 productivity boom, consumers learnt very slowly about a subsequent decline in productivity growth, which led to financial and trade imbalances that ended in a correction starting around 2007. The whole boom-bust cycle was long, taking about 14 years to complete. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We first estimate parameters of a life-cycle model. Our specification includes non-separable preferences and possible disability. It predicts a consumption-expenditure change at retirement. We use the magnitude of the expenditure change, together with households' retirement-age decisions, to identify key structural parameters. The estimated magnitude of the change in consumption-expenditure depends importantly on the treatment of consumption by adult children of the household. Simulations indicate that the reform could increase retirement ages one year or more, equivalent variations could average more than $4000 per household, and income tax revenues per household could increase by more than $14,000.

The bivariate nature of our data set also allows us to explore the interaction between the two hypothesized opinion formation processes, while consideration of the simultaneous weekly changes of the stock index DAX enables us to study the influence of sentiment on returns. Technically, we extend the maximum likelihood framework for parameter estimation in agent-based models introduced by Lux (2009a) by generalizing it to bivariate and tri-variate settings. As it turns out, our results are consistent with strong social interaction in short-run sentiment. While one observes abrupt changes of mood in short-run sentiment, medium-term sentiment is a more slowly moving process in which the influence of social interaction seems to be less pronounced. The tri-variate model entails a significant effect from short-run sentiment on prices in-sample, but its out-of-sample predictive performance does not beat the random walk benchmark.

Production is characterized by a complementarity between the quality of the capital stock and the specific skills of workers using the capital stock. Hence, productivity changes in a region are influenced both by the investment of local firms in high quality capital goods and by the evolution of the specific skill distribution of workers employed in the region. We show that various labor market integration policies yield, via differing regional worker flows, to distinct regional distributions of specific skills. Through this mechanism, relative regional prices are affected, determining the shares that the regions can capture from overall consumption good demand. There occurs a trade-off between aggregate output and convergence of regions with closed labor markets resulting in relatively high convergence but low output, and more integrated labor markets yielding higher output but lower convergence.

The HIP assumes that individual labor income grows deterministically at an unobserved rate and contains a persistent but stationary component, while the RIP assumes that income contains a random walk, a stationary component, and no unobserved deterministic growth-rate component. I show that if idiosyncratic labor income contains a persistent component, a deterministic household-specific trend, and a random-walk component, then all of the components can be identified in small unbalanced panels. Using data on idiosyncratic labor income growth from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I find that the estimated variance of deterministic income growth is zero, that is, the HIP model can be rejected.

Their adoption, however, remains rather low, while their impact on productivity is substantial and differentiating with respect to technological characteristics. Energy intensity, being such an obvious characteristic, could be employed to classify EET adopters thus giving rise to two heterogeneous technologies (i.e. those corresponding to firms of low and high energy consumption). Hence, this paper examines the impact of energy intensity on the productivity growth of firms adopting EET in varying time intervals through a metafrontier-based framework, while also decomposing that impact in terms of technical, efficiency and scale-efficiency changes. The analysis is complemented by examining the role of firm-specific characteristics on the productivity growth through linear regression. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.v.

Our study investigates a behavioral phenomenon through which inequality might have adverse effects on economic growth. In particular we investigate whether or not individuals exhibit a discouragement effect in the face of inequality that leads to lower work effort. If such an effect exists, it provides a mechanism for converting even idiosyncratic inequality into sustained inequality with adverse consequences for the individuals being affected by the inequality and the economy as a whole. We investigate this phenomenon using an economic experiment to allow us to cleanly vary the nature of inequality and to allow us to directly observe several characteristics of the workers. We find robust support for the existence of a discouragement effect lending credibility to the claims that such an effect would exist in external situations among workers confronted with disadvantageous inequality.","[Ku, Hyejin] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Salmon, Timothy C.] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Umphrey Lee Ctr, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Southern Methodist University,"Ku, HJ (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, 113 Collegiate Loop,Room 263,POB 3062180, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",hku@fsu.edu; tsalmon@smu.edu,"Salmon, Tim C/A-7595-2009","Ku, Hyejin/0000-0001-7291-4969",,,,,29,12,14,7,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

A comparison of the estimated model parameters suggests that, in Slovakia, the output gap is less sensitive to real interest rate movements and prices experience greater inertia. The estimated monetary policy reaction functions show Macedonia and Slovakia as inflation targeters, with Macedonia as the more conservative one, despite its officially applied exchange rate targeting regime. The differences in the estimated parameters imply differing transmission mechanisms for Macedonia and Slovakia. Consequently, the variance of domestic variables in Slovakia is most influenced by monetary policy shocks, while there is no single dominating shock explaining the volatility of Macedonia's macroeconomic variables. The exchange rate shock, the monetary policy shock and the demand shock are jointly important in determining the volatility of Macedonia's variables. The model simulations indicate that Macedonia experiences lower output gap and inflation volatility than Slovakia. This comes, nevertheless, at the cost of higher interest rate and real exchange rate volatility in Macedonia, which could be an indication of more volatile financial markets with possible negative implications for financial stability.

We consider two types of models, a mean-reverting model, and a spike model with mean reversion that incorporates two different speeds of mean reversion; one for the fast mean-reverting behaviour of prices after a jump occurs, and another for the slower mean reversion rate of the diffusive part of the model. We also extend these models to incorporate time-varying volatility in their specification, modelled as a GARCH and an EGARCH process. We compare the relative goodness of fit of the different modelling variations both in sample, using Monte Carlo simulations, as well as out-of-sample, in a Value-at-Risk (VaR) setting. Our results indicate the presence of a leverage effect for WTI, Heating Oil and Heating Oil-WTI crack spread, whereas for the remaining energy markets we find the presence of an inverse leverage effect. Also, the addition of the EGARCH specification for the volatility process improves both the in-sample fit as well as the out-of-sample VaR performance for most energy markets that we examine.

We propose to measure an agent's sacrifice at an allocation by the size of the set of feasible bundles that the agent prefers to her consumption. As a solution, we select the allocations at which sacrifices are equal across agents and this common sacrifice is minimal. We then turn to the manipulability of this solution. In the tradition of Hurwicz (1972), we identify, under some mild assumptions on preferences, the equilibrium allocations of the manipulation game associated with this solution when all commodities are normal: for each preference profile, each equal-division constrained Walrasian allocation is an equilibrium allocation: conversely, each equilibrium allocation is equal-division constrained Walrasian. Furthermore, we show that if normality of goods is dropped, then equilibrium allocations may not be equal-division constrained Walrasian. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The general pattern is robust across alternative levels of initial foreign indebtedness. While lasting imbalance correction requires a contraction of debt-financed domestic demand, supply-side reform can mitigate the associated output contraction. A scenario is given as illustration that would reverse the 20% competitiveness loss in the EMU periphery during the 2000s and reduce foreign and government debt by 30% and 50% of GDP within ten years.

Depending on the agent's default behaviour, it can be optimal for the principal to propose an incomplete contract (that keeps the agent unaware) or a complete contract. The key trade-off is that of enlarging the agent's choice set versus adding costly incentive constraints. If agents differ in their unawareness, optimal contracts show a self-reinforcing pattern: if there are few unaware agents in the economy optimal contracts promote awareness, if unawareness is wide spread optimal contracts shroud the contracting environment, thus keeping the agent unaware.","[Von Thadden, Ernst-Ludwig] Univ Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany; [Zhao, Xiaojian] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Mannheim; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Von Thadden, EL (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany.",,,"Zhao, Xiaojian/0000-0001-8821-9602",,,,,49,21,25,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

However, as this paper argues, many of the shortcomings stemming from these assumptions, together with the consequent economic policy of light regulation, were clearly revealed by the collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. This nearly brought about the collapse of the U. S. banking system and gave a clear practical demonstration that the economy is nonergodic. The paper discusses the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management and shows how the lessons derived from that crisis were not learned. It also highlights the dangers of assuming that uncertainty can simply be treated as risk, as the Post Keynesians have long argued. Furthermore, it argues, following Akerlof (2007), that case studies can be just as, or indeed more, revealing than econometric testing.","[Allington, Nigel F.

This paper attempts to investigate whether changes in the specification of distribution specification and regime shifts will affect the inflation-uncertainty relationship. Empirical results show that these two factors have a vital effect on the inflation-uncertainty relationship. A specification with four states and the Student's t distributed error terms can successfully describe the dynamics of the inflation rate. After taking the non-normal density and independent regime shifts into account, this paper finds that inflation uncertainty has no impact on inflation, regardless of inflation pressure.

Low fertility and a gender wage gap persist in Japan. This paper presents a model where endogenous increases in the price of child-care and gender equity in the allocation of capital play important roles in the effect of per capita income growth and rising female relative wages on fertility. Results indicate that a positive relationship between fertility and per capita income is not robust: overall fertility rises with female relative wages if child-care productivity is sufficiently high; female relative wages may not rise with per capita income if men work with increasing capital relative to women.,"Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Day, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, HC Coombs Bldg 9, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",creina.day@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,31,17,20,4,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Platforms sell broadband Internet access services to residential consumers and may set fees to content and application providers on the Internet. When access is monopolized, cross-group externalities (network effects) can give a rationale for network neutrality regulation (requiring zero fees to content providers): there exist parameter ranges for which network neutrality regulation increases the total surplus compared to the fully private optimum at which the monopoly platform imposes positive fees on content providers. However, for other parameter values, network neutrality regulation can decrease total surplus. Extending the model to a duopoly of residential broadband ISPs, we again find parameter values such that network neutrality regulation increases total surplus suggesting that network neutrality regulation could be warranted even when some competition is present.

Social norms are modeled as a constraint on the allocation of household labor that diminishes the gains of entering a partnership, especially for highly educated women with a higher opportunity cost of time. Results using individual level data from 7 waves of the European Community Household Panel (1995-2001) confirm the predictions from the theory. These results are robust to controlling for country varying factors such as childcare policies and divorce rates, and are mostly driven by marriage (as opposed to cohabitation) decisions. Given that household formation is a necessary prerequisite to having children, our results potentially shed light onto the process of below replacement fertility and the economic challenges associated with it.","[Ignacio Gimenez-Nadal, J.; Alberto Molina, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Sevilla-Sanz, Almudena] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Alberto Molina, Jose] IZA Inst Study Labor, Bonn, Germany",University of Zaragoza; University of Oxford; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Gimenez-Nadal, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, C Gran Via 2,3rd Floor, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",ngimenez@unizar.es,"Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/H-4276-2015; Molina, Jose Alberto/H-1676-2015","Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-1610-5451; Molina, Jose Alberto/0000-0002-9437-4606",,,,,65,21,21,2,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

First, the National Pension Scheme and the National Health Insurance need to be improved. Second, Korea should develop well-targeted social programs and expand the earned income tax credit. Third, it is important to reduce labor market dualism, a major cause of inequality due to the large wage gap between regular and non-regular workers. Fourth, education reform is needed to lower the financial burden of tertiary education, reduce the heavy reliance on hagwon and increase spending on preprimary education. At the same time, it is essential to maintain a sound fiscal position by increasing tax revenues, primarily through indirect taxes and environmental taxes, to cover rising social spending.","OECD, F-75775 Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Jones, RS (通讯作者)，OECD, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris, France.",randall.jones@oecd.org,"Vyacheslav, Gromyko/I-5054-2012",,,,,,23,5,6,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

This study assumes the incentives embedded in the unemployment insurance system have a heterogeneous impact, depending on the type of labour market transition (quits versus layoffs and recalls versus new job entrances) and on a worker's attachment to the labour market (gender and type of contract). The layoff hazard rate increases as workers qualify for unemployment benefits, whilst the quit hazard rate remains stable. Similarly, employment inflow increases sharply after the exhaustion of unemployment benefits. The timing and importance of the exit differ between recalls and new job entry and depend on a worker's attachment to the labour market. The results show that unemployment benefits appear to favour job turnover and both firms' and workers' decisions seem to matter. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the effect of hours of work on social interaction. The empirical work is complicated by the argument that unobserved factors could increase both hours of work and social interaction. The empirical work in this paper employs an exogenous decline in hours of work in France due to a new employment law to bypass this endogeneity problem. The data employed are derived from the 1999-2003 Continuous Survey of Household Living Conditions which is a random sample of French households. Gender specific results from a difference-in-difference model show that the employment laws reduced hours of work but there is no evidence that the extra hours went to increased social interactions. Contrary to the intuitive argument, the paper concludes that in the range of approximately 94 extra hours of leisure per year, hours of work have no effect on social interaction.","[Saffer, Henry] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lamiraud, Karine] ESSEC Business Sch, Paris, France; [Lamiraud, Karine] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Paris, France",National Bureau of Economic Research; ESSEC Business School; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Saffer, H (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hsaffer@gc.cuny.edu; lamiraud@essec.edu,,,,,,,20,6,7,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The availability of five years of birth data following the introduction of the baby bonus allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the policy implications than is current in the literature. The focus of this paper is to identify if there is a positive fertility choice response to the introduction of the Australian baby bonus policy and if this response is sustained over time. To do this, 19 years of birth and macroeconomic data, beginning in 1990, is analysed using an unobservable components model. The results indicate a significant increase in birth numbers ten months following the announcement of the baby bonus, and this overall increase was sustained up to the end of the observed period. A cumulative growth in birth numbers which commenced in January 2006 slows in 2008 and 2009. It is suggested that the initial increase in births, identified in March 2005, is a direct fertility response to the introduction of the policy, and that the subsequent change in the growth of birth numbers may be the result of a delayed effect working through a number of channels. We estimate that approximately 108,000 births are attributable to the baby bonus over the period, at an approximate cost of $43,000 per extra child.","[Sinclair, Sarah; Boymal, Jonathan; De Silva, Ashton] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Sinclair, S (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, 239 Bourke St, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",sarah.sinclair@rmit.edu.au,"De Silva, Ashton/L-5537-2019","De Silva, Ashton/0000-0002-1280-4511; Sinclair, Sarah/0000-0002-7143-387X",,,,,28,12,15,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

The analysis is based on a detailed and original database of 51 technology transfer offices (TTOs) categorised by the type of university to which they belong, for the period 2003-07. Overall, we find a low level of efficiency and both intra- and intercategory efficiency variation. Analysis of the determinants shows that the efficiency of French TTOs depends primarily on the nature of the category (with universities specialised in science and engineering being most efficient), and on institutional and environmental characteristics. Both the age of the TTO and the size of the university have a positive effect. In terms of environmental variables, the intensity of R&D activity (both private and public) has a positive impact; however, in terms of growth rate, private R&D activity seems to be the main driver. Lastly, we find that the presence of a university-related hospital is detrimental to efficiency.

This paper reports on the creation of four Smart State Institutes at the University of Queensland in Australia and the concatenation of circumstances, decisions and actions that led to their formation. In the course of just over a decade, these Institutes, addressing biotechnology, nanotechnology, neuroscience and the molecular and cellular basis of disease, have developed into a cluster of scientific research of global significance, raising over $1 billion in investment and employing 1300 staff. A case study approach was employed in the analysis, involving 59 semi-structured interviews with key individuals involved at the organisational, regional and national levels. A range of archival data were collected and analysed to help construct a rigorous chronology of the key events, reports and actions that led to the development of the Institutes. Our research identifies the importance of the policy context, at both the Federal and State levels, conducive to the investment in the new Institutes. It shows how the University's leadership and strategy took advantage of policy conditions, with a number of individual academic entrepreneurs providing the actions necessary to shape and guide the creation of the Institutes. Private philanthropy played a crucial role as animateur amongst the contributors. We argue the importance of the mutually reinforcing and concurrent contribution of all these actors and draw lessons for future government and university policy.","[Dodgson, Mark; Staggs, Jonathan] Univ Queensland, Sch Business, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Dodgson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Business, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",mark.dodgson@uq.edu.au,"Dodgson, Mark/A-5953-2008","Dodgson, Mark/0000-0001-8532-946X",,,,,40,17,19,1,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We consider both static and dynamic systems with random mutation, partial matching arising from search, and type changes induced by matching. Under independence assumptions at each randomization step, we show that there is an almost-sure constant cross-sectional distribution of types in a large population, and moreover that the multi-period cross-sectional distribution of types is deterministic and evolves according to the transition matrices of the type process of a given agent. We also show the existence of a joint agent-probability space, and randomized mutation, partial matching and match-induced type-changing functions that satisfy appropriate independence conditions, where the agent space is an extension of the classical Lebesgue unit interval.

Using the Chinese provincial-level data during the period 1992-2006, we find that the transition of provincial leaders seems to have no significant effect on expenditure composition, either in the short run or long run. However, if the origins of provincial leaders are taken into consideration, only when they are from the central ministries, the replacement of the party secretary is associated With significant changes in the composition of government expenditure in the long run. Moreover, in comparison with other regions, the composition of government expenditure in autonomous regions is more likely to remain stable in the short run when the replacement of provincial party secretary occurs.","[Feng, Juncheng; Zhang, Kezhong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Hao, Rui] Shenzhen Univ, Inst Adv Study, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Shenzhen University,"Zhang, KZ (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",chengchengwhut@126.com; ruihao@hotmail.com; liyang0202@hotmail.com; th928@163.com,,,,,,,27,3,4,0,16,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

We present an application to evaluate credit rationing in the U.S. credit market. Using U.S. monthly data (1952.1-2008.1) and using inflation as the underlying state variable, we find that credit is not rationed for levels of inflation that are either very low or very high; and for the remaining values of inflation, we find that credit is rationed and the Mundell-Tobin effect holds.","[Hernandez-Verme, Paula] Univ Guanajuato, Dept Econ & Finance, Guanajuato 36250, Gto, Mexico; [Gao, Qi] SW Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Gu, Jingping] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Universidad de Guanajuato; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Hernandez-Verme, P (通讯作者)，Univ Guanajuato, Dept Econ & Finance, UCEA Campus Marfil, Guanajuato 36250, Gto, Mexico.",jgu@walton.uark.edu; paulaherver@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,14,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

We use the t-statistic corresponding to the slope coefficient in a predictive regression model for in-sample predictions, while for the out-of-sample, the MSE-F and the ENC-NEW tests statistics with good power properties were utilised. To guard against data mining, a bootstrap procedure was employed for calculating the critical values of both the in-sample and out-of-sample test statistics. Furthermore, we use a procedure that combines in-sample general-to-specific model selection with out-of-sample tests of predictive ability to further analyse the predictive power of each financial variable. Our results show that, for the in-sample test statistic, only the stock returns for our major trading partners have predictive power at certain short and long run horizons. For the out-of-sample tests, the Treasury bill rate and the term spread together with the stock returns for our major trading partners show predictive power both at short and long run horizons. When accounting for data mining, the maximal out-of-sample test statistics become insignificant from 6-months onward suggesting that the evidence of the out-of-sample predictability at longer horizons is due to data mining. The general-to-specific model shows that valuation ratios contain very useful information that explains the behaviour of stock returns, despite their inability to predict stock return at any horizon. The model also highlights the role of multiple variables in predicting stock returns at medium- to long run horizons. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Forward induction equilibrium exists for all finite extensive form games with perfect recall. It may not satisfy backward induction.

It shows that firms charge higher free-on-board (net of transportation costs, hereafter noted as fob) unit values on exports to more distant countries. This finding holds within firms and products, and across destinations. The price premium paid by distant consumers is due to firms charging higher fob prices, and to higher transportation costs. A simple decomposition of the elasticity of import prices to distance shows that, after a fall in transport costs, almost 80% of the decline in import prices enjoyed by consumers is due to firms charging lower fob prices. This suggests a new channel through which changes in transport costs may affect welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Within this context, as economic geographers, our concern in this paper is with the usefulness of the idea of emergence for studying the economic landscape and its evolution. The paper considers in what sense geographical processes and places can legitimately be described as emergent, how such places themselves produce emergent effects, and how we should conceive of and study the 'emergent' space economy. To do this, we apply Deacon's (2006) models of first-order, second-order and third-order emergence, and trace through their implications for constructing an 'emergence perspective' in economic geography. The notion of third-order emergence is argued to be the most promising, since it focuses explicitly on emergence as an evolutionary process. What is evident, however, is that a notion developed mainly for applications in physical and biological systems requires further elaboration and exploration if it is to provide explanatory leverage in studying the evolution of economic landscapes.

Rating agencies were criticized because of their ratings and failure to predict the bankruptcy of the banks. Based on this observation, we investigate whether the forecast of the rating of bank's financial strength using publicly available data is consistent with those of the credit rating agency. We use the data of Turkish banks for this investigation. We take a country-specific approach because previous studies found that proxies used for environmental factors (political, economic, and financial risk of the country) did not have any explanatory power and it is hard to find international data for other important factors such as franchise value, concentration, and efficiency. We use two popular multivariate statistical techniques (multiple discriminant analysis and ordered logistic regression) to estimate a suitable model and we compare their performances with those of two mostly used data mining techniques (Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network). Our results suggest that our predictions are consistent with those of Moody's financial strength rating in general.. The important factors in rating are found to be profitability (measured by return on equity), efficient use of resources, and funding the businesses and the households instead of the government that shows efficient placement of the funds.

The paper describes, for the first time, the evolution of the price of wind power in China, and provides estimates of how technology adoption, experience in building wind farm projects, wind turbine manufacturing localization, and wind farm economies of scale have influenced the price of wind power. The learning curve model presented includes several important control variables, namely, wind resource indicators and steel prices. The results indicate that joint learning from technology adoption and learning-by-doing through cumulative installed capacity, wind turbine manufacturing localization, and wind farm economies of scale comprise the three most significant factors associated with reductions in the price of wind power in China during the period under consideration. The two types of learning investigated are associated with a 4.1%-4.3% price reduction per doubling of installed capacity, providing an estimate of the evolution of the price of wind power, a technology widely used in other markets, which in China has benefited from technology leapfrogging, established supply chains, and operational experience in other countries. Because of the change of bidding rules in 2007, our estimates can be interpreted as the lower bound of the true joint learning rates. Our model also indicates that most learning about the installation and operation of wind farms was common to the whole industry (i.e., we found little evidence for intra-firm learning). The policies that have contributed to the growth of the Chinese knowledge stock through the promotion of technology adoption are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of the paper is to assess the relative importance of stochastic payoffs and expected payoffs in the learning process. A general learning model which nests several variations of reinforcement learning, belief-based learning, and experience-weighted attraction learning is used to analyze behavior in coordination game and prisoner's dilemma experiments with probabilistic payoffs. In all experiments, some subjects learn from past lottery outcomes, though the importance of these stochastic payoffs relative to expected payoffs depends on the game. Stochastic payoffs are less important when posted probabilities are equal to expected payoffs and more important when subjects are informed how much they would have earned from foregone strategies.

The results indicate direct, one-period-ahead, unidirectional causality from exports to GDP in Haiti. Rwanda and Sierra Leone, and from GDP to exports in Angola, Chad and Zambia. Considering the FDI-Growth nexus, there is evidence of FDI Granger-causing GDP in Benin and Togo, and GDP Granger-causing FDI in Burkina Faso, Gambia, Madagascar and Malawi. While studying EXP-FDI relations, this paper finds that the causality is from FDI to real exports in Benin, Chad, Haiti, Mauritania, Niger, Togo and Yemen, and from real exports to FDI in Haiti, Madagascar, Mauritania, Malawi, Rwanda, Senegal and Zambia.

I draw on the most important innovations from various legal traditions to propose a concept of the rule of law likely to find general support. To make the concept measurable, an ideal approach is contrasted with a pragmatic one. The pragmatic approach consists of eight different dimensions. I show that the bivariate correlations between them are usually very low, evidence that more fine-grained indicators of the rule of law, rather than a single hard-to-interpret one, are necessary for its measurement.

For less integrated markets, the inflation-price dispersion nexus is predicted to be asymmetrically V-shaped which results in an optimal inflation rate above zero. For highly integrated markets with low search costs, however, the impact of inflation on price dispersion should only be small.

We show that for an identifiable set of parent-child pairs, parents will rationally underinvest in their child's education. For these parent-child pairs, additional financial aid will increase educational attainment. The model highlights an important feature of higher education finance, the expected family contribution (EFC) that is based on income, assets, and other factors. The EFC is neither legally guaranteed nor universally offered: our model identifies the set of families that are disproportionately likely to not provide their full EFC. Using a common proxy for financial aid, we show, in data from the Health and Retirement Study, that financial aid increases the educational attainment of children whose families are more likely than others to underinvest in education. Financial aid has no effect on the educational attainment of children in other families. The theory and empirical evidence identifies a set of children who face quantitatively important borrowing constraints for higher education.","[Brown, Meta] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Scholz, John Karl; Seshadri, Ananth] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Brown, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA.",,,"Brown, Meta/0000-0003-1842-6037",,,,,45,44,59,2,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Using data from the European Community Household Panel in the 1999-2001 time period, we test the hypothesis that the probability of moving into self-employment is positively related to prior earnings discrimination, as measured by unexplained deviations from expected (male) earnings. Our findings suggest that women who have lower than expected wage sector earnings are more likely to leave wage employment in the following year. The results with respect to discrimination, per se, however, are mixed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The authors use data from 24 OECD countries over the period from 1997 to 2007 and employ instrumental variables fixed effects and dynamic panel estimators in order to account for unobserved heterogeneity as well as the potential endogeneity of migration flows and the high persistence of unemployment.

The domestic energy mix depends on the prices of the sources and on the capability of the household to invest in the energy-consuming appliances required to satisfy those needs. Based on data from a household survey carried out in Mozambique during 2002/3 (IAF), this paper calculates the price and the income elasticities of demand for domestic energy, using an econometric method developed by Deaton. The calculations are made for all households at the national level, differentiating for urban and rural households, and for the northern households of Mozambique. In the econometric formulation, proxies for the ownership of energy appliances per household are used, allowing a simple evaluation of the effects of asset ownership on the demand for energy. Own- and cross-price elasticities for five individual domestic sources are obtained: low-grade sources such as firewood and charcoal are less elastic (elasticities of -0.41 and -0.28 respectively) than candles, kerosene and electricity (respectively -0.88, -0.79 and -0.60). Income elasticities are respectively 0.45, 0.32, 0.93, 0.84 and 0.69, placing firewood and charcoal as the less responsive to income variations and candles and kerosene as the most responsive.

Furthermore, the stable certainty equilibria with small trade vectors define nonsunspot equilibria that are also stable independently of the constraint levels. Instability can develop only at intermediate constraint levels and for nonsunspot equilibria that feature sufficiently large trade vectors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This paper starts with the presumption that mitigation of greenhouse gases is a necessary policy that has to be designed in a cost effective way. It is well known that market instruments are the best option for cost effectiveness. But the discussion regarding which of the various market instruments should be used, how they may interact and what combinations of policies should be implemented is still open and very lively. In this paper we propose a combination of instruments: the marketable emission permits already in place in Europe for major economic sectors and a CO2 tax for economic sectors not included in the emissions permit scheme. The study uses an applied general equilibrium model for the Spanish economy to compute the results obtained with the new mix of instruments proposed. As the combination of the market for emission permits and the CO2 tax admits different possibilities that depend on how the mitigation is distributed among the economic sectors, we concentrate on four possibilities: cost-effective, equalitarian, proportional to emissions, and proportional to output distributions. Other alternatives to the CO2 tax are also analysed (tax on energy, on oil and on electricity). Our findings suggest that careful, well designed policies are needed as any deviation imposes significant additional costs that increase more than proportionally to the level of emissions reduction targeted by the EU.","[Gallastegui, M.

In just barely half a century, China set up a powerful system incorporating large areas protected by the state. The modalities and rationale are described underlying this extension in space and time of national parks. After a brief explanation of the methodology and a definition of the notion of a national park in China, four periods are brought under analysis: 1956-1974, 1975-1985, 1986-1997 and since 1998. The factors are identified that explain variations in the rhythm of park creation and the passage from one period to another.

We begin with an overview of what is new during the last 10-15 years in globalization, productivity, and patterns of US earnings. To preview our results, we then work through four main findings: First, there is only mixed evidence that trade in goods, intermediates, and services has been raising inequality between more- and less-skilled workers. Second, it is more possible, although far from proven, that globalization has been boosting the real and relative earnings of superstars. The usual trade-in-goods mechanisms probably have not done this. But other globalization channels-such as the combination of greater tradability of services and larger market sizes abroad-may be playing an important role. Third, seeing this possible role requires expanding standard Heckscher-Ohlin trade models, partly by adding insights of more recent research with heterogeneous firms and workers.

An empirical analysis reveals that the size of government is larger in those countries that enforce the rule of law. If government expenditures provide some measure of the ability of the ruling class to command resources, this suggests that those with political power could benefit from imposing a fairer and more objective legal structure. Another conjecture is that those in power maintain corrupt governments to pay off their supporters and enhance their ability to remain in power.

The results indicate heterogeneity in bank pricing in the short, but not in the long term. Mortgage rates and firm rates typically adjust to money market changes, but often less than fully in the long run. Large corporate loans have a smaller mark-up than small loans. Consumer rates have a high mark-up and do not exhibit a cointegration relationship with money market rates even in the long run. Next, we examine how bank characteristics determine the nature of interest rate pass-through in a cross-section of Czech banks. We find evidence for relationship lending, as banks with a stable pool of deposits smooth interest rates and require a higher spread as compensation. Large banks are not found to price their products less competitively. Greater credit risk increases vulnerability to money market shocks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An uninformed principal chooses whether to fully delegate her decision-making authority to an informed agent or to retain the authority and communicate with the agent via cheap talk to obtain decision-relevant information. In the game in which the delegation outcome is payoff-dominated by both the truthful and the babbling communication outcomes, we find that principal-subjects almost always retain their authority and agent-subjects communicate truthfully. Significantly more choices of delegation than of communication are observed in another game in which the delegation outcome payoff-dominates the unique babbling communication outcome; yet there is a non-negligible fraction of principal-subjects who holds on to their authority and agent-subjects who transmits some information. A level-k analysis of the game indicates that a principal-subject under-delegates due to the belief that her less-than-fully-strategic opponent will provide information; such belief is in turn consistent with the actual play.

In common with much of the existing empirical literature that models life satisfaction (or subjective well-being) this paper exploits an ordered probit model. In contrast to the existing literature, however, the current study places an important emphasis on regression model evaluation. Diagnostic testing revealed a number of econometric model deficiencies but the explicit incorporation of a variance function into the ordered probit model resolved all detected problems. The tenor of the key findings generally reflects that found in the literature on the determinants of life satisfaction for both advanced capitalist and transitional economies. However, a number of additional themes with a strong Albanian dimension were interrogated. In particular, our study revealed evidence of long memories among Albanian respondents with respect to the collapse of that country's notorious pyramid schemes and the scarring effects of the episode continue to impact on life satisfaction even with the passage of almost eight years. A sizeable effect for communal level criminal activity on life satisfaction was also detected. In addition, our econometric estimates also provided some empirical insights on the monetary value of friendship and the costs of children. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Two parties play a Markov game that combines stages of bargaining, where offers are made, with claim stages, where one side can commit to impose surrender on the other. Under uncertainty on the persistence of claims, long confrontations occur in the unique equilibrium of the game: war arises when reality disappoints initial (rational) optimism, and it persists when both agents are optimists but reality proves both wrong. Bargaining proposals that are rejected initially might eventually be accepted after several periods of confrontation. We provide an explicit computation of the equilibrium, evaluating the probability of war, and its expected losses as a function of (i) the costs of confrontation, (ii) the asymmetry of the split imposed under surrender, and (iii) the strengths of contenders at attack and defense. Changes in these parameters display non-monotonic effects.","[Sanchez-Pages, Santiago] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Sanchez-Pages, Santiago] Univ Edinburgh, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Ponsati, Clara] Inst Anal Econ CSIC, Barcelona 08193, Spain",University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Sanchez-Pages, S (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",clara.ponsati@iae.csic.es; sanchez-pages@ub.edu,,,,,,,36,0,1,0,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

This paper asks how much we might be misled by our economic assessment of climate change when we employ a conventional quadratic damages function and/or a thin-tailed probability distribution for extreme temperatures. The paper gives some numerical examples of the indirect value of various greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration targets as insurance against catastrophic climate change temperatures and damages. These numerical exercises suggest that we might be underestimating considerably the welfare losses from uncertainty by using a quadratic damages function and/or a thin-tailed temperature distribution. In these examples, the primary reason for keeping GHG levels down is to insure against high-temperature catastrophic climate risks.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Weitzman, ML (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mweitzman@harvard.edu,,,,,,,18,170,182,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

This paper tests for the presence of asymmetric information in this market using notarial data on transactions in Paris between 1993 and 2001. We first derive and test empirically a no arbitrage condition stating that the price of a viager has to be equal to its expected returns. Using this condition, we identify the type of the seller as a sum of weighted death probabilities. By comparing these sums with analogously defined national-level sums we find that sellers have on average shorter survival times than persons in the general population. We then develop a model for a viager sale and derive testable predictions under symmetric and asymmetric information. Our test for asymmetric information consists in regressing the contract parameters (down payment and annuity) on the inferred type of the seller, and comparing the estimates with the predicted outcomes. The hypothesis that information is symmetrically distributed between buyers and sellers is accepted. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

While these groups will be consistently more interested in some implications of international currency issuance than others, their specific preferences are likely to be highly context specific. Looking at the cases of the United States and China, we anticipate that domestic sectoral lobbying is unlikely to pressure either the US government to defend the dollar's international role vigorously or the Chinese government to internationalize the renminbi fully. From this domestic sectoral perspective, the future looks to be characterized by reluctant monetary leaders rather than increasingly aggressive currency competition between the United States and China.","[Helleiner, Eric; Malkin, Anton] Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Helleiner, Eric; Malkin, Anton] Univ Waterloo, Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Helleiner, E (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",ehellein@uwaterloo.ca,"Malkin, Anton/S-8880-2017","Malkin, Anton/0000-0002-1943-8251",,,,,70,32,35,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This changed in England before the industrial revolution (de Vries, 1994, 2008; Voth, 1998). Using a model of labor supply where consumption takes time, this paper shows that both an increase in the cost of subsistence and a fall in the price of time-intensive consumption could have generated an increase in hours worked but that only the latter would lead to an increase in the elasticity of labor supply. This model clarifies the role played by consumption in the behavior of labor on the eve of the onset of modern economic growth, distinguishing between an increase in hours worked caused by changing patterns of demand [the case of England] and an increase in hours worked caused by involution [the case of Italy and possibly Japan].

We write the Bowen-Lindhal-Samuelson (BLS) conditions for the optimal provision of the public good in a world divided into N countries, with two periods, present and future, and we simultaneously determine the optimal response in the first and second periods for a given rate of pure time preference. However, the Negishi weights at second period cannot be determined unambiguously, even under a no redistribution constraint within each generation, because they depend on non-observable future incomes; and thus on the answers to two often-overlooked ethical questions: (i) Do rich countries agree on deals which recognize that developing countries may catch up with developed countries in the long run, or do they use their negotiating powers to preserve the current balance of power? And (ii) does each country consider only the welfare of its own future citizens (dynastic solidarity) or does it extend its concern to all future human beings (universal solidarity)? Answers to (i) and (ii)-critical in the debate about how to correct the market failures causing global warming-define four sets of Negishi weights and intertemporal welfare functions, which we interpret as four mandates that countries could give to the Chair of an international negotiation on climate change to find an optimal solution. We find that in all mandates, public good provision expenditures are decreasing functions of income at first period. But each mandate leads to a different allocation of expenditures at second period and to different optimal levels of public good provision at both first and second periods. Finally, we show that only one of these four mandates defines a space for viable compromises.","[Lecocq, Franck] AgroParisTech, Engref UMR Econ Forestiere 356, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Lecocq, Franck] INRA, UMR Econ Forestiere 356, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Hourcade, Jean-Charles] Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, Nogent Sur Marne, France",AgroParisTech; INRAE; AgroParisTech; AgroParisTech,"Lecocq, F (通讯作者)，AgroParisTech, Engref UMR Econ Forestiere 356, F-54000 Nancy, France.",franck.lecocq@nancy-engref.inra.fr,,"Lecocq, Franck/0000-0003-4875-1156",,,,,44,5,5,2,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Relatively few industries see a long-run reduction in trade volumes due to volatility. This indicates that multinational producers in these integrated markets might be able to hedge against exchange-rate risk.

We test this empirically using a specifically designed survey about retirement preparation. We find that people who rely on a rule of thumb behave like literal planners. However, people without any systematic approach save substantially less.

These interpretations usually identify innovation in different environments. It is important to stress that interpretation of innovation in business, industry as well as in public sectors is totally diverse. This complicates the possibility to understand the expression of innovation and more over to assess the level of their penetration. In order to facilitate the understanding of innovation expression in the state level the National Innovation System (NIS) is used as the fundamental instrument. This is a new standpoint highlighted in the article. It is stressed that effective NIS is mostly influenced by various public sectors, private business sectors as well as educational institutions. The business sector is responsible for the inspiration of innovation creation and implementation of appreciable innovative product or service. The public sector is responsible for policy formation and preparation for innovation expansion at the state level. In the expert works different innovation indexes are used in order to assess the value of innovation expression as well as the effectiveness of NIS functioning in the state level. The main peculiarities of these indexes are highlighted in the article. The article solves the scientific problem which is directly correlated with the situation that there is no unit classification of possible indexes (models) for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level. According to all arguments mentioned, the authors of this article raise the aim to use analytical (theoretical) as well as empirical methods to systematize the evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level as well as to present possible methods and areas of it's application (Lithuania's case). To achieve this aim free tasks were solved in the article: to highlight the main peculiarities of existing indexes for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level; to systematize the groups of quantitative and qualitative criteria as well as to perform empirical research in order to present the evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level; to provide the possible methods and areas of application of evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level. The essential result of the research was the classification of possible indexes for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level into two groups. Using the comparison method, all criteria were systematized into 14 quantitative and 11 qualitative criteria. As the consequence of selection of criteria the basic frequently recurrent groups where highlighted (human resource, innovators, economic effect, environment, investment for education, conditions for business provided by public institutions, general infrastructure, scientific output, knowledge creation, investor and creditor conditions, entrepreneurship). The empirical research enabled to specify and adapt for Lithuania the evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level. Finally the possible methods and areas of application of evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level were presented in the article.","[Daugeliene, Rasa; Juocepyte, Simona] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Daugeliene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rasa.daugiliene@ktu.lt; simona.juocepyte@ktu.lt,,,,,,,34,6,8,2,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Although the Great Recession did not greatly change the relative probabilities of job loss for different types of workers, the long-run impact will vary by worker characteristics. Workers who lost long-term jobs during the recession are at increased risk of future job loss due to the loss of protection afforded by long job tenure, and older displaced workers are at relatively high risk of prolonged spells of unemployment and premature retirement. The recent increase in the job vacancy rate with relatively little change in the unemployment rate suggests a decrease in the efficiency of job matching and an increase in the NAIRU. However, this phenomenon may pass once aggregate demand has increased enough to bring vacancy rates back within their normal range and extended unemployment insurance programs have expired.","[Dickens, William T.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dickens, William T.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Triest, Robert K.] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Res Dept, Boston, MA USA",Northeastern University; Brookings Institution; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston,"Dickens, WT (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",wtdickens@gmail.com; Robert.Triest@bos.frb.org,"Dickens, William/HNS-5021-2023",,,,,,63,12,13,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

For this purpose,we test the current account stationarity by means of traditional unit root tests, taking into account the possibility of structural change and changes in the order of integration. We find no evidence of the sustainability of the Spanish current account. In fact, we argue that this lack of sustainability comes from the current account behaviour since the introduction of the euro in the Spanish monetary system.

Nonetheless, we do not expect that new milk dispensers will show up in the future; on the contrary, we expect their number will decrease. It is because the consumers demand for raw milk has been decreasing significantly recently, suggesting that the vending machines were only a consumer fad.

Under each regime, the payback obligation of an educational loan is contingent, to some extent, on an individual's future income.","[Eckwert, Bernhard] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; [Zilcha, Itzhak] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Zilcha, Itzhak] So Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",University of Bielefeld; Tel Aviv University; Southern Methodist University,"Eckwert, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany.",,,,,,,,27,15,17,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0427,,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2012,79.0,313,,,,,76,96,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2010.00871.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,862BD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000298063900004,0

No previous work has considered both exporter and importer income effects and allowed these effects to vary by product. On a large sample of bilateral unit values for 2005, we find that about 56% of all Harmonized System (HS)-6 products demonstrate both significant exporter-income effects and importer-income effects, with the former predominating in prevalence and magnitude.

This article examines if and how much democratic elections of the village leaders affected consumption insurance by Chinese village residents. Exploring a panel dataset of 1,400 households from this period, we find that consumption insurance is around 20 percent more complete with elected village leaders. Furthermore, local elections improve consumption insurance only for the poor and middle-income farmers, but not for the rich. The results are robust when we allow for pretrending, potential endogeneity of elections, and higher measurement errors for rich residents. We also find that the effects on consumption insurance are stronger when closer to the upcoming election year and when the village committees consist largely of non-Communist Party members. These findings suggest that the election effects on consumption insurance partly come from increasing accountability to local constituents.","[Gan, Li] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Gan, Li] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Xu, Lixin Colin] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Yao, Yang] Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; National Bureau of Economic Research; The World Bank; Peking University,"Gan, L (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",gan@econmail.tamu.edu; lxu1@worldbank.org; yyao@ccer.edu.cn,,,,,,,30,7,8,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

This then further negatively affects economic output and impacts back on banks in the form of for example, increased loan losses.

Using data collected from 160 households, we tested a number of hypotheses. Results show that households that perceived destruction, a belief in beneficiaries' responsibility for the forest management, participation in social institutions and governing council favorably determine willingness to contribute. Nevertheless, users' characteristics (age, group membership, income from the forest) had negative effect on willingness. State-driven development and settlers' activities had negatively affected indigenous people's use of forest, leading to a reduction in their willingness. This suggests the need to put effective property rights in place to cause a shift in users' behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis is motivated by contemporary urban economics theory, involving a production function for the competitive sector of the economy ('industry') which includes the level of composite services derived from 'service' firms under monopolistic competition. The outcome is potentially increasing returns to scale resulting from pecuniary externalities deriving from internal increasing returns in the monopolistic competition sector. We extend the production function by also making (log) labour efficiency a function of (log) total public capital stock and (log) human capital stock, leading to a simple and empirically tractable reduced form linking productivity level to density of employment, human capital and public capital stock. The model is further extended to include technological externalities or spillovers across provinces. Using panel data methodology, we find significant elasticities for total capital stock and for human capital stock, and a significant impact for employment density. The finding that the effect of public capital is significantly different from zero, indicating that it has a direct effect even after controlling for employment density, is contrary to some of the earlier research findings which leave the question of the impact of public capital unresolved.","[Gomez-Antonio, Miguel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Publ Finance & Fiscal Syst, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Fingleton, Bernard] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland",Complutense University of Madrid; University of Strathclyde,"Gómez-Antonio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Publ Finance & Fiscal Syst, Campus Somosaguas S-N, Madrid 28223, Spain.",mga@ccee.ucm.es,"Fingleton, Bernard/GZA-5738-2022; Gomez de Antonio, Miguel/Q-5859-2018","Fingleton, Bernard/0000-0001-7359-643X; Gomez de Antonio, Miguel/0000-0002-7138-0587",,,,,64,14,14,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We further investigate whether differences persist after controlling for several socioeconomic characteristics and labour market related variables. Estimating a modified probit model we find that, on average, being an alien lowers the probability of employment after training by approximately 15%. This effect reduces to 10% when controlling for other variables. The effect of education on a trainee's employment chances differs for aliens and nonaliens. Aliens have a markedly lower return on investment in education. Good language skills and a longer in company training period also increase employment probability, but more so for aliens. Other control variables do not significantly improve the explanatory power of the model.

Given the importance of short-term price forecasts in this new environment, this paper estimates and evaluates the forecasting performance of four ARMAX-GARCH models for five MISO pricing hubs (Cinergy, First Energy, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota) using hourly data from June 1, 2006 to October 6, 2007. Our empirical results reveal three important patterns: (a) electricity price volatility is regional and the optimum volatility model depends in part on the hub location, the forecast horizon, and regulated versus unregulated status of the market; (b) the APARCH model performs well in hubs in deregulated states; and (c) volatility dynamics in regulated states are better captured by a simple GARCH model and thus are less complex.

Theoretical considerations suggest that due to political fragmentation in the budgetary process expenditure policy might be prone to a procyclical bias. However, this tendency may be mitigated by strictly enforced expenditure rules. These hypotheses are tested against data from a panel of EU Member States. Our key findings are that (1) deviations between actual and planned government expenditure tend to be positively related to output gap surprises, and (2) expenditure rules reduce this procyclical bias.

We present an agent-based model based on cultural group selection that shows that the patterns observed in the field experiments can be evolved in cases where agents participate regularly in less challenging symmetric public good dilemmas.

For the study period, this fishery is regulated by variants of individual nontransferable quotas. It is shown that interest rates and capital stocks are primary determinants of investments. Another conclusion is that an aggregated model based on the whole fleet gives identical results to models based on individual fleets (disaggregated models) for trawlers and Danish seiners. However, for netters and other vessels, the aggregated and disaggregated models yield different results. In addition, the variance of the estimated parameters is lower in the disaggregated models. This result arises because vessels in the disaggregated models are more homogeneous. Furthermore, investments in machinery, electronics and vessels are governed by one year lagged variables, while investment in gears is governed by present variables for the Danish demersal fishery in the North Sea.","[Jensen, Frank; Andersen, Jesper; Jensen, Carsten Lynge] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Jensen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark.",fje@foi.dk,"Andersen, Jesper Levring/I-1002-2014; Jensen, Carsten Lynge/E-4601-2015","Andersen, Jesper Levring/0000-0001-6963-5053; Jensen, Carsten Lynge/0000-0002-9609-4982",,,,,15,3,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Interfunctional coordination was defined at the beginning of 90s. It is the coordination of all company activities leading to the increase of business performance. Interfunctional coordination is connected with market orientation. It is one of necessary principle of market orientation. It is not possible to use market orientation without interfunctional coordination. Market orientation is based on marketing conception. The first detailed studies were offered by Kohli and Jaworski (1990) and Narver and Slater (1990). Market orientation is described as a method helping to contribute better managing of a company by many researchers. A lot of papers on this topic were publicized during the last two decades. The earliest papers involved the first definitions of market orientation; offered methods for its measuring; and investigated the impact of market orientation on business performance. The last attitudes towards market orientation agree that market orientation enables managers to focus on external and internal elements and activities, which influence the activity of a company leading to its performance increase (Tomaskova, 2009). At present, we have a lot of methods used for the measuring of market orientation. Using a proper method depends on the branch or economic system. The perception of the implementation of market orientation is changing during the period, as well. However, the main principle is still the same - market orientation has a positive impact on business performance. Nowadays, a lot of authors deal with the implementation of market orientation. Because of this reason, we have prepared research Research on implementation on market orientation in Hi-Tech Firms (GA 402/07/1493). The goal of the research was to detect barriers of the implementation of market orientation. We divided the barriers of the implementation into three parts according to managers' influence in an internal, branch and external environment. State, economy and technologies are named as the main elements of external environment. The main barriers connected with the elements of branch environment are quality and quantity of branch stakeholders. Barriers of internal environment involve the barriers connected with the top management and its personality, skills, knowledge and experiences, all employees of a company and interfunctional coordination. The paper deals with the interfunctional coordination at hi-tech firms. The objective of the paper is to define barriers connected with interfunctional coordination and to detect the perception and importance of interfunctional coordination at hi-tech firms. The theoretical knowledge is noticed in some research studies. The data was acquired by means of a questionnaire. New Method measured market orientation in a company. The questionnaire New Method with 7-point Likert scale constituted by Tomaskova (2005) was used for the research. The complete database was analysed by using standard statistical methods (correlation analysis, Spearman correlation coefficient, chi-square) as well as other sophisticated techniques (Cronbach alpha). The main results of the research show that the level of market orientation at the hi-tech firms in the Czech Republic is high and confirm how important is gaining information and using this information inside the company for market orientation. The main results of the research confirm that interfunctional coordination is the base of market orientation. Hi-tech firms in the Czech Republic perceive interfunctional coordination as very necessary presumption for their future development and prosperity. The highest rate for this part received the following statements confirming positive company attitude for innovation, preference for teamwork and mutual cooperation in firms and also effort to be flexible. On the other hand, the lowest average rate had the statement describing relations between superiors and subordinates and their strictness and formalness.","[Kanovska, Lucie] Brno Univ Technol, Brno 61200, Czech Republic; [Tomaskova, Eva] Masaryk Univ, Brno 61180, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology; Masaryk University Brno,"Kanovska, L (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",kanovska@fbm.vutbr.cz; eva.tomaskova@law.muni.cz,"Kanovska, Lucie/AGA-2051-2022; Tomaskova, Eva/D-3973-2014","Kanovska, Lucie/0000-0003-2797-7973; Tomaskova, Eva/0000-0002-0579-4976",,,,,38,19,20,0,35,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This process is important for the success of the experiment and the validity of the results, but it is often not reported thoroughly. In the field of health care, one faces challenges in relation to what makes sense both for the respondent and what has clinical relevance, especially in situations with little evidence and unclear choices, where the decision making process is not clear or informed. This is the case for degenerative spine diseases, where the selection of candidates for surgical rather than non-surgical treatment has been widely discussed and where surgery rates accordingly vary across settings. In the present work, we demonstrated how the qualitative process significantly impacted and guided the design, and it was clear that a less thorough qualitative process would have resulted in a less useable and valid design. To elicit relevant attributes and levels for a DCE, fieldwork in clinical departments in Danish hospitals was performed and has been supplemented by qualitative interviews with patients and doctors. Systematic and thorough qualitative investigation of the decision context relevant attributes and levels and appropriate framing appears valuable in the process of designing a DCE for quantitative pilot testing.","[Klojgaard, Mirja Elisabeth; Sogaard, Rikke] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Appl Hlth Serv Res & Technol Assessment, Odense, Denmark; [Bech, Mickael] Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE Ctr Hlth Econ Res, Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark,"Klojgaard, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Appl Hlth Serv Res & Technol Assessment, Odense, Denmark.",mirk@cast.sdu.dk; mbe@sam.sdu.dk; ris@cast.sdu.dk,"Bech, Mickael/G-2588-2011","Bech, Mickael/0000-0003-3084-2068; Sogaard, Rikke/0000-0003-3557-8550",,,,,44,114,123,1,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

We find that for around 45% of the countries, we are able to reject the unit root hypothesis for each of the three HE series.

The results are concluded by applying descriptive analysis, correlation analysis and regression analysis. 6 determinants (profitability, growth, size, tangibility, risk and investment opportunity) are examined. The purpose is to investigate which factors have strong influence on the leverage. The analysis reveals that profitability, tangibility and investment opportunities have significant negative association with the leverage while the size and growth have significant positive correlation with the leverage.

The OCA criteria used are trade openness, business cycle synchronisation, real exchange rate volatility, inflation convergence and real interest rate cycle synchronisation. The 'performance' of these potential anchor countries is compared before and after the Asian financial crisis. The findings suggest an increase in the potential for China as a monetary anchor in the future but the US dollar likely still is the most obvious choice of anchor currency.

Therefore, governments try to stimulate the merchandises to export and extend their business abroad. This leads to better quality, extended markets, more customers and higher income. For this purpose, governments have considered some persuasive programs to promote exporting activities. However these programs do not influence export activities equally and their importance is different in exporters' viewpoint. In this paper we tried to use exporters' preferences and rank these promotion programs based on their opinions. Accordingly, we selected 15 exporters and asked them to rank 18 identified export promotion programs against to their effects on export procedures. The proposed Fuzzy Linear Assignment Method has assured responders that their uncertainty in ranking will be recognized in model. Finally the proposed method is applied for prioritizing the export promotion programs for Iranian food industry. Its results show that ambiguity of scoring among several options would be easy by considering each number as a triangular fuzzy number and it's more precise and reliable.","[Razavi, Seyed Hossein] Inst Trade Studies & Res, Tehran, Iran; [Hashemi, Shide Sadat] Allame Tabatabaei Univ, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] VilniusGediminasTechnicalUniv, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Allameh Tabataba'i University,"Razavi, SH (通讯作者)，Inst Trade Studies & Res, Tehran, Iran.",s.hossein.r@gmail.com; shide_hashemi@yahoo.com; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi/ABE-8871-2020; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X",,,,,72,5,6,1,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The resulting panel data allow us to identify the causal relationship by controlling for the fixed effects and dynamic factors. We find a significant positive effect of local institutional improvements on outsourcing within lower-middle income countries. In low, upper-middle and high income developing countries, institutional quality is not an important determinant of international outsourcing.","[Roelfsema, Hein; Zhang, Yi] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands.",y.zhang@uu.nl,,,,,,,44,6,6,7,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In addition, our analysis allows for a more general class of sub-utility functions than the one in the Atkinson and Stiglitz theorem, which includes work done or income further to consumption goods and services.

Such deviations from exponential discounting are large enough to make a significant difference in consumption choices over long horizons.

We assess under which assumptions imitation, among noise traders, can give rise to the emergence of gurus and their rise and fall in popularity over time. We study the wealth distribution of gurus, followers and non followers and show that traders have an incentive to imitate and a desire to be imitated since herding turns out to be profitable. The model is then used to study the effect that different competitive strategies (i.e. chartist & fundamentalist) have on agents performance.

Using the national representative household data on international migration in 2008, the results find no self-employment differential between migrant and non-migrant households. International migration matters only if business scale is taken into account. Estimations using the propensity score matching method reveal that Vietnam's migrant households are either poor or rich families. This points to the effectiveness of government labour export programmes designed to reduce poverty and the tendency of rich families to send children to study abroad. The results also show that international migration has no impact on entrepreneurship, and thus employment generation in the informal sector, raising concerns about the lasting impact of migration.","[Thi Bich Tran; Huu Chi Nguyen; Thi Xuan Mai Nguyen; Thi Phuong Thao Ngo] Natl Econ Univ, Dept Stat, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Thi Phuong Thao Ngo] Natl Econ Univ, Dept Real Estate & Resource Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam",National Economics University - Vietnam; National Economics University - Vietnam,"Tran, TB (通讯作者)，Natl Econ Univ, Dept Stat, Hanoi, Vietnam.",tranthibich@yahoo.com,,,,,,,28,4,4,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Secondly, when industrialized countries are in recession, a SOEE suffers an even larger reduction in their growth rate. The obtained results show that if exports respond negatively to the international interest rate or exports are reduced due to an international recession, the aggregated consumption of the domestic economy is substantially more volatile than an economy where exports do not react.

We find a strong announcement effect-19 percent of the response occurs during the first two-month announcement period via credit cards. Subsequently, consumers switched to debit cards after disbursement before finally increasing spending on credit cards in the later months.

The ability to generate income without producing real value-added output is a key characteristic of a rentier economy. Broader indicators include a massive increase in financial activity and finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE), declining manufacturing share, declining real investment in plant and equipment, increased outsourcing of production and rising trade deficits, declining employment and real wage growth, rising profits, growing inequality, and increasing aggregate demand dependency on private (household and business) and public sector debt. Based on these indicators, relative to other advanced countries like Germany, the U.S. has since the mid-1970's increasingly become a rentier economy. Grafting a schematic rentier economy onto a simple free trade unequal exchange model from Baiman (2006) highlights the labor exchange, inequality, and efficiency characteristics of rentier United States, unequal exchange (German), and developing country (China), economies. Reviving the U.S. economy and restoring full employment will require a public policy induced reallocation of resources away from rentier activity back to productive high-value added unequal exchange production.","Benedictine Univ, Lisle, IL 60532 USA",,"Baiman, R (通讯作者)，Benedictine Univ, Lisle, IL 60532 USA.",rbaiman@ben.edu,,,,,,,39,9,11,1,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The most complete and significant studies of performance measures, so far, have been written by Aftalion and Poncet, Le Sourd, Bacon, and Cogneau and Hubner. A review of the most recent literature led us to collect several dozen measures that we classify into four families. We first present the class of relative measures, starting with the Sharpe ratio. Secondly, we analyse absolute measures, beginning with the most famous one - the Jensen alpha. Thirdly, we study general measures based on specific features of the return distribution, where the pioneering contributions are those of Bernardo and Ledoit, and Keating and Shadwick.

Both nonlinear dynamics and structural breaks in unemployment are applied in our examinations. The empirical results without structural changes show that the unemployment hysteresis hypothesis cannot be rejected in all educational attainment categories. After simultaneously incorporating nonlinear processes and smooth structural changes, we find that only the unemployment rate of junior college graduates reveals a mean reverting to the natural rate in the long-run, whereas all other series still support the hysteresis hypothesis. The results indicate that: i) the shocks have only temporary effects on the unemployment rate of the junior college graduates; ii) the labor or macroeconomic stabilization policies could have long lasting effects on unemployment rates of the other educational attainment categories; the unemployment rates of low-skill labor are susceptible to the changes of economic or fiscal policies; and iv) practical and occupational training mechanisms should be implemented and strengthened in the higher education system to alleviate the increasingly serious problem of unemployment.

We define the Civil War as a regime shift that necessitated a structural movement of labor from Southern agriculture to Northern manufacturing, and design empirical tests to determine whether this formulation fits the empirical data better than theories, such as the Beard-Hacker thesis, that characterize the U.S. transformation as an abrupt adjustment to technical shocks.

Following previous theoretical research, mainly Dunning's eclectic model, this paper evaluates the econometric relationship between corruption and foreign direct investment by testing three theoretically-based hypotheses: that corruption perception indicator is a stationary variable, that the relationship between corruption and foreign direct investment stock is statistically weak and that changes in foreign direct investment stock do not Granger cause changes in corruption. The verification is based on unit root tests, panel co-integration and Granger causality models performed on data from the Transparency International, the World Bank and the Heritage Foundation and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) for 94 countries for the years 1998-2007. The results show that there is no significant relationship between the two variables.","[Evan, Tomas] CIEE Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Evan, Tomas] NYU, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bolotov, Ilya] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Evan, T (通讯作者)，CIEE Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",tomas_evan@hotmail.com; ilya.bolotov@vse.cz,"Bolotov, Ilya/I-9483-2019; Evan, Tomas/ABB-3763-2020; Bolotov, Ilya I/L-5695-2013","Bolotov, Ilya/0000-0003-1148-7144; Evan, Tomas/0000-0002-0127-7605;",,,,,34,10,10,1,13,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Our identification results apply to static discrete choice models including binary logit, multinomial logit, nested logit, and probit models as well as to dynamic programming discrete choice models. In these models the only key condition we need to verify for identification is that the type specific model choice probability belongs to a class of functions that include analytic functions. Therefore our identification results are general enough to include most of commonly used discrete choice models in the literature. Our identification argument builds on insights from nonparametric specification testing. We find that the role of analytic function in our identification results is to effectively remove the full support requirement often exploited in other identification approaches.","Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, KI (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",kyookim@skku.edu,"Kim, Kyoo il/AAX-9757-2020","Kim, Kyoo il/0000-0002-2192-9367",,,,,27,2,2,0,9,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

Based on the estimation results of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) and usage rates of end users, this study investigates whether Internet service providers (ISPs) have the incentives to discriminate against application services and whether those incentives change according to various conditions. As a result, ISPs have the incentive to provide a low QoS level for costly application services, and the incentives change according to conditions such as regulatory regimes, the cost of the Internet access service from the ISP, the WTP of the end users, and the degree of competition among the ISPs.

Commons's negotiational psychology, specifically his principle of sovereignty, to the development of a discordant regulatory culture and its likely impact on the economic potential of recreational fishing. Using South African environmental judicial precedents and other documentation, we formulate six plausible hypotheses. We argue that regulatory incoherence, entitlement insecurity, corporate-dominated social valuation, strategic power coalitions, lack of procedural fairness, and the extent of judicial enforcement of environmental rights help explain the economic potential and isolation of the freshwater recreational fisheries sector. We find a consistent pattern of extraction and monopolization of sovereign power by the Department of Mineral Resources from propertied parties. Thus, regulatory domination is a major mechanism affecting the economic potential of recreational fisheries in the Trout Triangle. While Commons postulated that private property is a sufficient condition for participation in the determination and use of sovereign power, we argue that private/public property is only a necessary condition. The conjunctive sufficient condition is the existence of both regulatory coherence between spheres of government and property.","[Marire, Juniours; Snowball, Jen D.; Fraser, Gavin] Rhodes Univ, Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Marire, J (通讯作者)，Rhodes Univ, Grahamstown, South Africa.",,"Fraser, Gavin/R-9525-2019; Snowball, Jen/D-8887-2017","Marire, Juniours/0000-0002-6648-7582; Snowball, Jen/0000-0001-7497-6653",,,,,42,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Public policies based on such models have contributed materially to the practice of mass incarceration in the USA. A survey of similar policing strategies in other venues suggests that such policies almost inevitably lead to exacerbation of organized violence. Adapting a Black-Scholes methodology, it is possible to characterize the 'regulatory investment' needed to manage criminal enterprise under conditions of uncertainty at a scale and level of organization that avoids an atomistic fallacy. The model illuminates how public policy that might seem rational on an individual scale can trigger ecosystem resilience transitions to long-lasting or permanent modes of institutionalized hyperviolence. The homicide waves associated with the planned shrinkage program in New York City that was directed at dispersing minority voting blocks carry implications for national patterns of social disruption in which mass incarceration is an ecological keystone. Continuing large-scale socioeconomic decay, in the specific context of that keystone, greatly increases the probability of persistent, large-scale, organized hyperviolence, as has been the experience in Naples, Sicily, Mexico, and elsewhere.

We calibrate the model to match both cross-sectional and dynamic aspects of US producers related to export participation and the establishment lifecycle. We find a tariff equivalent of fixed export costs of 30 percentage points. We also find that a sizeable share of export profits is a return to the organizational capital from investing in export capacity rather than creating an establishment. We use the model to estimate the effect of reducing tariffs on welfare, trade, and export participation. We find that eliminating an 8 percent tariff increases the ratio of trade to GDP from 3.9% to 7.4% and raises welfare by 1.02%. Along the transition, consumption overshoots its steady state, even as trade and the capital stock grow gradually, so that the change in steady state consumption understates the welfare gain. Models without a dynamic export decision generate more gradual aggregate transition dynamics and smaller gains from trade. Capital accumulation and material usage are important sources of the welfare gains to trade. (C) 2014 Elsevier By.

This optimization goal is called makespan minimization, and the agents are often treated as machines. We give tight deterministic bounds for: (1) two unrelated machines: and (2) m >= 2 related machines. A natural question to ask is whether envy-free pricing techniques can improve the current known bounds for truthful mechanisms for the task-scheduling problem studied in the seminal paper of Nisan and Ronen (2001).

Using members of the United Nations from 1995 to 2012 as the research sample, this study investigated the influence of national leader change on corruption and sovereign rating by analyzing one year after the change in national leadership. The results showed that national leader change exerted a significant, positive effect on the degree of corruption and the sovereign rating one year after the change in national leadership. By including national characteristics, this study found that for countries that have adopted the semipresidential system, national leader change had a significant, negative effect on the degree of corruption and the sovereign rating.

We use a unique village-level data set from the Rwandan genocide to estimate the impact of a popular radio station that encouraged violence against the Tutsi minority population. The results show that the broadcasts had a significant effect on participation in killings by both militia groups and ordinary civilians. An estimated 51,000 perpetrators, or approximately 10% of the overall violence, can be attributed to the station. The broadcasts increased militia violence not only directly by influencing behavior in villages with radio reception but also indirectly by increasing participation in neighboring villages. In fact, spillovers are estimated to have caused more militia violence than the direct effects. Thus, the article provides evidence that mass media can affect participation in violence directly due to exposure and indirectly due to social interactions.","Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Yanagizawa-Drott, D (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,72,237,310,6,80,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The method deals with mirror trade statistics problems, such as the different valuation of imports and exports, and it corrects for double-counting re-exports. The method is tested by means of a decomposition of value added and CO2 emissions embodied in EU27 exports to third countries. When the national SUTs for the period 2000-2007 are used, neglecting intra-European Union spillover and feedback effects results in an underestimation of the embodied value added of 12-15%. Not consolidating the national tables properly leads to a further underestimation of 11-16%. With these underestimations removed, EU27 foreign exports still only explain around 11% of EU27 Gross Domestic Product, whereas they explain 17% of the EU27 CO2 emissions. Hence, the income benefits of these exports are, in relative terms, considerably smaller than their CO2 emission cost.","[Bouwmeester, Maaike C.; Oosterhaven, Jan] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Rueda-Cantuche, Jose M.] Commiss European Communities, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville, Spain",University of Groningen; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Oosterhaven, J (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands.",j.oosterhaven@rug.nl,"Oosterhaven, Jan/ABA-1136-2021",,,,,,54,3,3,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

To provide an answer, we employ a small stochastic New Keynesian model with a zero bound on nominal interest rates and characterize optimal time-consistent stabilization policies. We focus on two policy tools, the short-term nominal interest rate and debt-financed government spending. The optimal policy response to a liquidity trap critically depends on the prevailing debt burden. While the optimal amount of government spending is decreasing in the level of outstanding government debt, future monetary policy is becoming more accommodative, triggering a change in private sector expectations that helps to dampen the fall in output and inflation at the outset of the liquidity trap.

In the Internetworked economy as it is becoming, this is no longer true as value is increasingly jointly created among individuals, as a function of their co-creation experiences. We construct a framework that reconnects economics with value creation that goes beyond artifacts as the central unit of analysis, toward platforms of engagements of which artifacts themselves are only a part. Engagement platforms are now both the means and ends of value creation, and economic theory must take into account both the potential value generated to individuals through production experiences of co-creating artifacts (through co-production engagement platforms), as well as co-creating consumption experiences (through co-consumption engagement platforms). We show how starting with joint value creation re-shapes our thinking about the nature of surplus, expanding traditional economic thinking about supply and demand toward a more convergent space of markets shaped by co-creation experiences.","[Chakrabarti, Avik] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Ramaswamy, Venkat] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Chakrabarti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",chakra@umich.edu; venkatr@umich.edu,,,,,,,23,0,0,2,28,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Specifically, it is shown that a parameter that can be associated with the animal spirits of firms is crucial to the stability of full employment equilibrium in a production economy. This approach to animal spirits is different to that taken by recent New Keynesian DSGE-type models, but similar in spirit to Old Keynesian approaches, including that of the General Theory.

These providers received points for their price bids and for three proxies of the ex-ante quality of their services: their reputation, a description of the intended plans ('methodology') to reintegrate workers, and the number of job placements they expected to achieve. We exploit the fact that the scoring weights of these award criteria changed in the time period under consideration, while the classification of worker types remained similar. Our estimation results show that increases in the scoring weights of the quality components (vis-A-vis the price weight) result in higher price bids. We also find that a higher weight for both the reputation component and the methodology component contributes to the job-placement of workers. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our result indicates that asymmetry, and not welfare-concerning objectives, yields specific results in the literature on mixed oligopoly.","[Matsumura, Toshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Ogawa, Akira] Int Christian Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818585, Japan",University of Tokyo; International Christian University,"Ogawa, A (通讯作者)，Int Christian Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, 3-10-2 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818585, Japan.",matsumur@iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ogawaa@icu.ac.jp,"Matsumura, Toshihiro/F-3997-2010","Matsumura, Toshihiro/0000-0003-0572-6516",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530248] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,34,65,65,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Using panel data on science journals, we are able to circumvent problems plaguing previous studies of the impact of open access on citations. In contrast to the huge effects found in these previous studies, we find a more modest effect: moving from paid to open access increases cites by 8% on average in our sample. The benefit is concentrated among top-ranked journals. In fact, open access causes a statistically significant reduction in cites to the bottom-ranked journals in our sample, leading us to conjecture that open access may intensify competition among articles for readers' attention, generating losers as well as winners.","[McCabe, Mark J.] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [McCabe, Mark J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [McCabe, Mark J.] SKEMA Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Snyder, Christopher M.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Snyder, Christopher M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; SKEMA Business School; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"McCabe, MJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",mccabe@umich.edu; chris.snyder@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,33,83,90,0,69,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Economic agents use simple models to form expectations and need to learn the relevant parameters. Their gain coefficient is endogenous and is adjusted according to past forecast errors. The model is estimated using likelihood-based Bayesian methods. The endogenous gain is jointly estimated with the structural parameters of the system. The estimation results show that private agents appear to have often switched to constant-gain learning, with a high constant gain, during most of the 1970s and until the early 1980s, while reverting to a decreasing gain later on. As a result, the model can generate a pattern of volatility, which is increasing in the 1970s and falling in the second half of the sample, with a decline that can roughly match the magnitude of the so-called Great Moderation in the 1984-2007 period. The paper also documents how a failure to incorporate learning into the estimation may lead econometricians to spuriously find time-varying volatility in the exogenous shocks, even when these have constant variance by construction.

Regulatory authorities regularly ignore firm-specific characteristics, such as size or asset ages, implying different risk exposure in incentive regulation. In contrast, it is common to apply only a single benchmark, the weighted average cost of capital, uniformly to all firms. This will lead to implicit discrimination. We combine models of firm-specific risk, liquidity management and regulatory rate setting to investigate impacts on capital costs. We focus on the example of the impact of component failures for electricity network operators. In a simulation model for Germany, we find that capital costs increase by 0.2 to 3.0 % points depending on the size of the firm (in the range of 3-40 % of total cost of capital).

However, the precise relationship between trust and cooperation (i.e. whether trust leads to cooperation or cooperation leads to trust) remains unclear and it is not known how the level of economic development affects the level of cooperation and trust. Using a combination of public goods, gambling game and trust game experiments, we investigate the links among cooperation, trust and economic development in four regions of China. Our results suggest that, first, there is a U-shaped or V-shaped relationship between cooperation and economic development. Second, on the one hand, cooperation leads to trust, and on the other hand, more cooperative behaviour may be created by rewarding trusting behaviour. Third, men are more cooperative and trusting than women. Furthermore, we find that the widely used GSS trust' question from the General Social Survey (GSS) does not predict either cooperation or trust, whereas the questions GSS fair' and GSS help' have weak predictive power for trusting behaviour but not for cooperative behaviour.","[Shen, Junyi] Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Qin, Xiangdong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Kobe University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Shen, JY (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",shen@rieb.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Shen, Junyi/AFS-9019-2022","Shen, Junyi/0000-0001-5859-1382",,,,,29,2,3,1,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

It demonstrates a one-to-one equivalence between the basic issue of social choice theory (the problem of selection of a well-functioning social choice rule [SCR]) and the problems that majority rule faces (it fails decisiveness in certain preference profiles). It is shown that whenever an SCR works well, majority rule works well, and in these circumstances, the SCR yields the same outcome as majority rule. So whenever majority rule works we can never do better by choosing an alternative SCR. When majority rule does not work well, then any other SCR will face a serious problem, too.

We assume a model in which a network operator provides access to consumers and content providers. The network operator offers two access technologies: an old technology (copper) and a new technology (fiber). Content providers sell both a basic content and a premium content depending on the network technology to which consumers subscribe. We consider two market segments: one in which the network operator only offers the old technology (copper), and the other in which both technologies are offered. The network operator can invest in the new technology to increase its market coverage. We show that a marginal network investment can be beneficial for content providers and increase the consumer surplus, and examine the impacts of the discriminatory regime. We also state that content quality produces contrasted effects in the investment from the network operator depending on how high the consumer valuation for premium content is compared to basic content and the substitutability between both technologies. Finally, high content quality can give incentives to the network operator to invest more in the new technology, and then create a greater positive effect of the discriminatory regime.

These results are in contrast to the case with reversible investments, where a continuum of inefficient equilibrium steady states exists for any level of depreciation, discount factor, and size of population.","[Battaglini, Marco] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Nunnari, Salvatore] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Palfrey, Thomas R.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Princeton University; Columbia University; California Institute of Technology,"Battaglini, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",mbattagl@princeton.edu; snunnari@columbia.edu; trp@hss.caltech.edu,,"Battaglini, Marco/0000-0001-9690-0721",,,,,15,29,36,0,17,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We contribute to this literature by presenting new evidence on the evolution of productivity in the aftermath of recessions. Our method allows us to distinguish between frontier and (in-)efficiency effects of recessions. We present international evidence for a panel of 70 countries for the period 1960-2000. Our results reveal that the average cumulative impact of recessions on productivity up to four years after their end is negative and significant. This, however, results from a mixture of mechanisms. The level of frontier production increases, but the rate of technical progress decreases, leading to a fall in frontier production. Efficiency also falls, lending support to the idea that recessions tend to reduce, rather than increase, economic restructuring. Long and deep recessions are also shown to have distinctive impacts on productivity.","[Christopoulos, Dimitris] Pante Univ, Athens, Greece; [Leon-Ledesma, Miguel A.] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT27NP, Kent, England",Panteion University; University of Kent,"León-Ledesma, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT27NP, Kent, England.",m.a.leon-ledesma@kent.ac.uk,"Leon-Ledesma, Miguel/AAG-8740-2021; Christopoulos, Dimitris/ABH-5594-2020",,,,,,53,7,8,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

These CPB forecasts are all manually modified model forecasts, where the model is a (very) large multi-equation macro model. The CPB forecasts are held against real-time forecasts obtained from simple autoregressive time series models, and for seven of the ten cases, CPB's forecasts are significantly more accurate. Combining CPB's forecasts with the real time autoregressive forecasts shows that four of the ten combined forecasts are significantly better than CPB's forecasts, and seven of the ten are better than the time series forecasts. This suggests that CPB's manual adjustment efforts could perhaps be directed to modifying simple model forecasts and not the forecasts from the own large macro model.","Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Franses, PH (通讯作者)，Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",franses@ese.eur.nl,,"Franses, Philip Hans/0000-0002-2364-7777",,,,,7,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2014,162.0,3,,,,,215,221,,10.1007/s10645-014-9230-z,0.0,,,7,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AO1PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341086000001,0

For some parameters of the problem, a range of alternative incentive schemes also satisfy this criterion.

We build a general equilibrium model with transferable utility where the uncertainty arising from rationing is incorporated in the definition of a commodity, in the spirit of the Arrow-Debreu theory. Prices of commodities then depend not only on their physical characteristics, but also on the probability that their trade is rationed. The standard definition of competitive equilibrium is extended by replacing the market clearing condition with an exogenous matching function which describes a trading technology that is not frictionless. As is typical in search models, the matching function relates the rationing probabilities of buyers and sellers to the ratio of buyers to sellers in the market. When search frictions vanish, our model is equivalent to the continuous assignment model of Gretsky et al. [20]. We adapt their approach, which uses linear programming techniques and duality theory, to show that a competitive equilibrium exists and is constrained efficient in our environment. Our competitive equilibrium notion is equivalent to that of directed (or competitive) search. The strength of our formulation and the linear programming approach is that they allow us to generalize the constrained efficiency and existence results in the directed search literature to a much broader class of economies. Our framework also opens the door to the use of existing algorithms for computing equilibria and taking these models to the data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Excessive wage reductions in the face of negative exogenous shocks or too risky investment decisions represent the main instances of such opportunistic behavior. Fixed wages can represent workers' best response to the emerging risk of the employer moral hazard, but this implies a heightened risk of layoffs since wages and employment levels cannot be fixed at the same time. Besides discussing piece rate contracts, profit-sharing and codetermination as counterexamples, we observe worker cooperatives which depart from the presence of contrasting interests and private information in the principal-agent framework. Indeed, several empirical studies have shown greater employment stability and wage flexibility in worker cooperatives vis-a-vis the capitalist firm.","[Navarra, Cecilia] Univ Namur, CRED, Namur, Belgium; [Navarra, Cecilia] Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy; [Tortia, Ermanno] Univ Trent, Dept Econ, I-38100 Trento, Italy",University of Namur; University of Turin; University of Trento,"Navarra, C (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, CRED, Namur, Belgium.",,,"Tortia, Ermanno/0000-0002-2138-1119",,,,,85,13,18,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We extend the model in several directions: using expected utility as well as nonexpected utility to consider the role of risk aversion, non-linear probability weighting, and loss aversion. We also consider how relevant emotions such as guilt, shame, and indignation play out. Several of these factors support the intuition that wrongful convictions of the innocent do have a larger detrimental impact on deterrence and thus the policy implications are reconciled with the widely shared maxim in dubio pro reo.

We outline a decomposition methodology for investigating the variations that exist when using different multiregional input-output (MRIO) systems to calculate a region's consumption-based account. Structural decomposition analysis attributes the change in emissions to a set of dependent determinants, such as technical coefficients, the Leontief inverse and final demands. We apply our methodology to three MRIO databases - Eora, GTAP and WIOD. Findings reveal that the variation between Eora and GTAP can be attributed to differences in the Leontief inverse and emissions' data, whereas the variation between Eora and WIOD is due to differences in final demand and the Leontief inverse. For the majority of regions, GTAP and WIOD produce similar results. The approach in this study could help move MRIO databases from the academic arena to a useful policy instrument.","[Owen, Anne; Barrett, John] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Steen-Olsen, Kjartan] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway; [Steen-Olsen, Kjartan] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Wiedmann, Thomas] UNSW Australia, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wiedmann, Thomas; Lenzen, Manfred] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys A28, Ctr Integrated Sustainabil Anal, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Leeds; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney,"Owen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",a.owen@leeds.ac.uk,"Barrett, John/K-8867-2014; Wiedmann, Thomas/C-9158-2011; Lenzen, Manfred/D-3161-2013","Wiedmann, Thomas/0000-0002-6395-8887; Owen, Anne/0000-0002-3872-9900; Barrett, John/0000-0002-4285-6849; Lenzen, Manfred/0000-0002-0828-5288",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,64,108,112,8,110,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The results suggest that the market reforms in China have led to a reduction of workers' bargaining power, which in turn explains both the rapid productivity increase and the steady decline in the wage share observed since the beginning of the reforms. The results also suggest that privatization, labor market informalization, and retreat of the state from social provisioning are key factors explaining the decline in the wage share. The current Chinese model of development, however, is unsustainable for economic, social, and environmental reasons, and a sustainable model of development is likely to require a more egalitarian income distribution.","Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Piovani, C (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Dept Econ, 2000 E Asbury Ave, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",chiara.piovani@du.edu,,,,,,,46,9,9,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Three measures for monetary policy surprises are used: 1) the surprise change to the current federal funds target rate, 2) the surprise component to the future path of policy, and 3) the unanticipated announcement of future large-scale asset purchases (LSAP). Estimation results show that monetary policy surprises have economically important and highly significant effects on the level and volatility of energy futures prices and their trading volumes. I find that, on average, a hypothetical unanticipated 100-basis-point hike in the federal funds target rate is associated with roughly a 3% decrease in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices. I also document that, in a narrow window around the FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve's LSAP1 and LSAP2 programs have a cumulative financial market impact on crude oil equivalent to an unanticipated cut in the federal funds target rate of 156 basis points.

The amount of borrowing is limited by a collateral constraint. When either the loan to value ratio declines or house prices fall, we observe a decrease in the money multiplier. We argue that the central bank should respond to the fall in the money multiplier and therefore to the reduction in house prices or the loan to collateral value ratio. We also find that optimal monetary policy generates a large and persistent fall in the money multiplier in response to the drop in the loan to collateral value ratio. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the dual role of the social and physical neighborhood environment as they relate to the eating behaviors of residents of a low-income minority urban neighborhood. We find that both proximity to different types of food sources (a characteristic of the physical neighborhood environment) and dietary intake of neighbors (a characteristic of the neighborhood's social environment) are related to dietary intake. The relationships are most robust for fruits and vegetables consumption. Proximity to fast food sources is related to less fruits and vegetables consumption while the opposite is found for individuals residing closer to fresh food sources. Additionally, individuals whose neighbors report increased fruits and vegetables intake also report higher fruits and vegetables consumption, while controlling for proximity to food sources. Instrumental variable and quasi-experimental robustness checks suggest that correlation in neighbors' fruits and vegetables consumption is likely due to social interactions among neighboring residents. The results elucidate important inter-relationships between access and social norms that influence dietary behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To that end we construct and estimate several competing small-scale DSGE models that extend the standard real business cycle model. In particular, we identify from the literature six different hypotheses that generate the empirically observed decline in hours worked after a positive technology shock. These models alternatively exhibit (i) sticky prices; (ii) firm entry and exit with time to build; (iii) habit in consumption and costly adjustment of investment; (iv) persistence in the permanent technology shocks; (v) labor market friction with procyclical hiring costs; and (vi) Leontief production function with labor-saving technology shocks. In terms of model posterior probabilities, impulse responses, and autocorrelations, the model favored is the one that exhibits habit formation in consumption and investment adjustment costs. A robustness test shows that the sticky price model becomes as competitive as the habit formation and costly adjustment of investment model when sticky wages are included.

Analyzing a novel firm-level business survey data set, we provide new insights on the price setting behavior of German retailers during a low inflation period. Relating the probability of both price and pricing plan adjustment to time-and state-dependent variables, we find that state-dependence is important; the macroeconomic environment as well as the firm-specific condition significantly determines the timing of both actual price changes and pricing plan adjustments. Moreover, input cost changes are important determinants of price setting.

While recent empirical studies make it clear that training intervention can improve the management level, it remains unclear why the managers had not made efforts to obtain these basic knowledge. To test the hypothesis that the reason lies in low valuation for obtaining knowledge, we conduct experimental training programs for the managers of SMEs in a knitwear cluster in rural town in Vietnam. We find that the demand for these training was indeed low prior to training, but increased greatly with own learning experience, and that those with a higher prior demand tended to benefit more from the training.

Our estimates of aggregate and sector-level GTFP growth reveal that Chinese industry is not yet on the path towards sustainable, low-carbon growth. A dynamic panel data analysis of the determinants of GIFP across sectors is used to identify factors that might rectify this situation, including state owned enterprise (SOE) reform, the growth of small private enterprises, continued openness to foreign investment and higher spending on R&D, particularly in emission-intensive sectors.

A monopolist exploits differences in the stochastic characteristics of demands. If demands are correlated and the firm faces a capacity constraint, then it can set prices to reduce the variability of aggregate demand, thereby reducing the probability of excess demand and the associated service quality deterioration. Demands that covary negatively with aggregate demand are valuable to the firm in much the same way that securities that covary negatively with the market are valuable in a stock portfolio. Customer classes that exhibit low covariance with aggregate demand realize lower optimal prices. Optimal capacity is also affected by these covariances. As long as demands are not perfectly positively correlated, expected costs of joint production are less than expected costs of serving demands separately.","[Eckel, Catherine C.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Smith, William T.] Univ Memphis, Dept Econ, Fogelman Coll Business & Econ, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Memphis,"Eckel, CC (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, TAMU 4228, College Stn, TX 77845 USA.",ceckel@tamu.edu; wtsmith@memphis.edu,,"Eckel, Catherine/0000-0003-1583-5214",,,,,23,0,0,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The use of the non-parametric MFA allows for the decomposition of gross efficiency (i.e. the efficiency of banks when measured relative to a common frontier) into 2 components: net efficiency (the efficiency of banks measured relative to their own bank type frontier) and type efficiency (the efficiency which relates to modus operandi). This approach is new to the Islamic banking literature. The analysis is performed in two stages. The first stage employs DEA and MFA to compare banks on the basis of gross efficiency and its components (net and type). We find that Islamic banks are typically on a par with conventional ones in terms of gross efficiency, significantly higher on net efficiency and significantly lower on type efficiency. Second stage analyses, which account for banking environment and bank-level characteristics, confirm these results. The low type efficiency of Islamic banks could be attributed to lack of product standardization whereas high net efficiency reflects high managerial capability in Islamic banks. These findings are relevant to both policy-makers and regulators. In particular, Islamic banks should explore the benefits of moving to a more standardized system of banking, while the underperformance of conventional bank managers could be examined in the context of the on-going remuneration culture.

Financial frictions lead to imperfect risk-sharing among households with idiosyncratic labor incomes. I study implications of imperfect risk-sharing for optimal monetary policy by documenting its impacts on the monetary transmission mechanism, the inflation-output tradeoff faced by the central bank, the policy objective function, and the resulting targeting rule. The main finding is that while the central bank continues to have the conventional dual mandate the output gap and inflation stabilization - it should place a greater weight on the later as the degree of financial frictions increases because price stability provides the additional benefit of reducing undesired consumption dispersion.

Using plant-level data for a single industry, the model's dynamic parameters are estimated in two-stages using the Nested-Pseudo Likelihood algorithm and the Method of Simulated Moments. Simulations of the model are used to investigate the effects of shocks to the exchange rate process on productivity.

Optimal (growth-maximizing) tax rules are derived under exogenous collection costs. The optimal direct-indirect tax ratio is shown to be negatively related to the administrative costs of collecting these taxes, as documented in cross-country data. This result also holds under endogenous collection costs (with these costs inversely related to administrative spending on tax enforcement), but for these to generate significant effects on tax collection requires implausibly high degrees of efficiency in spending, or the allocation of a large fraction of resources to tax enforcement. Depending on how it is financed, the latter policy may entail adverse effects on growth. Improving 'tax culture' and the sense of civic duty through greater budgetary transparency may be a more effective policy to improve tax collection and promote economic growth.","[Agenor, Pierre-Richard; Neanidis, Kyriakos C.] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Agenor, Pierre-Richard; Neanidis, Kyriakos C.] Univ Manchester, Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Agénor, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.",Pierre-richard.Agenor@manchester.ac.uk,,"Neanidis, Kyriakos/0000-0001-5258-2688",,,,,32,1,5,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In particular, when using a gain of 0.05, constant gain least squares generally outperforms the corresponding autoregressive model estimated with ordinary least squares.

We do this by means of a dynamic programming model for the retirement behavior of singles. The model is applied to new administrative data that contain very accurate and detailed information on individual incomes and occupational pension entitlements. Our model is able to capture the main patterns observed in the data. We observe that as individuals get older their labor supply declines considerably and this varies by age and gender. We simulate the current pension reform which aims at gradually increasing the legal retirement age from 65 to 67 and a hypothetical reform that immediately increases the retirement age to 67. The simulation results show a small impact on the effective retirement age for the first reform and a bigger impact for the second reform. Respectively, individuals postpone their retirement by 1 month and 7 months on average; while differences across individuals mainly depend on their gender and health status.","[Bernal, Noelia] Univ Piura, Lima, Peru; [Bernal, Noelia] Tilburg Univ, Netspar, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Bernal, Noelia] Tilburg Univ, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Vermeulen, Frederic] Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",Universidad de Piura; Tilburg University; Tilburg University; KU Leuven,"Vermeulen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",noelia.bernal@udep.pe; frederic.vermeulen@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,46,14,14,2,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2014,162.0,2,,,,,115,145,,10.1007/s10645-014-9226-8,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AJ6GJ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337788500002,0

If Kahn's satirical theory is taken seriously, then the situation in Japan in the 1990s requires some thought. In Japan in the 1990s, the percentage of long-haired women did not increase, despite an increase in the quantity of hairpins. This article considers such a situation by following Paul Krugman's thinking about a liquidity trap. The failure of an increase in the quantity of hairpins to increase the percentage of long-haired women is thought of as a failure of policymakers to credibly commit to a permanent increase in the quantity of hairpins.","[Capehart, Kevin W.] Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The uncompensated elasticity of self-employment taxable income ranges from 0.953 to 2.810. This responsiveness of self-employment income and average deadweight loss reflect short-term responses of static taxable income rather than long-term responses.

Under decentralized regulation, each firm is assigned to a regulator charged with maximizing the welfare generated by that firm. With asymmetric cost information, centralized regulation results in a negative externality between firms when engaging in lobbying. Decentralized regulation removes this externality and reduces lobbying.

We find that when the market micro-noise is perfectly negatively correlated with the return of futures market, market incompleteness depends on the relative level of noise volatility. Especially when noise volatility is less than the futures market yield, noise volatility will be offset by return volatility. As a result, complete optimal hedging model emerges. As an aside, it is interesting to note that as different conditional variances derived from different volatility models being applied, the hedge performance tends to be basically consistent with subtle difference: DCC-GARCH model is more likely to execute the hedging with 1:1 ratio, while other multivariate GARCH models would give a hedging ratio with greater probability less than 1:1 and is less likely to be a perfect hedge. Therefore, we believe that a simpler econometric model might produce better empirical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We consider individual problem solving attempts as acts of production embedded in an evolving bipartite network which affiliates organizational participants to organizational problems. We document how local configurations of network ties (or motifs) linking participants to problems emerge from - but at the same time sustain decentralized problem solving activities. Structural characteristics of the observed network suggest specific dependence hypotheses linking participants to problems. We explore these hypotheses by examining problem solving attempts performed by 135 participants in an open source software project on the 719 problems (software bugs) recorded during a complete release cycle of the software. Our empirical strategy relies on the specification and estimation of newly derived stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOM) originally conceived for the analysis of social networks. We find that individual problem solving behavior is activated by the interaction between local configurations of network ties, the level of experience of problem solvers, and the level of difficulty of problems.

We test the most commonly-cited determinants: the speed of disinflation, openness, inflation targeting, central bank independence, and political factors for both OECD and non-OECD countries. We find that the speed of disinflation is the most important determinant of OECD sacrifice ratios, but puzzlingly has no effect on non-OECD nations' disinflation costs. Instead we find evidence that greater central bank independence and more openness are associated with lower non-OECD sacrifice ratios. We also find that the ratio of government debt to GDP - a variable that is not important when it comes to OECD countries - is highly significant for non-OECD economies. Specifically, we find that higher indebtedness is associated with lower sacrifice ratios in non-OECD nations, suggesting that greater levels of debt do not lead to higher expectations of inflation. Furthermore we find evidence that the negative impact of debt on non-OECD sacrifice ratios is being driven by middle income economies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on descriptive index level results, Bartram and Bodnar (2009) conclude that the reaction of all sectors and industries was homogeneous during the LBs' bankruptcy and equity investors could not benefit from diversification. Motivated by Narayan and Sharma's (2011) findings on firm and sector heterogeneity, this paper employs an event study approach to further examine the sectoral and industrial performance during the bankruptcy period. Daily data for a total of 481 firms is examined. The main contribution of this paper is that it provides evidence that sectors behave heterogeneously during a stock market crisis and the significant adverse impact from the LBs' bankruptcy is discriminatory toward the financial sector and the diversified financial industry, which were most exposed to LBs. This paper proposes for investors to short sell those sector's or industry's securities that are anticipated to be the most significantly adversely affected from a particular negative news announcement.

Accordingly, an accurate and appropriate performance evaluation is critical. Financial performance indicators reflect the competitiveness of a company and they must be carefully identified in the evaluation process. Generally, accounting measures are used for performance evaluation. However, these measures are not sufficient for performance evaluation in the today's competitive economy. Therefore, value based measures have recently been introduced to express the company value. In this study, a hybrid approach is proposed for financial performance evaluation of automotive companies of Tehran stock exchange (TSE). For this purpose, a hierarchical financial performance evaluation model is structured based on the accounting measures and economic value measures. In this approach Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is applied to determine weights of criteria. Then the companies are ranked by using Fuzzy VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (in Serbian), Fuzzy Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS-F) and Fuzzy Complex Proportional Assessment (Fuzzy COPRAS), simultaneously.

It makes social control a consistent way of designing an efficient macro environment. Institutional economics precisely relies on such a triptych, and reveals to be an appropriate theoretical and practical reference to deal with today's major economic issues, such as the 2007-2008 systemic crisis. The article suggests, therefore, an institutional analysis that points to the role of the institutional-regulatory framework, and the rationale of social control principles in the stabilization of the working of capitalist finance. It then advocates for an alternative organization of the banking and financial system to ensure systemic sustainability and to guide the economy in a socially desirable direction.","[Uelgen, Faruk] Univ Grenoble 2, CREG, Branch Campus Valence, F-38040 Grenoble, France; [Uelgen, Faruk] Grenoble Sch Management, Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Grenoble Ecole Management,"Ülgen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble 2, CREG, Branch Campus Valence, F-38040 Grenoble, France.",,"Ulgen, Faruk/T-9908-2019","ULGEN, Faruk/0000-0003-2625-6293",,,,,24,5,5,0,13,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

All these are consistent with the lump-sum property of the tax and imply little effect of the tax abolition on relaxing credit constraints to farmers.

It is shown that while more intense competition in the product market increases output and reduces price, it does not necessarily lead to a lower unemployment rate or a higher wage for workers. Depending on the technologies, the relationship between the intensity of competition and the level of employment (respectively, wage, welfare) is not always monotonic, and, in some instances, has an inverted U-shape.","[Chen, Zhiqi] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Zhao, Bo] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Carleton University; University of International Business & Economics,"Chen, ZQ (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",zhiqi.chen@carleton.ca,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The similarity of shocks affecting the members is an important condition to minimize the costs from the loss of national monetary policy implementation. Eichengreen (Economic Policy 10:118-187; 1990) pointed that this is an important condition to be satisfied before joining a currency union. Frankel and Rose (Economic J 108:1009-1025 1998) state that membership could lead to an ex post rise in output correlations. In the current study, we employ ex post and ex ante data on output for 11 members and 11 non-members of the EMU and we test whether the adoption of the euro increased the output synchronization among members compared to non-members. The main findings of this paper are that there is not robust evidence for a decrease in average correlation among members compared to the co-movement among non-members. Our sensitivity analysis reveals that for a group of countries considered to be the core of the European Union, the effect is statistically insignificant. Any decrease in correlation could be attributed to some extend to the countries of the periphery, and also to some of the countries considered as members of the core, giving credit to Eichengreen (Economic Policy 10:118-187; 1990) and Krugman (1990) arguments about increased specialization giving rise to idiosyncratic shocks.","European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Christodoulopoulou, S (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",styliani1983@hotmail.com,,,,,,,52,8,8,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2014,41.0,2,,,SI,,177,222,,10.1007/s10663-012-9207-6,0.0,,,46,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AG6UT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335554700004,0

Agents derive their utilities from consumption over time. We consider an agent that invests in the financial market and in durable and perishable consumption goods. Assuming that there are costs for transacting the durable good, we show that an agent who does not consider the possibility of jumps will make suboptimal decisions, not only regarding the fraction of wealth invested in the stock market, but also with respect to the timing for trading on the durable good. Furthermore we also show that jumps cause a non-obvious asymmetric impact on the thresholds that lead the consumer to trade the durable good, even when the jump distribution is symmetric.

We study the effects of tax policies on entrepreneurs' choice of riskiness (or quality) of an innovation project, and on their mode of commercializing the innovation (market entry versus sale). Limited loss offset provisions in the tax system induce entrepreneurs innovating for entry to choose projects with inefficiently little risk. The same distortion does not arise when entrepreneurs sell their innovation in a competitive bidding process to an incumbent before the uncertainty is revealed. Tax systems which systematically favor market entry of entrepreneurs can thus lead to welfare losses due to inefficient quality choices, despite leading to more competition in the product market.

We also split the total savings (investment) into private and government savings (investment) to explore the role of government in improving capital mobility. Over time, we find an improvement in capital mobility after the mid-1990s. Across provinces, we observe higher capital mobility in eastern/coastal regions. From the 1990s, the government is found to play a less important role in promoting capital mobility.

Two alternative indicators are used on firm-level data to measure quality changes. Both lead to similar conclusions. Namely, we show that the mean quality of French exports increased by 10-15% between 1995 and 2005. Quality improvement is significantly more pronounced in markets in which competition from low-wage countries has increased the most.

Our model gives rise to an indicator measuring how strong the incentives for speculation were. The indicator is also used to estimate the influence of transaction costs and demand-side subsidies on leverage. According to the model, the influence of subsidies is likely to be limited compared to transaction costs, which may play a significant role in containing incentives for maturity mismatching. Some distinctive patterns can be deduced from a country by country analysis.","Banque France Eurosyst, F-75049 Paris 01, France",,"Castro, DF (通讯作者)，Banque France Eurosyst, UA 2403 Desk C223 39,Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris 01, France.",daniel.fuentescastro@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, each penalty kick cannot be considered a repetition of the same event because of the varying background conditions, in particular the heterogeneous ability of different players. Consequently, aggregate statistics over data sets composed of a large number of penalty kicks mediate the behaviour of the players in different games, and the properties of optimal mixed strategies cannot be tested directly because of aggregation bias. In this article, we model the heterogeneous ability of players. We then test the hypothesis that differently talented players randomize over different actions. To achieve this aim, we study a data set that collects penalties kicked during shoot-out series in the last editions of FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro Cup (1994-2012) where kickers are categorized as specialists and non-specialists.

J,"Allen, PM",,,,"Allen, Peter M.",,,"Evolution: complexity, uncertainty and innovation",JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Evolution,SEARCH,"Complexity science provides a general mathematical basis for evolutionary thinking. It makes us face the inherent, irreducible nature of uncertainty and the limits to knowledge and prediction. Complex, evolutionary systems work on the basis of on-going, continuous internal processes of exploration, experimentation and innovation at their underlying levels. This is acted upon by the level above, leading to a selection process on the lower levels and a probing of the stability of the level above. This could either be an organizational level above, or the potential market place. Models aimed at predicting system behaviour therefore consist of assumptions of constraints on the micro-level - and because of inertia or conformity may be approximately true for some unspecified time. However, systems without strong mechanisms of repression and conformity will evolve, innovate and change, creating new emergent structures, capabilities and characteristics. Systems with no individual freedom at their lower levels will have predictable behaviour in the short term - but will not survive in the long term. Creative, innovative, evolving systems, on the other hand, will more probably survive over longer times, but will not have predictable characteristics or behaviour. These minimal mechanisms are all that are required to explain (though not predict) the co-evolutionary processes occurring in markets, organizations, and indeed in emergent, evolutionary communities of practice. Some examples will be presented briefly.","Cranfield Univ, Sch Management, Complex Syst Management Ctr, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Cranfield University,"Allen, PM (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Sch Management, Complex Syst Management Ctr, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",p.m.allen@cranfield.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,6,9,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This work aims at providing a holistic approach to the assessment of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people's life experience by developing a synthetic index of social inclusion. This is obtained by aggregating several variables pertaining to the following domains: monetary poverty, labour market attachment, housing conditions, subjective well-being, and education. We focus on the case of Italy due to the availability of a peculiar dataset that allows us to distinguish LGB people who are open about their sexuality and those who choose not to declare it. The empirical analysis highlights a lower level of inclusion of individuals in same-sex couples that cannot be explained by other observable characteristics. Thus, it may denote a lack of equal opportunities and a need for adequate inclusion policies. Being publicly open about one's sexuality is found as a crucial correlate of the welfare of LGB people, to an extent so far neglected by the literature.

Few quantitative studies have been conducted on the causes of Italy's recession and slow recovery. Using monthly data, and reviving an aggregate supply model published in Bernanke and Carey [Quarterly Journal of Economics 111 (1996), 853-883], we empirically test whether Italy's 1930s industrial performance could be related to the Fascist wage and price policies, which, aiming at keeping workers' real wages constant, actually raised firms' labor costs, computed as nominal wages deflated by wholesale prices, hence stalling industrial production. We find evidence of a strong countercyclicality of real wages and of nominal wage stickiness in the period 1929-1936, which would confirm our hypothesis. Trade restrictions are found to play a smaller role in hindering industrial production than previously stated in the literature, whereas we confirm the weak transmission of financial turbulence to the real economy.","[Giordano, Claire] Bank Italy, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Piga, Gustavo; Trovato, Giovanni] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Giordano, C (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Econ & Financial Hist Div, Struct Econ Anal Dept, Via Nazl 191, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",claire.giordano@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,54,4,5,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We obtain estimates of the full set of location specific tax elasticities and conduct ex ante analysis of how the location of ownership of intellectual property will respond to changes in tax policy.

Specifically, it aims to improve confidence in the interpretation of people's willingness to pay (WTP) for water resources protection by enhancing understanding of value relationships. Primary data were obtained from a sample of 510 people living in and visiting the Pinios River in the eastern part of central Greece. Respondents' behaviour was explored by measuring and comparing use and non-use values with the help of a proposed constructed scale for measuring the dimensions of total economic value of a water resource. For this purpose, a combination of applied methodological research techniques like principal component and cluster analyses together with logistic regression was used. The results indicated the relative importance of particular value components in determining water resources conservation preferences, as well as individuals' WTP for protecting them. We have extracted four factors and explored their influence on respondents' WTP and the general attitude towards the area. There were high associations between WTP of individuals towards river protection in relation to their characteristics (like education, income and origin).

After calibrating the RB parameter using the detection error probabilities, we show that the model can explain the observed international consumption correlations as well as the other consumption moments quantitatively.

Contrary to standard game-theoretic predictions, our experimental results suggest that commitment can be used effectively to increase the committer's payoff, particularly in a one-to-many bargaining environment where strategic holdout behavior is likely. However, we find evidence that commitment may also increase the number of failed agreements and reduce overall efficiency from exchange. To explain why behavior is inconsistent with standard game-theoretic predictions, we offer a behavioral bargaining model that allows for both sincere and strategic responders. Strategic responders behave as expected-payoff maximizers, while sincere responders behave according to a minimum-acceptable-offer (MAO) rule. We demonstrate that a mix of sincere and strategic types in the population is necessary to generate increasing equilibrium offers over time and holdout behavior, whereby strategic responders wait for higher offers in later periods. In response, proposers may find it optimal to commit early to an offer if commitment is possible.

The empirical results reveal that, on average, Turkish firms hold 9.1% of their total assets as cash and cash equivalents. There is a steadily increasing trend in cash holding across the years. Both the system GMM and the difference GMM regression results are consistent; almost exactly the same variables are significant and going in the same direction. The findings indicate that the previous year's cash holding is positive and significant determinant at the current year's cash level, suggesting that these firms have a targeted cash level. Furthermore, the results reveal that cash flow and growth opportunities have positive and significant impact on the cash level. However, the amount of capital expenditures, liquid assets used as cash substitute, the degree of tangibility of assets, financial debt ratio and leverage have negative and significant impact on the cash level.

We apply our approach to an Austrian data set. Our findings suggest that factor prices like short-term interest rates (STIs) and energy prices constitute major drivers of default rates, while firms' profits reduce the expected number of failures.

Postulating that the female workforce is heterogeneous by age, education and the presence of children, we create four groups; the aggregated, young and childless, young with children and the educated. The article finds statistical evidence of significant gender differences, though not uniformly so. Econometric results, however, paint a muddier picture, indicating that statistical results alone should not be used to categorically report incidences of gender differences in job satisfaction. Sample-selection bias results also evince sub-group heterogeneity and require further study. The determinants of job satisfaction vary between measures and sub-groups, though not necessarily so across gender. In sum, the article finds that the paradox does exhibit itself for the aggregated and young and childless sub-groups, but is largely absent for the young with children group. As well, there is a clear bifurcation in job satisfaction between genders for the educated sub-group. This suggests that employed females should not be viewed as a monolithic bloc in the labour force.","[Kifle, T.] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Kler, P.] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Shankar, S.] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, Parramatta, NSW 2751, Australia",University of Queensland; Griffith University; Western Sydney University,"Shankar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, Parramatta, NSW 2751, Australia.",s.shankar@uws.edu.au,"Kler, Parvinder/P-3968-2019","Kler, Parvinder/0000-0001-5235-1038; Shankar, Sriram/0000-0001-9096-9883",,,,,27,19,24,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The previous literature on the topic is useful for these purposes but it does not provide an adequate framework for analyzing the Icelandic experience because Iceland is a very particular case within the group of countries that have historically resorted to CAR. Our main conclusions are that capital account regulation has been essential in stabilizing the currency after the banking crash, providing space for expansionary monetary policy, and keeping public debt yields low.

The model shows that the equilibrium firm decision depends on product technology, consumer preference for product quality, fixed investment costs of establishing a foreign subsidiary, transportation costs and relative wages. Our empirical results confirm the predictions of the theoretical model. Firm-level demand and productivity components are important in explaining the decision to participate in foreign markets with their relative importance depending on the firm's organizational form (exports versus FDI) and the destination of the investments. In general, FDI firms are more productive than exporting firms regardless of FDI destinations. FDI firms also have a higher demand component than exporters and this demand component is stronger than productivity. Finally, among FDI firms, while those with a high demand index and productivity have a significantly higher propensity to invest in high-income countries, firm productivity is the sole determinant of firms undertaking FDI in low-income countries.

If voting is voluntary so that abstention is allowed, then sincere voting in accordance with a voter's private information is always rational while participation may become strategic. We find strong support for these theoretical predictions in our experimental data. Moreover, voters adapt their decisions to the voting institution in place in such a way as to make the group decision accuracy differences between the two voting institutions negligible.

Over time, these concepts have evolved from simple studies of job satisfaction towards more comprehensive measures of job and employment quality, including the International Labour Organizations concept of Decent Work launched in 1999. This article compares the parallel development of quality of employment measures in the European Union with the ILOs Decent Work agenda and concludes that the former has advanced much further due to more consistent efforts to generate internationally comparable data on labour markets, which permit detailed measurements and international comparisons. In contrast, Decent Work remains a very broadly defined concept, which is impossible to measure across countries. We conclude by proposing three important differences between these two scenarios that have lead to such diverging paths: the lack of availability of internationally comparable data, the control over the research agenda by partisan social actors, and a prematurely mandated definition of Decent Work that is extremely vague and all-encompassing.","[Burchell, Brendan; Piasna, Agnieszka] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3RQ, England; [Sehnbruch, Kirsten; Agloni, Nurjk] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",University of Cambridge; Universidad de Chile,"Piasna, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Free Sch Lane, Cambridge CB2 3RQ, England.",ap582@cam.ac.uk,,"burchell, brendan/0000-0002-8243-937X",,,,,75,153,168,9,150,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

An experiment on risk aversion and the house-money effect,EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,House-money effect; Risk aversion; Prospect theory; Economic experiment; External validity,PREFERENCES,"The house-money effect, understood as people's tendency to be more daring with easily-gotten money, is a behavioral pattern that poses questions about the external validity of experiments in economics: to what extent do people behave in experiments like they would have in a real-life situation, given that they play with easily-gotten house money? We ran an economic experiment with 122 students to measure the house-money effect on their risk preferences. They received an amount of money with which they made risky decisions involving losses and gains; a randomly selected treatment group received the money 21 days in advance and a control group got it the day of the experiment. From a simple calculation we found that participants in the treatment group only spent on average approximately 35 % of their cash in advance. The data confirms the well documented results that men are more tolerant to risk than women, and that individuals in general are more risk tolerant towards losses than towards gains. With our preferred specification, we find a mean CRRA risk aversion coefficient of 0.34, with a standard deviation of 0.09. Furthermore, if subjects in the treatment group spent 35 % of the endowment their CRRA risk aversion coefficient is higher than that of the control group by approximately 0.3 standard deviations. We interpret this result as evidence of a small and indirect house money effect operating though the amount of the cash in advance that was actually spent. We conclude that the house money effect may play a small role in decisions under uncertainty, especially when involving losses. Our novel design, however, could be used for other domains of decision making both in the lab and for calibration of economic models used in micro and macroeconomics.","[Camilo Cardenas, Juan] Univ Los Andes, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia; [Camilo Cardenas, Juan] Univ Los Andes, CEDE, Bogota, Colombia; [De Roux, Nicolas] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Jaramillo, Christian R.] DIAN, Bogota, Colombia; [Martinez, Luis Roberto] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Martinez, Luis Roberto] London Sch Econ, STICERD, London WC2A 2AE, England",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Columbia University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Cárdenas, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia.",jccarden@uniandes.edu.co; nd2282@columbia.edu; ch.jaramillo.econ@gmail.com; l.r.martinez@lse.ac.uk,"cardenas, juan-camilo/B-4658-2009","cardenas, juan-camilo/0000-0003-0005-7595",,,,,20,24,30,2,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

This applies to contracts among family and friends, contracts regulating market transactions, and sovereign debt contracts. Do such non-enforceable contracts matter? We use a version of the trust game with participants from Norway and Tanzania to study repayment decisions in the presence of non-enforceable loan contracts. Our main finding is that the specific content of the contract has no effect on loan repayment. Rather, the borrowers seem to be motivated by other moral motives, which contributes to explaining why they partly fulfill non-enforceable contracts. We also show that some borrowers violate the axiom of first-order stochastic dominance when rejecting loan offers. This seems partly to be due to negative reciprocity, but may also reflect that there are individuals who have a preference for not accepting something referred to as a loan.","[Cappelen, Alexander W.; Sorensen, Erik O.; Tungodden, Bertil] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Trondheim, Norway; [Hagen, Rune Jansen] Univ Bergen, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Bergen,"Tungodden, B (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, C-319,Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",bertil.tungodden@nhh.no,"CAPPELEN, ALEXANDER/AAY-1676-2021; Hagen, Rune Jansen/I-8522-2019","Sorensen, Erik O./0000-0002-7155-4188",,,,,33,2,2,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We find, firstly, that the commercial patterns of Catalonia (seen as an independent country) are, today, qualitatively different to those of any other EU country due to the enormous degree of concentration of commerce in a relatively small partner: the rest of Spain. Our objective is to simulate what would happen if Catalonia became a normal country of the EU. To do so, we calibrate the model for Catalonia, the rest of Spain and the rest of the world; and, also, for Portugal, Spain and the rest of the world. In this way, we can estimate the effective distances (frictions) both between Catalonia and the rest of Spain and between Portugal and Spain. The intellectual experiment that we carry out is to compare the benefits for Catalonia of not paying the fiscal transfer with the costs that would incur if the effective distance between Catalonia and Spain were the same as that between Spain and Portugal. We find that, in this case, the increase of disposible income due to the fiscal saving is lower than the combined effect of greater commercial distortions, a lower productivity of Catalonian firms and, consequently, lower salaries. The net disposible income of the Catalonians would be about 3% lower.","[Comerford, David; Myers, Nicholas; Rodriguez Mora, Jose V.] Univ Edimburgo, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Comerford, D (通讯作者)，Univ Edimburgo, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,"Comerford, David/0000-0002-5541-736X",,,,,12,5,5,0,32,UNIV ZARAGOZA,ZARAGOZA,"DEPT ESTRUCTURA ECONOMICA ECONOMIA PUBLICA, GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

This paper identifies various sources of interbank liquidity in Qatar and discusses the various implications of structural primary liquidity surplus for the money market in particular and the economy at large. The paper attempts to evaluate the Qatar Central Bank policy making and conduct during the pre- and post-crisis periods within a framework of the Austrian monetary overinvestment theories, and concludes that the central bank had forcibly committed several forced monetary policy mistakes, which resulted in a breakdown in the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. This led to the inability of the central bank to control the interbank interest rate and to an accelerating inflation rate during the pre-crisis years. In contrast, a dramatic change in the central bank's monetary policy framework and a deliberate monetary policy mistake on behalf of the central bank resulted in a restoration of the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, stabilization of the interbank interest rate close to the central bank's policy rate and a sharp deceleration in the inflation rate in the post-crisis period.

The country with the highest flow of GDP in a particular year is not necessarily the richest country. The richest country has the highest capital stock, whether endowed or accumulated, implying a higher potential for future income and consumption. This should be obvious, yet concepts of wealth are often poorly understood or ignored. Many countries do not maintain adequate wealth accounts; those that do would admit that a great deal of work on national accounts remains to be completed. This is remarkable: investors would not accept corporate balance sheets of a quality akin to those of many countries. However, with progress on wealth accounting, including the accounting of natural wealth, this situation may be set to change, enabling the rate at which nations are becoming richer or poorer per capita to undergo popular examination. A focus on wealth, and changes in wealth, would lead to attention on investment in important assets and to sharper attention on sustainability. This paper, and this issue of the Review as a whole, provides an examination of wealth, its definition, constituent parts, geographical distribution, and change over time, and provides policy guidance on accounting and management. We also explore the degree to which successful wealth management may even make us happier.","[Hamilton, Kirk] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] LSE, Grantham Res Inst, Oxford, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] New Coll, Oxford, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Hamilton, K (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.e.hamilton@verizon.net; cameron.hepburn@new.ox.ac.uk,,"Hepburn, Cameron/0000-0003-0467-7441",,,,,52,34,38,2,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The Bank of Japan set a 2 percent inflation target and specified concrete actions to achieve this goal by 2015. In 2013, Shinzo Abe's government supported this change with fiscal policy and planned structural reforms. Together with the Bank of Japan's aggressive monetary easing, this policy package is known as Abenomics. We show that Abenomics ended deflation in 2013 and raised long-run inflation expectations. Our estimates suggest that Abenomics also raised 2013 output growth by 0.9 to 1.8 percentage points. Monetary policy alone accounted for up to a percentage point of growth, largely through positive effects on consumption. In both the medium and the long run, Abenomics will likely continue to be stimulative. However, the size of this effect, while highly uncertain, thus far appears likely to fall short of Japan's large output gap. In part this is because the Bank of Japan's 2 percent inflation target is not yet fully credible.

To do so, we utilize the recently proposed Efficiency Index to find out that the most efficient among all of the analyzed commodities is heating oil, closely followed by WTI crude oil, cotton, wheat, and coffee. On the other end of the ranking scale we find live cattle and feeder cattle. The efficiency is also found to be characteristic for specific groups of commodities, with energy commodities being the most efficient and other agricultural commodities (composed mainly of livestock) the least efficient groups. We also discuss contributions of long-term memory, fractal dimension and approximate entropy to the total inefficiency. Last but not least, we come across the nonstandard relationship between the fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent. For the analyzed dataset, the relationship between these two variables is positive, meaning that local persistence (trending) is connected to global anti-persistence.

If the optimal contract is invariant over the hidden information and, thus, the disclosure rules (constant elasticity case), such disclosure increases the agent's utility, it can raise or lower profit and total surplus depending on the source of hidden information, and non-disclosure can be optimal if disclosure affects the agent's motivation.

Furthermore, using both a two-factor and a three-factor capital asset pricing model (CAPM), we test for the presence of a long-run relationship among exchange rate risk pricing, herding behavior, term structure and the interest rate. The estimated results based on both the ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized least squares (GLS) estimation techniques confirm that exchange rate risk in the Canadian equity market is priced and that the pricing of this risk is time-varying. This result holds for all seven exchange rate proxies. Our empirical analysis also suggests the presence of a long-run relationship among exchange rate risk pricing, herding behavior, term structure and the interest rate.

We are able to isolate conditions under which determinacy does and does not imply learnability and also conditions under which long-horizon forecasts make a clear difference for learnability. Finally, we apply our result to a relatively general New Keynesian model.","Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Eusepi, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, Dept Res & Stat, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA.",stefano.eusepi@ny.frb.org,"Bullard, James/L-8120-2016","Bullard, James/0000-0002-1142-6803",,,,,23,11,13,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

The estimation of the Cox proportional hazard model provided evidence that the independence of company's governance bodies, their human resource abundance, and influence over corporate management are statistically significant factors affecting the survival probability of the surveyed firms. In particular, the board of directors and the audit committee are likely to play a vital role in reducing the potential exit risk.

Second, I construct a model of on-the-job search and explore the implications of this phenomenon. The calibrated model quantifies the effect of the decline in the reallocation of workers through job-to-job transitions on total factor productivity (TFP).

Besides, it includes the conventional identification approach in the most literature as a special case, but relaxes the embedded normality assumption. A detailed procedure is outlined to demonstrate the implementation of the new approach, further illustrated by an empirical study on identifying the currency crises of China. Results are compared and evaluated by different approaches, and reveal remarkable improvement of our approach. We further combine our method with Early Warning Systems and the second-generation crisis models.

Preliminary analysis suggests the presence of cross-sectional dependence within the panel data. As a result, second-generation panel unit root tests of Smith et al. (2004) and Pesaran (2007) are undertaken to find the respective variables that are integrated of order one. Panel cointegration and error correction modelling reveal that a long-run relationship exists between renewable energy consumption per capita, real GDP per capita, carbon dioxide emissions per capita and real oil prices. The long-run elasticity estimates are positive and statistically significant for real GDP per capita, carbon dioxide emissions per capita and real oil prices. The panel error correction model shows that a feedback relationship exists among the variables.","[Apergis, Nicholas] Curtin Univ, Dept Econ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Payne, James E.] Georgia Coll & State Univ, J Whitney Bunting Coll Business, Milledgeville, GA 31061 USA",Curtin University; University System of Georgia; Georgia College & State University,"Payne, JE (通讯作者)，Georgia Coll & State Univ, J Whitney Bunting Coll Business, Milledgeville, GA 31061 USA.",james.payne@gcsu.edu,"Payne, James/IZQ-1848-2023; Apergis, Nikolas/J-7125-2017; Payne, James/Q-9569-2019",", Nick/0000-0002-0375-2457",,,,,17,90,94,3,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The matching market serves as an endogenous outside option for the agents. The market includes inflexible commitment types who demand a constant portion of any match surplus. The frequency of such types is determined in equilibrium.An equilibrium where there are significant delays in reaching an agreement and where negotiations occasionally break down on the equilibrium path is constructed. Such an equilibrium exists and commitment types affect bargaining dynamics even if the equilibrium frequency of such types is negligible. If the inflows of firms and workers into the market are symmetric, then bargaining involves two-sided reputation building and reputation concerns lead to delays and inefficiency. Access to the market exacerbates bargaining inefficiencies caused by inflexible types. If the inflows of workers and firms are sufficiently asymmetric, then bargaining involves one-sided reputation and commitment types determine the terms of trade.","[Atakan, Alp E.] Koc Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ekmekci, Mehmet] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Koc University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Atakan, AE (通讯作者)，Koc Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",,,,,,,,23,16,16,2,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

When applied to South Africa for the period 1960-2011, the findings are as follows: results from the full-sample VECM indicate that there is no Granger causality between tourism receipts and GDP, while the findings from the time-varying coefficients model based on the state-space representation show that tourism receipts have positive-predictive content for GDP for the entire period, with the exception of the period between 1985 and 1990.

Emigration has become one of the most important and controversial recent economic and political subject of discussions, however impact of different qualification groups on the national economic growth has not been emphasized. This is an important aspect of the research, because impact of migration on the national economic growth in the macroeconomic level depends on the political, economic and social conditions as well as on the individual characteristics of emigrants, their owned capital and behaviour. Therefore this paper presents the integrated assessment model of the impact of emigrants' qualification structure on the national economic growth, which has been applied in the case of Lithuania. Emigration impact was assessed through the aggregated cost components, therefore GDP expenditure method has been chosen because it allows to identify systemically expenditure groups related to the economic growth through the incoming and outgoing cash flows which is determined by the emigrants' role in every economic sector The calculation results showed that increase in part of qualified emigrants negatively influenced national economic growth during the whole analysed period. The biggest negative effect came from the change of consumption expenditure while the positive effect from the saved social benefits did not overcome the negative one. The calculations showed that the change of 10 per cent of emigrants' qualification structure determined on average of 5 per cent of the GDP loss change in the country.","[Berzinskiene, Daiva; Butkus, Mindaugas; Matuzeviciute, Kristina] Siauliai Univ, Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Berzinskiene, D (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Architektu St 1, Shiauliai, Lithuania.",daiva.berzinskiene@ktu.lt; mindaugo.butkaus@gmail.com; matuzeviciute@gmail.com,"Butkus, Mindaugas/E-3973-2017","Butkus, Mindaugas/0000-0003-2381-5440; Matuzeviciute-Balciuniene, Kristina/0000-0003-0573-0072",,,,,46,6,6,0,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Moreover, since the traded sector (i.e. Industry) is affected by international competitive pressure, it should act as the leader, because this would be conducive to wage restraint. We apply a Vector Error Correction Model on four macro sectors (Industry, Services, Construction and the Public Sector) in ten EMU countries to test for wage leadership and wage adaptability. Our results show significant cross-country differences, with the Public Sector acting as the leader in Germany, Belgium and Greece. Countries that recently experienced a construction bubble such as Spain and Ireland show wage leadership of the construction sector. Moreover, in half of the countries, wages in different sectors are, to some extent, set autonomously, which suggests low inter-sectoral labor mobility. Finally, adjustment after a positive vs. negative shock to the leading sector's wage, in Mediterranean countries, Ireland and the Netherlands is asymmetric. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Cycles are more erratic and higher frequency in the instantaneous adjustment treatment.

Monthly earnings that are higher than the median are also better recalled. These results have implications for the accuracy of the moments of the self-reported earnings distribution.

The definition requires output gaps to be stationary around a constant mean. But when all n(n - 1)/2 pairs of log per capita output gaps are considered, this results in more than 1,000 unit root tests to be conducted. Hence, because of the ensuing multiplicity of the testing problem, a nontrivial number of output gaps will be falsely declared to be stationary when each of the n(n - 1)/2 hypotheses is tested at some conventional level like 5%. To solve the problem, we employ recent multiple testing techniques that allow us to bound the expected fraction of false rejections at a desired level. Monte Carlo results illustrate the usefulness of the techniques. The empirical results show that the data do not support the notion of output convergence after controlling for multiplicity.","[Deckers, Thomas] BGSE, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Hanck, Christoph] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Deckers, T (通讯作者)，BGSE, Dept Econ, Kaiserstr 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",thomas.deckers@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,44,7,7,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Results from linear and nonlinear unit root tests show that current account sustainability is supported for the majority of Latin American countries with the exception of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay. For the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela the current account dynamics are best described by a stationary linear model, and by a stationary linear model with a mean shift in years 2003, 1982 and 1980 in Bolivia, Costa Rica and Nicaragua, respectively.

Our analysis shows how these equilibrium configurations depend on the relative interests in power (resp., ideology) and the uncertainty about voters' preferences.

I find empirical evidence for trade-related foreign technology spillover effects for Greece and Ireland if technology diffusion is unrestricted. Restricting technology diffusion to EU-12 countries, there are significant foreign technology spillover effects from European integration for Portugal (patent related) and Spain (trade and FDI related).

This conveniently forgoes the need to choose a bandwidth parameter, which due to a lack of a clear and sensible information criteria is difficult for testing purposes. We are able to do so after making use that the number of individuals increases with no limit. After removing the parametric component of the model, when the errors are homoscedastic, our test statistic converges to a Gaussian process whose critical values are easily tabulated. We also examine the consequences of having heteroscedasticity as well as discussing the problem of how to compute valid critical values due to the very complicated covariance structure of the limiting process. Finally, we present a small Monte Carlo experiment to shed some light on the finite sample performance of the test.","[Hidalgo, Javier] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Lee, Jungyoon] New Coll Humanities, Dept Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hidalgo, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0731-9053,,978-1-78441-182-4; 978-1-78441-183-1,ADV ECONOMETRICS,,,2014,33.0,,,,,,303,345,,10.1108/S0731-905320140000033010,0.0,,,43,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360559300011,0

In the long run, we found a unidirectional causality runs from output to electricity consumption. This result indicates that the development of manufacturing sector stimulates greater demand for electricity. Government needs to make sure that the future planning of electricity supply is in line with the economic development planning to avoid shortage in electricity supply. Focusing more on industrial development policy to promote growth in manufacturing sector is recommended since energy conservation is expected not to give an adverse impact to the output growth. In the short run, there are two unidirectional relationships exist, 1) from the international oil price to electricity consumption, and 2) from international oil price to manufacturing output.

It presents a simple theoretical model in which candidates for promotion are uncertain about the type of evaluator mandated by the Organization to review them. Adverse promotion is then shown to occur, the term adverse meaning here unfair and/or inefficient. Unfairness is tied to the possible existence of an evaluator enjoying power. Indeed, in the separating Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium such an evaluator promotes a worker from among the less competent candidates in order to signal his type and thence to induce further candidates to court his favour. Inefficiency arises with both types of evaluator (the power-liking and the ethically-acting) but is different in nature: either it is tied to courting behaviour of workers, or it is due to the discouragement of some workers. The role played by competition between heterogeneous workers is then discussed and some remedies are suggested.","Univ Caen Basse Normandie, CREM, UMR CNRS 6211, Caen, France",Universite de Caen Normandie,"Lecostey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Caen Basse Normandie, CREM, UMR CNRS 6211, Caen, France.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

However, in contrast to those who completed their education pre-immigration, immigrants who arrived at a young age are not influenced by this educational quality measure. Also, the results are not much affected when the source country's GDP per capita and other nation-level characteristics are used as control variables.

More generally, the set of Pareto optima will have the same dimension as the set of allocations. The Pareto criterion then will not be able to discriminate locally among policy options. A small distortion, for example, will call for no policy response.

The effect is stronger and significant in a treatment where dictators are asked to guess the average transfer expected by the recipients, compared to a treatment where they are asked to guess average transfers.

After the accession to the EU, the Czech agricultural holdings gained the opportunity to obtain finances from Common Agricultural Policy. This financial support should have positive effect on the beneficiaries; enhance their profitability, competitiveness and overall development. However, as our results shows, the impact is ambiguous. On one hand, the subsidies helped to increase the operating surplus of the agricultural sector and profitability of agricultural holdings through increasing profitability of commodities. On the other hand, this can lead to the increased reliance of beneficiaries on external financial support. Especially in cases, when plants are not naturally profitable. Besides, the situation when the plants are profitable even without subsidies (and more profitable with them), lowers farmers' motivation for efficient production.","[Pechrova, Marie] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,,pechrova@pef.czu.cz,"Pechrová, Marie Šimpachová/X-8982-2018",,,,,,12,3,3,0,6,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

This required exploration of the mechanisms through which new knowledge was developed as well as the means by which knowledge was transmitted between the generations. The present article examines Mandevilles treatment of these mechanisms and explores their theoretical origins. It examines Mandevilles understanding of the role of the division of labour in facilitating discovery and learning and the role of education and imitation in transmitting social knowledge. It shows that, for Mandeville, innovators were people of ordinary capacity who were alert to the opportunities and challenges of their environment. As a result of specialisation, they possessed tacit knowledge which was actualised in what they did rather than in theoretical propositions. Mandevilles evolutionary thought influenced subsequent writers on political economy and evolutionary social thinkers. It may also have had some influence on Charles Darwin, though it is not, in itself, Darwinian.","Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Univ Management Sch, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Prendergast, R (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Univ Management Sch, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",r.prendergast@qub.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,4,4,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The quantification of the analysed exposure contributes to the process of identifying, monitoring and managing interest rate risk. As a sample of a developed financial market we surveyed 65 bank holding companies in the United States, whereas the sample of a developing financial market included 10 banks from the Republic of Serbia, which are listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange. A comparative analysis of the influence of the balance sheet characteristics was conducted on the basis of the results of Stone's regression model and the Econometric panel model. Based on the obtained regression coefficients, we conclude that growth of total assets in banks in the United States results in increases in exposure to interest rate risk, while in Serbia the relationship seems to be inverse. Furthermore, the results show that an increase in the share of deposits in total assets of the U. S. banks reduces exposure to interest rate risk, while banks in the Republic of Serbia experience an opposite effect. The coefficients also suggest that there are some empirical factors whose effects are universal. For instance, both an increase in return on average equity (ROAE) and a decrease in net interest income lead to reductions of interest rate sensitivity, regardless of the level of development of the market where the banks operate.","[Racic, Zeljko] Higher Sch Profess Business Studies, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Stanisic, Nemanja] Singidunum Univ, Belgrade, Serbia; [Racic, Marijana] Ernst & Young GmbH, D-80636 Munich, Germany",,"Racic, Z (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Profess Business Studies, Vladimira Perica Valtera 4, Novi Sad, Serbia.",raciczeljko@gmail.com; nstanisic@singidunum.ac.rs; Marijana.Racic@de.ey.com,"Rehman, Ijaz/E-1783-2011; Stanisic, Nemanja/ABC-6475-2020","Rehman, Ijaz/0000-0003-2181-0929; Stanisic, Nemanja/0000-0002-6543-1472",,,,,26,0,0,1,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

One of the major findings is that with non-linear Engel curves and linear income tax, optimal commodity tax rates will be progressive and highly dispersed under logarithmic utility specifications. The dispersion of tax rates is reduced if the inequality aversion rate of society is low. With exogenously given non-optimal and non-linear income tax schedules, usually there is still a need for differentiated and progressive indirect taxation. These findings are in marked contrast to the continuing preoccupation of much of the literature with uniform indirect taxation for redistributive purposes. The results also indicate that if tax evasion incurs substantial dead-weight costs, it usually reduces optimal tax rates by over a half of the evasion/revenue ratio of the product, with the reduction being larger for necessities and smaller for luxuries. Private compliance costs and government administration costs reduce optimal tax rates by a similar amount to the share of these costs from taxes. In a model with linear income tax, the effect of externalities on optimal tax rates substantially exceeds the corresponding Pigouvian tax rates or subsidies. The main benefit of higher taxes on leisure complements than leisure substitutes appears to be in boosting tax revenue for redistribution, rather than in improving the utility position of those paying the taxes. The effect of complexities such as tax evasion, administrative costs, externalities and leisure complements/substitutes on redistribution is not neutral. Generally, these factors tend to increase the progressivity of optimal commodity tax rates.","[Revesz, John T.] Australian Publ Serv, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,,,"Revesz, John/ABE-4192-2020","Revesz, John/0000-0001-6558-9774",,,,,68,6,6,0,10,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2014,,211,,,,,9,66,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.14.4.1,0.0,,,58,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V43ZT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000209720000001,0

I elicit subjective distribution functions over future global mean temperatures and WTP for mitigation. I find, not surprisingly, that subjects, on average, view climate change as a bad, and the higher the expected temperature increase they perceive, the more they are willing to pay for mitigation. Subjects are generally risk averse, so that they are WTP more for mitigation programs when the outcome of the program is more certain. The skew of the subjective climate-change distribution also affects preferences, so that aversion to catastrophic outcomes is an important component of WTP for mitigation. I find that models that ignore skew are likely to underestimate the influence of uncertainty on willingness to pay for climate-change mitigation.","Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Riddel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Box 6005,4505 Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",mriddel@unlv.nevada.edu,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The emphasis on natural experiments and randomization is a highly useful one; in more standard observational studies, the self-selection of people into peer groups can make the measurement of peer effects extremely difficult. In the absence of exogenous variation, knowing that people have similar outcomes as their friends, classmates, and coworkers may tell us little about peer effects. I examine the successes, failures, and findings of experimental analyses of peer effects. I draw three broad conclusions. First, even more than in other areas of social science, the size and nature of peer effects estimated are highly context specific; peer effects in student test scores and grades are prominent in some cases and absent in others. That said, there is a pattern across studies suggesting that social outcomes (e.g., crime, drinking behavior) and career choices show larger peer influences than do test scores. Second, researchers have shown that the linear-in-means model of peer effects is often not a good description of the world, although we do not yet have an agreed-upon model to replace it. Third, despite potential temptation, we have not reached the point at which we can reliably use knowledge of peer effects to implement policies that improve outcomes for students and other human subjects.","[Sacerdote, Bruce] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Sacerdote, Bruce] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Sacerdote, B (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",bruce.sacerdote@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,51,100,138,3,42,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimations help determine dynamic series relationships, and panel-causality tests are run based on the results of GMM estimations.

Specifically, we consider a monopolist who can sell vertically differentiated products over two periods to heterogeneous consumers. Each consumer demands one unit of the product in each period. In the second period, the monopolist can condition the price-quality offers on the observed purchasing behavior in the first period. In this setup, the monopolist can price discriminate consumers in two dimensions: by quality as well as by purchase history. We fully characterize the monopolist's optimal pricing strategy when there are two types of consumers. When the type space is a continuum, we show that there is no fully separating equilibrium, and some properties of the optimal contracts (price-quality pairs) are characterized within the class of partitional perfect Bayesian equilibria.","Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Sun, CJ (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",cjsun@deakin.edu.au,,"Sun, Ching-jen/0000-0002-7363-3533",,,,,36,2,2,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

In our analysis we explore the impact of the higher capital requirements on the level of profitability of European banks. More specifically, we try to pinpoint which of the variables will have the most significance. Based on the results of our analysis which employs a simultaneous equations model on 594 banks operating in the European Union in the 2006 - 2011 period, we conclude that higher capital requirements under the CRD IV proposal would cause a decrease in banks' profitability accompanied by a drop in their risk taking. Additionally, we show that a higher level of capital held by banks would cause them to decrease their risky assets held relative to total assets.","[Sutorova, Barbora; Teply, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Teply, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Banking & Insurance, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Sútorová, B (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",barbora.sutorova@gmail.com; teply@fsv.cuni.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,,,,,49,9,9,2,20,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

To examine the source of the decline, this paper proposes a decomposition method that delves deeper into the two micro-components of aggregate productivity growth: a within-plant component and a between-plant component. The decomposition builds on earlier work by Jorgenson and his collaborators that decomposes aggregate productivity growth into its industry components, but applies it to the plant level and introduces non-neoclassical features of the plant-level economic environment. It finds that the preponderance of the aggregate labor and multifactor productivity growth slowdown is due to the pro-cyclical nature of productivity growth arising from capacity utilization. Almost all of the aggregate productivity growth slowdown is driven by exporters, as exporters experienced large declines in labor productivity growth in the post-2000 period as a result of large declines in their capacity utilization.","[Baldwin, John R.; Gu, Wulong; Yan, Beiling] STAT Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada",Statistics Canada,"Gu, WL (通讯作者)，STAT Canada, Econ Anal Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada.",Wulong.Gu@statcan.gc.ca,,"baldwin, john/0000-0002-9465-7569",,,,,38,24,26,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

However, the Coase theorem is valid only under certain assumptions, such as transferable utility (no restrictions on side-payments) and complete information. Brito and Intrili gator (1985) showed how incomplete information may lead to war. An aggressor who demands concessions may simply be bluffing, so it may be rational to refuse his demands. If the aggressor is not bluffing, a war may ensue. We discuss how long such a war may last, and whether other kinds of frictions (such as limited commitment power and limits on side-payments) may also lead to war.","[Baliga, Sandeep] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Sjoestroem, Tomas] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Northwestern University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Baliga, S (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",baliga@kellogg.northwestern.edu; tsjostrom@econ.rutgers.edu,"Baliga, Sandeep/KCY-3667-2024; Sjostrom, Tomas/AAB-9239-2020","Baliga, Sandeep/0009-0000-5709-4253; Sjostrom, Tomas/0000-0003-2835-0953",,,,,42,10,10,0,13,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

The results indicate that firm-level employment dispersion rises with higher price stickiness and higher demand elasticity, whereas it falls with more convexity of search costs and with a higher labor supply elasticity. Industry-level employment is more volatile and less procyclical than aggregate employment, and a larger industry size reduces volatility and raises co-movement with output. The calibrated model is able to match the volatility, autocorrelation and cyclical correlation of US industry-level employment when incorporating firm-specific technology shocks.

Individuals differ in dependency risk, productivity and degree of risk misperception. The former two are positively correlated (because of the longevity factor) and social insurance tends to be regressive. A first-best solution requires subsidization of private insurance and/or public provision of the appropriate level of LTC. The support for these instruments is less strong in a second-best setting, as there may be a conflict between the correction for myopia and redistribution. Public LTC provision is never optimal when private insurance markets are fair (irrespective of the proportion of myopic individuals and their degree of misperception). Under loading costs, the solution may require a combination of private and public insurance or even rely solely on public provision. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We use this framework to show analytically how higher degrees of dollarization induce larger volatilities of the output gap and inflation, thus hampering a central bank's effectiveness to stabilize the economy. Our impulse response functions show that the transmission of such shocks has a positive (negative) effect on inflation and negative (positive) effect on the output gap when money aggregates and consumption are complements (substitutes).","[Felices, Guillermo] Barclay Capital, Barclays, NY 10019 USA; [Tuesta, Vicente] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CTR Catolica, Finance Dept, Lima, Peru",Barclays; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Tuesta, V (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CTR Catolica, Finance Dept, Lima, Peru.",vtuesta@pucp.pe,"Tuesta, Vicente/HTR-5134-2023",,,,,,25,4,5,0,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By using costly warnings for minor offenses that would otherwise not be pursued, the agency can generate observable activity to escape budget cuts in subsequent periods. We show in a stylized model that warnings may indeed occur in an equilibrium of a game in which warnings are entirely unproductive in the agency-regulatee interaction, and thereby derive a testable hypothesis on regulatory agency behavior.","[Goeschl, Timo] Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Jarke, Johannes] Univ Hamburg, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Hamburg,"Goeschl, T (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, Bergheimer Str 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",goeschl@eco.uni-heidelberg.de; johannes.jarke@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,"Jarke-Neuert, Johannes/0000-0001-6407-5202; Goeschl, Timo/0000-0001-7618-5070",,,,,65,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The construction of these models is motivated by the failure of the Yitzhaki version of the Allingham-Sandmo model to predict correctly the proportion of taxpayers who will evade and the effect of an increase in the tax rate upon the chosen level of evasion. Recent approaches have applied non-expected utility theory to the compliance decision and have addressed social interaction.

We characterize the set of recursive Markov equilibria.

The current research specifically examines the potential differences in productivity effect between FDI toward developing (vertical FDI) and developed countries (horizontal FDI) and between electronics and non-electronics firms. Using panel data on Taiwan firms from 2000 to 2005, results obtained using propensity score matching (PSM) show thatmultinational firms experience a higher productivity following their FDI in developing countries. A time lag exists in productivity gain of investment to developed countries, and is relevant only to electronics firms. Employing the generalized method of moment of the panel fixed model to control for problems of endogeneity and unobservable heterogeneity, the empirical finding suggests that productivity effect caused by investing in developing countries remains significantly positive. A lagged productivity-enhancing effect is also found after FDI in developed countries for both electronics and non electronics firms.","[Huang, Chia-Hui] Aletheia Univ, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Hou, Tony Chieh-Tse] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Shoufeng, Taiwan; [Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Uniers, Jhongli, Taiwan",Aletheia University; National Dong Hwa University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Uniers, Jhongli, Taiwan.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,42,11,12,0,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The aggregation of these individual choices in markets and in other institutions influences the supply of amenities and local public goods. Pollution, congestion, and the quality of public education are examples. Over the past decade, advances in economic models of this sorting process have led to a new framework that promises to alter the ways we conceptualize the policy evaluation process in the future. These equilibrium sorting models use the properties of market equilibria, together with information on household behavior, to infer structural parameters that characterize preference heterogeneity. The results can be used to develop theoretically consistent predictions for the welfare implications of future policy changes. Analysis is not confined to marginal effects or a partial equilibrium setting. Nor is it limited to prices and quantities. Sorting models can integrate descriptions of how nonmarket goods are generated, estimate how they affect decision making, and, in turn, predict how they will be affected by future policies targeting prices or quantities. Conversely, sorting models can predict how equilibrium prices and quantities will be affected by policies that target product quality, information, or amenities generated by the sorting process. These capabilities are just beginning to be understood and used in applied research. This survey article aims to synthesize the state of knowledge on equilibrium sorting, the new possibilities for policy analysis, and the conceptual and empirical challenges that define the frontiers of the literature.","[Kuminoff, Nicolai V.; Smith, V.

Second, a substantial source of this system's cost-effectiveness was an unanticipated consequence of earlier railroad deregulation. Third, it is ironic that cap-and-trade has come to be demonized by conservative politicians in recent years, as this market-based, cost-effective policy innovation was initially championed and implemented by Republican administrations.

To this end, first, a Multiple Discrete-Continuous Heteroscedastic Extreme Value (MDCHEV) model is formulated to allow heteroscedastic extreme value stochastic distributions in MDC models. Next, an empirical analysis of individuals' daily time use choices is carried out using data from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) for three geographical regions in Florida. A variety of different MDC model structures are estimated: (a) the Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model with independent and identically distributed (IID) extreme value error structure, (b) the MDCHEV model, (c) the mixed-MDCEV model that allows heteroscedasticity by mixing a heteroscedastic distribution over an IID extreme value kernel, (d) the MDC generalized extreme value (MDCGEV) model that allows inter-alternative correlations using the multivariate extreme value error structure, (e) the mixed-MDCEV model that allows inter-alternative correlations using common mixing distributions across choice alternatives, and (f) the mixed-MDCEV model that allows both heteroscedasticity and inter-alternative correlations. Among all these model structures, the MDCHEV model provided the best fit to the current empirical data. Further, heteroscedasticity was prominent while no significant inter-alternative correlations were found. Specifically, the MDCHEV parameter estimates revealed the significant presence of heteroscedasticity in the random utility components of different activity type choice alternatives. On the other hand, the MDCEV model resulted in inferior model fit and systematic discrepancies between the observed and predicted distributions of time allocations, which can be traced to the thick right tail of the type-1 extreme value distribution. The MDCHEV model addressed these issues to a considerable extent by allowing tighter stochastic distributions for certain choice alternatives, thanks to its accommodation of heteroscedasticity among random utility components. Furthermore, spatial transferability assessments using different transferability metrics also suggest that the MDCHEV model clearly outperformed the MDCEV model. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

China has undertaken some concrete steps to push forward RMB internationalisation such as the Pilot Scheme of Cross-Border Trade Settlement in the RMB, RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor, Dim Sum bonds, and bilateral currency swap agreements. Where the RMB stands in the process of becoming an international currency is assessed by reviewing the progress China has made and analysing the challenges China faces in internationalising its currency. Based on this assessment, a roadmap for internationalising the RMB is drawn from two perspectives: the functions of the RMB as an international currency and the scope of RMB use in the global financial system. A possible roadmap for RMB internationalisation is to begin from RMB settlement in cross-border trade, followed by regionalisation of the RMB, and finally globalisation. With respect to achieving the functions of an international currency, the RMB should first become a settlement currency, then a denomination currency, and lastly, a reserve currency.","Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University,"Cui, YM (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",cuiyuming@fuji.waseda.jp,,"Cui, Yuming/0000-0002-3314-5842",,,,,16,7,8,5,110,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Based on sectoral price responses to macroeconomic shocks estimated from an approximate factor model, we find that the frequency of price changes explains a relevant share of the cross-sectional variation of the speed and size of responses. Moreover, there is little evidence that the volatility of sectoral inflation due to idiosyncratic shocks dampens the size and speed of the responses to macroeconomic shocks. These findings support a multi-sector model with sticky prices rather than a rational-inattention model. We derive the results from different modelling and sampling decisions proposed in the literature, and we find that the explanatory power of the frequency of price changes for the speed of response to a macroeconomic shock proves robust in the face of these decisions. Other results are sensitive with respect to the choice of the factor model and the treatment of outliers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

During the 1980s and 1990s, monetary targeting was the dominant monetary policy framework in Nigeria. However, in 2006 the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) adopted the new monetary policy framework through which short-term interest rates are adjusted to achieve stability in the value of the domestic currency. This paper has presented an empirical investigation into the demand for Nigerian real narrow money (M1) over the period 1960-2008 in an attempt to identify whether the CBN were right to adopt the new monetary policy framework. In doing so, we estimate alternative (canonical and extended) specifications of M1 demand using structural change methods. Our results suggest that the canonical specification is well-determined. Although the money demand relationship went through a regime shift in 1986, it is largely stable. These findings favour the use of supply of money as an instrument of monetary policy, thus lending limited support for the new monetary policy framework. (C) 2013 Society for Policy Modeling.

Second, the impacts of economic growth and import price on CPI inflation appeared relatively greater. Third, the inflationary effects of external shocks using the quarterly data are similar to those using monthly data except for the impact of oil price inflation shock In conclusion, nonmonetary international factors influenced inflation dynamics in Korea in addition to the monetary shocks. Therefore, it is recommended that in order to reduce excessive fluctuation in CPI inflation, an import-dependent economy such as Korea should ease its excessive dependence on high-cost foreign intermediates over the long-term through import-substitution policies and allow a real appreciation of the domestic currency.","[Lee, Min-Hwan] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Pusan, South Korea; [Yeo, Taek-Dong] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Int Econ & Business, Gyeong San 712749, Kyung Buk, South Korea",Pusan National University; Yeungnam University,"Yeo, TD (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Sch Int Econ & Business, 214-1 Dae Dong, Gyeong San 712749, Kyung Buk, South Korea.",mhlee@pusan.ac.lcr; tdyeo@yu.ac.kr,,,,,,,38,2,2,2,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Here, we propose the use of one member of the family of exponential Gumbel distributions in order to study a potential nonlinear relationship between environmental regulation and manufacturing productivity in Mexico using a data set at the plant level. We show that the link between environmental regulation and productivity is in fact nonlinear and that there is a decreasing trade-off between those variables in the manufacturing industry. We find that such trade-off is high for small firms, but almost negligible for large companies. Thus, we argue that much of the debate on different effects is due to the heterogeneity of the industry.

Empirical methods, considering structural change, were applied and show that before the break, intratemporal elasticity of substitution dominates, but subsequently the relation inverted and intertemporal elasticity became predominant and hence, the theoretical response of trade balance changed.

This finding helps explain why an oil production shortfall of the same magnitude is associated with a stronger response of oil prices and more severe macroeconomic consequences over time, while a similar oil price increase is associated with smaller output effects. Oil supply shocks also account for a smaller fraction of real oil price variability in more recent periods, in contrast to oil demand shocks.

In this paper, we propose a methodology to evaluate the impact of taxation of a food market taking into account the strategic price response of both manufacturers and retailers. We apply this methodology to the French SD market and simulate the impacts of ad valorem and excise taxes. We find that firms behave differently when facing an ad valorem tax or an excise tax. An excise tax is overshifted to consumer prices while an ad valorem tax is undershifted to consumer prices. We find that an excise tax based on the sugar content of SD is the most effective at reducing SD consumption. Our results also indicate that ignoring strategic pricing by firms leads to misestimations of the impact of taxation by between 15% and 40% depending on the products and the tax implemented. In the short-term, that is, ignoring positive long-term health effects, a is an element of 9 cents/1 excise tax has a small negative welfare effect (about El/person/year). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A large body of work views the two recent cyclical U.S. episodes, namely, the new economy boom in the late 1990s, and the 2000s housing boom-bust as episodes where over-optimistic beliefs have played a significant role. These episodes have revived interest in expectations driven business cycles models. However, previous work in this area has not addressed the important asymmetry feature of business cycles. This paper takes a step towards addressing this limitation of expectations driven business cycle models. We propose a generalization of the Greenwood et al. (1988) model with vintage capital and learning about capital embodied productivity and show it can deliver fluctuations that are asymmetric as in the U.S. data. Learning, calibrated to match the procyclical forecast precision from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, is crucial for the model's ability to generate asymmetries. Forecast errors generated by the model are shown to trigger recessions that mimic in magnitude, duration and depth the typical post WW II U.S. recession. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This channel combines bank credit supply and interest rates on loans as a cost to firms. The thrust of the CCC is that it makes both aggregate demand and aggregate supply dependent on monetary policy. As a consequence (1) credit market conditions (e.g. risk spreads) are important sources and indicators of macroeconomic shocks, (2) the real effects of monetary policy are larger and persistent. We have applied the Cointegrated Vector Autoregression (CVAR) econometric methodology to Italy and Germany in the hard' EMS period and in the European Monetary Union (EMU) period. The short-run and long-run effects of the CCC are detectable for both countries in both periods.

This paper offers an explanation for the sharp break in the fluctuations of labor market variables based on endogenous labor supply decisions following the mortgage market deregulation. We set up a search model with efficient bargaining and financial frictions, in which impatient borrowers can take an amount of credit that cannot exceed a proportion of the expected value of their real estate holdings. When borrowers equity requirements are low, the impact of a positive technology shock on the marginal utility of consumption is strengthened, which in turn results in lower hours per worker and higher wages in the bargaining process. This shift in labor supply discourages firms from opening vacancies, reducing the impact of the shock on employment. We simulate the effects of an increase in both the loan-to-value ratio and the share of borrowers in total population. Our exercise shows that the response of labor market variables might have been substantially affected by the increase in household leverage in the US in the last twenty years. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper lays down the facts about Latvia's boom and bust and analyzes the policy response and the mechanics of the adjustment through internal devaluation. While Latvia's adjustment was very costly, with a large drop in output, a big increase in unemployment, and substantial emigration, it was eventually successful. The internal devaluation worked faster, though quite differently, than what had been expected. Productivity increases, rather than nominal wage cuts, drove much of the unit labor cost reduction. These then led to an increase in profit margins, rather than a decrease in prices, and to a surprisingly fast supply response. The strong front-loaded adjustment did not prevent the recovery. The lessons of the Latvian experience for other countries may however be limited, since many of the elements of the eventual success appear to have been due to factors largely specific to Latvia, factors that are not present in southern euro countries, in particular.","[Blanchard, Olivier J.; Griffiths, Mark; Gruss, Bertrand] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Blanchard, OJ (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,"Griffiths, Mark D./AAY-3546-2021","Griffiths, Mark D./0000-0001-8880-6524",,,,,49,34,36,0,11,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We identify significant business cycle divergence taking place in the mid-eighties, followed by a persistent convergence period spanning most of the nineties. This convergent episode finishes roughly with the birth of the European Monetary Union. We show that a hypothetical euro area including all the new members of the recent enlargement rounds does not imply a sizeable decrease in the optimality of the currency union.

The purpose of this article is to test these hypotheses using an evolutionary simulation model. To this end, we use a model of endogenous growth and structural change into which an environmental dimension is incorporated. The results of our simulations certainly reveal structural change within service industries but no change in the distribution of employment between services and manufacturing. Furthermore, we show that the environmentally desirable stagnation of labor productivity in the capital goods sector is compatible with a largely positive growth trend in the economy as a whole, with the development of knowledge-intensive business services apparently able partially to offset the stagnation of productivity in the capital goods sector. We conclude by emphasizing the need for environmental innovation in service activities and cast doubt on the long-term effectiveness of an environmental tax in the fight against pollution.","[Desmarchelier, Benoit; Gallouj, Faiz] Univ Lille 1, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille,"Gallouj, F (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 1, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",benoit.desmarchelier@ed.univ-lille1.fr; Faiz.Gallouj@univ-lille1.fr,"Gallouj, Faïz/AEB-1304-2022; Gallouj, Faïz/P-6851-2017","Gallouj, Faïz/0000-0002-9837-8778; Gallouj, Faïz/0000-0002-9837-8778; Desmarchelier, Benoit/0000-0001-7981-192X",,,,,34,6,6,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We construct competitiveness measures at both industry and plant level using OECD STAN data in order to confront this hypothesis with empirical evidence. Our results show that plants' export intensity is positively correlated with German competitiveness. Exploiting a plant-level competitiveness measure, we use a corner solution model that enables us to decompose the total effect into its component effects at the intensive and extensive margins. Our results indicate a positive and significant effect of competitiveness at both margins, but this turns out to be insignificant before the introduction of the Euro. A one standard deviation increase in a plant's competitiveness (about 70%) is associated with a 2% higher probability to become an exporter. At the intensive margin, the same increase in competitiveness leads to a 0.49 percentage point increase in export intensity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In that case, an efficient entrant is not necessarily foreclosed through exclusive contracts but induces buyers to breach. Because breaching buyers have to pay expectation damages to the incumbent, the downstream profits they obtain when breaching must be large enough.

This view implies that the key to overcoming the euro crisis is in the external adjustment, not the fiscal adjustment. Another implication is that in a crisis a strong fiscal adjustment is desirable, not because it can immediately reduce the public debt/GDP ratio, but because it reduces domestic absorption and thus reinforces the external adjustment.","Ctr European Policy Studies, Brussels, Belgium",,"Gros, D (通讯作者)，Ctr European Policy Studies, Brussels, Belgium.",danielg@ceps.eu,,"Gros, Daniel/0000-0002-2911-8235",,,,,18,30,30,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

This paper compares the migration potential and migration decisions for the Czech Republic and Poland using the data for inter-regional and rural-urban migrations. These data that can be used as a proxy for migration potential, are very useful in predicting the propensity to international migration. We come to conclusions that migration potential and the propensity to migrate as a reaction to worsening of the economic conditions at home are highly correlated. The comparative analysis shows that while Poles are quite sensitive to worsening economic conditions at home, Czechs posses lower value of migration potential and therefore are not so inclined to migrations. The results might explain the high volume of migration from Poland after the EU 2004 enlargement.","[Kowalska, Karolina] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland; [Strielkowski, Wadim] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Strielkowski, Wadim] Global Change Res Ctr AS CR, Vvi, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",University of Warsaw; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kowalska, K (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",karolinakowalska@wne.uw.edu.pl; strielkowski@fsv.cuni.cz,"Strielkowski, Wadim/J-6112-2017; Strielkowski, Wadim/I-4374-2019","Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841",,,,,44,4,4,2,14,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The analysis employs a panel regression method with fixed effects and uses data for 18 EU member states with statutory minimum wage over the period 1996 to 2011. The analysis is restricted to teenage workers between 15 and 19 years of age and young workers between 20 and 24 years of age. The study finds a negative, statistically significant impact of minimum wage on youth employment, by which the disemployment effect appears to be stronger for teenage workers. The effect remains negative and statistically significant also when controlled for other labour market institutions. Taking into account empirical results, we can conclude that EU countries should be more cautious when setting up minimum wages for young workers, as disemployment effects may have been downplayed.","Univ Primorska, Fac Management, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia",University of Primorska,"Laporsek, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Cankarjeva 5,Pp 345, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia.",suzana.laporsek@fm-kp.si,"Laporšek, Suzana/AAC-5278-2020","Laporsek, Suzana/0000-0002-7787-8749",,,,,18,8,8,2,74,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A long-lived government can be trustworthy (meaning that it commits to its announced tax rate) or opportunistic (meaning that it retains the ability to change its tax rate after announcing it). Unlike in most prior studies, the committed strategy in this model is optimally chosen by the trustworthy type. We show that this change has significant consequences for the equilibrium dynamics The optimal committed strategy is found to vary with the time preferences of the two government types, the initial reputation of the government, and the elasticity of household production. This formulation explains differences in policy responses across governments in the face of similar credibility problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We approached about 4500 households, each participating in an all-pay auction, a lottery, a non-anonymous voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM), or an anonymous VCM. In contrast to the VCMs, households in the all-pay auction and the lottery competed for a prize. Although the all-pay auction is the superior fundraising mechanism both in theory and in the laboratory, it did not raise the highest revenue per household in the field and even raised significantly less than the anonymous VCM. Our experiment reveals that this can be attributed to substantially lower participation in the all-pay auction than in the other mechanisms while the average donation for those who contribute is only slightly (and statistically insignificantly) higher. We explore various explanations for this lower participation and favor one that argues that competition in the all-pay mechanism crowds out intrinsic motivations to contribute. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An augmented Taylor rule is estimated within a panel switching regression for a group of developing countries that have historically experienced such a switch and a group of comparable countries that in the same period continued to target the exchange rate. Results suggest that under inflation targeting, the investigated countries retained their focus on inflation, but their reaction to it moderated. The output gap and the change in the exchange rate are found to be not significant, suggesting that these countries likely implemented a monetary policy geared toward strict inflation targeting.","Univ Amer Coll, Skopje Sch Business Econ & Management, Skopje, North Macedonia",,"Petreski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amer Coll, Skopje Sch Business Econ & Management, Skopje, North Macedonia.",,"Petreski, Marjan/A-6336-2018","Petreski, Marjan/0000-0002-2675-8325",,,,,36,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

We analyze how the expansion of the wage gap between regular and non-regular employment affects the economy. If the steady state equilibrium exhibits the wage-led demand regime, an increase in the wage gap does not affect the stability of equilibrium. In this case, the size of the reserve army effect affects the stability of the equilibrium. If the reserve army effect is strong, the steady state equilibrium is unstable. On the other hand, if the steady state equilibrium exhibits the profit-led demand regime, an increase in the wage gap destabilizes the equilibrium. It is possible that depending on conditions, an increase in the wage gap produces endogenous and perpetual business cycles. The introduction of the minimum wage is desirable in that it mitigates business cycle fluctuations. However, the introduction of an inappropriate minimum wage policy leads to a real wage and an employment rate that are lower than the steady state values. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

GMM estimates using data from a survey of bank managers confirms the importance of these variables for inflation dynamics. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a land use decision model that captures biofuel-driven structural changes in market demand and derive threshold conditions that trigger participation in the program. We then quantify the impacts of biofuel production on participation at both the national and state levels using Monte Carlo simulations. The model is also used to analyze how changes in the persistence of the biofuel production boom and in the volatility of farming returns affect conservation participation decisions.

It computes effective tax rates to take account of special regimes, such as tax holidays, temporarily reduced rates and increased investment allowances. There is evidence of a partial race to the bottom: countries have been under pressure to lower tax rates in order to lure and boost investment. In the case of standard tax systems (i.e. tax rules applying under normal circumstances), the effective tax rate reductions have not been larger than those witnessed in advanced economies, and revenues have held up well over the sample period. However, a race to the bottom is evident among special regimes, most notably in the case of Africa, creating effectively a parallel tax system where rates have fallen to almost zero.

The stochastic dynamic program does not (directly) depend on portfolios of call options, but rather on a key ingredient: some transition parameters of the underlying asset. More in line with the literature on dynamic programming, our procedure is contract free and is well designed to accommodate all one-dimensional convex value functions of derivative contracts.

We examine whether the abolition of fees presented a trade-off between quantity and quality in primary schools, comparing Kenyas experience with others in the region. We examine the superior performance of private primary schools and elite, public secondary schools in examinations and summarise research testing whether this performance reflects causal returns to these school types.

To do this, we apply nonlinearity tests and threshold models. While the first tests enable us to check for further changes in the data, threshold models are required to assess the switching-regime hypothesis and to apprehend the main changes in public debts through different regimes. Our results provide several interesting findings. First, for both countries, we noted several structural breaks associated with well-known economic downturns, oil shocks, debt crises and financial crashes. Second, public debt dynamics seem to be characterized by various threshold effects that can improve the modeling and forecasting of public debt evolution. It is important to note that public debts vary significantly according to the regime and that a regime can be induced by specific macroeconomic factors. Keeping a close eye on such factors may help economists and policymakers to better control future public debt evolutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Extant studies predict that increasing racial heterogeneity reduces the share of expenditure on productive public goods such as health and education spending. The relationship, however, has been inadequately examined in the previous research because (1) the use of a cross-section dataset in previous research makes it difficult to draw a causal inference, (2) previous research does not sufficiently discuss the magnitude of the effect, (3) it uses aggregate expenditure data which do not distinguish between programs that benefit targeted groups vs. the general public, and (4) previous research does not take political representation bias into consideration. My paper offers the first longitudinal analysis to examine a causal effect of racial heterogeneity on Medicaid expenditure at the U.S. state level. Using state panel data from 2000 to 2010, I find that racial heterogeneity has a negative and statistically significant effect on Medicaid's share within a state's budget.

In a model of strategic trade policy, we show that the impact of a negative rainfall shock on optimal import tariffs is generally ambiguous, depending on the weight placed by the domestic policy maker on tariff revenue, profits and the consumer surplus. The more weight placed on domestic profits, the more likely it is that the policy maker will respond to a rainfall shortage by reducing import tariffs. These findings are robust to alternative assumptions about market structure and the timing of the game. Using detailed panel data on applied tariffs and rainfall for 70 nations, we find robust evidence that rainfall shortages generally induce policy makers to set lower tariffs on agricultural imports.

An equilibrium is purifiable if some close-by behaviour is consistent with equilibrium when agents' payoffs in each period are perturbed additively and independently.

Using a simple model of individual labor market participation under uncertainty, we predict that high levels of perceived fairness cause higher levels of individual welfare, and lower support for income redistribution. Income inequality is predicted to have a more favorable impact on subjective well-being for individuals with high fairness perceptions. This relationship is predicted to be stronger in societies that are characterized by low actual fairness. Using data on subjective well-being and a broad set of fairness measures from a pseudo micro-panel from the WVS over the 1990-2008 period, we find strong support for the negative (positive) association between fairness perceptions and the demand for more equal incomes (subjective well-being). We also find strong empirical support for the predicted differences in individual tolerance for income inequality, and the predicted influence of actual fairness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By grouping countries according to their geographical proximity, the importance of cross sectional dependence in panel unit root and stationarity tests is revealed. Using a recently developed nonlinear panel unit root test, we find strong evidence that the per capita carbon dioxide emissions over the last one hundred and fifty years are stationary.

The contribution of ethanol to the transport energy mix varies markedly by state. Heterogeneity in ethanol adoption and market development is investigated using a hierarchical, spatiotemporal model. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method is employed for estimation of the proposed flexible model structure. Besides spatial dependence among neighboring states, differential inclusion rates of ethanol are found to be largely determined by national- and state-level biofuel incentive policies, relative gasoline prices, feedstock availability, household median income, MTBE bans, and density of fuel retail infrastructure.

The Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator was used to correct for the presence of heteroscedasticity, and religion-related dummy variables were incorporated to investigate the relationship between religion and trade. The results indicate that religion creates positive institutional and network effects, increasing international trade in goods and services; these effects enhance trade in services more than trade in goods; institutional effects exert a greater trade-creating effect than deliberately designed institutional regimes, but a lesser effect than historically established cultural regimes, such as common language and colonial ties; network effects on trade in services, although less significant than common language and colonial ties, promote trade to nearly the same degree as regional trade agreements and shared legal systems. Religion establishes co-religious networks that positively affect interpersonal trust, thereby reducing institutional distances between countries.

I derive the implications for optimal savings behaviour in this environment and relate this to the frictions that characterize the endogenous earnings process implied by on-the-job search. Savings behaviour depends in a very intuitive way on the rate at which offers are received, the rate at which jobs are destroyed, and a worker's current rank in the wage distribution. The implication is that workers, who are identical in terms of preferences and opportunities, have substantially different savings behaviour depending on their history and current position in the wage distribution. The mechanism that generates the substantial differences in savings behaviour in the model is the dynamic of the wage ladder resulting from the search process. There is an important asymmetry between the incremental wage increases generated by on-the-job search (climbing the ladder) and the drop in income associated with job loss (falling off the ladder). The behaviour of workers in low paying jobs is primarily governed by the expectation of wage growth, while the behaviour of workers near the top of the distribution is driven by the possibility of job loss. The distributions of earnings, wealth, and consumption implied by the model (suitably aggregated) align reasonably well with the data, with the notable exception of implying substantially less concentration of wealth among the richest one percent of the population.","[Lise, Jeremy] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Lise, Jeremy] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lise, J (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",,,,,,,,34,46,65,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In the model, risk-averse consumers rationally choose the quantity and quality of information to process about their wealth, while constrained by a Shannon channel. The main contribution of the paper is methodological. It proposes a solution to rational inattention problems in rich theoretical environments. The main prediction of the model is that consumption responses to wealth shocks are asymmetric, with negative shocks producing faster and stronger reaction than positive shocks. The model also predicts that information-processing constraints increase persistence and volatility of consumption behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

I develop a location choice model that informs the use of policy variation from the quotas to address endogeneity issues well known in the social interactions literature. I assembled a dataset on neighbourhood-level ethnic proportions by matching more than 500,000 names in the phonebook to ethnicities. I find that all groups want to live with some own-ethnic-group neighbours but they also exhibit inverted U-shaped preferences so that once a neighbourhood has enough own ethnic neighbours, they would rather add a new neighbour from other groups. Welfare simulations show that about 30% of the neighbourhoods are within one standard deviation of the first-best allocation of ethnic groups.","Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Wong, M (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,55,32,44,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The share of the top 1 per cent is highly correlated across Anglo-Saxon countries, more so than with the share of the next 4 per cent. Controlling for country and year fixed effects, we find that a reduction in the marginal tax rate on wage income is associated with an increase in the share of the top percentile group. Likewise, a fall in the marginal tax rate on investment income (based on a lagged moving average) is associated with a rise in the share of the top percentile group.","[Atkinson, A.

Fully rational individuals were supposed to be completely free of emotions. Modern psychological research challenged this paradigm. One of the insights of this research is that though emotions indeed interfere with the ability to evaluate the objective consequences of choices, they also allow the decision maker to feel the difference in utility arising from those choices. In this article, I formalise this intuition by introducing the concept of emotional temperature. I show that there exists a positive optimal emotional temperature, which leads to an irreducible probability of suboptimal choice. I apply the model to characterise the optimal contracts under moral hazard, assuming that the emotional temperature of the decision maker increases when the contract provides more powerful incentives. A more general point the article makes is that a mechanism designer needs to be aware that the mechanism will not only affect incentives but also the degree of rationality of the agents.","La Trobe Univ, Dept Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Basov, S (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Dept Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",s.basov@latrobe.edu.au,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

The novelty of the study is to look at the interaction of these effects with firm ownership. We use firm-level micro data collected by the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) for 27 transition countries for 200209. Among other data, BEEPS collects information on different forms of corruption at the firm level and firm ownership. We find the somewhat surprising result that private firms (domestic and foreign-owned) are more involved in both informal payments and state capture. Our results also reveal that foreign-owned firms that are involved in informal payments are likely to benefit from these corrupt practices. On the other hand, state-owned firms are more likely to experience negative effects of involvement in corruption on productivity growth. After 2004 involvement of firms in corrupt practices diminished and their negative impact on firm performance declined, indicating an improvement in the stability of the business environment and law enforcement.","[Blagojevic, Sandra; Damijan, Joze P.] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze P.] Vives, Louvain, Belgium",University of Ljubljana,"Blagojevic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",sandraana.blagojevic@gmail.com,,"Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174",,,,,38,30,32,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUN 1,2013,25.0,2,,,,,133,158,,10.1080/14631377.2013.787734,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,137XY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318472900001,0

We first review the question of whether trade exacerbates or contributes to the climate change problem by increasing global emissions, a particularly important issue being the pollution haven problem. Then we consider environmental policies and trade. We analyse non-cooperative environmental policies and investigate whether trade undermines the effectiveness of unilateral environmental policies, in which carbon leakage and international competitiveness are of particular importance. To deal with climate change, cooperation among countries is important. In this aspect, we review the interactions between trade and environmental policies, border tax adjustment policies, and the role of the World Trade Organization in combating climate change arising from economic activities.","[Chen, Xiao; Woodland, Alan] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Woodland, A (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",xiao.chen@unsw.edu.au; A.Woodland@unsw.edu.au,"Woodland, Alan/J-9157-2012; Woodland, Alan/AAG-6239-2020","Woodland, Alan/0000-0003-0523-6517; Woodland, Alan/0000-0003-0523-6517",,,,,98,10,10,13,128,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In this paper, we make several arguments. First, there is always a substantial gap between actual production and the capacity of the economy to produce. Second, the great recession widened the production gap, but did not change the basic relationship. Third, the anti-recessionary policies, adopted during the recession, were anti-abundance policies, for the most part. Fourth, almost by definition, short-term (cyclical) fiscal and monetary policy regimes do not address longer-term structural issues or the creation of widely shared abundance. Last, but not least, despite the great recession, and the myopic policy responses it generated, the abundant economy-based on a largely undamaged joint stock of knowledge remains a genuine possibility.","[Dugger, William M.] Univ Tulsa, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA; [Peach, James T.] New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",University of Tulsa; New Mexico State University,"Dugger, WM (通讯作者)，Univ Tulsa, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA.",,,,,,,,17,4,6,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The agency view suggests that CEOs invest in CSR to enhance their own private benefits. On the contrary, the conflict resolution view argues that CSR investments are made to resolve the conflicts among various stakeholders. Using Bebchuk et al. (2011) CEO Pay Slice (CPS) to measure CEO power, we show that the association between CEO power and CSR is non-monotonic. When the CEO is relatively less powerful, an increase in CEO power leads to more CSR engagement. However, as the CEO becomes substantially more powerful, he is more entrenched and no longer invests more in CSR. In fact, when CEO power goes beyond a certain threshold, more powerful CEOs significantly reduce CSR investments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It builds on the model of different institutions by comparing America with a flexible wage and Europe with a rigid wage (the existence of union), where the two areas are integrated via perfect capital mobility. We find the necessary condition that the degree of wage orientation of the union is larger than the firm's bargaining power and determines the positive direction on global economic growth. In addition, the effect of union's bargaining power on global economic growth is ambiguous. If the sum of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labour and the output elasticity of labour is smaller than one, or the firms are characterized by a Leontief production function (HarrodDomar growth model) or an extremely low substituting elasticity (much empirical literature is supported), the union's bargaining power will lead to an increase in the growth of the global economy. In the general CobbDouglas production function (SolowSwan neoclassical growth model), the union's bargaining power will result in a decline in the growth of the global economy.","[Lai, Chung-Hui] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Accounting, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Lai, Chung-Hui] Cent Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lai, Chung-Hui] Natl Formosa Univ, Ctr Gen Educ, Yunlin Cty, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; Central Taiwan University Science & Technology; National Formosa University,"Lai, CH (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Accounting, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.",p9217770@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

We answer the first question affirmatively, having reviewed economic principles and evidence concerning the effects of projects locating in (or not being off-shored from) a country. On the second, policy can have a limited effect in influencing location decisions, but it is doubtful that it is cost effective. Implementation faces lack of information, risk of capture, and, in many cases, non-rigorous processes. Competition between jurisdictions means that much policy is investment diversion not investment creation. There is a case for supra-national controls (as with EU State Aid regulations), for policy to be used only for well-defined market failures, and for better implementation and more rigorous ex ante appraisal and ex post evaluation.","[Navaretti, Giorgio Barba] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Navaretti, Giorgio Barba] Ctr Studi Luca Agliano, Milan, Italy; [Venables, Anthony J.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Milan; University of Oxford,"Navaretti, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",barba@unimi.it; tony.venables@economics.ox.ac.uk,"venables, anthony/JDW-7805-2023","venables, anthony/0000-0003-0251-7479",,,,,69,5,5,3,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We found that the more internationally engaged firms create more knowledge output than their domestic counterparts; indeed, the more globalised firms apply more inputs and have the opportunity to use a larger stock of knowledge.

From that time, however, the Vietnamese economy entered a new phase, which has been characterized by slow growth, weak international competitiveness, and macroeconomic instability. Apart from short-term problems associated with the management of increasing foreign capital, the major factors accounting for the difficulties of Vietnam's current economic phase can be attributed to the Vietnamese style of the gradualist strategy of transition from a planned to a market economy, which protects state-owned enterprises, and consequently to the failure to respond to the rapid rise of China. For further industrialization and sustained growth, Vietnam should embrace a new doi moi that follows the efficient type of gradualist strategy, with a special focus on new reforms of state-owned enterprises and a policy that promotes the country' s dynamic comparative advantage.","[Tran Van Tho] Waseda Univ, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Tho, TV (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",tvttran@waseda.jp,,,,,,,10,30,33,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

Democracy is defined using the concept of Dahl (1971) who refers to contestation as the essential feature of democracy. Development is identified with the general progress of human beings (Ray, 1998), which can be better captured by the Human Development Index, and which does not include income improvements only. I assume that democratic institutions come from the middle class and social capital. In CEECs a higher level of social capital and a more consistent middle class than in FSRs generate better democratic institutions and consequently higher levels of human development.

Programs such as the Greater Mekong Subregion program of the Asian Development Bank and the MekongJapan Cooperation program focused first on improving physical connectivity through transport corridors, regional power development and grid connection, and telecommunications linkages, and were successful. However, as transport and trade facilitation became a priority, the weak institutional capacity of Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Vietnam resulted in a slow progress and is a major challenge to regional cooperation. Other challenges are the pressure on the use of Mekong water resources and the planned construction of mainstream dams, which could threaten the Mekong River Commission's role, the regional rivalry for energy sources, and the lack of attention to unskilled labor issues. The relations between Mekong regional cooperation programs and China are also a main issue to address if cooperation programs are not to become instruments of geopolitical rivalry.","Mekong Inst, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand",,"Verbiest, JPA (通讯作者)，Mekong Inst, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.",jpverbiest@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,14,15,0,59,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

At the same time, entrepreneurship is complex and evolving. The path between entrepreneurship and wellbeing is not clear-cut, and not all types of entrepreneurial activity are correlated with economic growth. Failure to acknowledge this heterogeneity has important consequences for entrepreneurship policy and human development, particularly where gender is concerned. The paper treats the complexities involved in defining and conceptualizing entrepreneurship, setting the stage for a focus on the gender dimension. As female entrepreneurial activity has risen in many countries around the world, it is important to acknowledge the diversity of such activity and the ways it does (or does not) correspond to an increase in human freedom. Highlighting the differences between necessity and opportunity entrepreneurship, this paper illustrates the formal and informal institutions that shape gender inequity in the entrepreneurial environment. It concludes with some suggestions for addressing this important issue.","[Warnecke, Tonia] Rollins Coll, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA; [Warnecke, Tonia] Rollins Coll, China Ctr, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA",Rollins College; Rollins College,"Warnecke, T (通讯作者)，Rollins Coll, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA.",,,,,,,,31,43,53,3,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This populist bias of policy is greater when the value of remaining in office is higher for the politician; when there is greater polarization between the policy preferences of the median voter and right-wing special interests; when politicians are perceived as more likely to be corrupt; when there is an intermediate amount of noise in the information that voters receive; when politicians are more forward-looking; and when there is greater uncertainty about the type of the incumbent.

The analysis contrasts Keyness chartalist conception of money and central banking with the peculiar post-World War II German traditions nourished by the Bundesbank and based on a fear of fiscal dominance. Keynes viewed the central bank as an instrument of the state, controlling the financial system and wider economy but ultimately an integral part of, and controlled by, the state. In contrast, the Maastricht (EMU) regime (of German design) positions the central bank as controlling the state. Essentially, the national success of the Bundesbank model in pre-EMU times has left Europe stuck with a policy regime that is wholly unsuitable for the area as a whole. But regime reform is complicated by severely unbalanced competitiveness positions and debt-overhang legacies. Refocusing the ECB on growth and price stability would have to be a part of any solution, as would refocusing area-wide fiscal policy on growth and investment.","[Bibow, Joerg] Skidmore Coll, Saratoga Springs, NY USA",Skidmore College,"Bibow, J (通讯作者)，815 N Broadway, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA.",jbibow@skidmore.edu,,,,,,,42,21,21,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We consider a market with one risky asset with agents maximizing expected utility of wealth over discrete investment periods. Investors' demand for the risky asset may depend on the historical returns, so that our model encompasses a wide range of behaviorist patterns. Stochastic properties of the returns process are established analytically and illustrated by simulation. The links between dynamic patterns in returns and different types of investment behavior are explored in the heterogeneous agents' framework. We find that conditional volatility of returns cannot be constant in many generic situations, especially if agents with different investment horizons operate on the market. In the latter case, the return process can display conditional heteroscedasticity, even if all investors are so-called fundamentalists and their demand for the risky asset is subject to exogenous lid shocks. We show that the heterogeneity of investment horizons can contribute to the explanation of different stylized patterns in stock returns, in particular, mean-reversion and volatility clustering.

The study confirms the existence of a labour market stratified by employment type/gender/unionised or non-unionised/firm size. The labour market structure is not only reflected in the distribution of wages but also in the social security coverage. The empirical result suggests that gender and employment type are the key variables determining the likelihood of social security exclusion. With the other conditions controlled, the female worker has a 65 per cent likelihood of exclusion, and the non-standard worker has a 40.9 per cent likelihood. For female non-standard workers, the situation is worse. Their likelihood of exclusion from social security soars to 80.1 per cent. The empirical results with respect to other fringe benefits not mandated by law exhibit the same pattern of social security exclusion. The empirical results emphasise the limitations of gender policy intended to rectify gender discrimination or exclusion alone and suggest a matrix policy that takes into consideration the complex labour market structure.","[Cho, Joonmo; Lee, Jaeseong] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwon, Taehee] Korea Employment Informat Serv, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",trustcho@skku.edu,,,,,,,43,9,9,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Embedding neoliberal principles in the treaties defining its governance, the EU has enshrined a peculiar doctrine within its constitution. We further argue that this BerlinWashington Consensus has serious empirical and theoretical flaws, as its reliance on Pareto optimality leads to neglect the crucial links between current and potential growth. We show by means of a simple model that the call for structural reforms as an engine for growth may be controversial, once current and potential output are related. We claim that adherence to the Consensus may go a long way in explaining the poor growth performance of the European economy in the past two decades, because of the constraints that it imposed on fiscal and monetary policies. The same constraints have deepened the eurozone crisis that started in 2009, putting unwarranted emphasis on austerity and reform. Challenging the Consensus becomes a precondition for avoiding the implosion of the euro and recovering growth.","[Fitoussi, Jean-Paul] Luiss Univ, Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Saraceno, F (通讯作者)，OFCE 69 Quai dOrsay, F-75007 Paris, France.",francesco.saraceno@sciences-po.fr,,,,,,,53,42,44,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In some recent papers a three-component inventory level dependent demand (as displayed stock level (DSL)) has been proposed. It has been assumed that demand is independent of instantaneous inventory level if inventory is above a certain level in a shelf. As the demand is independent of instantaneous inventory level, a retailer is always in dilemma whether inventory additional to that level will be kept in the shelf or to rent a new storage. In this paper we focus on this by developing three mathematical models. We show that the problem in choosing rented storage or shelf to keep additional inventory can always be eliminated (a) without the knowledge of optimal stocking points or (b) with the knowledge of any one optimal stocking point. Also, if there is enough opportunity to have an extra storage and a mild limit on inventory holding cost in the shelf is satisfied, then there is no need to display inventory in the shelf above the certain level. The results are illustrated by numerical examples and sensitivity analysis is carried out. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A well-known result in such setting is that under random matching cooperation vanishes for any interior initial condition. The novelty of this paper is that we consider partial rematching: players that belong to a pair in which both parties cooperate repeat partner next period, while all other players are randomly matched into pairs. Under certain conditions, this rematching mechanism makes cooperation the unique outcome in the long run. Furthermore, we show that if imitation happens infrequently enough then cooperative behavior is always present in the population. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a set of stylized arguments about information-related problems and their possible solutions in Central and East European markets, discussing separately measures to protect lenders, such as requiring collateral, collection, screening and data sharing, and those to protect consumers, including disclosure, data privacy and regulation of automated individual decisions.

The Case of the Slovenian Beer Market,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"We use the natural experiment of EU entry to test the hypothesis that the lack of consumer tastes for diversity in beer may be responsible for slow development of small breweries in a highly concentrated beer market. Our contribution is to propose that lagged imports diversity, which increased after joining the common market, may be used as a proxy for consumer tastes development. Our reasoning is that after the EU entry, when imports soared, consumers became increasingly exposed to a much wider variety of beer styles. This might have led at least some of them to develop a taste for diversity in beer. In turn, this increased appreciation of diversity may have led them also to appreciate more the products of domestic microbreweries. Using monthly sales data, we are able to find some empirical confirmation that variety of imports indeed helps domestic small producers to cope with increasing competition. This suggest that the >> taste for beer diversity << may develop as consumers are faced by a larger variety of beers. However, higher significance of domestic supply diversity compared to imported diversity may indicate that apart from actual beer tasting, there are additional channels of taste development, such as the general international fad for microbreweries which is developing in recent years.","[Sustersic, Janez] Int Sch Social & Business Studies, SI-3000 Celje, Slovenia; [Sustersic, Snezana] Re Forma, Res & Dev, SI-1210 Ljubljana Sentvid, Slovenia",,"Sustersic, J (通讯作者)，Int Sch Social & Business Studies, Mariborska 7, SI-3000 Celje, Slovenia.",sustersic.janez@gmail.com; re.forma@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,4,4,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2013,66.0,2,,,,,306,316,,10.1111/kykl.12023,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,126NN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317624500007,0

Any reduction in accidents following texting bans is short-lived, however, with accidents returning to near former levels within a few months.

This prediction arises naturally when well-documented effects of language structure are merged with models of intertemporal choice. Empirically, I find that speakers of such languages: save more, retire with more wealth, smoke less, practice safer sex, and are less obese. This holds both across countries and within countries when comparing demographically similar native households. The evidence does not support the most obvious forms of common causation. I discuss implications for theories of intertemporal choice.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Chen, MK (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, 135 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",keith.chen@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,326,368,9,160,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Examinations of the relationship between trade and growth have taken a number of approaches, differing both in the empirical methods, as well as the proxies employed for trade openness, trade liberalization, and growth, but results have been decidedly mixed. Our research differs from prior studies in that it does not examine whether trade policy, trade liberalization or the level of trade itself enhances GDP; but rather whether participating in a specific type of trade agreement/union and/or the number of trade agreements to which a given country or region belongs enhances a country's level of growth. For this purpose, we study the relationship between trade agreements and growth for 18 Latin American countries between 1960 and 2008. Empirical analysis uses an adaptation of the neoclassical Solow growth model. Even though supporters of globalization advance the notion that involvement in trade agreements will help a country's economy, our findings suggest that that may not be consistently so.","[de Boyrie, Maria E.; Johns, Roger] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",New Mexico State University,"de Boyrie, ME (通讯作者)，New Mexico State Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business, MSC 3FIN,POB 30001, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",deboyrie@nmsu.edu,,,,,,,58,6,6,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We relax this assumption and impose downward commitment; firms can commit only to paying at least their advertised wage. As each firm can only commit to pay at least their advertised wage, workers may demand that the firm pay more than the advertised wage. In labor markets with a finite number of workers and firms, the strategic interaction between firms makes it costly for firms to provide applicants the incentive not to demand wages in excess of the advertised wage. In equilibrium, firms may settle for running job auctions at the cost of losing control of the number of applicants that they can attract. When this strategic interaction between firms vanishes, workers never choose to demand more than the advertised wage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In fact, we find the volatility of macroeconomic variables largely unchanged before and after the introduction of the Euro. Exceptions are a strong decline in real exchange rate volatility and a considerable increase in cross-country correlations. To account for this finding, we develop a two-country business cycle model which is able to replicate key features of European data. In particular, the model correctly predicts a limited effect of EMU on standard business cycles statistics. However, further analysis reveals that the Euro has changed the nature of the cycle through its impact on the transmission mechanism. Cross-country spillovers have become relatively more, domestic shocks relatively less important in accounting for economic fluctuations under EMU. This explains why there is little change in unconditional volatilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, predictions of the available null-model methods can be derived analytically only under assumptions (e.g., sparseness of the network) that are unrealistic for most economic networks like the world trade web (WTW). In this paper we study the evolution of the WTW using a recently-proposed family of null network models. The method allows to analytically obtain the expected value of any network statistic across the ensemble of networks that preserve on average some local properties, and are otherwise fully random. We compare expected and observed properties of the WTW in the period 1950-2000, when either the expected number of trade partners or total country trade is kept fixed and equal to observed quantities. We show that, in the binary WTW, node-degree sequences are sufficient to explain higher-order network properties such as disassortativity and clustering-degree correlation, especially in the last part of the sample. Conversely, in the weighted WTW, the observed sequence of total country imports and exports are not sufficient to predict higher-order patterns of the WTW. We discuss some important implications of these findings for international-trade models.","[Fagiolo, Giorgio] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Squartini, Tiziano] Univ Siena, CSC, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Squartini, Tiziano] Univ Siena, Dept Phys, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Squartini, Tiziano; Garlaschelli, Diego] Leiden Univ, Inst Lorentz Theoret Phys, Leiden Inst Phys, NL-2333 CA Leiden, Netherlands",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Siena; University of Siena; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Fagiolo, G (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",giorgio.fagiolo@sssup.it; squartini@lorentz.leidenuniv.nl; garlaschelli@lorentz.leidenuniv.nl,"Fagiolo, Giorgio/AAI-6807-2021; Fagiolo, Giorgio/HGB-6892-2022; Squartini, Tiziano/H-8823-2017; Garlaschelli, Diego/P-2795-2019","Fagiolo, Giorgio/0000-0001-5355-3352; Squartini, Tiziano/0000-0001-9011-966X; Garlaschelli, Diego/0000-0001-6035-1783",,,,,68,56,61,1,58,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

After the collapse of financial intermediation in late 2008, the strategy of the ECB was to adopt several non-standard policy measures. According to our quantitative evaluation of the impact of the main non-standard policies decided in October 2008 and in May 2009, which notably did not include entering commitments regarding the future path of the policy rate, such measures have significantly contributed to preserving price stability and forestalling a more disruptive collapse of the macroeconomy.

A key issue that arises in pursuing this policy goal is whether, in the context of a welfare system that accommodates the combining of part-time employment with welfare receipt, part-time employment helps or hinders progression to full-time employment. We investigate this issue using panel data on single mothers, estimating dynamic random effects multinomial logit models of labour force status that distinguish part-time employment, allowing investigation of whether part-time work represents a 'stepping-stone' to full-time employment. Evidence in support of the stepping stone hypothesis is found. Part-time employment on average increases the next-year full-time employment probability by five percentage points.

We consider a political economy setting in which elected representatives bargain over the degree of centralization within the union. In our model, strategic delegation affects the identity of the representatives, and hence the equilibrium policy outcome. We show that the relationship between the extensive and the intensive margin of centralization may be non-monotonic: Up to a certain threshold a larger size implies deeper integration, whereas beyond that threshold centralization declines with further increases in size. We also show that freezing the level of centralization and associate memberships can mitigate this trade-off.","[Lorz, Oliver] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Willmann, Gerald] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",RWTH Aachen University; KU Leuven,"Lorz, O (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, Templergraben 64, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.",lorz@rwth-aachen.de; gerald.willmann@econ.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,31,6,7,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

When the initial level of differentiation is high enough, the low-quality firm always launches first. Finally, we extend this model to analyse commercial piracy. We obtain that pirates are highly unlikely to launch the illegal copy first because they would bear a higher penalty and a higher risk of being detected.","[Martinez-Sanchez, Francisco] Univ Murcia, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Martínez-Sánchez, F (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos Econ & Empresa, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",fms@um.es,"Martínez-Sánchez, Francisco/F-4688-2016; Martínez-Sánchez, Francisco/AAH-4773-2019","Martínez-Sánchez, Francisco/0000-0001-8127-3649; Martínez-Sánchez, Francisco/0000-0002-9149-2340",,,,,17,3,3,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

We report an experiment in which players can issue non-binding threats to punish others based on their contribution levels to a public good. After observing others' actual contributions, they choose their actual punishment level. We find that threats increase the level of contributions significantly. Efficiency is improved, but only in the latter periods. However, the possibility of sanctioning differences between threatened and actual punishment leads to lower threats, cooperation, and welfare, restoring them to levels equal to or below the levels attained in the absence of threats.

A variety of mechanisms have been adduced to explain the emergence of this phenomenon. This paper integrates these mechanisms into a simple and transparent analytical model in which currency mismatches, large current account deficits, and large stocks of short-term debt interact with low reserve stocks to generate dual equilibria. In this context, the panic equilibrium is characterized by a currency crisis, a sudden stop, and an output collapse. The potential for various policies to avoid this outcome is explored, as are the implications of the analysis for reserve accumulation.","Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Montiel, PJ (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",Peter.J.Montiel@williams.edu,"fungsen, chan/H-1983-2016",,,,,,15,6,6,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

An unanswered question is why replacing the manager seems to be necessary for reversing poor decisions. One explanation is that managers have an irrational behavioral aversion to admitting mistakes (loss aversion). We test this hypothesis with a research design that mitigates many of the measurement problems associated with investment decisions in traditional corporate settings, and that allows us to distinguish agency cost from loss aversion as explanations. Using Major League Baseball data, we find that new managers, compared to continuing managers, are more likely to divest low-performing players. Moreover, when the manager is new and the previous manager was responsible for acquiring a player who is underperforming, the likelihood of player divestiture is significantly higher relative to low performers acquired by earlier managers. Experience of the acquiring manager does not affect the likelihood that the manager retains a low performer, suggesting that it is loss aversion, and not career concerns, that motivates acquiring managers to retain low performers. The findings suggest that loss aversion plays a significant role in managerial decisions and managerial turnover.

The main reason why this process is not infinitely fast, is the presence of adjustment costs, some of them technological, others institutional. Chief among the latter is labor market regulation. While few economists object to the hypothesis that labor market regulation hinders the process of creative-destruction, its empirical support is limited. In this paper we revisit this hypothesis, using a new sectoral panel for 60 countries and a methodology suitable for such a panel. We find that job security regulation clearly hampers the creative-destruction process, especially in countries where regulations are likely to be enforced. Moving from the 20th to the 80th percentile in job security, in countries with strong rule of law, cuts the annual speed of adjustment to shocks by a third while shaving off about 1% from annual productivity growth. The same movement has negligible effects in countries with weak rule of law. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study is a theoretical attempt to provide a convincing explanation of these observations. We develop an endogenous growth framework comprising a profit/revenue-sharing scheme that simultaneously governs income inequality and economic growth. Therefore, we show that a share-based scheme can cause the workers to engage in performance pay seeking and, as a result, boost economic growth. Nonetheless, the intensive use of performance pay also results in higher income inequality. Because of the increased use of performance pay, there exists a positive relationship between economic growth and income inequality. While this result contradicts the traditional notion, it is supported by recent empirical studies. Our welfare analysis indicates that a more intensive sharing scheme does not necessarily raise the level of social welfare, even though it is favourable to economic growth.","[Chang, Juin-Jen] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Liu, Chia-Ying] Aletheia Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hung, Hsiao-wen] Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Fu Jen Catholic University; Aletheia University; Tamkang University,"Hung, HW (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan.",hwhung@mail.tku.edu.tw,"Chang, Juin-Jen/ABD-9235-2022",,,,,,39,3,4,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

This distribution of firm size is crucial for evaluating the welfare impact of economic policies such as barriers to entry or trade liberalization. Using a multi-country model of production and trade calibrated to the observed distribution of firm size, we show that the welfare impact of high entry costs is small. In the sample of the 50 largest economies in the world, a reduction in entry costs all the way to the U.S. level leads to an average increase in welfare of only 3.25%. In addition, when the firm size distribution follows Zipf's Law, the welfare impact of the extensive margin of trade - newly imported goods at or near the exporting cutoff - is negligible. The extensive margin of imports accounts for only about 5.2% of the total gains from a 10% reduction in trade barriers in our model. This is because under Zipfs Law, the large, infra-marginal firms have a far greater welfare impact than the much smaller firms that comprise the extensive margin in these policy experiments. The distribution of firm size matters for these results: in a counterfactual model economy that does not exhibit Zipfs Law the gains from a reduction in fixed entry barriers are an order of magnitude larger, while the gains from a reduction in variable trade costs are an order of magnitude smaller.

Market forces alone are generally felt to be insufficient for signaling investment due to appropriability problems and the challenges of parallel (loop) flow. Further, there is no generally recognized method of estimating the value of transmission expansion. Here we extend the approach of Kleit and Reitzes (2008) to the nearly isolated electricity grid of Alberta, essentially eliminating the problems of parallel flow. With this model, we are able to determine the value of electricity flows to and from Alberta, as well as the transactions costs associated with those flows. We are also able to value the impact of transmission expansion in Alberta. We apply this model to a project currently being developed, the Montana-Alberta Tie Line (MATL). Depending on the relevant elasticity of supply, we find that the MATL owners will be able to appropriate between 80% and 96% of the societal value of their new transmission capacity. This high level of appropriability is in contrast to the conclusions of most of the literature in this area, suggesting that market forces may in some instances be effective in providing incentives for optimal transmission investment.

With the exchange economy replicated several times, prices and allocations in most experiment sessions adjust toward the competitive equilibrium in continuous double auction trading, though adjustment is much slower than in previous commodity flow (or perishable good) double auction market experiments. Price adjustment is evaluated by comparing its extent within each market replication (or trading period) to its extent across trading periods. More price adjustment occurs within trading periods than across trading periods, so price adjustment data are evaluated with the disequilibrium Hahn process model (Hahn and Negishi in Econometrica 30:463-469, 1962) of within-period trades. This paper introduces a stochastic version the Hahn process model and demonstrates that a linear approximation to this stochastic model yields an autoregressive process with a near unit root when the adjustment rate is low. In effect, the autoregressive price adjustment model studied extensively by time series econometricians over the past 30 years can be viewed as a reduced form of a stochastic disequilibrium exchange economy price adjustment model. Estimation of the model demonstrates that price adjustment in the exchange economy experiment is considerably slower than in economies without income effects, which suggests that the price discovery process may be a significant factor in the slow adjustment documented by applied econometricians.","Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, Orange, CA 92866 USA",Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Gjerstad, S (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, 1 Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",gjerstad@chapman.edu,,,,,,,30,8,8,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The effectiveness of PPP and the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) in terms of delivering government objectives and providing infrastructure and services efficiently are examined, taking account of private-sector returns on capital, implications for public spending (including future deficits and debt), the treatment of risk, the provision of incentives to deliver projects to cost and on time, and various other issues.

At this pooling rate unhealthy agents would eventually like to borrow but this would reveal their true health type. As a consequence, they rationally drop out of the market.

As both these quantities are unobserved, a forecaster has to learn about changes in trend inflation by a signal extraction procedure. I suggest that the forecaster uses a simple IMA(1,1) model because it is well suited to forecast inflation and it provides an efficient way to solve the signal extraction problem. I test whether this model provides a good fit for expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. The model appears to be well suited to model observed inflation expectations if we allow for stochastic volatility. When I estimate the implied learning rule, results are supportive for the trend learning hypothesis. Moreover, stochastic volatility seems to influence the way agents learn over time. It appears that survey participants systematically adapt their learning behavior when inflation uncertainty changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In a sample of 18/20 developed countries between 1978 and 2009 we find that, in periods without financial crises, increases in bilateral banking linkages are associated with more divergent output cycles. This relation is significantly weaker during financial turmoil periods, suggesting that financial crises induce co-movement among more financially integrated countries. We also show that countries with stronger, direct and indirect, financial ties to the U.S. experienced more synchronized cycles with the U.S. during the recent 2007-2009 crisis. We then interpret these findings using a simple general equilibrium model of international business cycles with banks and shocks to banking activity. The model suggests that the relation between integration and synchronization depends on the type of shocks hitting the world economy, and that shocks to global banks played an important role in triggering and spreading the 2007-2009 crisis.

The density measure is a proxy for synergies between the products in a country's export basket. The network proximity measure is an indicator of how difficult it is likely to be for a given country to move from its current product specialization to new products. We find that density and network proximity are together of importance for a poor country to move to higher income products and experience higher growth rates. Higher network proximity is associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing growth acceleration, but the positive effect of density tapers off at higher values. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The region has seen improved macroeconomic management and substantial and sustained reductions in poverty and inequality. In this paper, we argue that social policy, including human capital and education, social insurance, and redistribution, need special attention if achievements of the last two decades are to be sustained and amplified. Starting in the mid 1990s, many governments in the region introduced a variety of programs, including noncontributory pensions and health insurance, and cash transfers targeted to the poor. Social spending in Latin America increased sharply. These policies have been widely praised, and we believe they have resulted in substantial improvements in the lives of the poor in the region. However, a more nuanced view shows some worrisome trends. Moving forward, we believe it is necessary to pay much closer attention to the quality of services, particularly in education; to the incentives generated by the interplay of some programs, particularly in the labor market; to a more balanced intertemporal distribution of benefits, particularly between young and old; and to sustainable sources of finance, particularly to the link between contributions and benefits.","[Levy, Santiago] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Schady, Norbert] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Social Sect, Washington, DC USA",Inter-American Development Bank; Inter-American Development Bank,"Levy, S (通讯作者)，Inter Amer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA.",slevy@iadb.org; norberts@iadb.org,,,,,,,96,92,108,0,36,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The empirical results suggest a nonlinear and asymmetric relation between oil price changes and personal consumption expenditures. In particular, the effects of rising oil prices on personal consumption expenditures are greater than those of falling oil prices. While oil price changes affect personal consumption expenditures via real balance effects, smooth transition effects also come into play. Below a threshold value, an increase in oil prices reduces personal consumption expenditures. In other words, in the face of uncertainty regarding future oil prices, consumers initially rationally postpone spending. However, once oil prices above the threshold after a prolonged upward trend, the prices of domestic production factors rise. This fuels continued price hikes and further increases personal consumption expenditures until a cost-pushed inflation takes hold. Due to differences in economic developments and structures, the effects of rising oil prices vary from one country to another, with different countries usually to different monetary policies from each other. As a result, personal consumption expenditures also show various patterns across countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We describe how this type of sorting biases wage-hedonic VSL estimates and implement two new estimation strategies that correct that bias.

Using a World Bank survey of 1566 manufacturing enterprises in 18 Chinese cities, we investigated whether property rights protection mattered for enterprise performance. We found that property rights protection had a positive and statistically significant impact on enterprise productivity. Two-step GMM estimation and heterogeneous response estimation further established the causal impacts of property rights protection on enterprise productivity.

The present paper pursues two aims. The first is to characterize the SFS as a new prototype of a complex cultural good that expresses the link between the people and the place in which they live based on material and immaterial cultural heritage represented through popular celebrations. The second goal is to conduct an empirical analysis of the determinants that shape attendance intensity by estimating a zero-truncated count data model using a unique dataset of attendees at the SFS in 2009. Findings indicate that attendance is strongly associated with variables reflecting knowledge, institutional links, past experiences, and the perceived external benefits generated by the existence of the SFS. The article contributes to the literature by exploring participation in popular celebrations, a field of inquiry that to date is extremely limited in cultural economics.","[Luisa Palma, Maria; Palma, Luis] Univ Seville, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Seville 41018, Spain; [Fernando Aguado, Luis] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Econ, Cali, Colombia",University of Sevilla; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Palma, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Ramon & Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain.",mpalma@us.es; lpalma@us.es; lfaguado@javerianacali.edu.co,"Aguado Quintero, Luis Fernando/D-9838-2011","Aguado Quintero, Luis Fernando/0000-0002-1675-0418",,,,,62,28,30,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The overall view is broken down into domains, mostly into human capital, structural capital and relational capital domains. The well-known Intellectus model further distinguishes organisational and technological capital inside the structural capital and also business and social capital inside the relational capital. These domains are further refined into elements and variables. For example, the human capital domain in Intellectus contains-besides others-the element 'capacities', which again contains the variable 'leadership'. While this may suffice for a static intellectual capital (IC) statement of an organization, it shows two major drawbacks. Firstly, it is often fragmentary in the sense, that it does not show existing inter-dependencies and correlations between different branches of this taxonomic view. Secondly, it clearly does not help for the dynamic perspective of intellectual capital development. In this paper, a networked model of intellectual capital and its development is proposed. It extends a taxonomic model like the Intellectus model by links between the different branches of the model. As a result, the links in this networked model then serve as basis for intellectual capital dynamics, because inter-dependent and correlated assets must be recognised in development activities. This can be modeled utilising a hierarchical modeling approach for IC and knowledge dynamics, reaching from IC domain transformations to detailed knowledge conversions as drivers for IC and knowledge development.","Reutlingen Univ, Sch Informat, Reutlingen, Germany",,"Ammann, E (通讯作者)，Reutlingen Univ, Sch Informat, Reutlingen, Germany.",Eckhard.Ammann@Reutlingen-University.de,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,11,19,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000002,0

The potential welfare gains among the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are positive even though the magnitudes are smaller compared to those of the rest of the MENA region. We also quantify the extent of risk-sharing for the MENA region and show that it is significant for the MENA region and its subgroups; however, we could not find any sign of inter-temporal smoothing across the same groups. Decomposing the aggregate output shocks shows that the extent of risk-sharing is significant when only positive output shocks exist across the resource-scarce MENA economies.

The results show that for the 1992-2009 period, the overall welfare gains across MENA countries were higher than those documented for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations. In the Gulf region, the amount of factor income smoothing does not differ considerably when output shocks are longer lasting rather than transitory, whereas the amount smoothed by savings increases remarkably when shocks are longer lasting. In contrast, both factor income flows and international transfers respond more to permanent shocks than to transitory shocks in the non-oil MENA countries. The results also show that a significant portion of shocks is smoothed via remittance transfers in the economically less-developed MENA countries, but not in the oil-rich Gulf and OECD countries. Finally, for the overall MENA region, a large part of the shock remains unsmoothed, suggesting that more market integration is needed to remedy the weak link of incomplete risk sharing.","[Balli, Faruk] Massey Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Balli, Faruk] Suleyman Sah Univ, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey; [Basher, Syed Abul] Qatar Cent Bank, Dept Res & Monetary Policy, Doha, Qatar; [Louis, Rosmy Jean] Vancouver Isl Univ, Fac Management, Dept Econ & Finance, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Massey University; Suleyman Sah University; Vancouver Island University,"Balli, F (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",f.balli@massey.ac.nz; bashers@qcb.gov.qa; rosmy.jeanlouis@viu.ca,"Balli, Faruk/H-8162-2019","Balli, Faruk/0000-0003-2372-4709; Basher, Syed/0000-0003-3918-8285",,,,,27,10,11,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

In contrast, we find little impact of the early school environment on noncognitive gaps. Differences in endowments explain a small part of boys' noncognitive deficit in single-mother families. More importantly, noncognitive returns to parental inputs differ markedly by gender. Broken families are associated with worse parental inputs, and boys' noncognitive development, unlike that of girls', appears extremely responsive to such inputs.","[Bertrand, Marianne] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bertrand, Marianne] Natl Bur Econ Res, Ctr Econ Policy & Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pan, Jessica] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National University of Singapore,"Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",marianne.bertrand@chicagobooth.edu; jesspan@nus.edu.sg,"Pan, Jessica/AHA-4915-2022","Pan, Jessica/0000-0002-8640-9768",,,,,54,220,247,2,62,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

The theory of complete markets suggests that sovereign debt and credit default swap (CDS) credit spreads should track each other closely. In addition, liquidity risk should be priced into both instruments in such a way that buying exposure to the same default risk is identically priced. We use a time-varying vector autoregression framework to establish the credit and liquidity spread interactions over the 2009-2010 crisis period. We find substantial variation in the patterns of the transmission effect between maturities and across countries. Our major result is that, for several countries, including Greece, Ireland and Portugal the liquidity of the sovereign CDS market has a substantial time varying influence on sovereign bond credit spreads. This evidence is of particular importance in the current policy context. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This implies that consumers bear a greater share of the tax burden with per unit consumption taxes than that with ad valorem consumption taxes. This article seeks to test this theoretical result empirically using the French market for alcoholic beverages, which is subject to both per unit (excise taxes) and ad valorem (value-added tax, VAT) consumption taxes. Econometric analysis is applied to two consumption tax reforms affecting two distinct French markets for alcoholic beverages, those for beer and for aperitif. In 1995, the full rate of VAT increased from 18.6 to 20.6%; excise taxes on alcoholic beverages increased in 1997. Graphical evidence and econometric results confirm the statements of economic theory. For both classes of alcoholic beverages - beer and aperitif - the change in prices due to per unit excise taxes was significantly larger than that due to ad valorem VAT.","[Carbonnier, Clement] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, F-95000 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Carbonnier, Clement] Sci Po, LIEPP, F-75007 Paris, France",CY Cergy Paris Universite; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Carbonnier, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, 33 Bd Port, F-95000 Cergy Pontoise, France.",clement.carbonnier@u-cergy.fr,,,,,,,33,14,14,1,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We find that higher oil prices are always associated with a decline in private consumption expenditures, but the response of gross domestic product (GDP) crucially depends on the underlying shock. While a disruption in oil supply provokes a recession, positive world demand shocks prompt a temporary increase in exports and investment, which initially outweigh the cutback on consumption. In a counterfactual analysis, we show that the world demand shocks that led to the 2007/2008 oil price rise triggered a delayed 0.8percent decrease in German GDP in 2009, and therefore notably contributed to the recession of that year.","[Carstensen, Kai; Elstner, Steffen; Paula, Georg] Ifo Inst, DE-81679 Munich, Germany; [Carstensen, Kai] Univ Munich, DE-80539 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Carstensen, K (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, DE-81679 Munich, Germany.",carstensen@ifo.de; elstner@ifo.de; paula@ifo.de,"Carstensen, Kai/AAF-7834-2020",,,,,,39,10,10,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

In this study, we tested the long-run performances of acquiring firms and found negative results. We further found that the stock performance of acquiring firms was superior prior to the M&A.

According to the collected theoretical and practical data, the analysis of the concepts of labour market, economic cycles is carried out, and the assessment of dependence between the labour market and economic cycles in the EU countries is done in this paper. The main problem of this article is that so far labour market and economic cycles are being analyzed as separate subjects, without emphasizing common points, and the links between indicators reflecting economy's cyclicity and indicators of unemployment are not found. This paper aims to explore the dependence between labour market and economic cycles, as well as to do the research of the EU labour market indicators operating in economic cycles. According to the created test model of economic cycles and unemployment rate dependence analysis the change of the EU labour market indicators in economic cycles was examined. The aim was to investigate the level of indicators' contra cyclicity from different aspects. The theory of economic cycles and labour market theory, as well as the theory of unemployment can be linked and viewed as closely related systems of indicators. Therefore, the analysis of the indicators of these separate spheres is necessary in order to balance the labour market and at the same time economy in changing economic cycles. Thus it is important to investigate the dependence of indicators and their possible values. In order to investigate the dependence between unemployment rate and GDP, the quantitative research method was used correlation regression analysis based on the EUROSTAT data. Correlation coefficients were used during the analysis of the dependence between the unemployment and economic cycles.","[Ciegis, Remigijus] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ciegis, Remigijus; Nakciunaite, Egle; Mikalauskiene, Asta] Vilnius Univ, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Mikalauskiene, Asta] Lithuanian Energy Inst, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vilnius University; Lithuanian Energy Institute,"Ciegis, R (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, K Donelaicio St 28, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",remigijus.ciegis@vukhf.lt; egle.nakciunaite@vukhf.lt; astam@mail.lei.lt,,"Mikalauskiene, Asta/0000-0002-4301-2058",,,,,51,4,5,4,23,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Given the recurrence of the instability cycle and the higher probability of the economy to avoid falling into the liquidity trap if inflation is relatively high when a bubble bursts, then such inflation is preferable to a relatively low one.

Sustainable Innovation is something that is attained only when innovation in an enterprise is regular, systematic, and systemic to the endeavors of the enterprise itself - that is - Sustainable Innovation is part of the enterprise cultural fabric, is foundational to enterprise strategy, and contributes to the financial security of the enterprise. Innovation for Sustainability is innovation that is specifically targeted to address ecological and / or societal considerations.

The assessment report is referred to as a SEI News Report and is intended not only to provide feedback to the organization concerning its present SEI performance, but also to deliver significant foresight that will inform future SEI efforts, strengthening the likelihood of implementing not only best practices, but next best practices and sources of competitive advantage.","[Edgeman, Rick; Eskildsen, Jacob] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Edgeman, R (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark.",rledge@asb.dk; eskildsen@asb.dk,"Edgeman, Rick/AAE-9251-2019",,,,,,37,4,4,1,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,114,122,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000014,0

Given the prevailing economic climate in many the major economies of the world there is a need to develop the potential of other markets and Micro-states in the developing world are prime targets as they have historic ties with the developed world. Almost by definition, in Micro-states the population of indigenous firms is dominated by SMEs and in many countries there is an extensively researched correlation between the strength of an SME sector and economic development, (although continuing debate about the causations). There is also much current interest in the links between intellectual capital and organisational performance. Out focus is thus to explore intellectual capital in Microstates, to understand how it can be harnessed to improve the economy these areas and maximise any associated value in intra-and extra regional networks. We report the findings of a quantitative study into the presence and understanding of intellectual capital within the Micro-states of the English-speaking Caribbean. A survey involving 1500 SMEs in the Caribbean with a response rate of 42% was conducted, the resulting data was analysed using IBM SPSS 20. The findings indicate both that exploitable intellectual capital is present in the SMEs of the Caribbean and that there is a link between intellectual capital and organisational performance. However, the development of methodologies and practices for the formal reporting and measurement of intellectual capital is at a rudimentary stage at best, and totally absent in most cases. There is therefore an excellent opportunity for knowledge regarding intellectual capital that has been developed in the accumulated world to be integrated within the organisational operations of these SMEs in the Caribbean; this can generate benefits at firm level with increased productivity, efficiency, profitability, and knowledge sharing and transfers. There are also benefits to be had at the state level where national economies can benefit from the productivity of the firms at a regional level with networking (relational capital), having the possibility of increased intra and extra regional activity.

We improve upon the extensive prior literature on the effect of pension incentives on retirement by jointly modeling the transitions between employment, unemployment and retirement, paying special attention to the transition from unemployment to retirement (which is particularly important in Spain and other European countries, and whose relevance is increasing as a result of the recent economic crisis). Using administrative data, we find that, when properly defined, economic incentives have a strong impact on labor market decisions. Unemployment regulations are shown to be particularly influential for retirement behavior, along with the more traditional determinants linked to the pension system. Pension variables also have a major bearing on workers' reemployment decisions. The quantitative impact of the incentives, however, is greatly affected by the existence of unobserved heterogeneity among workers. Its omission leads to sizeable biases in the assessment of the sensitivity to economic incentives. We confirm the importance of this potential problem in the case of the change in early retirement provisions legislated in Spain in 2002 (which we analyze with a difference-in-difference approach).

We present an endogenous growth model with imperfect credit markets and establish how improving the efficiency of these markets affects modes of production, innovation, and wage dispersion between skilled and unskilled workers. The experience of U.S. states following banking deregulation provides empirical support for our hypothesis.

This article addresses changes in these behaviors for different birth cohorts by estimating cohort-adjusted age profiles for debt and payoff rates based on a time series of cross sections. Younger consumers are found to be borrowing more heavily and repaying at lower rates than older generations. The accumulation of credit card debt is found to continue over the lifecycle. This has implications for recent changes in laws governing the credit card industry. Increases in minimum required payment rates are examined and are found to increase actual payoff rates more than proportionately.

The major heavy metals found to have accumulated were lead, nickel, zinc and copper. These research results are useful for conducting preliminary evaluations of possible heavy metal pollution in other similar cities within the European Union.

In industrial sites, concentrations of key contaminants (Pb, Cu, Mn, Ni) are significantly higher than in residential and public-residential areas.

Analytical solutions for optimal monetary and fiscal policy rules depend on the degree of pass-through. Each country unilaterally uses its fiscal instrument to stabilize the costs facing exporters. The welfare effects differ strongly depending on the degree of pass-through. For high levels, both countries are better off with the fiscal instrument and welfare is closer to the benchmark flex-price level. For low levels, however, the unilateral equilibrium policy rules lead to high volatility in taxes, and fiscal policy ends up being destabilizing by transmitting exchange rate fluctuations. Because these results stem from strategic considerations by the two countries, the fiscal instrument is not used under policy coordination. In addition, imposing a monetary union increases welfare when pass-through is low, including the case of local currency pricing.

It has even been argued that the impact on the informal sector in the case of the minimum wage is stronger than on the formal sector. Using quasi-experiments of minimum wage changes and thereby exploiting geographical variation of the minimum wage bite, I find evidence for this hypothesis. Informal workers, workers without social security contribution, experienced significant wage increases when the minimum wage was raised while formal workers did not. This result highlights that noncompliance with one labour legislation, the social security contribution, does not necessarily imply noncompliance to other labour laws such as the minimum wage.","[Khamis, Melanie] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Khamis, Melanie] Inst Study Labor IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Wesleyan University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Khamis, M (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",mkhamis@wesleyan.edu,,,,,,,55,19,23,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, the empirical literature does not give unanimous support to the theory. Based on a stochastic general equilibrium model it is argued that the long-run relationship between stock returns and per capita income growth is ambiguous and depends on output volatility. Using a century of data for 20 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries it is shown that the relationship between stock returns and growth is positive over the period 1916-1951, in which output volatility was persistent. Outside this period no relationship between stock returns and growth is found.

In the Western Europe we put emphasis on: (1) explicit knowledge, (2) measuring and managing existing knowledge, (3) treating the organization as a vehicle for the information processing.

In conclusion, this new management concept has two important dimensions:(1) the assessment of knowledge; (2) a judicious management of the human capital. The economic environment where the SMEs are competing prove a continuous process of changing. Switching from a post-industrial based economy to a knowledge based economy has changed the way the small businesses manage their assets. The knowledge based economy, which includes today even the SMEs from Romania, alongside with other types of organizations, puts a great emphasis on the exploitation of the intellectual capital. Each country, company and individual depends increasingly more on knowledge, which materializes in: patents, skills, technologies, and customer information about suppliers. At the level of the SMEs, the technology and the associated processes act upon the individual knowledge, and especially upon the side of the intellectual tacit component. The management and the leadership are a powerful integrator in the nonlinear segment. The leadership is important by its power to act on knowledge, on the intelligence and on the individual values. The organizational vision and mission are also interesting integrators, which act mainly on the individual emotional intelligence. The organizational culture appears as a powerful integrator, because it acts mainly on the individual intelligence and on the values and creating models of the organizational behavior.

In a standard New Keynesian model, the central bank and private agents make their subjective estimates on the persistence of productivity growth. In this situation, if private agents believe that the central bank's projections include forecast errors on future productivity growth, these beliefs can destabilize private agents' own expectations because the central bank's forecast errors may lead to policy mistakes in the future. Consequently, central bank transparency does not necessarily stabilize the variations of the output gap and inflation rate.

In the early 1980s, centralized wage bargaining began to collapse. In this paper, we assess a novel explanation for both the initial establishment of a centralized wage-setting process, and its subsequent collapse. According to our theory, centralized wage bargaining was set up as a response to the spillovers created by the unemployment benefit program. Its collapse was the result of the increase in the productivity gap across workers, brought about by equipment-specific technological progress and equipment-skill complementarity.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Ortigueira, S (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",salvador.ortigueira@uc3m.es,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

This article analyses regional variations in outpatient antibiotics in Italy using a balanced panel dataset covering the period 2000 to 2008. We specify an econometric model in which antibiotic consumption depends upon demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population, the supply of health care services in the community, and antibiotic copayments. The model is estimated by means of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) techniques with Fixed Effects (FE). The implications of consumption externalities across geographical areas are investigated by means of Spatial-Lag and Spatial-Error models (SLFE and SEFE). We find significant and positive income elasticity and negative effects of copayments. Antibiotic use is also affected by the age structure of the population and the supply of community health care. Finally, we find evidence of spatial dependency in the use of antibiotics across regions. This suggests that regional policies (e. g. public campaigns) aimed at increasing efficiency in antibiotic consumption and controlling bacterial resistance may be influenced by policy makers in neighbouring regions. There will be scope for a strategic and coordinated view of regional policies towards the use of antibiotics.","[Ortiz, L. G.

Therefore, an analysis of the strategic flexibility of small and medium-sized businesses could help to find an answer to the question of how this business segment could deal with challenges from the external environment and what type of strategies they might use to achieve their goals. Flexibility to changing conditions is a necessary feature of any company in order to be able to respond. Hence, even if the number of jobs provided by the SMEs gazelles or the amount of the value they add does make up a considerable part of a region or sector, attempts to assess the Impact of new business formation on development should try to account for Indirect effects also.

In addition, it analyses the influence of the company size on SC practices. Research results show that Chilean construction firms are in an early stage of the path for achieving SC. Their practices towards SC are highly dependent of the company's size and its core business. Main barriers towards SC are the lack of financial incentives, lack of integrated design, and affordability whereas company's tax reduction incentives related to the level of investment effort on SC would be a key governmental policy to promote sustainability. The results of this study might be particularly useful for other countries, particularly developing ones, and for government policy making.","[Serpell, Alfredo; Kort, Jorge; Vera, Sergio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Santiago, Chile; [Vera, Sergio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Sustainable Urban Dev CEDEUS, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Vera, S (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",svera@ing.puc.cl,"Serpell, Alfredo/D-1024-2009; Vera, Sergio/F-8316-2013","Serpell, Alfredo/0000-0003-3939-4281; Vera, Sergio/0000-0002-7257-0710",,,,,28,103,108,5,66,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

However, we find that 36% of non-graduates are still enrolled. Using micro-level data with rich information on demographic and academic background, we employ a multinomial logit model to distinguish among graduates, persisters, and dropouts six years following matriculation. We find that there are significant differences across these populations. Separate evidence indicates that as many as half of those persisting at the six-year mark will graduate within a few years. Thus, six-year graduation rates understate success, but future success is not the same for all groups. Holding academic background constant, reported graduation rates are lower for Hispanics because they are taking longer to graduate and lower for first-generation college students because they are dropping out. The most important factor is academic background, suggesting that increased financial aid is unlikely to substantially increase graduation rates.","[Stratton, Leslie S.; Wetzel, James N.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Stratton, Leslie S.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Virginia Commonwealth University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, 301 W Main St Snead Hall, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",lsstratt@vcu.edu; wetzelwetzel2002@yahoo.com,,,,,,,25,2,4,0,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Results from both approaches indicate that, in general, an increase in the stock of FDI enhances the horizontal diversification of exports. The actual magnitude of the effect however, varies greatly across countries depending on the existing stock of FDI and stage of diversification, giving rise to an almost inverted U-shaped relationship.

There is an emergent need for a socio-technical 'knowledge solution' to create circles of impacts that bind building professionals, energy administrations, and citizens in a shared sustainability experience to address a number of issues.","[Wilson, Ian E.; Rezgui, Yacine] Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Cardiff CF24 3AA, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Rezgui, Y (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Cardiff CF24 3AA, S Glam, Wales.",RezguiY@cardiff.ac.uk,"Rezgui, Yacine/ABE-6712-2020","Rezgui, Yacine/0000-0002-5711-8400",,,,,62,14,16,4,41,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This implies that including bonus points in league standings generates a more accurate ranking of teams from best to worst than a system that only rewards wins and ties. Our preferred system awards four points for a win, two for a tie, one point for scoring three or more touchdowns and one point for losing by seven or fewer points. Such a system would also make it easier for supporters to identify playoff contenders and place importance on otherwise meaningless end-of-game plays in some matches, which would increase spectator interest.","[Winchester, N.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Winchester, N.] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Stefani, R.

In addition, studies that utilise product variety models assume that varieties of producer services are non-traded. Using a product variety model, this paper examines the issue of the skilled-unskilled wage inequality when producer services are internationally traded. The paper shows that, irrespective of the size of income share of capital, inflow of capital (which can also be interpreted as foreign direct investment) has no effect on skilled-unskilled wage inequality in the short-run. However, in the long-run, inflow of capital can decrease the skilled-unskilled wage inequality. An increase in the price of the agricultural good can decrease the skilled-unskilled wage inequality in the short-run. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the weak consistency, another regression method is developed to transform HFPRs into reduced FPRs which satisfy the weak consistency.

Their interpretation is that this misallocation is due to institutions and policies in these developing countries that redirect resources from productive to unproductive firms. Using the US. Census of Manufactures from the late 19th century, I find that the level of dispersion in these modern, less developed countries is very similar to that in the 19th century U.S. What is similar about the countries is their level of development not the existence of institutions that Hsieh and Klenow (2009) emphasize such as state-owned enterprises as in China or entry restrictions as in India. These results suggest that the institutional basis of misallocation potentially goes beyond these overtly distortionary policies. I apply their accounting procedure to the U.S. and find that between 4% and 7% of total manufacturing TFP growth in the 20th century can be attributed to a more efficient intra-industry allocation of resources. I conclude by discussing some other explanations for these results including differences in transportation networks and lack of competitive regulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Sub-regions can be considered as small regional units, within which the inhabitants commute for basic services, especially to primary schools, basic health services and post office. Territorial conceptual units are a specific case of sub-regions that are used by the Liberec Region in the evaluation and the support of economically weak areas. These units are based on the administrative districts of registry, building and other offices, and on commuting to work. Delimiting sub-regions can be used for an assessment of regional disparities, since these regions are on the one hand compact enough as compared with the individual communities, but on the other hand they are not too large (as compared with administrative districts of municipalities with extended powers). In delimiting sub-regions, commuting to nodal centers, number of inhabitants and basic services play a major role. For a comprehensive assessment of regional disparities, the article also proposes a hierarchical classification of higher regional level (the micro-regional significance centers, regional importance and major regional centers). To determine these further levels, there was also investigated the occurrence of major employers and institutions of a secondary and a university education.

Like many other countries that were hit by the Great Recession, the USA responded initially with active fiscal policy measures. But a more positive view of fiscal intervention appears to have developed earlier in the decade, and estimated decision rules confirm that there was an increase in policy activism. While this positive view has been tested by the unclear effects of fiscal policy during the Great Recession, recent evidence does suggest that fiscal policy may be especially effective in recession. Fiscal policy activism has also been tempered by recent concerns about growing government debt, a development which potentially might also undercut the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Auerbach, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",auerbach@econ.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,32,9,30,0,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

From 1999/2000 to 2005/2006, Germany experienced an unprecedented rise in net equivalized income inequality and poverty. At the same time, unemployment rose to record levels, part-time and marginal part-time work grew, and there was evidence for a widening distribution of labor incomes. Other factors that possibly contributed to the rise in income inequality were changes in the tax and transfer system, changes in the household structure (in particular the rising share of single parent households), and changes in other socio-economic characteristics (e.g., age or education). We address the question of which factors were the main drivers of the observed inequality increase. Our results suggest that the largest part of the increase was due to increasing inequality in labor incomes, but that changes in employment outcomes and changes in the tax system also contributed considerable shares. By contrast, changes in household structures and household characteristics, as well as changes in the transfer system only seem to have played a minor role.","[Biewen, Martin] Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Biewen, Martin] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Biewen, Martin] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Biewen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",martin.biewen@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,37,47,49,8,73,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We investigate behavioural responses in individuals' willingnesses-to-pay for private health insurance to changes in the public sector allocation rule (needs-based vs. random), the supply of health care resources, and the size of the public health care budget. Of particular interest is how willingness-to-pay for private insurance feeds back into the determination of the equilibrium price of health care resources, the probability of public treatment and which individuals are left untreated. Our findings are generally consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model, although individuals consistently exhibit greater willingnesses-to-pay for private insurance than predicted resulting in a larger than predicted amount of private insurance being purchased. A commonly used risk-aversion measure only partially explains this observed deviation. We also find that, relative to a system of public financing only, a mixed system of health care finance results in higher health care prices and sicker, poorer people being left untreated.

Such effects may not be accurately detected and measured in a classical permanent-income model without considering consumption habit formation as pointed out by Nishiyama (2005). To resolve this problem, this paper employs an extended permanent-income model which encompasses consumption habit formation. Both cointegration analysis and GMM are used to estimate the (modified) intertemporal elasticities of substitution (IES) between imports and domestic consumption and the parameters of habit formation as well as the (modified) intratemporal elasticities of substitution (AES). We find that import and domestic consumptions are complements in China, but substitutes in Japan and Korea. Different per capita incomes and consumer behaviors between China and the other two countries are two possible reasons for different relationships between import and domestic consumptions.

In this paper, we step back from the highly charged rhetoric and address this question with the two primary data sources for looking at compensation of state and local government workers: the Current Population Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation microdata collected as part of the National Compensation Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In both data sets, the workers being hired in the public sector have higher skill levels than those in the private sector, so the challenge is to compare across sectors in a way that adjusts suitably for this difference. After controlling for skill differences and incorporating employer costs for benefits packages, we find that, on average, public sector workers in state government have compensation costs 3-10 percent greater than those for workers in the private sector, while in local government the gap is 10-19 percent. We caution that this finding is somewhat dependent on the chosen sample and specification, that averages can obscure broader differences in distributions, and that a host of worker and job attributes are not available to us in these data. Nonetheless, the data suggest that public sector workers, especially local government ones, on average, receive greater remuneration than observably similar private sector workers. Overturning this result would require, we think, strong arguments for particular model specifications, or different data.","[Gittleman, Maury; Pierce, Brooks] US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA",United States Department of Labor,"Gittleman, M (通讯作者)，US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA.",gittleman.maury@bls.gov; pierce.brooks@bls.gov,,,,,,,40,31,38,0,10,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We apply knowledge from the extensive literature on diffusion modelling to develop and test our hypothesis regarding triggers and influencers of obsolescence and disposal of durable products.

The transportation sector accounts for 70 percent of U.S. oil consumption and 30 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Taking the externalities associated with high U.S. gasoline consumption as largely given, I focus on understanding the policy tools that seek to reduce this consumption. I consider four main channels through which reductions in U.S. oil consumption might take place: 1) increased fuel economy of existing vehicles, 2) increased use of non-petroleum-based, low-carbon fuels, 3) alternatives to the internal combustion engine, and 4) reduced vehicle miles traveled. I then discuss how these policies for reducing petroleum consumption compare with the standard economics prescription for using a Pigouvian tax to deal with externalities. Taking into account that energy taxes are a political hot button in the United States, and also considering some evidence that consumers may not correctly value fuel economy, I offer some thoughts about the margins on which policy aimed at reducing petroleum consumption might usefully proceed.","[Knittel, Christopher R.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Knittel, Christopher R.] MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Knittel, Christopher R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Knittel, CR (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",knittel@mit.edu,,,,,,,67,47,56,0,19,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In order to provide insights into consumer behavior related to digital piracy, this study aimed at developing and empirically testing the role of subjective knowledge and three types of expected consequences (i.e., perceived benefits, moral intensity, perceived risk) as antecedents of attitude toward digital piracy and intention to pirate digital content. In view of the existing literature, the purpose of this research was twofold: (a) to develop a conceptual model of consumer's attitude and intention to pirate, and (b) to empirically test the role of subjective knowledge, perceived benefits, moral intensity and perceived risk as antecedents of consumers' attitude toward pirating, as well as the role of subjective knowledge, perceived benefits, and attitude as antecedents of intention to pirate. The hypotheses were tested by collecting data via self-administered mail survey sent to an initial sample of 10,000 adult consumers in Slovenia, yielding a usable random sample of 843 consumers. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results of the study show that moral intensity and perceived risk do not play an important role in shaping one's attitude toward piracy, while subjective knowledge and perceived benefits exhibit a statistically significant impact upon both, attitude toward digital piracy and intention to pirate. In addition, consistent with previous studies, attitude is a significant predictor of behavioral intention. Taking into consideration the specifics of the selected context, it is hoped that this study contributes to a better understanding of the demand side of digital piracy.","[Koklic, Mateja Kos; Bajde, Domen; Culiberg, Barbara; Vida, Irena] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Koklic, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",mateja.kos@ef.uni-lj.si; domen.bajde@ef.uni-lj.si; barbara.culiberg@ef.uni-lj.si; irena.vida@ef.uni-lj.si,"Koklic, Mateja Kos/N-5778-2017; Bajde, Domen/ITW-2715-2023","Bajde, Domen/0000-0001-7135-6897",,,,,45,1,5,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We test this alternative hypothesis using a panel of data from the U.S. Electrical Censuses of 1902-1937.

For her, that something else was a change in the esteem that was afforded to the bourgeois, to capitalists and to capitalism. The talk changed and a change in the talk was what ultimately changed things. In this article, we briefly explore and defend McCloskey's (2010) claim that a change in talk was at the root of the Industrial Revolution. Further, contrary to much of the literature on the relationship between discourse and social change which tends to focus on discourse as an artifact rather than a driver of change, we argue using examples from outside of economics and economic history that a change in talk not only tends to accompany but often precedes dramatic social transformation.

However, several options exist for improving the efficiency of domestic emissions regulation. A prominent but contentious policy option for improving the external efficiency is the implementation of carbon tariffs on non-regulating regions. This is thought to reduce carbon leakage and increase domestic production, albeit at the cost of non-regulating countries. In contrast, internal efficiency improvements can be more collaborative in type. Among others, they include extending and linking of domestic emissions-trading systems. This study compares the relative economic impacts of those policy options if Annex I countries would follow one or the other. The study uses a computable-general-equilibrium model of the global world economy and develops a set of emissions-trading and carbon-tariff scenarios with various degrees of sectoral and regional coverage. For a globally effective Annex I emissions-reduction target of 20%, the results indicate that linking Annex I countries' domestic emissions-trading systems and expanding their sectoral coverage could yield greater global welfare improvements than implementing carbon tariffs on energy-intensive goods imported from non-Annex I countries. While non-Annex I countries would be significantly better off without facing carbon tariffs on their exports, Annex I countries could gain from either policy. The relative gains from linking and extending the sectoral coverage of domestic emissions-trading systems are greater for early policy implementation within a large Annex I coalition of climate-regulating countries, while late implementation within a small coalition would yield greater relative welfare gains from imposing carbon tariffs. The results suggest that, in addition to the political benefits, there exists an economic rationale for substituting the external efficiency improvements associated with implementing carbon tariffs with internal ones associated with extending Annex I countries' emissions-trading systems.

While supply is affected by construction costs, demand is determined by the renting/buying considerations of the public. As a result, the construction cost index (CCI) on the supply side and the rental price index (RPI) on the demand side should be closely related to the house price index (HPI). The present study adopts three price indices of the Taiwan housing market, the CCI, the RPI and the HPI, and examines long-term and short-term correlations among the three indices. Empirical results indicate that the relationships among three indices are nonlinear. More interestingly, this article finds that the HPI stimulates changes in the CCI and the RPI, although construction costs and rent are viewed as fundamentals in the existing literature. This phenomenon is rather obvious when deviations of the latter two indices from the HPI are greater. The corrective behavior of the HPI is more notable under these circumstances.","Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung,"Tsai, IC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",ictsai@nuk.edu.tw,"Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018","Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327",,,,,52,9,10,5,85,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

J,"Vallier, K",,,,"Vallier, Kevin",,,Morality and aspiration in Bourgeois Dignity,JOURNAL OF SOCIO-ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social morality; Political economy; Economic history; Bourgeois dignity; Industrial revolution; Moral philosophy,,"Deirdre McCloskey's book, Bourgeois Dignity, sets out to refute the most reputable explanations of what she calls the Great Fact-that over the last few centuries, the wealth of industrialized nations has increased by a factor of at least sixteen. She also presents a positive thesis, namely that the Great Fact occurred when Western societies began to ascribe dignity and liberty to the bourgeoisie by changing their rhetoric. I argue that McCloskey's positive thesis can benefit from an illuminating moral psychological distinction between what Peter Strawson has called social morality and individual ideal or what I shall refer to as moral rules and personal ideals or aspirations. McCloskey's positive thesis can be mapped onto these two categories and thus separated into two distinct theses: the Imperatival Thesis and the Aspirational Thesis. The former holds that societies that stopped blaming and ostracizing the bourgeoisie for their characteristic activities were the first to develop, whereas the latter holds that societies stopped ostracizing the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie started innovating because they took on new aspirations and ideals. These twin theses help to explain how the ideas of dignity and rhetoric operate in Bourgeois Dignity. I also argue that the distinction connects McCloskey's positive thesis to a large field of empirical and theoretical work in evolutionary psychology and cognitive science. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We then test the results in a controlled laboratory setting. The behavior of subjects is close to the theoretical predictions. Mistakes are relatively infrequent (15%). They occur in both directions, with a higher rate of over-sampling (39%) than under-sampling (8%). The main difference with the theory is the smooth decline in sampling around the theoretical equilibrium.

It conjectures that the presence of an outside option induces autocrats to behave like roving bandits: they use tax audits to establish control over regional companies, but exploit this control to extract private rents rather than revenues for the regional budget used for public goods provision.","[Libman, Alexander; Schultz, Andre] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Libman, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Kozlov, Vladimir] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow 101000, Russia",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Libman, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",a.libman@fs.de; kozloww@gmail.com; a.schultz@fs.de,"Kozlov, Vladimir A/J-6059-2015","Libman, Alexander/0000-0001-8504-3007; Kozlov, Vladimir/0000-0003-1788-1484",,,,,86,27,30,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2012,65.0,4,,,,,526,562,,10.1111/kykl.12005,0.0,,,37,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,026AT,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310241200006,0

The distances to suppliers and customers are shorter for indigenous firms in these Southeast Asian countries; but the arm's length differs across countries. The distance between firm pairs differs widely across firms within narrowly defined industries and countries. We find that both firm-level transaction costs and capabilities affect the distances between customers and suppliers. The distance to suppliers is longer for firms that have accepted guest engineers from the main supplier to maintain production processes.

Sraffa's little book is highly theoretical. To relate the two we must avoid stopping at Keynes, and include the whole group of economists around him in Cambridge, resuming the discussions that have been pushed into oblivion by the mainstream. The capital theory controversy was not the only one. Here, more relevant is the controversy on growth, income distribution, savings and profits between Samuelson-Modigliani and Kaldor-Pasinetti. As a result, a theorem, associated with Modigliani-Miller, was brought to fame and hailed as 'the core of modern corporate finance'. Its surprisingly wide acceptance is here harshly criticised and indicted of major responsibility for the present crisis. Inevitably, this is argued through counter-factual hypotheses. Yet, even with less sophisticated analytical tools, a framework does exist, much nearer to common sense, implying the needed flexibility and openness of mind for the major restructuring of financial institutions, which today so clearly emerges as the major task to undertake.","[Pasinetti, Luigi L.] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Pasinetti, LL (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Econ Theory & Quantitat Methods, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",llp@unicatt.it,,,,,,,38,14,15,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Uncertainty causes retail price effects: large buyers wield countervailing power (deliver lower retail prices) if upstream marginal costs are decreasing. If there were no upstream uncertainty, downstream retail prices would be independent of buyer size. With enough uncertainty large buyers have buyer power also (secure advantageous input prices). Downstream mergers, or organic growth of a downstream firm, change the uncertainty facing the upstream supplier and so result in waterbed effects on other buyers.

If the value of the expenses paid by card is high, and if merchant demand is not very sensitive to the interchange fee on card payments, social welfare can be increased by reducing the interchange fee on card payments.

Its starting point is Sraffa's reintroduction of the classical notion of wages as the cost of reproducing labour, so that they are necessarily a charge on production. However, when considering a production system generating a surplus, Sraffa offered no explanation of how the surplus might be realised and distributed. Rather, he concentrated on the choice of technique as the profit share varied from 0 to 1. His approach was one of taking a snapshot of a productive system at a point in time. In contrast, this paper explores the trend in wages in the UK over the past 150 years and the evolving level and composition of what became the social necessities of worker consumption, i.e. the customary standard of life. In this process, four dynamically interacting processes can be identified: (i) a progressive increase in the productive potential of the system; (ii) the diffusion of a greater quantity and varieties of consumer goods, the growth of property ownership by consumers, and their use of credit in a cumulative improvement in their customary standard of life; (iii) the consolidation of the customary standard of life into real wages by collective bargaining; and (iv) diffusion of improved living standards by an extension of collective bargaining coverage to include groups previously excluded, and the growth of the welfare state in which the failure to achieve the customary standard of life defines poverty and triggers policy designed to alleviate it. The central role played by the customary standard of life in driving real wages means that the inputs of labour power into commodity production can be represented by the commodity composition of the customary standard of life in Sraffa-style analyses. In this, the successive cross sections in the historical flow of economic development showing the commodity flows into and out of production will be ever changing (like the still frames in a moving picture show). Moreover, such a historical approach rules out the possibility that at any time changes in the rate of profit will precipitate the switching of methods of production. Past choices of techniques are historically embedded in the capital stock, the composition of which is modified by new investment and the scrapping of old as it wears out, becomes technically outmoded and/or demand for its products declines. Nevertheless, changes in the distribution of income have consequences for the future path of economic and social development, and what this might be is arguably the most useful area for economic and social research.","[Wilkinson, Frank] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Wilkinson, F (通讯作者)，36 Metcalfe Lane, Over CB24 5PA, Cambs, England.",sf.wilkinson@ntlworld.com,,,,,,,69,8,8,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We found that Central Asian transition countries, such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, have on average very poor management practices. Their average scores are below developing countries such as India. In contrast, the Central European transition countries such as Poland and Lithuania operate with management practices that are only moderately worse than those of Western European countries such as Germany. As we find these practices are strongly linked to firm performance, this suggests that poor management practices may be impeding the development of Central Asian transition countries. We find that competition, multinational ownership, private ownership and human capital are all strongly correlated with better management. If causally interpreted, this would imply that the continued opening of markets to domestic and foreign competition, privatization of state-owned firms and increased levels of workforce education should promote better management, and ultimately faster economic growth.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bloom, Nicholas; Van Reenen, John] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Bloom, Nicholas; Van Reenen, John] CEPR, London, England; [Bloom, Nicholas; Van Reenen, John] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Schweiger, Helena] European Bank Reconstruct & Dev, London, England",Stanford University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; National Bureau of Economic Research; European Bank of Reconstructon & Development,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nbloom@stanford.edu; schweigh@ebrd.com; j.vanreenen@lse.ac.uk,"Van Reenen, John/AAG-9587-2019; Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019",,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,23,34,36,3,52,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Obviously, such tax systems are exposed to horizontal equity (HE) failures, or horizontal inequity (HI). HE and HI have a firm grip on assessment of fair tax policies, both from an academic point of view and in general public debate. The dual income tax system of Norway was modified by the tax reform of 2006 precisely because the previous schedule failed to deliver equal tax treatment of equals. This paper discusses the meaning and measurement of HI effects of dual income tax systems, and evaluates the development of HI for Norway over the time period 2000-2008 using microdata. A copula-based identification strategy efficiently establishes a framework for evaluations of HI over time. The dual income tax system and the early announcement of its impending revision during the period under examination created measurement problems which we had to account for by defining a new income concept for the empirical strategy. As expected, we find less HI in Norway after the reform of 2006.","[Bo, Erlend E.; Lambert, Peter J.; Thoresen, Thor O.] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Lambert, Peter J.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Statistics Norway; University of Oregon,"Thoresen, TO (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",erlend.bo@ssb.no; plambert@uoregon.edu; thor.olav.thoresen@ssb.no,,"Bo, Erlend Eide/0000-0002-8956-0201",,,,,52,14,14,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In our setting, successful innovators undertake costly rent protection activities (RPAs) to enforce their patents. RPAs deter innovators who seek to discover higher quality products and thereby replace the patent holder. RPAs also deter imitators who seek to capture a portion of the monopoly market by imitating the patent holder's product. We investigate the role of private IPR protection by considering the impact of subsidies to RPAs on economic growth and welfare. We find that a larger RPA subsidy raises the innovation rate if and only if the ease of imitation is above a certain level. With regards to welfare, we find that depending on the parameters it may be optimal to tax or subsidize RPAs. Thus a prohibitively high taxation of RPAs is not necessarily optimal. We also show that the presence of imitation strengthens the case for subsidizing R&D. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model is a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium setup with a continuum of regions. Thus, it is a full stochastic general-equilibrium version of RICE, Nordhauss pioneering multi-region integrated assessment model. Like RICE, our model features traded fossil fuel but otherwise has no markets across regionsthere is no insurance nor any intertemporal trade across them. The extreme form of market incompleteness is not fully realistic but arguably not a bad approximation of reality. Its major advantage is that, along with a set of reasonable assumptions on preferences, technology, and nature, it allows a closed-form model solution. We use the model to assess the welfare consequences of carbon taxes that differ across as well as within oil-consuming and -producing regions. We show that, surprisingly, only taxes on oil producers can improve the climate: taxes on oil consumers have no effect at all. The calibrated model suggests large differences in views on climate policy across regions.","[Hassler, John; Krusell, Per] Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Krusell, Per] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",Stockholm University; University of Gothenburg,"Hassler, J (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden.",john.hassler@iies.su.se; Per.Krusell@iies.su.se,,,,,,,28,57,61,1,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We use experimental laboratory methods to examine the effect of positive inducements for filing a tax return. Our design captures the essential features of a voluntary income reporting and tax assessment system: human participants earn income, they must decide whether to file a tax return, and, conditional upon filing, they must choose how much income to report. Taxes are paid on reported income only. Unreported income of filers may be discovered via a random audit, and the participant then pays owed taxes plus a fine. Inducements for filing are introduced as treatments: a social safety net (e.g., unemployment replacement income) that is conditional upon past filing behavior, and a tax credit that is available only to those who file. Our results suggest that an untargeted tax credit can encourage participation, but that targeting the credit to low income earners offers a stronger inducement to file. Also, the provision of a social safety net via unemployment benefits has a positive, albeit an indirect, impact on participation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We show that a simple condition on evidence is necessary for the implementation of a social choice function f when the preferences of the agents are state independent and sufficient for implementation for any preferences (including state dependent) with at least three agents if the social planner can perform small monetary transfers beyond those called for by f. If transfers can be large, f can be implemented in a game with perfect information when there are at least two players under a boundedness assumption. For both results, transfers only occur out of equilibrium. The use of evidence enables implementation which is robust in the sense that the planner needs little information about agents' preferences or beliefs and agents need little information about each others' preferences.

This policy consists of labour cost subsidies for contracts subscribed by the municipalities with unemployed persons to create jobs with a public or social interest, combining elements of direct public employment and labour training. The analysis is carried out using administrative records from a regional public employment service in Spain for the period 2005-2010. The results from the application of matching estimation methods show a positive effect on the probability of employment once the contracts for the participants in the program end. This effect is particularly notable in the medium term and has intensified during the recent economic turmoil.

We develop a more comprehensive model that accounts for the fact that welfare stigma may elicit psychological effects and foster negative attitudes towards welfare recipients, affecting their employment prospects. We find two contrasting effects. The first reinforces the standard prediction: rational individuals foreseeing the reduction in employability defer welfare entry (deterrence effect); the second goes in the opposite direction: once assisted, individuals experience less welfare-to-employment transitions, both because of reduced search effectiveness and of reduced search effort (entrapment effect). When stigma is not too high, the latter effect prevails: more stigma yields to less employment and more welfare participation. The result is stronger if individuals are not able to foresee their loss of employability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, financial markets can force these countries sovereigns into defaulting. This makes the monetary union fragile and vulnerable to changing market sentiments. It also makes it possible that self-fulfilling multiple equilibria arise. I analyse the implications of this fragility for the governance of the Eurozone. I argue that the role of the European Central Bank as a lender of last resort is crucial in reducing the fragility of the Eurozone. In addition, steps towards a budgetary union are key in structurally strengthening the union.","[De Grauwe, Paul] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [De Grauwe, Paul] Ctr European Policy Studies, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"De Grauwe, P (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",p.c.de-grauwe@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,14,124,128,1,37,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

This concerns issues ranging from negotiations between political parties to conflict resolution within marriages. We experimentally study this problem using a simple voting game where information about preferences is private. With random matching, subjects overwhelmingly follow the dominant strategy to exaggerate their preferences. The exogenous linking mechanism by Jackson and Sonnenschein (2007) captures nearly all achievable efficiency gains. Repeated interaction in various settings, which could allow endogenous linking mechanisms to evolve, leads to significant gains in truthful representation and efficiency only when players can choose their partners.","[Engelmann, Dirk] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, CESifo, Nurnberg, Germany",University of Mannheim; University of Copenhagen; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Ifo Institut,"Engelmann, D (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",dirk.engelmann@uni-mannheim.de,"Engelmann, Dirk/H-2943-2014",,,,,,20,12,13,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

Indirect effects occur when the own action is changed to affect other players' actions. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of either effect.

As there are considerable differences in the composition of the consumption basket between rural and urban, so the survey data of both years is disaggregated into four sub-samples which may divide according to the expenditure levels of rural-urban segments based on head count index. The result reveals that the distributional characteristic of meat, fruits, soft drinks and all ready-made food products are low which implies that expenditures on these commodities are unevenly distributed over the total expenditures which favor rich families.

The share of GDP accounted for by training is less than a third as large in the new member states. A growth accounting method is employed to show that failure to account for continuous training leads to an underestimate of the impact of human capital on output growth in the EU.","Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"O'Mahony, M (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.omahony@bham.ac.uk,,"O'Mahony, Mary Philomena/0000-0002-0601-3991",,,,,37,19,20,1,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The results crucially depend on the underlying source of the oil price shift. When a rise in oil prices is caused by increased global economic activity or a rise in oil-specific demand, almost all countries experience respectively a temporary increase and transitory decline of real GDP. The role of oil and other forms of energy cannot explain the differences in the effects of both shocks across countries. In contrast, this role is very important to explain asymmetries in the effects of exogenous oil supply shocks. Whereas net oil and energy-importing countries typically face a permanent fall in economic activity, the impact is insignificant or even positive in net energy-exporting countries. In addition, countries that improved their net energy-position the most over time, became less vulnerable to oil supply shocks relative to other countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In an uncertain market environment, Mean-Variance Portfolio (MVP) theory provides a consistent framework to balance risk and return in power generation portfolios. Focusing on fuel price risks, MVP theory can be adopted to determine the welfare efficient system generation technology mix. Existing literature on MVP applications in electricity generation markets uses predominantly numerical methods to characterize portfolio risks. In contrast, this article presents a novel analytical approach combining conceptual elements of classical capacity planning models and MVP theory to derive the efficient portfolio structure consisting of an arbitrary number of plant technologies given uncertain fuel prices. For this purpose, we provide a static optimization model which allows to fully capture fuel price risks in a mean variance portfolio framework. The analytically derived optimality conditions contribute to a better understanding of the optimal investment policy and its risk characteristics compared to existing numerical methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of the proposed framework and provide results for the German electricity market which has been hardly treated in MVP literature on electricity markets. This article provides easily interpretable analytical optimality conditions for efficient generation portfolios from a societal point of view and therewith contributes to a better understanding of MVP in electricity applications.

The author suggests that differentiating between the two concepts of current account imbalance and international currency power imbalance can offer a persuasive explanation of China's positions on international policy coordination, and help advance the global debate on the issue of global economic rebalancing.

We show that when commercial banks are allowed to trade in financial assets (here equities) as a substitute for traditional lending, the macroeconomic system is likely to be an unstable one. We then consider a narrow banking system defined by a Fisherian 100 percent reserve ratio for checkable deposits and the ban for commercial banks from trading in stocks and other financial assets. Within the stylized theoretical framework set up here, we show that in the second system macroeconomic stability is guaranteed by some weak assumptions on the behavior of economic agents. Moreover, while a sufficient loan supply can be guaranteed in such a framework, the rationale for bank runs can be eliminated, in contrast to what is likely to happen under traditional broad banking. Though narrow banking is an extreme banking system unlikely to be adopted in the short-run, its features highlight the stability and efficiency properties that the separation between commercial and investment banking bring about.

In this paper! demonstrate that the rigorous application of this policy in Ukraine over the period 1999-2005 did not in fact eliminate significant deviations of Ukrainian interbank interest rates from those on the London interbank market. Estimation using weekly data over the period 1999-2005 illustrates that the government's nominal anchor policy visa vis the US dollar was effective at eliminating the risk of currency depreciation. However, other risks related to convertibility and liquidity were either not addressed or exacerbated, and thus deviations from uncovered interest parity continued through the period. This has a clear policy implication: monetary and financial-sector policy should be coordinated to eliminate convertibility and liquidity risk as well as the risk of currency depreciation.

The model is used to re-examine the relationship between the innovation in the North and the imitation lag of the South and to address the implications of the (weak) international Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection. When the imitation technology is modeled as a function of increasing complexity of targeted products, opening to trade increases the growth rate and welfare of both regions, but results in a larger North-South quality gap. While a full catch-up is possible with no protection of ideas flow, but also with no trade, the quality gap is always positive under full economic integration including trade in goods. Stronger IPR protection increases the gap and has a negative effect on the world growth rate and welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

His mistake was to think that the marginal utility theory of value can be, and was actually in the process of being, developed in a concrete and realistic direction. In fact, marginal utility theory has not to this day been developed in a concrete and realistic direction, and ironically one can find in Robbins's cogent exposition of marginal utility theory the reason why it is impossible to do so. This reason is not primarily methodological (attachment to equilibrium, to formalism or some such), philosophical (attachment to opositivism') or ideological (pro-capitalist bias), rather the reason is theoretical. Specifically, marginal utility theory can provide no comprehension of the macroeconomic aggregates that drive the reproduction and development of the economic system. The implications for contemporary economics are clear: utterly unrealistic otoy models' will persist in economics until an alternative value theory is adopted that is able to justify macroeconomic aggregation. These implications ironically bring into consideration the very labour theory of value that Robbins had argued to be usurped by marginal utility theory.","[Brown, Andrew] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Brown, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",andrew@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We use a Threshold VAR (WAR) framework to test for and then estimate a model with endogenous transitions between regimes. We detect two regimes, with a clear transition between them in 2003-4. The pre-reform regime is characterized by high inflation, passive monetary policy and persistent responses to shocks. The post-reform regime is characterized by low inflation, active and credible monetary policy and markedly less persistent responses to shocks. Using a model that contains sufficient variables to capture diverse transmission mechanisms, working through the real exchange rate, domestic credit and monetary policy, we find evidence of sharp changes in transmission mechanisms.
