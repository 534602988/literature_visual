The concept of sustainable development requires taking consideration into the legal system of traditional knowledge for the benefit of indigenous people who live in or near the forest. In modern administrative countries, the statutory legal system established by the government had almost prevailed over the common law system especially relating to management of natural resources. The statute regulating forest resources should prescribe the inherent interests to traditional knowledge of indigenous people in the forest. To endow indigenous people with inherent interests about forest resources and rights to traditional knowledge, the statute legal system and the common law system have to cooperate with each other according to the governance theory of cross-regulation.

CCGAP is a combination of the well known classical approach of chance constrained programming (CCP) and A-priori multi-objective approach of goal attainment programming (GAP) that is known to be an extension of goal programming (GP).

The transparency of business practices implies that for many organizations Corporate Social Responsibility is not more a luxury but a requirement. Although there are quite a few good practices around the world, what are real effects CSR has achieved so far? Since CSR activities are based on voluntary approach, environmental externalities although observable to stakeholders, often cannot be verified. Therefore, the concern about CSR is that instead of large number of initiatives there should be a comprehensive framework which would at the same time cover issues such as national standards, management systems, performance standards and reporting, codes of conduct etc. Corporations usually implement separate components or join certain initiatives thus often forgetting for example about transparent monitoring practices.

In Latvia, all taxes fall under the category of state taxes, since no tax is determined as a local government tax. State and local government transfers constitute a large proportion of local government budget revenues. Reallocation of resources through the Equalisation Fund of Finances implemented for several years has not promoted the financial stability of local governments in the depressed regions, and it has also to a certain extent hindered the development of donor local governments, since the currently prescribed financial sources restrict free legal capacity of these local governments to act with their resources. The achievement of budgetary independence is essential for the increase of financial stability of local governments. Insufficiency of sources of revenue to cover the expenditure of local governments and their dependency on the state aid leads local governments to become financially unstable. To diversify the sources of budgetary revenue for local governments, it might be efficient to increase local government budgets with revenues from the taxes where local governments themselves are interested to increase the tax base. It may be ensured by corporate income tax (CIT) which is directly related with the business performance result not indirectly as it is in case of personal income tax (PIT). Therefore, the authors suggest including part of the CIT revenues into local government budgets. It is recommended to compensate the decrease of the state budget with the PIT revenue for the non-transferred part of CIT to avoid the reduction of either the state general budget or the local government general budget caused by the reallocation, thus, proportionally decreasing the share of PIT which is transferred to the budgets of local governments. The research includes the calculation of the most appropriate tax reallocation proportion and the analysis of possible benefits and losses of local governments due to such tax reallocation between the state and local government budgets.","[Pule, Biruta] Latvia Univ Agr, BA Sch Business, Jelgava, Latvia; [Leibus, Inguna] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,biruta.pule@ba.lv,"LEIBUS, INGUNA/AAG-5993-2019","LEIBUS, INGUNA/0000-0002-2830-1409",,,,,10,1,1,0,2,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-0-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,33,,,,,24,33,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347130400002,0

This position is achieved, primarily, by combination of three physical comparative advantages: huge continental extension, fertile soils and tropical climates, which favors sugar cane plantations. Nevertheless, to remain attractive to foreign investments for sugar cane industry is necessary that price hedge mechanisms become truly efficient. In this context, this study's main goal is to evaluate hydrated ethanol future prices behavior at BM&F Bovespa, side by side with price behavior at major spot trading locations in the Brazilian South-Center: Paulinia-SP, Maringa-PR e Ribeirao Preto-SP, through the identification of an asymmetric transmission process between future and spot prices. This analysis is based on nonlinear time series models of TAR and M-TAR family; the departure approach used was cointegration with threshold, firstly developed by Enders and Siklos (2001), for the May 8 th 2010 to December 28 th 2012 period. Starting results indicate that ethanol futures contracts have an asymmetric short-term price transmission mechanism for Ribeirao Preto-SP and Paulinia-SP, although in a longer-term analysis the effect vanishes. For adjustment speeds, lesser values were found for Maringa-PR, suggesting that the greater the physical proximity between spot and future markets, the greater is the integration degree among them.","[Tonin, Joao Ricardo; de Jesus Godoy, Antonio Augusto] Univ Estadual Maringa, Econ Theory Econ Postgrad Programme, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Tonin, Julyerme Matheus] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Econ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Dias, Joilson] Univ Estadual Maringa, Econ Dept DCO, Maringa, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Maringa; Universidade Estadual de Maringa; Universidade Estadual de Maringa,"Tonin, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Maringa, Econ Theory Econ Postgrad Programme, 5790 Colombo Ave, Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",joaoricardo01@yahoo.com.br; godoybr@gmail.com; jmtonin@uem.br; jdias@uem.br,"Tonin, Julyerme Matheus/M-8941-2015","Tonin, Julyerme Matheus/0000-0002-1176-8977",,,,,39,0,0,0,4,DENFAR TRANSNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,ONTARIO,"58 RIDEAU HEIGHTS DR, ONTARIO, OTTAWA NEPEAN K2E 7A6, CANADA",,,978-0-9868210-5-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,229,246,,,,,,18,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353691000015,0

Thus basic data which could be used for the analysis of current cooperation linkages on a separate period of time for the purpose of seeking the ways of increasing their efficiency due to its content are limited mainly by the volumes of the purchases/sales which could be expressed in any of the trade, logistic or cost units. The index method chosen for the modeling of foreign economic relations allows us to define the general index of efficiency of trade i.e. the index number with the changed and constant (fixed) weights, an index of structural changes, to calculate the absolute variation of the 2009 to 2007 result and to show which part of this increment (decrease) is received from the changes of the size of basic cost, from the productivity of trade with the certain countries or from the changes of structure of basic cost during the processes of trade.

This paper presents an alternative method to estimate VOT by analyzing an hourly dataset on drivers speeding behavior as a function of the gasoline price. Our identification strategy is novel as it is based on the intensive margin. In comparison, previous studies reveal VOT on the extensive margin, but choice alternatives have multiple attributes thereby potentially confounding estimates. Consistent with the range of the prior literature, we find a VOT of about 50% of the wage rate and analyze sources of bias from accidents and traffic tickets. These bias functions suggest that previous stated preference VOT estimates are likely downward whereas previous revealed preference estimates are likely upward biased. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

As a result of the policy change, the cost of attending college at public universities in Texas fell dramatically for non-citizens. Using administrative data from five universities in Texas, we employ a quasi-experimental design to identify the effects of the policy change on the probability of enrollment at each of the universities.

We study a major educational reform in Sweden in which vocational tracks in upper secondary school were prolonged from two to three years and the curricula were made more academic. Our identification strategy takes advantage of cross-regional and cross-time variation in the implementation of a pilot scheme preceding the reform in which several municipalities evaluated the new policy. The empirical analysis draws on rich population micro data. We find that women who enrolled in the new programs were significantly less likely to give birth early in life. There is however, no statistically significant effect on men's fertility decisions.

To compare TIPP with the Lichtenstein method, a randomised trial was conducted (ISRCTN93798494). The aim of this study was to perform an economic evaluation of the TIPP modality compared to the Lichtenstein modality from both a hospital and societal perspective alongside the clinical trial. The TULIP study was a double-blind randomised clinical trial comparing two techniques for inguinal hernia repair (TIPP and Lichtenstein). Correct generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up were used/applied according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook. Next to the cost drivers, the short-form-36 health survey (SF-36) data from the TULIP trial was used to determine utility. The SF-36 data from the TULIP trial were revised using the SF-6D algorithm according to Brazier. Two scenarios-a hospital and a societal perspective-were presented. If the analyses showed no difference in effects (on the SF-6D) the cost effectiveness decision rule to cost minimisation was altered. No significant difference in SF-6D utility between both modalities was found (mean difference: 0.888, 95 % CI -1.02 to 1.23); consequently, the economic decision rule became cost minimisation. For the hospital perspective no significant differences in costs were found (mean difference: a,not signa'13, 95 % CI a,not signa'130 to a,not sign104). However, when including productivity gains in the analysis, significant differences (P = 0.037) in costs favouring the TIPP modality (mean saving: a,not sign1,472, 95 % CI a,not sign463-a,not sign2,714) were found. The results show that TIPP is a cost-saving inguinal hernia repair technique compared to the Lichtenstein modality against equal effectiveness expressed as quality adjusted life week at 1 year given a societal perspective. In the trial, TIPP patients showed on average a quicker recovery of 6.5 days compared to Lichtenstein patients.","[Koning, G. G.; Keus, F.; van Laarhoven, C. J. H.

Symptoms of CD are quite similar to IBS, but its treatment is different. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening for CD in patients with diarrhoea/mixed type IBS (IBS-D/mix) in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) in the Netherlands. A decision model was constructed to evaluate the costs and health benefits of serological testing followed by confirmatory endoscopy with biopsy. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to examine the effect of parameter uncertainty. Finally, the budget impact of implementing the screening process was also computed for implementation over a 10-year time horizon. Screening resulted in an increase of about 0.07 quality life years (QALYs) per patient over a lifetime horizon. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was about 6,200 a,not sign/QALY compared to no screening. The PSA showed that the uncertainty in cost effectiveness results is not considerable. The value of information analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. Screening all current patients with diarrhea/mixed type IBS would require a total budget of about 25 million Euros over a 10 year time period. Screening patients with IBS-D or IBS-mix for CD is almost certainly cost-effective. The screening program would improve the quality of life of those patients with IBS symptoms who actually have CD at a relatively low cost.","[Mohseninejad, Leyla; Feenstra, Talitha; Buskens, Erik] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [van der Horst, Henriette E.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam Med Ctr, Dept Gen Practice, EMGO Inst Hlth & Care Res, NL-1081 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Woutersen-Koch, Helen] Dutch Coll Gen Practitioners, NL-3502 GE Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; VU UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,"Mohseninejad, L (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Hanzepl 1,POB 30-001, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands.",mohseninejadl@epi.umcg.nl; t.l.feenstra@umcg.nl; he.vanderhorst@vumc.nl; H.Woutersen-Koch@nhg.org; e.buskens@umcg.nl,"Feenstra, Talitha L/B-6959-2013; Feenstra, Talitha/AAM-3234-2020","Feenstra, Talitha L/0000-0002-5788-0454; Feenstra, Talitha/0000-0002-5788-0454; buskens, erik/0000-0002-6463-1106",,,,,32,11,12,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We find, first, that the law of one price holds for both Ege-Memphis and Ege-Liverpool A-index comparisons. Second, there is no indication of price asymmetry between the Ege and international prices. Third, there is evidence for a bidirectional Granger causality relationship for both Ege-Memphis and Ege-A-index. The results are important for determining whether commodity markets are well integrated and adjust rapidly to price shifts, how prices in different countries adjust to shocks, how information flow patterns can be characterized among different markets, and how Turkey adjusts its prices in response to deviations in exporting countries, especially the United States.","[Oz, Mustafa Safa; Ozertan, Gokhan] Bogazici Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Öz, MS (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",msafa_oz@yahoo.com; ozertan@boun.edu.tr,,", Gokhan/0000-0002-3796-8790",,,,,30,0,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Using European Social Survey for the years 2002-2009, we show that immigrants are more likely to be both under- and overeducated than the native born for the jobs that they perform. However, immigrants' outcomes converge to those of the native born with the years of labor market experience. The mismatch is due to immigrants' selection and sorting across countries. Notably, origin countries' quality of human capital, by affecting selection, mostly matters for undereducation of immigrants. Overeducation is determined to a greater extent by destination country economic conditions and labor market institutions. Immigrant-specific policies in destination countries, such as those improving labor market access, positively affect overall matching; however, other policies, such as those improving eligibility or aimed at antidiscrimination may aggravate overeducation by attracting a wider range of educated immigrants.

Using restricted-access data from the Monitoring the Future project, I find the mandate increased volunteering among eighth-grade students.

This paper aims to fill these critical knowledge gaps. We first introduce the SES framework into the context of PES in general and ecological restoration in particular and then highlight the progress and challenges of China's large initiative of converting degraded cropland. Next, we deliberate the essential lessons that can be learned from China, as reflected in the multi-faceted, complex processes of interactions and outcomes of the initiative from the ecological, socioeconomic, and institutional perspectives. We hope that these efforts will convey some important and timely policy messages, which will contribute to advancing the science and practice of PES-based ecological restoration and nature conservation.

The connection between these two research fields arises from the emerging need to find means of constructing complex service experiences with multidisciplinary approach. By leaning on both perspectives, the aim of the article is to construct a science-fiction prototype 'Dreamnesting'. The prototype presents a new service enterprise that engages a user-customer deeply in the co-creation experience and introduces a new technology platform for the interior design task: augmented reality (AR) technology in an intelligent service environment. The prototype has its foundations, at first, in a front-end co-design user study, which aimed at creating novel interior design service concepts that were thought to be used virtually, and to exploit 3D modelling and AR technology. Then, the article converses on relevant building blocks that come to the fore from the economy and business theories, namely: co-creation of value, customer experience and human assets of the firm.

I collect a data set of Northwestern University sophomores that contains their subjective expectations about choice-specific outcomes, and estimate a model where majors are chosen under uncertainty. Enjoying coursework, and gaining parents' approval are the most important determinants in the choice for both genders. However, males and females differ in their preferences in the workplace, with males caring about the pecuniary outcomes in the workplace much more than females. The gender gap is mainly due to gender differences in preferences and tastes, and not because females are underconfident about their academic ability or fear monetary discrimination.

In particular, the functional form of the index is excessively and unnecessarily confusing. Moreover, the inclusion of indicators that compare the relative performance of women vis-a-vis men, together with absolute women-specific indicators, obscures even more the interpretation of an already complicated index and penalizes the performance of low-income countries. In order to overcome some of the identified limitations, this contribution defines a new composite index of gender inequality that incorporates the GII variables but uses a much simpler functional form. The results suggest that great caution should be exercised when interpreting and using the values of the GII.","Campus Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Demog, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centre d'Estudis Demografics (CED),"Permanyer, I (通讯作者)，Campus Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Demog, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",inaki.permanyer@uab.es,"Permanyer, Inaki/M-3571-2015","Permanyer, Inaki/0000-0002-7051-5144",,,,,43,72,82,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Searching for a typical Asian model, we observe that the eight Asian ECs in our panel are dispersed among four of the five types of emerging capitalism. Although Asian ECs belong mainly to the directed model, three exceptions are observed: South Korea has a de-centralized model, Malaysia a finance-led model and the Philippines a cocktail model. This diversity of institutional architectures in Asian ECs does not prove that there is no Asian mode of upgrading but rather that an Asian path towards technological emergence does exist, followed by Asian ECs at different periods and at varying speeds.","Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5113, GREThA, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Reslinger, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5113, GREThA, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",coralie.reslinger@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,78,10,10,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Such a uniform pattern - if empirically proven and quantified - might help in establishing REDD+ baselines (i.e., references against which reductions in the emissions from deforestation and forest degradation of developing countries could be measured, and subsequently be rewarded). REDD+ baselines are required to be based on a globally standardised method and also to consider country-specific circumstances. These requirements might be fulfilled by applying the concept of forest transition in a baseline setting. With the objective of finding empirical evidence for a uniform global deforestation pattern, we specified a model of forest cover decline which is empirically testable at the global scale. Referring to the causal theory of the FT concept, we define variables which are globally testable with currently available data. By parameterisation of different model specifications, we first analyse deforestation patterns of developing countries, applying cross-section data from the most recent FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010. Population density, cereal area yield, land suitability and the proportion of potential forest vegetation area are determined to significantly explain the variance of forest cover decline. In a next step, we test the basic model by including modelled historical cross-section data of developed countries. The previously defined model was still found to be valid and no significant differences occurred between developing and developed countries. Hence, a uniform pattern of forest cover decline could be detected on the national scale for 140 countries by an adjusted coefficient of determination of 0.788. The empirical evidence of a deforestation pattern provides the necessary justification for any further discussion of an inclusion in REDD+ baselines. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This research is based on the principles of autoethnography, since its purpose is to present self-critical reflections, enhanced by reflective and reflexive conversations on a scenario planning method used at business unit level.

The data set of 27 countries covering the year 2011 and obtained from the statistical evidence Eurostat were used for the analysis of education in relation to unemployment or employment. One of the work aims is to evaluate the population aged 25-64 who are a productive component in the countries according to the percentage achieved by secondary and tertiary education. Education is one of the main factors affecting the labour market, so the state interest is to promote the so-called lifelong learning. The group of countries closed to each other in terms of education were created using cluster analysis. As variables were considered two indicators for this purpose: the percentage of people with at least a completed full secondary education and the percentage of people who completed lifelong learning. Data indicators were transferred to the standardized variables zero and unit-level variability. The dendrogram was based on creating 5 groups, which were presented in the graph of clusters. Each group of countries was described in relation to the average of the two indicators and individual included countries were mentioned namely. While lifelong education is rather complementary, fundamental importance has secondary and tertiary education. From this perspective, the leading positions are occupied mainly countries central and eastern Europe, while Southern European Countries are located on the end of the sequence. The set of all 27 EU countries is characterized by each of the selected indicators summarized characteristics level and variability. There are described: arithmetic mean, median, standard deviation, variation coefficient, minimum and maximum. The calculations were performed simple form that should be noted. The size of the country has not been taken into account, so that each country had the same weight. The histogram was constructed for percentage indicator of people aged 25-64 with secondary and tertiary education submitting information on the distribution frequency. Furthermore, complex data are provided for the EU as a whole. The principal aim of this work was to demonstrate the education impact on both unemployment or employment, which was expressed using appropriate measures. In view of the data obtained from Eurostat, three groups were created according to the highest education level and within expressed unemployment and employment rates, both for individual countries and for the EU as a whole. The education level was determined by the International Standard Classification of Education (International Standard Classification of Education - ISCED, 1997) and based on the labour force survey. Three training levels were: pre-primary education, primary education and lower secondary education (levels 0-2), upper secondary education and post-secondary non-tertiary education (levels 3-4) and tertiary education (levels 5-6). Based on the analysis of variance was confirmed by a highly significant difference between the both groups so unemployment rate as the employment one. Processed bar graph convincingly documents that the greater degree of education of the population achieves this leads to a decrease in the unemployment rate and increasing the employment one.","[Dufek, Jaroslav; Somerlikova, Kristina; Sapakova, Eva] Mendelova Univ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,,dufek@mendelu.cz; somerlik@mendelu.cz; eva.sapakova@mendelu.cz,"Somerlikova, Kristina/E-4852-2018","Somerlikova, Kristina/0000-0001-9093-6707",,,,,5,0,0,0,6,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,113,121,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600011,0

A view of the World Futures Studies Federation in the 21st century,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HISTORY; WFSF,"This paper explores the idea of what it means to be ahead of the times. In doing so the paper looks at new generations of ideas; new generations of individualism; and new generations of organisational structures and cultures. Weak signals can already be identified from a century ago indicating new ways of thinking within several disciplines such as science, philosophy, psychology and education. These signs of what many regard as evolutionary change in human thinking run parallel with many of the exponential changes manifesting in the external world. The paper argues for a shift beyond egotistic individualism to collective individualism, laying foundations for major organisational transformation to meet the needs of uncertain futures. The paper suggests that futures studies as a field needs to be sensitive to the developmental and paradigmatic changes that have been occurring both within and across the knowledge spectrum. Finally, the World Futures Studies Federation is examined as a case study to determine whether it is, indeed, ahead of its times. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The main goal is relaxation, learning, health, distraction and entertainment, cultural and sports activities, business trips, i. e. to gain comprehensive experience. Tourism is an interdepartmental industry which directly trench on the sphere of economy, industry, trade and services, finance, transport, regional development, culture, health, education, sports, environment, forestry and water management, agriculture, employment, creating new jobs towns and scope of government. It is an economic activity that is able to generate employment growth in the EU and concurrently to contribute to the economic and social development and integration, especially in terms of rural and mountain areas, coastal areas, islands, remote and very remote regions. European tourism sector, which comprise for about 1.8 million enterprises, especially small and medium - sized enterprises that employ around 5.2 % of the total labour force in the EU, produces more than 5 % of GDP and the rate is still increasing. Tourism in 2010, the Slovak Republic accounted for 2.56 % of GDP and in 2011 for 2.53 %. From the total number of 3,571,093 visitors represent 1,460,361 foreign visitors and 2,110,732 natives, compared to the previous year, in 2010 was an increase of 2.179 % for natives. The position of Slovakia in the heart of Europe at the intersection of trade routes, with its cultural and historical wealth and the favourable climatic conditions creates the potential for development of the tourism industry in our country. The tourism potential of Slovakia is vast, covering almost all key forms and types of tourism. Throughout most of Slovakia there is a wealth of cultural, historical and natural attractions which may be utilised for tourism. In addition, a great deal of accommodation, catering and supplementary service capacity already exists in Slovakia. On the other hand, what is on offer does not match our possibilities and potential. The most popular touristic destinations are historical towns and numerous mountain ski resorts. Slovakia is a country of destination especially for middle class and less demanding visitors, where the most important factor is price. This fact is visible from structure of visitors who visit the Slovak republic. Slovak citizens generally reflect global trends in terms of information sources. Among young respondents the internet becomes a strong unit. In most cases the Slovak citizens start to plan their vacation 2 - 7 months before the vacation term. Typical season for holiday and vacation is the summer time for 86 % of respondents. In younger categories it is more than 90 %. The older generation over 50 years prefers the spring and autumn time. It could be described by more factors, e. g. prices of vacation are lower because it is not holiday time, less strict timetables in this group of holidaymakers. These tourists or holidaymakers use better prices and before or after seasonal discounts and quieter resorts of tourism. Aim of this paper is to analyse the holiday behaviour of the Slovak population. Background data were obtained from the World Economic Forum, Statistical Office of the Slovak republic, Slovak tourist board and from our electronic survey. In our survey 287 respondents participated. Information from Slovak tourist board used as the background data for creation of this paper were the result of a quantitative market research and public opinion of citizens of Slovakia with the aim to know their behaviour in travel, choosing vacation destinations. Random sample of 1,245 respondents aged over 18 was representative in terms of region, place of residence, gender and age. We have compared their survey with our survey. The random sample is representative in terms of region, age and gender. By the processing and evaluation of holiday behaviour of respondents we have used many methods of comparison, synthesis, mathematical and statistical methods. Examined data were statistically processed and analysed in MS Excel 2010. We have determined the range of sample with statistical method and we selected option without repeating. The basic set, population of Slovakia by the date of 12th of December was 5,410,836 people according to Statistical Office of the SR. Sampling error is set to 5 % and the variability on 65. Calculation was made for significance level of 95 %. From this data we obtained respondents in sample, which are 649 people. In terms of time we could not analyse the whole sample. Querying was done on 287 respondents willing to answer through an electronic questionnaire. For data processing were used some tests, e. g. Friedman test to calculate the results, statistic formula: = 12/nk(k+1) R - 3n(k+1)","[Palkechova, Lucia] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Management, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia; [Viragh, Roderik] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Informat, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia; [Svoradova, Lucia] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Palkechová, L (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Management, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia.",xpalkechova@is.uniag.sk; xviragh@is.uniag.sk; xsvoradova@is.uniag.sk,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,21,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,387,398,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600036,0

Using household level data from Household Budget Surveys over the period 2004 - 2008, I find no evidence for a pro-male bias. Results suggest that a pro-female bias at the secondary school level emerged in 2006 which is in line with declining gender gaps in enrolment at the secondary school level. Findings in both urban and rural areas suggest that Turkish households do not favor boys in the allocation of education expenditures.

Lab application is preferable, because there are stable conditions, especially temperature and moisture, and there are any weather events. These waste materials (biodegradable communal waste: kitchen and garden) are suitable for consuming by larvae Hermetia illucens.

Methods Register data on health care utilisation, pharmaceutical sales, permanent disability and mortality were used to calculate health care costs and costs that accrue due to productivity losses. By linkage of register information, we were able to distinguish pharmaceuticals prescribed against epilepsy from prescriptions that were prompted by other indications. Results The estimated total cost of epilepsy in Sweden in 2009 was (sic)441 million, which corresponds to an annual per-patient cost of (sic)8,275. Health care accounted for about 16% of the estimated total cost, and drug costs accounted for about 7% of the total cost. The estimated health care cost corresponded to about 0.2% of the total health care cost in Sweden in 2009. Indirect costs were estimated at (sic)370 million, 84% of which was due to sickness absenteeism. Costs resulting from epilepsy-attributable premature deaths or permanent disability to work accounted for about 1% of the total indirect cost in Sweden in 2009. Discussion The per-patient cost of epilepsy is substantial. Thus, even though the prevalence of the illness is relatively small, the aggregated cost that epilepsy incurs on society is significant.","[Bolin, Kristian] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Lundgren, Anders; Kallen, Kristina] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Skane Univ Hosp Lund, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Berggren, Fredrik] UCB Nord AS, Copenhagen, Denmark",Lund University; Lund University; Skane University Hospital,"Bolin, K (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",Kristian.Bolin@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,14,10,10,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Methods A systematic review of published studies was conducted describing their characteristics and methodological quality. We analyse the cost per LYG results in relation with a commonly accepted Spanish cost-effectiveness threshold and the possible relation with the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained when they both were calculated for the same economic evaluation. Results A total of 62 economic evaluations fulfilled the selection criteria, 24 of them including the cost per QALY gained result as well. The methodological quality of the studies was good (55%) or very good (26%). A total of 124 cost per LYG results were obtained with a mean ratio of 49,529(sic) and a median of 11,490(sic) (standard deviation of 183,080). Since 2003, a commonly accepted Spanish threshold has been referenced by 66% of studies. A significant correlation was found between the cost per LYG and cost per QALY gained results (0.89 Spearman-Rho, 0.91 Pearson). Conclusions There is an increasing interest for economic health care evaluations in Spain, and the quality of the studies is also improving. Although a commonly accepted threshold exists, further information is needed for decision-making as well as to identify the relationship between the costs per LYG and per QALY gained.","[Perez Alcantara, Ferran; Crespo Palomo, Carlos; Brosa Riestra, Max] Oblikue Consulting SL, Barcelona, Spain; [Rodriguez Barrios, Jose Manuel; Gonzalez Garcia, Paloma; Anton De Las Heras, Enrique] Medtron Iber, Madrid, Spain; [Crespo Palomo, Carlos] Univ Barcelona, Dept Stat, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Alcántara, FP (通讯作者)，Oblikue Consulting SL, C Josep Irla i Bosch 5-7,1 Planta, Barcelona, Spain.",ferran.perez@oblikue.com,"Palomo, Claudio/E-6993-2018; Crespo Palomo, Carlos/JBR-8389-2023","Crespo Palomo, Carlos/0000-0001-6066-0818",,,,,84,19,22,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Reverse causality is also a potential challenge to retrieving estimates of the causal relationship, as the severity of school sanctions may simply reflect the need for more-severe sanctions. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I offer an instrumental-variables approach to retrieving an estimate of the causal response of marijuana use to sanctions and thereby demonstrate the efficacy of school-imposed penalties as a deterrent to adolescent drug use. This suggests that school sanctions may have important long-run benefits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Waddell, G. R.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Waddell, G.

Following a series of conjectures regarding the future application of enhanced television technologies to politics, the potential benefits and drawbacks of interactive television on governance are discussed.

First, using an economics framework, there are rational and logical reasons why different individuals and different organized human systems have different levels of adaptive capacity and these differences do not necessarily correlate to differences in vulnerability. An alternative approach is to determine where there are factors leading to socially inequitable or economically sub-optimal investment in adaptive capacity assets or reduced effectiveness of adaptive capacity assets resulting in adaptive capacity deficits. Factors contributing to adaptive capacity deficits include cases of irrational agent behaviour and cases where there are political, social, and economic system failures. A second way current adaptive capacity constructs can be enhanced is by taking explicit account of the adaptive capacity of economic systems. Economic system properties such as scale, diversity, relative mix of the private and public sectors, innovation, organizational/managerial capital, substitutability of inputs, factor mobility, liquidity of assets, etc. will affect the capacity of economic systems to adapt.

In this article, we argue that a change in financing health care accompanied by the liberalisation of the market for health care service providers offers a promising solution.

A major advantage of adding participatory, qualitative scenarios is their ability to produce creative, innovative, non-linear products. Integrating participatory results with quantitative models, however, can lower their credibility of both products when they are not consistent. The low level of structure in most participatory output limits possibilities for linking them to quantitative models. More structure could be introduced, but this might hamper the creativity of the workshop results: outcomes (process) and outputs (storylines). This paper tests a new method to analyse the creativity of scenario storylines in order to analyse the effects of structuring tools on the creativity of workshop results. Both the perceptions of participants and the resulting storylines of nine case studies across Europe are used in the analysis. Results show that the use of structuring tools can have a negative effect on the creativity of the workshop, but the influence seems to vary between the different tools. The study shows the benefit of using indicators for the scenario quality criteria. More research is needed to develop indicators for other scenario quality criteria, to improve those developed here and to study the impact of structuring tools with a larger data set.

An important problem with this method is that results have been found to be responsive to the procedure used to elicit preferences. In particular, fixing the duration in the health state to be valued and inferring the duration in full health that renders an individual indifferent, causes valuations to be higher than when the duration in full health is fixed and the duration in the health state to be valued is elicited. This paper presents a new test of procedural invariance for a broad range of time horizons, while using a choice-based design and adjusting for discounting. As one of the known problems with the conventional procedure is the violation of constant proportional tradeoffs (CPTO), we also investigate CPTO for the alternative TTO procedure. Our findings concerning procedural invariance are rather supportive for the TTO procedure. We find no violations of procedural invariance except for the shortest gauge duration. The results for CPTO are more troublesome: TTO scores depend on gauge duration, reinforcing the evidence reported when using the conventional procedure.","[Attema, Arthur E.; Brouwer, Werner B.

The imports of developed countries and advanced developing countries, which represent one third of the WTO membership but 95% of world trade, are liberalized to a small degree. The other two thirds of the WTO membership are covered under a complex web of special categories and exceptions that calls into question their future participation in the international trading system.

The models were constructed for a model farm with an area of effective planting of 3491 ha, divided into 135 management units. The regulation models were formulated as model I, including integer constraints for the management units. We used meta-heuristic genetic algorithm for solving the models. For comparison we formulated a classical model of forest regulation. The purpose was maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV). The application of the technique of genetic algorithm is efficient for solving models, built with constraints and objectives of socioeconomic and environmental character. A comparison of volume variation is discussed to satisfy the demand of production imposed on all models. The inclusion of the adjacency constraint has reduced the over-all NPV at 8% compared to the classical model. The IHA has shown to be feasible and efficient for evaluating the environmental influences of forest management even-aged. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we find that the institutional set-up of the education system and the degree of coordination prevailing in a given economy both have a distinct impact on micro-level associations. Segregated education systems dominated by vocational training at the secondary level increase the strength of the association between educational background and preferences, whereas higher levels of coordination weaken this relationship. Our claims are supported by an empirical analysis of Eurobarometer survey data, using multilevel regression statistics.

It follows that the higher the degree of uncertainty, the more aggressive this preventive action should be. This normative maxim is explored in the case of a stylized dynamic model of pollution control with uncertain (in the Knightian sense) stock dynamics, using the robust control framework of Hansen and Sargent [12]. Optimal investment in damage control is found to be increasing in the degree of uncertainty, thus confirming the conventional PP wisdom. Optimal mitigation decisions, however, need not always comport with the PP. In particular, when damage-control investment is both sufficiently cheap and sensitive to changes in uncertainty, damage-control investment and mitigation may act as substitutes and a PP with respect to the latter can be unambiguously irrational. The theoretical results are applied to a calibrated linear-quadratic model of climate change. The analysis suggests that a reversal of the PP with respect to mitigation, while theoretically possible, is very unlikely. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Each agent's benefit depends on the amount of water consumed. An allocation of water is efficient when it maximizes total benefits. To sustain an efficient water allocation the agents can compensate each other by monetary transfers. Every water allocation and transfer schedule yield a welfare distribution, where an agent's utility equals its benefit plus (possibly negative) monetary transfer. The problem of finding a fair welfare distribution can be modeled by a cooperative game. We consider river situations with satiable agents and multiple springs. We propose the class of weighted hierarchical solutions, including the downstream incremental solution of Ambec and Sprumont (2002, [3]), as a class of solutions satisfying the 'Territorial Integration of all Basin States' principle for sharing water of international rivers. When all agents have increasing benefit functions, every weighted hierarchical solution is core-stable. In case of satiation points, every weighted hierarchical solution is independent of the externalities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Sweden is a case in point: Swedish tertiary education is open to older students, and labor market legislation supports employees who take a leave to study. The longitudinal data used for this analysis is based on annual population level registers from 1981 to 2007. Matching techniques are combined with fixed effect estimation to account for non-random selection. Late degrees were found to increase the employment rate by 18 percentage points and earnings while employed by 12 percent, which indicates strong employment effects and small effects on earnings while employed. The effects were absent in the higher parts of the earnings distribution, and females gained more than men. The estimated effects are largely stable across periods within a birth cohort.

More recently amenity horticulture has undergone a number of name changes from environmental and urban, to that of lifestyle horticulture, which has been described as those public and commercial businesses involved in the horticultural production, management and servicing of urban green spaces for environmental, social, economic and health benefit. Currently, the value of lifestyle horticulture products and services has been based on one of economic growth, employment prospects, tourism opportunities and/or their role in value-adding environmental, social, physical health and mental well-being. However, lifestyle horticulture has always been a dynamic sector of horticulture, with a strong focus on environmental, social, cultural and economic development along the supply/value chain. The objective of this paper is to characterise the enterprise numbers, commodities, employment and value of lifestyle horticulture generally and to demonstrate the value of the lifestyle horticulture commodity sod. Results show that over the next 3 years, 55% of growers will increase production, but the sector continues to be challenged by water restrictions, rising labour, fuel, insurance and equipment costs, as well as production and marketing related problems, which could impact on income, employment opportunities and market share. In the longer term, there is a need for capacity building among growers to deal with horticultural production, technological applications, business management and marketing challenges, as well as gain information on key industry benchmarks, particularly those supply chains operating under a drier environment and with limited irrigation.","[Aldous, D.

As the ownership structure arrangements will affect the bank's management incentive mechanism design, proxy contest, bank governance or other aspects of foreign acquisitions and mergers, therefore, the equity structure of listed banks is an important part of corporate governance.

These soils were removed from interest area (water source protection zone - Brezova nad Svitavou) and these soils were fertilized various types of fertilizers. For the experiment leaching of mineral nitrogen in relation to the previous type of soil fertilization, we used samples of arable land from the previous long-term experiment. This long-term experiment was made by five variants of the fertilizer (each variant had three repeat): V1 - control, without the application of fertilizers; V2 application of 90 g/m(2) mineral fertilizer GSH (N: P: K: S similar to 10: 10: 10: 13, registration number 2007), V3 - application of 50ml/m(2) B Lignohumat B (registration number 2723), V4 - application of 50 ml/m(2) Lignohumat B + 45g/m(2) mineral fertilizer GSH (50% of the recommended dose); V5 application of 150 ml/m(2) Lignohumat B (300% of the recommended dose) + 45g/m(2) mineral fertilizer GSH. In each experimental pot were planted indicator plant Deschampsia caespitosa. Indicator plant grew in the experimental containers for 72 day. After the end of the long-term experiment, we removed from each variant arable horizon (from all repetition of each variant) and we homogenized these samples of arable land in each variant. After homogenization, we obtained from each variant (V1 - V5) five samples of arable land. For the implementation Availability of mineral nitrogen in relation to the previous type of soil fertilization experiment has been used cylindrical experimental pots. We used plastic (PVC) pots with the following dimensions d(diameter)= 120mm and v(height)=90 mm. Each experimental pot we filled by arable land form previous experiment (after homogenization). It was created again five variants (V1 - V5) and three repetitions for each variant. This way we determined availability of mineral nitrogen in land from arable horizon, after soil fertilization. The obtained results detection of N-min confirmed a different influence of fertilizer to saturate soil by mineral nitrogen.","[Elbl, J.; Kintl, A.; Zahora, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Elbl, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xelbl@mendelu.cz,"Kintl, Antonín/I-8171-2018; Záhora, Jaroslav/L-6534-2018; Elbl, Jakub/I-5056-2018; Kintl, Antonín/AAJ-3773-2021","Elbl, Jakub/0000-0001-6401-1516; Kintl, Antonín/0000-0002-0031-083X",,,,,23,1,1,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,392,400,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200048,0

Continuously increasing energy prices constitute a significant economic burden for growers. With an international agreement to reduce CO2 emissions, there is an urgent need to identify alternative heating technologies and more efficient energy recovery systems in greenhouse production. However, newly invented energy efficient technologies in horticulture are generally adopted hesitantly by growers. Often this results in the non-implementation of technical innovations. Therefore, it is important to know which parameters influence individual decision-making processes. The main objective of this study was to define those factors that promote and restrain the uptake of energy efficient technologies in horticulture. Forty experts were interviewed in a qualitative and quantitative survey. An analysis of the interviews reveals that many growers need to improve their production methods due to increasing demands from traders and consumers. As consumers are focusing more on environmental protection, energy conservation and sustainability, long-term investments in new technologies are necessary. Economic factors, the personality of the grower and the business organization restrain the adoption processes the most.","[Flenker, J.; Bokelmann, W.] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Geidel, K.; Lange, D.] Ctr Business Management & Appl Res, Hannover, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Flenker, J (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66050-68-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2012,930.0,,,,,,99,105,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BDT45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314782400012,0

I demonstrate that the effects of a reduction in subsidies on fisheries output will differ, depending on the conditions of the economy and fisheries management in different countries. A possible outcome of a reduction in non-capacity-enhancing subsidies is that fisheries output will rise in countries where catch quotas are not enforced and remain the same in countries where catch quotas are strictly enforced, expanding the total supply of fisheries products in the short run.

There already are a few known differences between horses and donkeys; such as donkeys are taller in sacral region and the weight is carried a bit more by front limbs. To verify our hypothesis, the following body measurements had to be taken; WH (Withers Height), SH (Sacral Height), PA (Pelvic angle, measured from hip point to rating point, relative to floor). Our results were able to show a few differences between Czech and African population of donkeys. Czech donkeys are in average higher at withers and mostly downhill-built (average difference between WH and SH is 2.1 cm for stallions and 3 cm for mares). Both of these measurements are also more variable in Czech donkeys, which is most probably a consequence of uncontrolled import. The pelvic angle was showing values 12 degrees - 17 degrees for stallions and 14 degrees - 22 degrees for mares. This occurs in all equiidae; for mares, it is easier to give birth with slightly higher value of pelvic angle. In the end, we were not able to prove the influence of pelvic angle on body build (uphill x downhill), but we were able to prove WH dependency on SH using Pearson's correlation.","[Kost'ukova, M.; Jiskrova, I.; Cernohorska, H.; Bihuncova, I.; Oravcova, I.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kost'uková, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",markostuko@centrum.cz,"Jiskrová, Iva/L-2939-2018",,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,274,278,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200031,0

To solve the above issues we have four recommendations: farmers should add more attention to science and technology; vigorously strengthen the construction of information network; enhance the professional team building for agricultural science and technology promotion; improve the quality of personnel in Science and technology extension services team; strengthen leading role of agricultural science and technology demonstration untis.","[Lin, Li] Agr Univ Hebei, Business Coll, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Song, Jina] Ctr Inst Correct Police, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanning] Agr Univ Hebei, Econ & Trade Coll, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China",Hebei Agricultural University; Hebei Agricultural University,"Lin, L (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Hebei, Business Coll, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China.",linli11-09@163.com,,,[11457202D-5],,This Paper is supported by the following items: a research on developing strategy of fresh agricultural product processing industry in Hebei Province.(Item Number: 11457202D-5),,5,0,0,0,3,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-61896-012-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,1699,1702,,,,,,4,Economics; Management; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BBY61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308816302087,0

Trophic level correlates with production volume (tons/yr) and with unit value (US$/ton) in aquaculture but not in capture fisheries (FAO's fisheries data). Apparently, sustainability and economics in aquaculture both depend on ecological efficiency, i.e., the use of resources and the production of waste. Species feeding low in the food chain use efficiently the natural resources. Each level up the food chain inflates costs related to the use of resources, the production of waste and the maintenance of water quality. This effect has further repercussions on the economics of aquaculture: (1) cost influences profit and unit price, and (2) price influences demand and market share. The overall ecological efficiency, sustainability and economics of culturing carnivorous fish are improved by growing them in an ecological balance with species from low trophic levels in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.","[Neori, Amir] Israel Oceanog & Limnol Res, Natl Ctr Mariculture, IL-88112 Elat, Israel; [Nobre, Ana M.] Univ Nova Lisboa, IMAR, FCT, Dept Environm Sci & Engn DCEA, Caparica, Portugal",Israel Oceanographic & Limnological Research Institute; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Neori, A (通讯作者)，Israel Oceanog & Limnol Res, Natl Ctr Mariculture, POB 1212, IL-88112 Elat, Israel.",aneori@gmail.com,"Neori, Amir/HHM-8693-2022","Neori, Amir/0000-0002-0349-9498; Nobre, Ana/0000-0002-5371-2728",Israeli Ministry for National Infrastructures; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology,Israeli Ministry for National Infrastructures; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The authors thank Z.

The model specification fits well with monthly data from 2002-2008. Uncompensated own-price flexibilities for farmed mussels from Spain, France, Italy, and the Netherlands are inflexible, while demand for Denmark's wild stock mussels is flexible. Dutch mussels are deemed a luxury food, while preferences for mussels from other countries appear independent of the level of total expenditure (i.e., homothetic preferences). The results also show weak substitution relationships between mussels from these countries.","[Nguyen Tien Thong] So Denmark Univ, Ctr Fisheries & Aquaculture Management & Econ FAM, Dept Environm & Business Econ, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Thong, NT (通讯作者)，So Denmark Univ, Ctr Fisheries & Aquaculture Management & Econ FAM, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Niels Bohrs Vej 9-10, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark.",thongtiennguyen@gmail.com,,,"MarBioShell project at Southern Denmark University, Denmark","MarBioShell project at Southern Denmark University, Denmark","The author thanks Bjarne Sloth Jensen, Peter Sandholt Jensen, Hans Stubbe Solgaard, Eva Roth, and Lars Ravn-Jonsen (SDU, Denmark), David Newbery (CAM, UK), Jose Fernandez-Polanco (UC, Spain), and participants at the IIFET conference in Montpelier, France (2010), for their comments and discussions.

Besides, these systems have many measures which are calculated by taking samples. Mostly, these samples are consisted of imprecise data especially in those systems which don't have historical data and are unknown for experts of the system. Therefore, the measures which are calculated by such data are expected to be imprecise. To face with these uncertainty and impreciseness, this paper, based on Buckley's estimation method, proposes a fuzzy method to evaluate queue's measures. This method by considering both of the uncertainty and impreciseness concepts introduces triangular shape fuzzy numbers for different measures. Another important consideration in queue's studies is to determine whether they are steady or transient. In this paper, to do such important determination, a new fuzzy method, which is consistent with special form of fuzzy numbers of the paper, is also introduced. To illustrate the methods more explicitly, numerical example are also given.","[Rahmati, Seyed Habib A.] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran; [Pasandideh, Seyed Hamid Reza] Tarbiat Moallem Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Kharazmi University,"Rahmati, SHA (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran.",sd_rahmaty@yahoo.com; shr_pasandideh@tmu.ac.ir,"Pasandideh, Seyed Hamid Reza/ACY-8108-2022","Pasandideh, Seyed Hamid Reza/0000-0003-2468-8682",,,,,16,1,1,0,7,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Few scholars have looked into the issue and it seems to be their common view that the PCO has to be classified in the technical sense as being an 'exception' to the obligations and the commitments of the CATS'. The main argument of this article is that the PCO should rather he classified as a 'provision that excludes the application of other provisions'. This alternative interpretation is more consistent with the negotiating history of the provision, the negotiators' intention, as well as the economic rationale behind it. Characterizing the PCO in this manner has implications for the allocation of the burden of proof (which should therefore fall on the complainant and not on the defendant) and for the degree of deference that WTO judges have to pay to the rights and the prerogatives of the regulators in the domain of financial services.","European Univ Inst, Dept Law, Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Cantore, CM (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Law, Florence, Italy.",carlo.cantore@eui.eu,,,,,,,49,5,5,0,9,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

A life is proposed as a form of social site (Marston, S.A., Jones III, J.P., 82 Woodward, K. (2005). Human geography without scale, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 30,416-432.) where the future is met and negotiated. Unlike the broad sweep of historical narrative, a focus on the site of a life can reveal cumulative losses, futures denied and paths not taken. Life stories challenge historical narrative with alternative futures that 'might-have-been'; they might therefore usefully be added as a more experimental type to Inayatullah's taxonomy of historical traces (Inayatullah, S. (2012). Humanity 3000: A comparative analysis of methodological approaches to forecasting the long-term, Foresight, 14 (5), 401-417). A case study based on a life story from Aceh is used to demonstrate ways in which alternative futures can emerge from life stories and then be acted upon. The paper concludes that the experimental power of life stories as historical traces lies not only in the stories themselves but in the unique event of storytelling and its potentially transformative impact on the teller and listener, and hence the future.

For U.S. manufacturing plants we find this relationship to be more nuanced than prior research on UK plants. Most management techniques are shown to have beneficial spillovers to energy efficiency, but an emphasis on generic targets, conditional on other management practices, results in spillovers that increase energy intensity. Our specification controls for industry specific effects at a detailed 6-digit NAICS level and finds the relationship between management and energy use to be strongest for firms in energy intensive industries. We interpret the empirical result that generic management practices do not necessarily spillover to improved energy performance as evidence of an energy management gap. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This paper argues that certain international forest policies, although aiming at fostering well-intentioned reforms, may cause further expansion and power concentration of the already dominant large concession groupings and simultaneous marginalization and fragmentation of smaller forestry enterprises in the Congo Basin. We explore this argument through twenty-four semi-structured interviews with large and small scale enterprises to better understand how they think they may benefit (or not) from the changes foreseen by VPA implementation. The perceived benefits include the elimination of illegal players, a reduction in corruption and poverty, the promotion of business opportunities, and the valorization of investments. The way in which some of these benefits are expected to materialize may suggest a lack of congruence between the aims of Cameroon's VPA and private sector expectations. Not only may this lead to disappointment and a sense of demotivation among some of the main stakeholders, it also may lead to further fragmentation in the forest sector. The results therefore indicate that the success of VPA implementation in Cameroon depends on its ability to go beyond the timber legality verification for European markets argument and uphold its stated socioeconomic development objectives.

It assesses whether increasing tariffs on products from polluting industries amounts to a violation of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and whether protectionism in this case can be differentiated from genuine environmental concerns. It argues that while lowering tariffs on environmental goods may serve as a carrot to promote dissemination of cleaner technologies, tariff deconsolidation is a legitimate stick to encourage polluting countries to move towards an international climate agreement. The article further explores this view by undertaking a partial equilibrium analysis to examine the impact of a unilateral 5% tariff increase on the most carbon-intensive imports from countries not committed to climate polices. Our results, however, suggest that plurilateral action would be more effective than countries pursuing tariff policy in isolation, with the former leading to an average 1.4% net reduction in carbon-intensive imports from a 5% increase in their tariffs.","[Cottier, Thomas; Nartova, Olga; Shingal, Anirudh] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Cottier, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",thomas.cottier@iew.unibe.ch; olga.nartova@wti.org; anirudh.shingal@wti.org,,"Shingal, Anirudh/0000-0001-8007-7531",,,,,22,13,13,1,16,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Land allocated to woody biomass production increases with a higher expected biomass price and an earlier timing of biomass markets, but if transaction costs are high, the required expected strength of market emergence required to ensure bioenergy adoption may be prohibitive, suggesting that land use modeling without transaction leads to overly optimistic conclusions.

It departs from the fact that mining is always linked to a future oriented discourse. It shows howjargon used by professionals in the mining sector, and in particular notions of risk, serve to portray and predict outcomes of particular mining projects. The article is concerned with exploration companies (juniors) that try to attract investors for their projects in West Africa and in particular Burkina Faso. It shows how mining companies capitalize on their scale of operation and impact to demonstrate their contribution to the development of poor countries. Scale is a major criterion in the legal arrangements for gold mining in Burkina Faso, a country where small-scale mining is often tolerated and can be legal, but where large-scale mining seems to have the future. This discourse is analysed in terms of the politics of scale.

The results of econometric analysis for five manufacturing industries in 19 OECD countries between 1990 and 2005 indicate that higher energy prices resulted in smaller energy use due to both improved energy efficiency of capital stock and reduced demand for the energy input. The investment response to energy prices varied considerably across manufacturing industries, being more significant in energy-intensive sectors. The results of policy simulations indicate that a carbon tax can deliver significant reductions in energy consumption in the medium run with modest declines in energy-using capital stock.

They also discuss why deregulation, easier firing and higher labour turnover may damage learning and knowledge accumulation in companies, notably by weakening the functioning of the routinized innovation model (Schumpeter II).

Donors, civil societies, business organisations and other different bodies are investing resources on initiatives aimed to propagate different guidelines and principles expected to be adopted, supported and promoted by national governments as safeguards. Yet, there-is little research critically examining the different ideas, objectives and understandings embedded in the term and their implications for the purpose for which safeguards are designed for. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the discourse on safeguards by presenting REDD + Safeguard Spectrum, a framework which can be used to unpack the many faces of REDD + safeguards to guide their application and operationalization at national and local levels. Focusing largely on the social goals espoused under REDD +, the paper characterises social safeguards of REDD + into four categories-preventive, mitigative promotive and transformative.

This is particularly the case in suburban areas, where the costs for introducing a new transportation system are high due to the low population density. At the same time the negative externalities of the current mobility regime - such as health costs and congestions - are increasing rapidly. Based on expert interviews with car manufacturers, transportation authorities, environmental groups, and scientists we identify two visionary characteristics of future, more sustainable transportation systems: automated driving and sharing. Using these two characteristics, we apply the scenario-axes technique to develop four mobility scenarios for a suburban context that range from business-as-usual to a radical and more sustainable one. In an evaluation with ten criteria that measure a scenario's performance from a user perspective, the radical scenario performs worst since it does not meet current individualistic user requirements. Our findings suggest that lockins of users' expectations act as barriers for the diffusion of novel transportation systems. These barriers cannot be overcome by technological innovations and regulation alone. Hence, we call for innovative arenas, wherein technology and user acceptability could co-evolve.

To obtain the integrated model, the standard one-period expected utility model of one person facing the prospect of either being alive or dead is extended to incorporate (1) a third health state (sick) with a utility level that is intermediate to utility if healthy and utility if dead, (2) a family perspective in which a parent makes choices about risk exposure both for herself and for a child, and (3) a multi-period framework that allows for possible parent/child differences in illness latency. Monetary benefits of health risk reduction obtained from the integrated model are compared with those that would be computed using the standard model. The integrated model then is applied using data obtained from two field studies of skin cancer and leukemia to demonstrate how it can be used to estimate health benefits of reduced illness and death risks.

We develop a theoretical valuation model that contains a forest insurance policy, in order to protect the landowner against total or partial losses caused by wildfires. Restoration costs of affected areas are explicitly covered. Such model is used to simulate the changes in rotation and profitability of Pinus pinaster Aiton. in Galicia (NW Spain). We find that in the areas where the risk of wildfires is higher, forest owners may profit the most from subscribing such insurance.

If education programs are implemented to achieve a combination of increased school participation and a reduction in child work they may either have to be combined with different interventions that effectively reduce child work or they may have to be tuned more carefully to the incentives and constraints the child laborer faces.

Mediation facilitated by a third-party is widely considered an effective method in transforming conflict over natural resources. This study analyses the application of mediation in transforming two conflicts in Sumatra, Indonesia involving oil palm and pulpwood plantations. Our findings suggest that mediation has played a crucial role in transforming the two conflicts, particularly in reducing conflict intensity, reaching an agreement and improving relationships between the conflicting parties. In helping to address the conflict, the mediators played important roles including facilitator, capacity developer, advisor and motivator for the parties. The paper suggests that the plantation projects in Indonesia and beyond must include carefully devised conflict transformation mechanisms, including mediation, as an integral part of their management. Additionally improvement of conflict transformation capability among mediators and plantation stakeholders through targeted training programmes on conflict transformation is also needed. The paper also suggests promotion of mediation as an alternative mechanism to the judicial system in transforming plantation conflicts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our results are compared with findings in earlier studies for developed economies: Graham and Harvey (2001) for the United States and Brounen et al. (2004, 2006) for Europe. Korean chief financial officers are concerned about financial flexibility and volatility of earnings when issuing debt; they are concerned about target debt ratio maintenance and recent stock price increases when issuing equity. In contrast to independent firms, chaebol firms are more concerned about differences in corporate tax rates between foreign and domestic markets and the risk of refinancing in bad times. Chaebol firms are less likely to issue debt when faced with insufficient internal funds, which indicates that active internal capital markets are at work among the firms in a business group. Our results suggest that, compared to U. S. and European firms, Korean firms are under more pressure from their peers in formulating capital structure policies, consider equity a cheap source of financing, are less concerned with the dilution of earnings per share, and less frequently provide shares to employees as compensation.","[Lee, Hongbok] Western Illinois Univ, Macomb, IL 61455 USA; [Oh, Sekyung] Konkuk Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Kwangwoo] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea",Western Illinois University; Konkuk University; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Western Illinois Univ, Macomb, IL 61455 USA.",h-lee@wiu.edu; skoh@konkuk.ac.kr; kpark3@kaist.ac.kr,"Park, Kwangwoo/AFV-6132-2022; Park, Kwangwoo/C-1643-2011","Park, Kwangwoo/0000-0002-8318-1585; Lee, Hongbok/0000-0002-7219-6095",,,,,34,12,13,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Moreover the pro cyclical policies are not any more a feature of emerging markets but also of developed countries as well. This paper is aiming at showing that despite too many attempts to establish strong budget constraints through balanced or in surplus budget rule the politicians do not agree any restrictions which might negatively affect the outcomes of elections - the political dividends. The paper also intends to show that the financial stability requires a stronger motivation for politicians to abandon the wrong path to always accept budget deficits. This stimulus can only come from a major shift in voters attitudes. The arguments of solving the market failure or the need to encourage the public investments should be revalued through the efficiency of public spending. (C) 2014 The Authors.

However, most research focused on US data, while European countries were rarely analyzed and mostly focusing on participation decision. This is largely due to the lack of fully comparable microeconomic data across countries and the high item-non response rate in such data, which poses a challenge for reliable econometric analysis. In this paper, the data from Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) are used to investigate whether the association of health status with both participation and allocation decision varies across 11 European countries, each shielding households from out-of-pocket medical expenditures to a different extent. The hypothesis is that health risk shapes both decisions, but, as background risk theory suggests, the strength of these effects varies with the generosity of health care system, being weaker (even negligible) in countries with full-coverage National Health System. Using multiple imputation (MI) analysis to account for high non-response rate, this paper employs Probit and Tobit estimations to find empirical confirmation of this hypothesis on both margins. The health status shapes households' portfolio choice, but only in countries with less generous Health Care Systems where this association is large and economically significant. The results also provide some evidence that in those countries, informal care arrangements in form of bequests might be particularly important, thus indicating potential spillover effects of health related financial risks of the elderly to younger individuals, who are not included in SHARE sample.","[Djordjevic, Ljubica] Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, CenTER Inst, Warandelaan 2, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Djordjevic, L (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, CenTER Inst, Warandelaan 2, Tilburg, Netherlands.",l.djordjevic@tilburguniversity.edu,,,"European Commission through 5th framework programme [QLK6-CT-2001-00360]; European Commission through 6th framework programme (project SHARE-I3) [RII-CT-2006-062193]; European Commission through 6th framework programme (project COMPARE) [CIT5-CT-2005-028857]; European Commission through 6th framework programme (project SHARELIFE) [CIT4-CT-2006-028812]; European Commission through 7th framework programme (SHARE-PREP) [211909]; European Commission through 7th framework programme (SHARE-LEAP) [227822]; U.S. National Institute on Aging [U01 AG09740-13S2, P01 AG005842, P01 AG08291, P30 AG12815, Y1-AG-4553-01, OGHA 04-064, IAG BSR06-11, R21 AG025169]",European Commission through 5th framework programme; European Commission through 6th framework programme (project SHARE-I3); European Commission through 6th framework programme (project COMPARE); European Commission through 6th framework programme (project SHARELIFE); European Commission through 7th framework programme (SHARE-PREP); European Commission through 7th framework programme (SHARE-LEAP); U.S. National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"This paper uses data from SHARE release 2.5.0, as of May 24th 2011.

This issue is important in the context of economic and social cohesion in the EU. We adopt approach that the food share can be used as a proxy variable that reflects the standard of living of average households in a given country. We focus on two concepts of convergence: absolute (unconditional) beta convergence and sigma convergence. While the former focuses on detecting possible 'catching-up' processes, the latter refers to a reduction of disparities among countries in time. The data in this study comes from the Eurostat database and cover the period between 1995 and 2012. The analysis concerns the EU countries, however a particular attention is paid to Central and Eastern Europe Countries (CEEC) and a comparison of their situation with that of the EU-15 Member States. It is carried out for the entire period 1995-2012 as well as for the shorter sub-periods: 1995-2003 and 2004-2012. The research provides an empirical picture of convergence. It is found that the 'catching-up' process took place in the whole group of 27 countries as well as in two narrower sub-groups: the CEEC and the EU-15. Beta-convergence process is observed in all periods in question, but the convergence was more intense during the second period compared to the first. The analysis of cross-sectional dispersion of food share revealed that diversity in the EU-27 decreases over the entire period 1995-2012 and over both of the sub-periods. Similar results were obtained for the CEEC, while in the EU-15 beta convergence was not a sufficient condition for sigma convergence.","Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Econometr & Stat, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Dudek, H (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Econometr & Stat, Warsaw, Poland.",hanna_dudek@sggw.pl,"Dudek, Hanna/T-9763-2017","Dudek, Hanna/0000-0001-8261-2745",,,,,25,5,5,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

This article investigates fishermen's behavior in a situation in which a primary output quota is decreasing due to policy restrictions. The findings suggest that vessels respond to such situations by increasing pressure on unregulated species, using their spare capacity. This article models fishermen's behavior using a restricted profit function, treating the harvest of regulated species as fixed, while unregulated species are variable outputs. An empirical application is provided for the Polish trawler fleet with permits to harvest IVQ-regulated Atlantic Cod in the Baltic Sea. The results indicate a strong substitute relationship between the cod quota and pelagic species. Derived elasticities of intensity, providing a measure of the impact of a fixed-factor on variable factors, offer strong evidence of increasing pressure on pelagic species caused by decreasing quotas.","[Hutniczak, Barbara] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Hutniczak, B (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Niels Bohrs Vej 9, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark.",bhu@sam.sdu.dk,,"Hutniczak, Barbara/0000-0001-5152-7898",,,,,40,24,25,0,16,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The research findings evidence that in the countries included in the research, cultural heritage preservation is viewed as a very important activity to be handed over to the next generations, and this process is mainly affected by the public attitude to cultural heritage as a value.

Statistical data from two institutions, namely the Agricultural Property Agency (APA) and the Central Statistical Office (CSO) as well as the author's research have been used in the paper. The time horizon of the analysis covers the years 1992-2012. The lower limit was determined by the start of operation of the Agency of Agricultural Property of the State Treasury and the launching of a process of transformation in agriculture state. Completion of the analysis for 2012 is related with the availability of statistical data used. Among the main factors which govern the management of farmland in Poland in the new institutional economic context are: formal norms (legal enactments; amendments to enactments; and the formation and modification of functions of a state institution responsible for the market turnover of agricultural land on the public and private markets, such as the Agricultural Property Agency of the State Treasury, transformed into the Agricultural Property Agency). Among some non-formal institutions there are historically shaped attitudes to agricultural land, which go beyond the market value of this land resource, in addition, encompassing its special cultural and symbolic value. The results of the author's empirical research indicated that as many as 78.90% of the 943 questioned farmers received at least some of the farmland from their parents or parents-in-law, and as many as 73.49% would like to pass their farm to children or grandchildren (this intention was expressed by nearly all farmers who had children/grandchildren).","[Marks-Bielska, Renata] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,,renatam@uwm.edu.pl,,,,,,,15,4,4,0,2,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-2-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,35,,,,,189,198,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347133500021,0

The next generation of IT governance will migrate towards Cloud computing, the data lifecycle, social media as models and will integrate existing data in multiple sources, in which security, privacy and control remain critical, vital subjects. Traditional security issues could no longer be effectively solved in the cloud, and as a result other solutions were developed to focus on Governance in the Cloud.

It was hoped that China's WTO accession and participation in WTO dispute settlement could provide an external force to further China's reform. Due chiefly to the expansionist trend of the WTO regime and China's non-market economy, party-state regime and highly politicized WTO accession strategy, WTO dispute settlement sometimes exerts effects on China that are beyond the area of trade. Although China is sensitive and vulnerable to such trade-plus effects, a case study of China's relevant WTO disputes shows that, in general, China has successfully accommodated such effects to date. Therefore, despite its positive role in helping China improve trade governance, WTO dispute settlement has insofar played a limited role in furthering non-trade reform in China.","[Chi, Manjiao] Xiamen Univ, Sch Law, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Chi, Manjiao] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Global Governance & Rule L, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Chi, Manjiao] Xiamen Acad Int Law, Adm Council, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Chi, MJ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Law, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,111,1,1,0,20,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In general, this association is due to joint risk factors. Cost-effectiveness estimates based on decision-analytic models may be biased if this association is not reflected appropriately. To develop a procedure for quantifying the degree of bias when an increase in non-target-disease-specific mortality is not considered. We developed a family of parametric functions that generate hazard ratios (HRs) of non-target-disease-specific mortality between subjects screened positive and negative, with the HR of target-disease-specific mortality serving as the input variable. To demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure, we fitted a function within the context of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk screening, based on HRs related to different risk factors extracted from published studies. Estimates were embedded into a decision-analytic model, and the impact of 'modelling increased non-target-disease-specific mortality' was assessed. In 55-year-old German men, based on a risk screening with 5 % positively screened subjects, and a CAD risk ratio of 6 within the first year after screening, incremental quality-adjusted life-years were 19 % higher and incremental costs were 8 % lower if no adjustment was made. The effect varied depending on age, gender, the explanatory power of the screening test and other factors. Some bias can occur when an increase in non-target-disease-specific mortality is not considered when modelling the outcomes of screening tests.","[Stollenwerk, Bjoern] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen GmbH, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Stollenwerk, Bjoern; Siebert, Uwe] UMIT Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Inst Publ Hlth Med Decis Making & Hlth Technol As, Dept Publ Hlth & Hlth Technol Assessment, A-6060 Hall Intirol, Austria; [Gandjour, Afschin] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Luengen, Markus] Univ Appl Sci, Hsch Osnabruck, Fac Business Management & Social Sci, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Inst Technol Assessment,Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Ctr Hlth Decis Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Siebert, Uwe] ONCOTYROL Ctr Personalized Canc Med, Div Publ Hlth Decis Modelling Hlth Technol Assess, Innsbruck, Austria","Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; UMIT - Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics & Technology GmbH; Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

These inefficiencies arise when health gains associated with the new technology cannot be obtained immediately because the new technology does not yet supply all patients, and when there is overcapacity for the old technology in the short run because the supply of care is divided among two mutually exclusive technologies. Such efficiency losses are not taken into account in standard textbook cost-effectiveness analysis in which a steady state is presented where costs and effects are assumed to be unchanging over time. A model is constructed to quantify such short run inefficiencies as well as to inform the decision maker about the optimal implementation pattern for the new technology. The model operates by integrating the incremental net benefit equations for both the period of co-existence of mutually exclusive technologies and the period after complete substitution of the old technology. It takes into account the rate of implementation of the new technology, depreciation of capital of the old technology as well as the demand curves for both technologies. The model is applied to the real world case of converting from screen film to digital mammography in the Netherlands.","[van de Wetering, Gijs; Woertman, Willem H.; Verbeek, Andre L.; Broeders, Mireille J.; Adang, Eddy M.

However, its approach of focusing on the sequestration capacity of forests is potentially at odds with other environmental objectives. In order to cope with the risk of unintended impacts on biodiversity, the UNFCCC agreed on environmental safeguards that have yet to be specified and implemented through national REDD + strategies. Employing theoretical considerations regarding non-binding institutions and transparency, we investigate whether and how the voluntary setting of the REDD + Partnership can support the development of effective environmental safeguards. The analysis shows that the Partnership, despite its non-binding features, represents a promising complementary policy approach to the UNFCCC. Consisting of public and private actors it has laid the foundation for a more comprehensive view on REDD + by focusing on information exchange on practical implementation issues, e.g. on the specification of the safeguards agreed under the UNFCCC. If efforts to ensure accountability through transparency and stakeholder inclusiveness can be further improved, the setting may significantly contribute to establishing horizontal accountability, and hence, trigger a 'race to the top' on environmental standards.

In particular, analysis seems to reveal that devolution of power to the local resource user does not happen. Nevertheless, it also appears that community forestry programs do deliver some of their promises. Especially, the biodiversity of the resources involved is often improved. But who determines this, if not the local resource user? This article seeks to answer this by analyzing the biodiversity of 14 community forests in Namibia. The authors apply their power theory and methodology to identify the powerful, actors and these actors' interests. Finally, the author relates his findings to the real outcomes for biodiversity. The article concludes that biodiversity is only in the interest of a few powerful actors who have used their power to achieve a positive outcome for biodiversity. Therefore, the article argues that biodiversity in community forestry depends on the interests of powerful actors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Symptomatic of the cleavages across countries throughout the Round, little progress was achieved during the negotiations in defining an approach to a multilateral reduction in protection of EGs. Conflicting interests and differing perceptions of the benefits from increased trade in EGs was reflected in the different approaches proposed by members (request and offer, integrated project, list approach, hybrid approach), and for the few countries (13) that adopted a list approach, there was little overlap across submissions. For all income groups, on average, EGs are less protected than other goods and countries reduced protection by about 50% from initial levels in 1996 leaving little room for further exchange of market access. Difficulties in applying the two complementary conceptions of EGs: (i) 'goods for environmental management', and (ii) 'environmentally preferable products' are reviewed and mentioned as reasons for the lack of progress during the negotiations. Inspection of the submission lists against a 'core list' of 26 EGs drawn up by the WTO shows that this 'core list' was mostly made up of products in which developed countries had a comparative advantage, and that countries that submitted lists generally avoided including on their lists the most highly protected goods.","[De Melo, Jaime] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",University of Geneva,,gaellebalineau@gmail.com; Jaime.demelo@unige.ch,"Balineau, Gaelle/AAJ-2154-2020",,,,,,23,17,19,2,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2013,12.0,4,,,,,693,718,,10.1017/S1474745613000074,0.0,,,26,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,217CA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324333000004,0

The interactions between the two types often generate nonlinear relations that lead to various kinds of complex dynamics that complicate management and decisionmaking regarding them. Of these, forests have characteristics that lead them to have special problems not usually encountered in the management of such systems. A central one is the long time periods involved managing forests compared to most other such systems. This means that the issues regarding determination of discount rates for valuing future outcomes are more important for forestry management than for many other systems. Also, forests generate a wider range of externalities than do most other ecologic-economic systems, with implications for various hierarchical levels of management. This paper considers the array of these problems as they appear for a variety of forestry management issues.

This allows us to extend disposable income with the expected monetary value of public health services and to compare it with strictly cash income. Since non-cash income due to public health services is associated with health needs, we use needs-adjusted equivalence scales to perform distributional analysis and poverty/inequality comparisons.

The aim of this work is to present a quantitative review of the representation of forest conflicts across the world, developing an analysis of the geographical components of forest conflicts using the contested resource periphery theory as a framework. The analysis was based on a database covering 303 forest conflicts identified in academic literature and reports from international forest organisations and environmental non-governmental organisations (ENGOs). The analysis includes a methodology to geographically define the economic cores at different scales, and the location of the conflicts regarding a core-periphery continuum. The results found that forest conflicts are located in resource peripheries on global levels, but not necessarily on regional or local levels, as the type of conflict adds additional complexity to the analysis. Finally, it was found that international ENGOs targeting the operations of forest industry focus mainly on resource peripheries, which is a reflection of the resource's location, but also target the markets and financiers, usually found at the economic cores. The work provides additional tools for the analysis of the geography of forest conflicts, and the implications of the work not only feeds into the understanding of how conflicts develop, but also helps in verifying the theory of contested resource periphery.

A quantitative analysis of our model shows that female wage growth and decreasing fertility are primarily responsible for the overall increase in wives' hours since the 1970s.

The new instrument combines a conventional TTO to elicit values for states regarded better than dead and a lead-time TTO for states worse than dead. A total of 121 participants completed the composite TTO for ten EQ-5D-5L health states. Mean values ranged from -0.104 for health state 53555 to 0.946 for 21111. The instructions were clear to 98 % of the respondents, and 95 % found the task easy to understand, indicating feasibility. Further, the average number of steps taken in the iteration procedure to achieve the point of indifference in the TTO and the average duration of each task were indicative of a deliberate cognitive process. Face validity was confirmed by the high mean values for the mild health states (> 0.90) and low mean values for the severe states (< 0.42).

Private schools appear to have arisen in response to distinct market incentives. They are more common in fields where public school inertia has resulted in an under-supply of available slots. They are also more common where the public schools appear to be doing a worse job in their primary educational mission, as demonstrated by the success rate of academic secondary schools in obtaining university admission for their graduates. Public schools facing private competition improve their performance. They spend a larger fraction of their resources on classroom instruction and significantly reduce class sizes. Furthermore, Czech public academic secondary schools facing significant private competition by 1996 substantially improved their relative success in obtaining university admissions for their graduates between 1996 and 1998. The rise of private schools, however, also spurred maneuvering by the administrations of public schools to preserve these schools' entrenched position, pointing out how important it is that any voucher system be simple and leave as little opportunity as possible for discretionary actions on the part of implementing officials.

The paper finds that hospitals facing higher competition have lower unplanned admission rates.

This paper investigates analytically and empirically the degree to which the absence of health insurance in the US reflects the availability of the health care safety net, such as the guaranteed or charitable care provided by emergency rooms, community health centers and physicians. Our theoretical model demonstrates that the safety net can be a real alternative to health insurance, thus discouraging private insurance purchase in the market setting. In particular, when the community premium rate fails to reflect the value of such resources, not purchasing insurance becomes a rational decision for a sizeable portion of the population. The calibrated simulation based on US statistics indicates about 15.75 % of the uninsured population, or 7.2 million people in US, are attributable to the existing safety net system. Further empirical analysis using nationally representative data shows consistently that the presence of local safety net resources may reduce the probability of individual insurance purchase by as much as 45.9 %.","[Qin, Xuezheng] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Liu, Gordon G.] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Qin, XZ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",qin.econpku@gmail.com; gordon@gsm.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,36,2,3,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This study analyzes the distribution of pharmaceutical expenditures in ambulatory care and explores the basic characteristics of the high-cost drug users. Reimbursed prescription drug purchases in 2009 were derived from the National Prescription Register for a 50 % sample of the adult Finnish population. The high-cost users who were among the top 5 % in terms of drug expenditures were identified based on annual drug costs. The distribution of pharmaceutical costs is strongly skewed in Finland; only 5 % of the population accounts for about half of the costs. These high-cost drug users were older than the low-cost drug users, with more than one-fourth of them being over 75 years old. The high-cost drug users used, on average, more drugs than the low-cost drug users, but approximately 15 % of them used only 1-5 drugs. Almost 50 % of the high-cost drug users used more than 10 drugs per year. They had chronic diseases more often than the low-cost drug users, especially uremia requiring dialysis, post-transplant conditions, severe anemia associated with chronic renal failure and multiple sclerosis were common among the high-cost users. The skewness of the cost distribution indicates a need for more patient-specific cost-containment methods, and the high number of drugs in the high-cost group calls for exploring the possibilities of disease management and patient monitoring techniques in cost containment.","[Saastamoinen, Leena K.; Verho, Jouko] Social Insurance Inst, Res Dept, Helsinki 00101, Finland",,"Saastamoinen, LK (通讯作者)，Social Insurance Inst, Res Dept, POB 450, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",leena.k.saastamoinen@kela.fi,,,,,,,33,14,15,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We formalize this conjecture by proposing a model where starting/relapsing might result from time inconsistent preferences in a way that mirrors the inability of some smokers to carry out the decision to quit. Subsequently, we specify econometric models that allow us to test the implications of such conjecture using information on smoking behavior at the individual level from the Catalan Health Survey of 2006. The empirical results support our conjecture and suggest that the welfare gains derived from the reinforcement of self-control caused by tax hikes and smoking bans will accrue not only to smokers but also to the rest of the population.","[Badillo Amador, Lourdes; Lopez Nicolas, Angel] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Econ, Cartagena 30201, Spain; [Lopez Nicolas, Angel] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Recerca Econ & Salut, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Pompeu Fabra University,"Nicolás, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Econ, C Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Spain.",Angel.Lopez@upct.es,,"Lopez-Nicolas, Angel/0000-0003-3112-7779",,,,,18,5,6,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Among the key points of contention were which obligation pertained in each case - national treatment, limits on technical regulations, or rules governing standards. In each case, the Panel imposed significant restrictions on national regulatory practices, and in each case the Panel reasoning was challenged by the Appellate Body. This paper addresses some of the key legal and economic issues raised in the original Panel decisions, leaving the late-breaking Appellate Body decisions for future analysis. Given the unsettled nature of the terrain, the economic analysis focuses primarily on the question of national treatment, while the legal analysis deals with other interesting points that emerge from these rulings, such as the appropriate level of deference to international standards and the legitimacy of labeling requirements.","[Howse, Robert] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Levy, Philip I.] Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",New York University; University of Virginia,"Howse, R (通讯作者)，NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,13,24,26,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2013,12.0,2,,,SI,,327,375,,10.1017/S1474745612000638,0.0,,,49,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,126CZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317590600011,0
J,"Neven, D; Trachtman, JP",,,,"Neven, Damien; Trachtman, Joel P.",,,Philippines - Taxes on Distilled Spirits: Like Products and Market Definition,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper provides a legal-economic analysis of the Appellate Body decision in Philippines - Taxes on Distilled Spirits (Philippines-Spirits). In Philippines-Spirits, the Panel and the Appellate Body had an opportunity to consider again the scope of 'like products' and of 'directly competitive or substitutable products' under Article III:2 of GATT. The Panel and Appellate Body followed the Border Tax Adjustments factors in order to determine whether the products were sufficiently similar. The Appellate Body explicitly extended its jurisprudence from other areas of Article III to a like-products determination under the first sentence of Article III:2: this analysis is to be focused on the degree of competition between the imported and domestic products. We observe that the effect of different taxation on domestic products is affected by the degree of substitution between products as well as competitive conditions, whereas the Appellate Body seems to focus on the former and ignore the latter. We also question some of the Panel and Appellate Body interpretations of the evidence regarding the degree of substitution between products. Overall, we find that even if there may be a segment in which foreign and domestic products compete, the reported evidence in this case would seem to be consistent with the view that for the bulk of the market, foreign and domestic items are distant substitutes. Putting aside the jurisprudence, a methodologically sound finding regarding substitution (and competition) seems necessary, but not sufficient, for a finding of inefficient discrimination. In order to find inefficient discrimination, there must also be a finding that the nonprotectionist benefits that may arise from the national regulation are not sufficient to justify the discriminatory action, otherwise, rational regulation that is globally efficient might be invalidated, inappropriately restricting the national right to regulate. In the present case, the Philippines articulated no nonprotectionist rationale for its distinctions. Existing WTO jurisprudence in this area prior to the Appellate Body decision in US-Clove Cigarettes (in the context of Article 2.1 of the technical barriers to trade agreement) has only hinted at the additional focus on the justificatory role of nonprotectionist regulatory benefits, yet an explicit and appropriately contextualized reference to the nonprotectionist rationale, if any, of regulation seems to be a necessary part of decision-making.","[Trachtman, Joel P.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch Law & Diplomacy, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,,Damien.Neven@graduateinstitute.ch; joel.trachtman@tufts.edu,"Trachtman, Joel/AAN-8482-2020",,,,,,7,9,9,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2013,12.0,2,,,SI,,297,326,,10.1017/S147474561200047X,0.0,,,30,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,126CZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317590600010,0

This article assesses the effects of combining fiscal austerity with policies aimed at reducing labour costs and, in doing so, sheds new light on current policy debates. Taking a global perspective, the authors explore the aggregation problem by proposing a stylized analytical macro-model with explicit distribution dynamics. In this framework, flexibilization policies that suppress the labour share trigger global feedbacks that result in a downward spiral, with contraction even in export-led economies.

The main results indicate that, both in the short run and the long run, an increase in domestic sectors' openness exerts a positive effect on productivity growth in Poland (the opposite effect is exhibited by foreign sectors' openness).

This article draws together insights from economic sociology, history and democratic theory to engage in further discussion about the proper role of central banks in democratic society. We stress some related themes. Our brief history of central banks aims to show how these banks have always been embedded in economic and political coalitions and conflicts, therefore qualifying the term independence; our study also aims to show that in satisficing between conflicting tasks, central banks need to maintain a balance between cognitive competences and normative expectations. Independence is better understood as a form of dependence on the coalition of interests that supported the financial climate prevailing before the global crisis of 2008, one of low wage-price inflation, high borrowing and debt, and loss of prudential control. We argue that independence amounts to a form of re-privatisation of central banks, and that they are increasingly suborned to the pressures of financial markets. At the same time, asset price inflation has sacrificed growth and employment and therefore prolongs the crisis. The economic measures now demanded by the financial crisis prompt new doubts about the independent central bank experiment, potentially in favour of the ex ante model of governmental oversight of central banks.","[Pixley, Jocelyn; Wilson, Shaun] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Whimster, Sam] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Bonn,"Pixley, J (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Fac Australian, Sch Business, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",jocelynpixley@gmail.com,,"Wilson, Shaun/0000-0003-4687-1824; Whimster, Sam/0000-0003-4900-3782",,,,,56,9,12,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The findings revealed that calculus-based trust was built at the beginning of the process and enabled an improved relationship and collaboration between the park direction and local communities, and a subsequent raise of wildlife in the park. However, dysfunctional use of the trust built led to the emergence of distrust, which evolved into conflict. This conflict was hidden by the illusion of peaceful relationships between the stakeholders as pursued in common meetings. It was noticeable only through accusations on each other, including the shift of responsibility for solving the conflict when discussing the management separately with the different stakeholders. We conclude that (dis)trust should not be looked as a static/cognitive state, but as a dynamic frame that may be strategically used in interaction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, frameworks for analysing the emergence and 'maturing' of social issues have not as high a level of research. This paper presents a new framework for analysing social issues, introduces the concept of social issue maturation, and considers the implications for business, government and others. Existing frameworks tend to use basic descriptors (rather than observable outcomes), and rarely provide indicators and tools for tracking issues and anticipating future development. Our approach differs in that it is based on observable phases that allow the maturing of an issue to be plotted over-time, and the analytical framework integrates issue lifecycle modelling with technology analysis tools. Our approach also draws on social science research on the role of public risk perception and societal 'transitions'. We demonstrate its use by analysing climate change, and discussing related issues.

J,"Zeng, K",,,,"Zeng, Ka",,,Legal Capacity and Developing Country Performance in the Panel Stage of the WTO Dispute Settlement System,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PARTICIPATION; DEFENDANTS; PARTIES; MATTER,"Existing literature has yielded some evidence suggesting that developing countries are less likely to file World Trade Organization (WTO) trade disputes or to secure concessions in the consultation stage instead of the panel stage of the dispute settlement process. Furthermore, this 'bias' in the use of the dispute settlement mechanism against developing countries has often been attributed to developing countries' lack of legal capacity, or the financial, human and institutional resources available to analyse, pursue or litigate a dispute. However, much of this literature focuses on the constraining effect of legal capacity in the pre-panel ruling stage of the process. This article extends previous research and uses various alternative measures of legal capacity to more systematically analyse the effect of legal capacity on developing countries' performance during the panel stage of the dispute settlement process. Empirical analysis of WTO disputes filed by developing countries that have ended with a panel ruling between 1980 and 2010 shows that developing countries with greater government efficiency and regulatory quality are more likely to obtain positive panel rulings, although there is little evidence suggesting that legal capacity as measured by the size of a country's delegation in Geneva or its past experience in initiating WTO disputes may enhance its prospect of successfully defending its legal claims in the panel stage of the dispute settlement process. This result reinforces prior findings about the disadvantages developing countries face in the dispute settlement system and underscores the need for developing countries to engage in domestic capacity building in order to enhance their chances of successfully litigating at the WTO.","Univ Arkansas, Dept Polit Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Zeng, K (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Polit Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",kzeng@uark.edu,,,,,,,35,4,5,0,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We consider complete and incomplete information settings, where potential entrants use the regulator's tax policy and the incumbent's output decisions in order to infer the incumbent's cost structure. When the regulator is absent, we show that firms' entry-deterring practices increase pollution relative to complete information. Hence, under certain conditions, environmental regulation becomes more beneficial in incomplete than in complete information contexts. Our results, therefore, identify under which cases an under- or over-estimation of the welfare benefits of environmental regulation arises from ignoring the information setting in which firms interact. We also examine how this estimation error increases as firms become more symmetric in their production costs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We found that there is no significant impact of oil futures price returns to Asian stock returns. However, strong volatility spillover effect is observed from oil futures price shock and volatility to its counterpart volatilities. In addition, our examination of optimal weights and hedge ratios suggests adding the oil asset into a well-diversified portfolio and hedging the oil price risk effectively.

The experiment had 5 treatments. The first treatment was controlled, i.e., without the appliance of vermicompost. In treatment 2, vermicompost was applied in autumn and introduced a dose of 170 kg ha(-1) N into the soil. In treatment 3 to 5, vermicompost was applied at twice dose in comparison to treatment 2 (340 kg ha(-1) N). In treatment 3, the whole dose of vermicompost (340 kg ha(-1) N) was applied at once, in autumn. In treatments 4 and 5, half of vermicompost (170 kg ha(-1) N) was applied in autumn and half (170 kg ha(-1) N) in spring, month before maize sowing. Not only was vermicompost applied in treatment 5, but also nitrogen fertilizer in form of LAD (ammonium nitrate with dolomite) at 60 kg ha(-1) N dose. The obtained results suggest that impact of vermicompost application on thickness of stalk and plant height of maize depended on the vermicompost application dose and on time of application. A bigger dose had a more positive impact than a smaller dose. From aspect of thickness of stalk and plant height is more appropriate when a bigger dose of vermicompost is applied once in autumn than a dose divided into autumn and spring applications. From the aspect of yield, no difference has been observed between a single autumn application and an application divided into autumn-spring dates. Pre-sowing addition of industrial nitrogen into the soil fertilized with vermicompost in autumn and spring dates resulted in creation of thickest stalks of maize plants, highest plants, highest total chlorophyll content in leaves, longest spadix of maize, highest thousand kernel weight and in highest grain yield of maize.","[Kmet'ova, M.; Kovacik, P.] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Agrobiol & Food Resources, Dept Agrochem & Plant Nutr, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Kmet'ová, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Agrobiol & Food Resources, Dept Agrochem & Plant Nutr, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",kmetova.maria0307@gmail.com,"Kováčik, Peter/AAW-9907-2021; Kováčik, Peter/AAX-1582-2021","Kováčik, Peter/0000-0002-0185-3342;",,,,,17,4,4,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,75,81,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800011,0

This study analyzes perceptions of PAG members in Canada regarding how forest tenures promote or inhibit the pursuit of three SFM objectives: competitiveness, environmental integrity and community stability. The analysis uses data from ratings questions and a best-worst choice experiment. Our results suggest that most respondents in both western and eastern Canada believed that the current structure of tenures meet the SFM objectives. However, results show significant differences between eastern and western respondents. For competitiveness, eastern respondents suggested that duration and flexibility in operational and harvesting requirements were most important, while western respondents indicated that flexibility in operational requirements and harvest levels were most important. The results also indicate, however, that support from PAG members for governments to alter tenure characteristics may be limited, particularly in the east. For western respondents, there was some agreement (i.e. more people agreeing than disagreeing) regarding: increasing tenure duration, decreasing flexibility in operational requirements, and increasing flexibility of harvest levels. Though our overall findings suggest that PAG members are generally satisfied with current tenure arrangements, questions remain regarding what segments of society these members represent, and whether sufficient attention has been given to the complex relationships between structures of forest tenures and the pursuit of SFM.

Due to inflation, consumers are paying more for essential commodities and their savings are disappearing slowly. Inflation affects the consumer spending, business investment and over all mode of the economy. Keeping inflation low and stable has been one of the major challenges for the Indian government and the central bank. In the current macroeconomic scenario, inflationary condition creates uncertainty for the consumer about their purchase decision which will affect the whole business cycle.

This approach of risk measure allows us to get rid of the normality condition of returns. Combining the CVaR risk measure method with our regression model, nonrealistic assumptions - such as rational and risk-averse investors, unlimited leverage opportunity and price-taker investors - of the most commonly used models can be almost entirely omitted. In our model we define the optimal choice for every single investor. Aggregating the required returns, allows us including different leverage constraints and margins, thus we do not assume unlimited borrowing for risk-free interest rate. Furthermore, based on the anchoring effect in Prospect Theory risk-seeking behavior can be explained and implemented in our model. On the other hand, the aggregation method to calculate expected returns allows price-maker investors having great influence on price movements (in case of a block transaction or in a non-liquid market segment).","[Ormos, Mihaly; Timotity, Dusan] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Finance, Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,,ormos@finance.bme.hu; timotity@finance.bme.hu,"Ormos, Mihály/E-1051-2011","Ormos, Mihaly/0000-0002-3224-7636",,,,,26,0,0,0,3,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-1-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,130,153,,,,,,24,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336025300011,0

Increased storage of starch in the grain, however, leads to an unbalanced proportion to the proteins, and their absolute quantity decreases. This is particularly apparent in the conditions of nitrogen deficiency. Interaction effect of elevated CO2, nitrogen nutrition and drought are not yet sufficiently described. Within the manipulation experiment in open top chambers (Domaninek near Bystrice nad Pernstejnem) that allow simulation of elevated concentration of CO2 (expected by the end of this century - 700 mu mol mol(-1)) and simulation of drought periods, the effect of these interactions on biomass production, grain yield, protein content, and other quality parameters of grain was studied. Elevated CO2 concentration increased production of both aboveground biomass and grain. This stimulatory effect is more pronounced if nitrogen is no limiting factor and also under the effect of drought. Higher effect under drought stress is probably due to increased water efficiency. The results show that the drought and nitrogen deficiency amplified the negative effect of elevated CO2 concentration on grain quality. Elevated CO2 concentration leads to a decrease in grain protein content and to reduction of other quality parameters such as Zeleny sedimentation test.","[Rajsnerova, P.; Klem, K.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Inst Forest Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Rajsnerova, P.; Klem, K.] CzechGlobe Global Change Res Ctr AS CR, Vvi, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Rajsnerová, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Inst Forest Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",rajsnerova.p@czechglobe.cz,"Klem, Karel/G-9726-2014",,,,,,8,0,0,0,10,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,669,673,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800116,0

The study lasted thirty-one days (data analyzed daily), in the period from 1 June 2013 to 1 July 2013 with BAT from 11.59 to 28.31 degrees C. Data comes from University farm. The farm is situated in aboice (GPS49 degrees 0'51.786N, 16 degrees 36'14.809E). Total number of cows was divided into two groups by milk yield. Almost 40 % of cows milked more than 25 kg of milk per day per cow so cows are milked twice during the morning. The other more than 60 % of dairy cows milked per day less than 25 kg of milk per day, and these cows are milked once during the morning. Based on the correlation of milk production data of Holstein cows was found that with increasing BAT and THI statistically significantly reduces average morning milk yield per cow on the second morning milking (at 8.00 a.m.) (BAT: r = -0.48, P < 0.01, THI: r = -0.47, P < 0.01) and total average morning milk yield per cow in dairy cows milked twice during the morning (BAT: r = -0.36, P < 0.05, THI: r = -0.35, P > 0.05).

The promise of rationalization, realized in developed countries, is that good management may generate significant rents. But an important issue for developing countries is: will the rents from rationalization accrue to the poor? I investigate connections between fisheries rationalization, income distribution, and poverty reduction drawing on a model from AD. Scott (1957). Under open access, a fixed amount of labor is employed such that the value of marginal product (VMP) in agriculture is equal to the value of average product (VAP) in the fishery. Reform is then modeled with a dynamic optimization model, which identifies conditions that generate a high potential payoff to the poor Whether potential payoffs are translated into actual gains to the poor depends upon political economy factors. I discuss the political economy barriers to pro-poor fisheries reform and potential institutions for sustaining rational fisheries use.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Wilen, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",wilen@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,49,19,23,0,23,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Nevertheless new concepts overarching beyond geographical borders like information society and corporate governance came to the forefront, and inevitably the legislation that regulates the business life started to become insufficient. Accordingly modifying, updating, and advancing the TCC became a necessity in order to be capable of addressing the contemporary challenges of today's world. The new law was promulgated in the Official Gazette on February 2011. As stated in the New Turkish Commercial Code No. 6102 it has come into effect as of 1 July 2012. Amendments made to the New TCC in June were promulgated in the Official Gazette on 30 June and became effective on 1 July 2012 as well. It constitutes a major reform of Turkish commercial law and thoroughly changes the entire legal framework for the ways in which commerce and investment are carried out in Turkey. Therefore New TCC sets fundamental changes in financial reporting and auditing. The objective of the law is to enable Turkish companies to use financial reporting generally accepted in international markets and enable them to be competitive players in these markets. At the same time the new law introduces a fundamental system change with a reformist understanding and a contemporary evolution in the auditing of companies.

Content analyses had been carried out on the 2009-2011 annual reports of the leading 30 public listed companies in Malaysia. For terms of methodology, sentence count was used as a unit of analysis to measure disclosure depth, while a finer-grained analysis of the CSR disclosure structure was performed to measure disclosure breadth and disclosure concentration. There was found to be a significant relationship between CSR disclosure structure and the corporate financial performance in the subsequent year. The results suggest that good financial performers are those companies that display a relatively high breadth of disclosure, while at the same time demonstrate the ability to disclose a concentrated structure of CSR disclosure to the definitive stakeholders. The findings of this study imply that it is not the volume of disclosure that matters, but the variety of items disclosed and concentration to the definitive stakeholders. On one hand, the study findings generally offer insights into the workings of successful reporting strategies for business organisations in Malaysia, while on the other hand, the study does provide inputs pertaining to the betterment of the CSR framework, for Bursa Malaysia and the relevant regulatory bodies to deliberate upon.

Although its clinical efficacy has been proven in clinical trials, its cost effectiveness is yet to be established. Objectives To estimate the cost effectiveness of golimumab among patients with active PsA from the UK NHS perspective. Methods A decision analytic model was used to simulate progression of a hypothetical cohort of active PsA patients on golimumab and other TNF-alpha inhibitors as well as palliative care. The clinical evidence was derived from clinical trials of TNF-alpha inhibitors and compared using mixed treatment models. The primary outcome measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated based on change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) from baseline. The annual acquisition cost of golimumab was assumed to be identical to annual cost of other subcutaneous TNF-alpha inhibitors. The resource use costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% over a period of 40 years. The uncertainty surrounding important variables was further explored using probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). Results TNF-alpha inhibitors were significantly superior to palliative care but comparable to each other on Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC), HAQ and PASI response. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICERs) for golimumab compared to palliative care was 16,811 pound for PsA patients and 16,245 pound for a subgroup of PsA patients with significant psoriasis. At an acceptability threshold of 30,000 pound per QALY, the probability of golimumab being cost effective is 89%. Conclusion Once monthly, golimumab is a cost-effective treatment alternative for patients with active PsA. With its patient-focussed attributes, golimumab is likely to offer additional choice in PsA treatment.","[Punekar, Yogesh Suresh] Schering Plough Ltd, Welwyn Garden City AL7 1TW, Herts, England; [Cummins, Ewen] McMaster Dev Consultants Ltd, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Asseburg, Christian] ESiOR Oy, Kuopio, Finland; [Prasad, Manishi] Schering Plough Ltd, Kenilworth, NJ USA; [Buchanan, Jacqueline] Buchanan Biotech Consultants, Mountain View, CA USA",Merck & Company; Merck & Company; Schering Plough Corporation,"Punekar, YS (通讯作者)，Schering Plough Ltd, Welwyn Garden City AL7 1TW, Herts, England.",Yogesh.punekar@spcorp.com,"Asseburg, Christian/AAK-2903-2020","Asseburg, Christian/0000-0001-7196-3363; Punekar, Yogesh/0000-0002-7531-1319",,,,,25,12,12,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The behaviors of such groups are shaped by their diverse motivations and circumstances. Segmenting heterogeneous target groups into more homogeneous subgroups may improve the chances of successfully identifying policy strategies to influence their behavior. Findings from a multimethod study of nonindustrial private forest owners in eastern Oregon suggest four unique subgroups of owners with different fuel management motivations and suitabilities for policy tools: commodity managers could benefit from market-based incentives; amenity managers could benefit from capacity building programs paired with symbolic campaigns; recreational managers could benefit from public incentives provided through consultants or contractors who can help plan the work; and passive managers may benefit from opportunities to respond to the policy strategies designed for the other groupings until more information can be gathered. Incorporating qualitative analysis of interview data with statistical analysis of survey data improved understanding of the groupings and appropriate policy strategies for them.

However, the poor may lack the capacity to aspire, which often results in underinvestment in their children's education. This paper studies the effect of a social program on the educational aspirations poor parents have for their children, and explores the role of exposure to educated professionals as a possible channel for increasing these aspirations. First, using differences-in-differences, we show that the Mexican antipoverty program PROGRESA raises the educational aspirations of beneficiary parents for their children of a third of a school year. Then, exploiting PROGRESA's mandated differential exposure to professionals, using triple differences, we find evidence suggesting that educational aspirations for children from high-exposure households are almost half of a school year higher six months after the start of the program. Finally, we show that there is a positive correlation between parental aspirations and children's educational attainment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By tracking the university performance of students admitted for the years 1997-2002, we are able to estimate the likelihood of success of subsequent students based on their characteristics as well as their high school grades. In doing so, we use a number of alternative estimators including a Least Squares Dummy Variable Model and a Hierarchical Linear Model.

It was in 1992 that the Philippine government gave recognition to the potentials of indigenous knowledge systems following the Earth Summit in 1992. Prior to this, scientists/researchers, development workers and lawmakers in the Philippines were preoccupied with their craft seeking modern ways of doing and accomplishing things. Cordillera in the Northern Philippines is a host to many indigenous cultures like Isneg, Kalinga, Bontok, Kankanaey, Tingguian, Gaddang, Ayangan and Tuwali, Kalanguya or Ikalahan, Ibaloy and Karao whose traditional knowledge systems were subject of many studies and investigations. The paper describes the different knowledge systems for natural resources management in the Cordillera as practiced by the people with different beliefs, culture and traditions. The paper showcases different resource conserving experiences in these cultures like muyong and ala-a systems of the Ifugaos: Iapat among the Isneg and Tingguians; inum-an, gen-gen, day-og, balkah, kinebbah, tuping and pamettey of the Ikalahans. These knowledge systems have been practiced by the indigenous peoples in the Cordillera and have been transmitted from generation to generation, making their way of life in harmony with their physical and social surroundings. While culture is environment specific, adoption/transfer of some indigenous technologies that may be fitting to other cultures and communities, with a little modification to suit their needs, can be done.

In the short term, the effects are stronger than in the long run; these results hold when comparing children within the same household.

While current and prospective rapid population ageing is expected greatly to increase the demand for elder care services, financial constraints, social change and rising female employment all act as obstacles to the provision of an adequate supply of care labour. In their search for a financially sustainable response to these challenges the EU countries have brought in various reforms designed to mobilise resources and achieve more cost-efficient results. The paper presents an analysis of the main objectives of care reforms - making care affordable, favouring the creation of a care market, and making work pay - as well as their possible trade-offs. In fact, entailing as it does a larger role for the family, greater reliance on home care may clash with the goal of a higher female activity rate: good jobs and decent working conditions in the care sector may run counter to the principle of care affordability for the greatest possible numbers, while subsidising demand may conflict with public finance sustainability. These interactions, and the interdependence between the care market and the rest of the economy, are crucial factors that will need to be considered in order to ensure consistency between goals and policies.

Within disease areas, the use of models with alternative structures, type of modelling techniques and/or data sources for common parameters reduces the comparability of evaluations of alternative technologies for the same condition. The aim of this paper is to propose a decision analytic model to evaluate long-term costs and benefits of alternative management options in patients with depression. The structure of the proposed model is based on the natural history of depression and includes clinical events that are important from both clinical and economic perspectives. Considering its greater flexibility with respect to handling time, discrete event simulation (DES) is an appropriate simulation platform for modelling studies of depression. We argue that the proposed model can be used as a reference model in model-based studies of depression improving the quality and comparability of studies.","[Afzali, Hossein Haji Ali; Karnon, Jonathan; Gray, Jodi] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Afzali, HHA (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Discipline Publ Hlth, Level 3,122 Frome St,Mail Drop 207, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",hossein.hajialiafzali@adelaide.edu.au,,"Gray, Jodi/0000-0002-1119-7078; Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",,,,,68,13,14,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Behavioral responses to these programs may alter the incidence of their benefits, a possibility that receives less attention in the literature compared to tax incidence. I demonstrate the importance of benefit incidence analysis by showing that the intended cost reductions of tax-based federal student aid are substantially offset by institutional price increases for a sample of 4-year colleges and universities. Contrary to the goal of policymakers, I find that tax-based aid crowds out institutional aid roughly dollar-for-dollar. Unfortunately, it is not clear how institutions utilize these captured resources, so that the ultimate incidence of the programs is uncertain.

The objectives were to explore the extent to which generalisations can be made about preferences of forests as sites for recreational use, and how regional variations in preferences may be explained in terms of cultural differences in local populations and bio-physical characteristics of the forests in each region. Survey participants were asked to classify the relationship, and quantify the relative importance, of each attribute to the recreational value of forests in their respective regions. While there was agreement across regions on the type of relationship and level of importance for many of the attributes, there were some notable outliers, for example 'residue from felling and thinning' scored lowest in Central Europe and highly in the other three regions. Indicative explanations for regional variations are proposed, focusing on combinations of cultural and biophysical factors, and drawing on the literature on forest preferences, place attachment and cultural landscapes.

Both the luxury and the substitution axioms appear to hold in the case of Nepal's child labour: a household's higher per capita income reduces child work hours; and the absence from work of an adult household member owing to illness increases child work hours.

Indeed, although carbon buyers claimed REDD credits to be the most desirable ones, and despite the steps forward for a REDD+ approval under the UNFCCC, REDD+ project development appears problematic. Good governance is often a prerequisite for the development of a REDD+ project. With the scope of determining the governance features for a successful REDD+ project, the research proposes a logical framework for REDD+ project governance assessment. Starting from the Governance of Forests Initiative Toolkit developed by the World Resource Institute, a set of REDD+ governance indicators are selected and applied in two Peruvian REDD+ field case studies. The methodology is then tested on REDD+ projects where no primary information is available. REDD+ projects are found to be successful when transparency and accountability are carefully addressed and when forest management and land use planning are endorsed. In this sense the Forest Stewardship Council certification appears to be an important pre-condition for the success of REDD+. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, as the litigation developed, the very interesting novel issues raised by such a measure were not discussed. This essay discusses those novel issues - in particular, what sort of scientific justification or risk assessment should be required for a measure like this, and what SPS Article 4 says about equivalence regimes.

In forest management context, criteria based on existing and utilized forest resources are used to compare and contrast the alternatives. Typically only a small group of the available criteria is used in the analysis. Deciding upon which criteria are used to represent the economic, ecological and social sustainability might have an impact on the final selection among the forest plans. This study's primary objective is to examine if DMs derive similar decisions regarding forest management with a varying level of information provided, thus illustrating how critical it is to negotiate about the criteria set in advance. Fifty forest science students were used as testees, using a representative sized forest tract as a case holding which provided semi-authentic data. A series of decision scenarios tested how the decision changed with an increase in the amount of information. Results of a systematic examination show that slightly over half of the participants selected the same plan in at least 2 out of 3 scenarios. The results also suggest that the most important requirement for criteria selection is that they display the dimensions where the plans markedly differ. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For manufacturer it is essential to known how to manufacture product in concordance with market requirements on one side, and on the other side how expend minimal costs to do it.

To perform DfC it is crucial at first to identify parameters (cost factors/drivers) of the designed technical product which have the most considerable impact on its costs, and it is important to identify them as early and as accurately as possible. Two different approaches for early prediction of costs of designed technical products are then briefly introduced and compared.

We explore mixed logit (i.e., random parameter logit) and finite mixture (i.e., latent class logit) models for dealing with angler heterogeneity We compare these to the commonly used conditional and nested logit models in terms of the value of catching (and keeping) one additional fish. Mixed logit models illustrate that the value of catch can be highly heterogeneous and, in some cases, can include both positive and negative values. The finite mixture model generates value estimates that were sometimes strikingly different than conditional, nested, and mixed logit models.

Examination of aggregate employment data in the 1955-2009 period, as well as regression analyses of household survey data for 1988, 2000, and 2008 and qualitative data from a 1997 field study, show that the lack of a demand-side challenge to the male-breadwinner family resulted in the institutionalization of the gendered labor division and roles as binding constraints on women's labor supply. The prevalence of informal sector employment and absence of paid work-family reconciliation measures magnify these supply-side constraints. Social conservatism is a more limited constraint, while men's unemployment emerges as a counteracting factor. Nevertheless, women's desire for increased autonomy emerges as the primary motivation for entering the labor market.","Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Econ Div, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Ilkkaracan, I (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Econ Div, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",ilkkaracan@itu.edu.tr,"ilkkaracan, ipek/AAC-3899-2021","ilkkaracan, ipek/0000-0002-2592-2728",,,,,64,111,126,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

QDs have a broad absorption with narrow photoluminescence spectra, high resistance to photobleaching and high resistance to photo-and chemical degradation. Nowadays, they are usually made of semiconductor core capped with any organic derivative making the quantum dot water soluble. This organic compound covering the metal core also serves as a linker for further conjugation. Up to now, many efforts have been made to utilize quantum dots as immunochemical sensor. One of the possible ways is to conjugate the quantum dot with antibody. There are several methods of immuno-quantum dot preparation. The conjugation of antibodies or proteins to quantum dots using standard linking chemistry can be related to potential difficulties of working with nanoparticles. We have investigated an alternative approach of self-assembled immuno-quantum dot preparation using a peptide as a linker.","[Janu, L.; Stanisavljevic, M.; Ryvolova, M.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Ryvolova, M.; Hubalek, J.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Brno University of Technology; Masaryk University Brno,"Janu, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",,"Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Hubalek, Jaromir/D-7753-2012; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Vaculovicova, Marketa/E-5583-2016","Hubalek, Jaromir/0000-0002-7496-2558; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Vaculovicova, Marketa/0000-0002-6771-1304",,,,,12,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1190,1199,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200139,0

Using the pooled mean group autoregressive distributed lag approach to annual data over 1975-2007 for ninety developing countries, we find that financial integration contributes to faster economic growth and lower growth uncertainty in the long run. The evidence also shows considerable heterogeneity in the short run. In addition, we find that FDI impedes output growth but mitigates uncertainty in output and consumption growth in the long run. In the short run, FDI has an average negative effect on growth and negligible effect on growth uncertainty, but there are large cross-country differences in response to FDI integration.","[Kim, Dong-Hyeon] Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Lin, Shu-Chin] Tamkang Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Suen, Yu-Bo] Aletheia Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, New Taipei City, Taiwan",Sungshin Women's University; Tamkang University; Aletheia University,"Kim, DH (通讯作者)，Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",dhyeonkim@yahoo.com; econscl@mail.tku.edu.tw; au4390@mail.au.edu.tw,"Lin, Shu-Chin/AAG-3608-2019",,,,,,42,13,16,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Drawing on a recent analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), two contradictory hypotheses-institutional mirror versus substitute-are discussed focusing on three institutional spheres: corporatism, welfare arrangements and statism. The paper argues for moving beyond a linear perspective and takes the interaction of institutional spheres into account. Using a comparative quantitative multilevel approach, institutional, sectoral and organizational determinants of enterprises' civic engagement are empirically analysed drawing on a survey of small-and medium-sized firms in 17 Western European countries. While firm size remains an important determinant of civic engagement, it is shown that the impact of welfare arrangements is conditional on the presence of corporatist arrangements and vice versa. This suggests that civic engagement both mirrors and substitutes for existing institutions, depending on underlying institutional complementarities.","Univ Mannheim, Sch Social Sci, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Koos, S (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Sch Social Sci, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany.",skoos@sowi.uni-mannheim.de,"Koos, Sebastian/S-7741-2016","Koos, Sebastian/0000-0001-6739-1649",,,,,50,49,51,2,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We find that the tiered formula for agriculture would halve tariffs in industrial countries and lower them more modestly in developing countries. In non-agricultural market access (NAMA), the formulas would reduce the tariff peaks facing developing countries and cut average industrial country tariffs by more than a third. We use a political-economy framework to assess the implications of flexibilities for the size of the tariff cuts and find they are likely to substantially reduce the outcome. However, despite the flexibilities, there are likely to be worthwhile gains, with applied tariffs facing developing countries cut by about 20% in agriculture and 28% in NAMA, and sizeable cuts in tariffs facing industrial countries. The welfare impacts of reform are evaluated using a new approach to aggregation that improves on the traditional, flawed approach of weighted-average tariffs. This substantially increases the estimated benefits of an agreement along the lines of these modalities, with estimated global income gains of up to $160 billion per year from market access reform.","[Laborde, David] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Martin, Will] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Van der Mensbrugghe, Dominique] FAO, I-00100 Rome, Italy",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); The World Bank; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Laborde, D (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",Wmartin1@worldbank.org,"Laborde, David/D-6408-2015; Martin, William/E-6226-2011","Laborde, David/0000-0003-3644-3498; Martin, William/0000-0002-2824-1303",,,,,28,7,7,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2012,11.0,1,,,,,1,25,,10.1017/S1474745611000437,0.0,,,25,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,886WU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299885400001,0

Empirical research shows that economic and innovative activities tend to concentrate spatially, and over time a pattern of geographical concentration of production and innovative activities will occur. However, empirical research also suggests that there are differences in spatial concentration of both innovative and economic activities, both across regions and branches of industry. Particularly for innovative activities, they tend to concentrated in few industrial sectors and technological fields. The analysis that follows studies the geography of Greek innovation, aiming at identifying spatial differences and highlighting regions of better performance, using Greek patent records, which have been collected for a period 23 years (1988-2010). The paper puts more light into an area that has been little studied in Greece. Based on the geographical origin of patent owners we confirm the theoretical and empirical argument of both concentration and importance of few regions and cities. Results show that Greek innovation is geographically concentrated in few Greek regions and particularly in their 'dominant' regional entities and then capital cities. These regions and cities are at the same time the major economic, industrial and commercial centers, while most of Greeks live there. Results also show the esixtence of few exceptions, which are related to specific national features and peculiarities of the Greek case.","[Markatou, Maria] Univ Athens, Technol Educ Inst Larissa, Larisa 41223, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,,markatou@prd.uth.gr,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,10,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,832,840,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549800082,0

Lipid droplets stored in oocytes have been shown to be accumulated in oocytes during follicular development, and have large influence on quality of oocytes during the process of meiotic maturation, fertilization and preimplantation development. The principal objective of this research was to investigate the lipid compound of the porcine immature oocytes during the luteal and follicular phases of folliculogenesis. The oocyte subpopulations for this experiment were obtained from small (<5 mm) and medium (6-9 mm) follicles. The oocytes were stained with Nile Red to quantify cytoplasmic lipid droplets as small (<= 10 mu m in diameter) and large (>10 mu m in diameter). We observed following parameters in immature oocytes: total area covered with lipid droplets (%), total number of lipid droplets per oocyte, number of small lipid droplets and number of large lipid droplets. The total of area covered with lipid droplets is similar in oocytes derived from small and medium follicles. The total number of all lipid droplets and number of small lipid droplets were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in oocytes derived from small than medium follicles. We found that the total number of lipid droplets is significantly higher in the late luteal phase in oocytes derived from medium follicles, than all stages of luteal phase in oocytes derived from small follicles during the process of folliculogenesis. We also noted that the number of small lipid droplets was significantly higher in oocytes derived from the late luteal phase in oocytes derived from medium follicles in comparison to oocytes derived from the middle and the late stage of the luteal phase in oocytes derived from small follicles. The number of large lipid droplets was significantly higher in the late luteal phase in oocytes derived from medium follicles compared to the late luteal and the early follicular phase in the oocytes derived from small follicles. In the early luteal phase in the oocytes derived from small follicles the number of large lipid droplets was significantly higher in comparison to the early follicular phase in oocytes derived from small follicles. In conclusion, the lipid composition in the immature porcine oocytes varied during the different phases of folliculogenesis. The number of small lipid droplets was higher in oocytes derived from medium follicles than in oocytes derived from small follicles.","[Milakovic, I; Hanulakova, S.; Horsky, R.; Machal, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Jeseta, M.; Knitlova, D.; Hanzalova, K.] Vet Res Inst, Dept Genet & Reprod, Brno 62100, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Veterinary Research Institute,"Milakovic, I (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",irena.milakovic@gmail.com,"Machal, Ladislav/K-7596-2018; Jeseta, Michal/A-3159-2013","Machal, Ladislav/0000-0001-6638-4404; Jeseta, Michal/0000-0003-1778-3454",,,,,19,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,973,980,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200112,0

These measures allow flexibility in responding to concerns related to women's rights issues. This study analyzes the humanitarian clause within Spanish immigration law that concerns undocumented battered women. In Spain, undocumented battered women who accuse their male partners of abuse and win legal cases against them become eligible for five-year residence and work permits. Those women who lose must be deported. Several nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have criticized the arbitrary application of the clause, arguing that protecting battered women should be prioritized over legal status. By putting this argument in dialogue with philosophical and anthropological studies, this study shows how NGO advocacy strategy might obscure the close link between gender violence and the legal status of undocumented migrant women.","Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Social Anthropol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Pérez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Social Anthropol, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",marta.perez@uam.es,,,,,,,67,8,8,1,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Non-interventional, multicentre, cross-sectional and retrospective burden-of-disease study including 414 MS patients with spasticity (age from 25 to 80 years) from 42 clinical practices across Germany. All patients were diagnosed with MS-related spasticity based on neurological examination at least 12 months before inclusion in the study. Three different forms were completed on different aspects of the disease: the patient questionnaire, the chart documentation form and the physician questionnaire. Mild, moderate and severe spasticity were found in 27.3, 44.0 and 28.7 % of patients, respectively. Associated symptoms and QoL scores were worse in patients with higher degrees of spasticity. In particular, higher mean scores for sleep impairment (mild vs. severe, 2.1 vs. 4.3), mean spasm count (3/day vs. 10.1/day), mean WEIMuS fatigue score (15.8 vs. 19.8), increased walking time (9.6 vs. 20.2 s) and lower mean QoL scores (MSQoL-54 physical subscale, 54.9 vs. 39.5; EQ-5D, 0.60 vs. 0.30) were reported in patients with severe spasticity in comparison to patients with mild spasticity. Patient management mainly comprised physiotherapy (mild vs. severe, 65.5 vs. 85.7 %) and medication (84.2 vs. 64.8 %) with baclofen. The average cost for patients with mild spasticity was a,not sign2,268/year, increasing to a,not sign8,688/patient/year for patients with severe spasticity. The health insurance costs showed the same trend. MS patients with spasticity suffer a significant burden because of resulting disabilities and reduced QoL, especially in cases of severe spasticity.

Since 2009, the forestry authorities have been working to establish a timber legality verification system called SVLK. This system became mandatory for large-scale forestry enterprises on 1 January 2013, while small-scale operators had until 1 January 2014 to comply. While the progress with SVLK certification among large-scale timber enterprises has been considerable, timber legality verification in the small-scale sector lags behind. There continues to be a significant degree of illegality in small-scale forestry operations and stakeholders' understanding of SVLK and the VPA is limited. Many small-scale timber businesses are reluctant to pursue certification and formalize their operations because of concerns about additional costs and uncertainty about the benefits. Achieving timber legality compliance in the Indonesian forestry sector will not be easy. However, by applying a phased approach, providing more information to stakeholders, expanding verification bodies' capacity, simplifying the SVLK process and making it more financially attractive it is possible to make progress.

The government chooses the number of stands and the length of contracts so as to maximize biodiversity benefits under a binding conservation budget. We examine the implication of two alternative budgets: a separate budget for each period (periodic budget) or one budget that to be used in all periods (intertemporal budget). The impact of the budget type shows up in the fact that with intertemporal budget choice set is larger and more high quality stands are available for contracting. Based on theoretical characterization we conduct a numerical landscape-level analysis. We find that both short and long conservation contracts are used to protect privately owned forest land. Transactions costs tend to reduce the number of short contracts. A budget increase results in a use of longer contracts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, current literature says little about how these export restrictions interact with existing domestic support measures in jointly determining domestic market outcomes. This paper analyzes this interaction by providing a quantitative assessment on how increased spending on agricultural domestic support in China offset the negative effects on grain production caused by the country's export restrictions and how these two types of measures jointly moderated rises of domestic grain prices. In particular, domestic and trade measures on key agricultural inputs such as fertilizers are shown to contribute significantly to expand grain outputs and reduce domestic market prices. While the short-term goal in stabilizing domestic grain prices was achieved through these measures, large fiscal and efficiency costs were incurred, especially considering how the short-term export restrictions seemingly necessitated the extra spending on input-based domestic subsidies. We also demonstrate that the costs to China and the rest of the world of these complicated policy interventions may be partially avoidable with a simpler and less distorting instrument.","[Yu, Wusheng; Jensen, Hans G.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Yu, WS (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",wusheng@foi.ku.dk,"Jensen, Hans Grinsted/D-8969-2015; Yu, Wusheng/E-4626-2015","Jensen, Hans Grinsted/0000-0003-3572-0860; Yu, Wusheng/0000-0002-2311-3759",,,,,33,17,19,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2014,13.0,4,,,,,651,683,,10.1017/S1474745613000335,0.0,,,33,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AT5SB,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345001000003,0

The occurrences of large declines in the Chinese stock market will stimulate declines in the United States and the United Kingdom, and especially in Japan's and Hong Kong's stock markets.

Although the resulting net monetary benefit (NMB) is easy to compute, the use of a single willingness-to-pay threshold assumes expressibility of the health effects on a single non-monetary scale. To relax this assumption, this article proves that the NMB framework is a special case of the more general stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) method. Specifically, as SMAA does not restrict the number of criteria to two and also does not require the marginal rates of substitution to be constant, there are problem instances for which the use of this more general method may result in a better understanding of the trade-offs underlying the reimbursement decision-making problem. This is illustrated by applying both methods in a case study related to infertility treatment.","[Postmus, Douwe; van Valkenhoef, Gert; Hillege, Hans L.; Buskens, Erik] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [Tervonen, Tommi] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Hillege, Hans L.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Cardiol, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Groningen,"Postmus, D (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, POB 30 001, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands.",d.postmus@umcg.nl,"Postmus, Douwe/AAF-5454-2021; van Valkenhoef, Gert/H-2993-2019","Postmus, Douwe/0000-0002-9458-7038; van Valkenhoef, Gert/0000-0001-9231-2770; buskens, erik/0000-0002-6463-1106",,,,,21,13,14,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

It then gives a genealogy of European economic policy responses to the crisis, tracing them from the emerging 'freshwater' school of economics (e. g. University of Chicago) that arose in opposition to Keynesian theory. The more immediate cause of the 2008 crisis, long in the making, was its reliance on private debt to sustain economic demand in light of profit-enhancing wage suppression. Following the 2008 financial shock, European Union policymakers crafted policy that placed the burden of adjustment on labour. A programme of austerity was chosen in much of the European Union, at odds with the post-war European 'social model'. This represented a retreat from the notion of a European project that encouraged liberalisation of economic policy but at the same time could be harmonised with a social dimension to create a distinctive 'Social Europe'. Nowhere was this austerity more vigorously applied than in the Baltic states. Its effects are examined here, along with lessons to be derived from that experience.","[Sommers, Jeffrey] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI USA; [Woolfson, Charles] Linkoping Univ, Inst Res Migrat Ethn & Soc REMESO, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Ostergotland, Sweden; [Juska, Arunas] E Carolina Univ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Linkoping University; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"Woolfson, C (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Inst Res Migrat Ethn & Soc REMESO, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Ostergotland, Sweden.",charles.woolfson@liu.se,,,"Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE) Project [2011-0338]","Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE) Project","The authors acknowledge ongoing research funding from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE) Project Number: 2011-0338.",,57,15,15,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

WTO dispute settlement has defined the lines for this obligation as it regards discrimination through 'tangible' product attributes. Yet as consumer preferences expand to include 'intangible' product attributes, such as 'free-range' chicken, 'sustainably' produced furniture, 'fair trade' coffee or even 'dolphin safe' tuna, the stage is set for a renewed debate over how far a WTO Member can regulate in pursuit of domestic policy goals. This article examines recent WTO jurisprudence on the use of technical regulations, and attempts to construct a generally applicable doctrine governing the prevention of deceptive practices through regulating intangible product claims. Using traditional methods of treaty interpretation, in light of economic efficiency and comparative legal analysis, it also identifies potential inconsistencies in the application of the TBT Agreement. Finally, this article offers considerations for future WTO tribunals when deciding how to more effectively balance the right to regulate intangible product attributes for the prevention of deceptive practices with the obligations and goals expressed by the TBT Agreement.","Int Trade Ctr, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Lowe, ER (通讯作者)，Int Trade Ctr, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,50,6,6,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Observational clinical and market data spanning over a period of 20 years were applied in order to estimate the social surplus generated by pharmaceuticals used in the management of high cholesterol and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The distribution of social surplus between consumers and producers was also computed and the dynamics of rent extraction examined. Health-related social surplus increased consistently over time for both disease areas, mostly due to the launch of more effective technologies and a greater number of patients being treated for the conditions. However, the growth rate of social surplus differed for each disease and dissimilar patterns of distribution between consumer and producer surplus emerged across the years. For lipid-lowering therapies, yearly consumer surplus reaches 85 % of total health-related social surplus after the loss of exclusivity of major molecules, whilst for COPD it ranges from 54 to 69 %. Average producer surplus is approximately 25 % of total health-related social surplus in the lipid-lowering market between 1990 and 2010, and 37 % for COPD between 2001 and 2010. The share of surplus captured by non-innovative generic producers also varies differently across periods for both markets, reaching 11.12 % in the case of lipid-lowering therapies but just 1.55 % in the case of COPD. A considerable amount of the value may be recouped by consumers only towards the end of the lifecycle. Elements affecting the distribution of social surplus vary across disease areas and include the market pricing structure and the pattern of clinical effectiveness observed over time. The application of a longer-term disease specific perspective may be required when assessing the cost-effectiveness of health technologies at launch.","[Camejo, Rodrigo Refoios; Rutten, Frans] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Erasmus Med Ctr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McGrath, Clare] AstraZeneca, HTA Policy & Payer Evidence, Macclesfield, Cheshire, England; [Miraldo, Marisa] Imperial Coll Business Sch, Healthcare Management Grp, London, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; AstraZeneca; Imperial College London,"Camejo, RR (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Erasmus Med Ctr, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",rodrigo.refoioscamejo@gmail.com,"Miraldo, Marisa/ABF-2584-2020","Miraldo, Marisa/0000-0002-5772-7740; Refoios Camejo, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5507-4857",,,,,24,4,4,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

One group may determine provision of a project (such as a dam) that benefits group members but hurts others. We introduce a model of such projects. In-group members may contribute to a common fund that benefits them as a public good. Benefits from the project may vary within the group. Provision has negative downstream externalities: contributions hurt agents outside the in-group (Outsiders), rendering them anti-social. Many models of social preferences predict that such externalities should reduce provision, although conditional cooperation or a preference for in-group members may counteract this. We test this model with a lab experiment using Outsiders with whom the in-group members have more and less contact. With homogeneous in-group benefits, the presence of negative downstream externalities reduces contributions by half when they have closer contact with Outsiders but not at all when they have had no contact. We introduce a rotating high-return position that allows subjects to trade favors. In this setting, contributions of non-privileged members diminish slightly when faced with the negative externality given closer contact with Outsiders, and not at all with less contact. Reciprocal giving occurs whether or not Outsiders are present. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, a star fund, a fund with a five-star Morningstar rating, does not have any significant effect on the fund's flows.

According to portfolio theory, the overall risk of banks is decomposed in order to further investigate the contribution of noninterest income. The empirical results show that there is no significant relationship between income diversification and bank risk. The reduction of overall risk is attributed to the significant reduction in the risk of interest income business. While the proportion of noninterest income increases, its volatility also increases, and thus its contribution to overall risk increases. Accordingly, some policy suggestions on the future development of income diversification strategy are proposed.","Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Zhou, KG (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhoukg@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71172161, 71231008]; Department of Education of Guangdong Province, China [11ZGXM79001]; Department of Education of Guangdong Province of China","National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Department of Education of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Department of Education of Guangdong Province of China","Kaiguo Zhou (zhoukg@mail.sysu.edu.cn) is a professor of finance at Lingnan College, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.

We compare measures of academic ability across student sub-groups by race, income, and gender, and across institutions. Male, minority, and aided students are affected most strongly by their peers. The size and presence of peer effects are dependent on the ability measure used as well as the setting. Standardized estimates suggest ability measured by high school grades have roughly twice the effect of ability measured by SATs. We also test the use of a standardized measure of first-year performance and find more consistent evidence of peer effects across both schools. Our results provide an explanation for the mixed findings in the literature and suggest that the driving force behind peer effects lies in the transfer of general academic know-how rather than in the teaching of specific knowledge or social proximity.

J,"Guan, WW",,,,"Guan, Wenwei",,,How General Should the GATT General Exceptions Be?: A Critique of the 'Common Intention' Approach of Treaty Interpretation,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Through an analysis of the general exception jurisprudence in China-Raw Materials, this paper offers a critique of the 'common intention' approach of treaty interpretation that asserts members' common intentions via the Vienna Convention as the customary interpretative rules. As the paper will reveal, misled by the confusion developed previously On China's trading rights commitments, the Panel and Appellate Body failed to recognize the unforeseeable nature of general exceptions. Beginning with a misinterpretation of how an accession protocol forms 'an integral part of the WTO Agreement', the common intention approach carries a clear judicial activist tendency. Moreover, this activist approach reveals an 'origin-seeking retrospective' mechanism that locates 'common intentions' statically at the founding moment of the treaty framework, causing a failure to apply the contingency measures that balance the rigidity of the regime. The approach's failure to acknowledge differences and flexibility further undermines WTO legitimacy. Its contractarian obsession with 'common intentions' as a quest for legitimate consent fills on its own terms. This paper therefore calls for extreme caution to be applied to the 'common intention' approach and its judicial activism tendency, to allow a more dynamic understanding of evolving 'common intentions' that ensures future growth of the WTO regime.","City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Guan, WW (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",w.guan@cityu.edu.hk,,"Guan, Wenwei/0000-0003-1414-8949",,,,,55,2,2,0,7,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This development affects the distribution of workers at different skill levels between exposed and sheltered sectors. Using EU-KLEMS data, we show that low- and medium-skilled workers have become increasingly concentrated in sectors sheltered from global markets. High-skilled workers, in contrast, have become increasingly concentrated in sectors that are internationally exposed. We contend that this shift has important consequences for welfare state politics. While conventional wisdom has it that exposure to international trade fuels demand for social protection, we argue that international trade is correlated with more conservative social policy attitudes and less support for left parties, at least for highly skilled workers (likely because exposed workers worry about international competitiveness).

This article explores whether this context had some bearing on bargaining outcomes during that time. We analyse data from the Australian Workplace Agreements Database to determine the incidence and length of paid parental leave in collective agreements registered between 2005 and 2010. The results show an increase in the number of agreements that included paid parental leave clauses in the period, with just over 14% of all current agreements including a paid parental leave clause by 2010. Moreover, 18% of all agreements lodged in 2010 included a paid parental leave clause, suggesting an increase in bargaining outcomes over time. We also find a slight increase in the average duration of paid parental leave in collective agreements. A leave of 14 weeks is most common in public sector agreements but less than 3% of agreements in the private sector provide for 14 weeks or more. These marked differences between the public and private sectors suggest minimal change in private sector bargaining outcomes. We conclude that the legislative context does influence bargaining outcomes, but that this effect is felt more in public sector than private sector bargaining.","[Baird, Marian; Murray, John] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Baird, Marian] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Women & Work Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Baird, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",marian.baird@sydney.edu.au,,"Murray, John/0000-0002-5216-5208; Baird, Marian/0000-0002-7104-1788",,,,,20,4,4,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The seemingly flush conditions of the pension funds led legislators in most states to substantially improve retirement benefits for public workers, including teachers. In this study we examine the benefit enhancements to the teacher pension system in Missouri. The enhancements resulted in large windfall gains for teachers who were close to retirement when the legislation was enacted. By contrast, novice teachers, and teachers who had not yet entered the labor force, were made worse off. The reason is that front-end contribution rates have been raised for current teachers to offset past liabilities accrued from the enhancements. Total teacher retirement compensation, net of contribution costs, is lower for young teachers today as a result of the enhancement legislation. Given sharp increases in pension costs in other states, this finding may generalize to young teachers in many other plans.","[Koedel, Cory] Univ Missouri, Truman Sch Publ Affairs, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Koedel, Cory; Ni, Shawn; Podgursky, Michael] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Koedel, C (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Truman Sch Publ Affairs, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",koedelc@missouri.edu; ni@missouri.edu; podgurskym@missouri.edu,,,,,,,42,15,16,0,4,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

We show that under certain conditions, relocation can be averted in the long run, even if the grandfathering scheme is phased out over time and immediate relocation is profitable in its absence. This requires that the permit price triggers sufficient investments into low-carbon technologies or abatement capital that create a lock-in effect which makes relocation unprofitable.

One of the issues is how to regulate state-owned enterprises under the World Trade Organization's rules on subsidies. This paper tackles the issue of what criteria decide whether an SOE can be a 'public body' that provides subsidies to other enterprises under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Appellate Body's jurisprudence on this issue is not clear, and the debate regarding the proper line between 'public body' and 'private body' continues. This paper is the first attempt to provide a systematic and objective analysis of three different approaches in interpreting the term 'public body', providing a framework for further discussions on the proper legal status of Chinese SOEs under the World Trade Organization (WTO) legal regime. By examining the negotiation history and varying approaches to the issue, this paper identifies the problems of current Appellate Body's approach and provides proposals for future clarification.

Therefore, other markets seem to be influenced by the oil market. Recent developments in timber prices - for example, rising fuelwood prices - as well as shifts in supply and demand on the timber markets are an indication of this influence on that particular market. This paper uses oil price scenarios to investigate the effects of this influence on timber supply. Oil price scenarios were developed and connected to timber price scenarios. These scenarios then acted as input variables to felling plans for forest enterprises. The link between timber price and planning derision was established by calculating financially optimized management scenarios using the risk-sensitive planning support tool, YAFO. To analyze these effects at a general level, 54 hypothetical forest enterprises were built from forest inventory data of Bavaria, Germany. Every enterprise's management plan was optimized separately under both a base scenario with constant timber prices, and a scenario based on predicted moderate oil price increases. Comparing the results of the scenario analysis showed significant changes in timber supply and grading ratios, tending towards an increase in wood graded for energy use with rising oil and timber prices.

Optimal allocation of production activities was sensitive to varying survival rates of fingerlings and monthly sales patterns.

From the obtained results there have been found statistically significant effect of year weather conditions on the head diameter, weight of head, WTA and achene yield, but the number of plants and heads per hectare were affected statistically inconclusive by year weather conditions. Higher average values of heads per hectare and heads diameter were recorded in the year 2013. Higher average values of the number of plants per hectare, weight of head, HTN and achene yield were recorded in the year 2012. More positive for sunflower yield formation was year 2012. Application of organic-mineral preparation Alginit influenced statistically significant head diameter, weight of head, WTA and achene yield. Statistically inconclusive effect was observed on the indicators of number of plants and heads per hectare. The highest number of plants per hectare, weight of head, WTA and achene yield were observed on the variant with Alginit application in the year 2012. The highest number of heads per hectare was observed on the control variant in the year 2013. The biggest head diameter was measured on the variant with Alginit application in the year 2013.","[Cerny, Ivan; Kovar, Marek] SPU Nitra, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Cerny, I (通讯作者)，FAPZ SPU Nitre, Katedra Rastlinnej Vyroby, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",Ivan.Cerny@uniag.sk,"Černý, Ivan/AAE-6054-2019; Kovar, Marek/AHB-6490-2022","Černý, Ivan/0000-0001-8305-890X; Kovar, Marek/0000-0002-1478-8383",,,,,14,1,1,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2517-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,120,123,,,,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BC4QO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352852400029,0

The countries chosen for this analysis are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania whose income per capita levels vary, consistent with their respective economic structures. The period selected captures the global downturn, which serves as a useful platform on which the short-run effects on CS labour productivity and labour market reactions can be identified. Using Geary-Khamis dollars, in purchasing power parity terms, enables comparative analysis across the four selected, transition countries to be carried out in respect of these components. The work finds that income per head, driven by labour productivity, could be identified as increasing in the case of Poland only during this four-year period. Contrastingly, the Czech Republic, whose income per head is the highest within the group, was the only country to reveal positive labour productivity and labour market gaps relative to the average for all four countries. It occurs that higher GDP capita, a proxy for income per head, was a key factor in enabling these two latter countries to partially weather the global storm.","[Clowes, David] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland; [Bilan, Yuriy] Univ Szczecin, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; University of Szczecin,"Bilan, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland.",David.Clowes@uek.krakow.pl; yuriy_bilan@yahoo.co.uk,"Clowes, David/T-3611-2018; Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021; Bilan, Yuriy/B-3119-2012","Clowes, David/0000-0002-3176-9360; Bilan, Yuriy/0000-0003-0268-009X",,,,,31,13,13,0,14,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Less attention has been paid to how insurantial techniques for economizing catastrophe have been deployed as political technologies. Focusing on discussions of US flood policy in the 1960s, the present article examines how insurance was used to forge new articulations and accommodations between political government and processes of rationalization. On the one hand, insurance provided a technical solution to problems that had long confronted US policy-makers: How to reduce losses from floods? How to fully compensate individuals who suffered losses? On the other hand, insurance was a device for reshaping the aims and objects of government, and for reframing questions that are more frequently situated at the level of political philosophy: What are the respective responsibilities of individual citizens and government in providing security? What tradeoffs must be made between the provision of security and economic rationality? What values are relevant in orienting public policy? In examining these issues, the article raises questions about standard narratives about the changing relations among risk, responsibility, and security in recent decades, particularly as they relate to neoliberalism.","[Collier, Stephen J.] New Sch Social Res, Grad Program Int Affairs, 66 West 12th St,Room 612, New York, NY 10011 USA",The New School,"Collier, SJ (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Grad Program Int Affairs, 66 West 12th St,Room 612, New York, NY 10011 USA.",CollierS@newschool.edu,,,,,,,28,38,49,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

This rejection of culture is ontological and epistemological: culture appears in ANT largely as an artefact of modernist thought rather than as an empirical aspect of agents' performances. And yet if 'economy' can be critiqued and reinstated as performative, so too can 'culture'. To explore this, we focus on objects of concern that - unlike the financial markets that have formed the core of ANT-inspired thinking about the economy - are assembled by actors in and through what they themselves understand to be cultural materials, cultural calculations, cultural processes, cultural institutions. In such examples, 'culture' is continuously invoked and enacted by actors in constructing their actions, whatever critical sociologists might have to say about its ontological status. It seems paradoxical that a theoretical approach that makes sacrosanct the associations constructed by agents who assemble their own world, generally discusses 'culture' only from the point of view of critical epistemology. Bearing all this in mind, we argue that it is time for us to 'reassemble' the cultural.","[Slater, Don] London Sch Econ, Dept Sociol, 42 Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Entwistle, Joanne] Kings Coll London, Dept Culture Media & Creat Ind, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; King's College London,"Entwistle, J (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Culture Media & Creat Ind, London WC2R 2LS, England.",d.slater@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,50,40,44,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

A survey experiment was conducted with 1,745 MSM and MSW (18-25 years of age) who received incentive offers to decide first whether to accept monthly prevention talks and STI testing; and then a second set of offers to accept to stay free of STIs (verified by quarterly biological testing). The survey used random-starting-point and iterative offers. WTA was estimated with a maximum likelihood double-bounded dichotomous choice model. The average acceptance probabilities were: 73.9 % for the monthly model, and 80.4 % for the quarterly model. The incentive-elasticity of participation in the monthly model was 0.222, and 0.515 in the quarterly model. For a combination program with monthly prevention talks, and staying free of curable STI, the implied WTA was USD$ 288 per person per year, but it was lower for MSW: USD$ 156 per person per year. Thus, some of the populations at highest risk of HIV infection (MSM and MSW) seem well disposed to participate in a CEI program for HIV and STI prevention in Mexico. The average WTA estimate is within the range of feasible allocations for prevention in the local context. Given the potential impact, Mexico, a leader in conditional cash transfers for human development and poverty reduction, could extend that successful model to targeted HIV/STI prevention.","[Galarraga, Omar] Brown Univ, Dept Hlth Serv Policy & Practice, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Galarraga, Omar; Sosa-Rubi, Sandra G.; Bertozzi, Stefano M.] Natl Inst Publ Hlth INSP, Ctr Evaluat Res & Surveys, Div Hlth Econ, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico; [Infante, Cesar] Natl Inst Publ Hlth INSP, Ctr Hlth Syst Res, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico; [Gertler, Paul J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bertozzi, Stefano M.] Bill & Melinda Gates Fdn, Seattle, WA USA; [Bertozzi, Stefano M.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Brown University; Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica; Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Sosa-Rubí, SG (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth INSP, Ctr Evaluat Res & Surveys, Div Hlth Econ, Av Univ 655, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico.",srubi@insp.mx,"INFANTE, CESAR/AAF-1896-2021; Galarraga, Omar/N-1622-2019","INFANTE, CESAR/0000-0002-5367-8611; Galarraga, Omar/0000-0002-9985-9266; Bertozzi, Stefano M/0000-0002-1723-7085","FIC NIH HHS [K01-TW008016-04, K01 TW008016] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041020] Funding Source: Medline",FIC NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,50,19,22,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The crisis has had a far-reaching impact on the world economy and has brought challenges and opportunities to all countries and all fields. In addition to big difficulties, the crisis provided for Estonian manufacture also an exceptionally good chance for change and development. The crisis had a purifying and disciplining effect, enabled to eliminate from the manufacture wrong investments and inefficient enterprises. Assets were redistributed from passive economic agents to active ones and in favour of those who had capital for growth financing.

In the controlled, confined space of the laboratory they were able to produce, they claimed, distinct political 'climates'. Authoritarian, laissez-faire and, most precarious and precious of all, democratic 'atmospheres' were the observable effect of subjecting small groups of children to different styles of 'leadership' under artificial conditions of work-play. In this essay, we reconstruct the practical set-up that allowed Lewin and Lippitt to render political forms observable and manipulable under experimental conditions. We will analyze the physical configuration and material furnishings of the experimental setting, as well as the self-affected practices of 'leadership' that the experimenters deployed in their attempts to change the political valence of groups. The discovery of a set of technical procedures for the realization of localized but tangible forms of democratic life was a startling and welcome discovery in the bleak years of totalitarian ascendancy.

To do so, it follows both pragmatist sociology, where controversies are seen as situations in which social formations are questioned and reconfigured, and recent economic sociology, studying how marketisation might help in assembling and not only destroying social bonds. Simultaneously, this work departs from these influences in three directions. It deals with two ways of assembling the social, solidarity and property, which have remained overlooked in the proximate literature. Rather than a detailed ethnographic description, it works analogically, eliciting new interpretations of the empirical material by pairing the social scientific concepts mobilised in the studied controversy with the conceptual tools developed in recent social sciences. And, by analysing a parliamentary controversy regarding insurance, it complements recent work that is starting to study how finance commodities are enacted not only in traditional market encounters but also in a varied array of collateral sites, including courts, social policy and regulation controversies.","[Ossandon, Jose] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Ossandón, J (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",jo.ioa@cbs.dk,,"Ossandon, Jose/0000-0003-2927-1878",Beca Presidente de la Republica from Government of Chile; Central Research Fund by University of London; Universidad Diego Portales,Beca Presidente de la Republica from Government of Chile; Central Research Fund by University of London; Universidad Diego Portales,"This research has been funded by the Beca Presidente de la Republica from the Government of Chile, the Central Research Fund awarded by the University of London, and Universidad Diego Portales.

The article provides details of a range of services both within government and for society that are available in e-government modes. However, there are challenges to the development of e-government including adherence to traditional models of service delivery, resistance to organisational culture change by officials, preference for counter services by clients and constraints on the availability of information technology training.

J,"Jones, MD",,,,"Jones, Michael D.",,,Teacher behavior under performance pay incentives,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Teacher salaries; Productivity,,"Over the last decade many districts implemented performance pay incentives to reward teachers for improving student achievement. Economic theory suggests that these programs could alter teacher work effort, cooperation, and retention. Because teachers can choose to work in a performance pay district that has characteristics correlated with teacher behavior, I use the distance between a teacher's undergraduate institution and the nearest performance pay district as an instrumental variable. Using data from the 2003 and 2007 waves of the Schools and Staffing Survey, I find that teachers respond to performance pay incentives by working fewer hours per week. Performance pay also decreases participation in unpaid cooperative school activities, while there is suggestive evidence that teacher turnover decreases. The treatment effects are heterogeneous; male teachers respond more positively than female teachers. In Florida, which restricts state performance pay funding to individual teachers, I find that work effort and teacher turnover increase. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our concern with the early grades arises from recent studies highlighting how children's experiences in those years have lasting effects on their later outcomes. Using two credentials-based measures of teacher quality, we document within-school quality shortfalls in the lower grades, and show that the shortfalls increased with the introduction of No Child Left Behind. Consistent with that pattern, we find that schools responded to accountability pressures by moving their weaker teachers down to the lower grades and stronger teachers up to the higher grades. These findings support the view that accountability pressure induces schools to pursue actions that work to the disadvantage of children in the lower grades.","[Fuller, Sarah C.; Ladd, Helen F.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Fuller, SC (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",sarah.fuller@duke.edu; hladd@duke.edu,"Fuller, Sarah/I-7121-2018",,,,,,25,18,29,2,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Evidence from Ethiopia,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,"Fuelwood consumption; Household and community investment in trees; Heckman selection model; Tigrai, Ethiopia",MANAGEMENT; DEFORESTATION; CONSUMPTION; AGROFORESTRY; CHOICE; POLICY; HILLS,"As a result of many years of deforestation, fuelwood scarcity is a critical problem in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian government encouraged afforestation and tree growing at both the community and household levels as a policy to stem deforestation and degradation of agricultural lands. The rationale underlying the tree growing strategy is that some significant part of whatever is planted will be used as fuelwood, thereby reducing the demand for wood from native forestlands and use of crop residues and animal dung needed for soil improvement. It is incumbent, however, to ask: Does household or community tree planting indeed translate into greater use of wood for fuel? To address this question, fuelwood consumption in Ethiopia is examined using datasets from sample cross-sections of 500 households and 100 communities in the highlands of Tigrai, northern Ethiopia. The results of such an analysis provide important insights into the potential effectiveness of the tree growing or afforestation strategy as a partial remedy to the country's fuel problems. Findings suggest, however, that there may not be a link between tree planting and the use of such fiber for fuelwood. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to determine if specific conditions affect the valuation of health using a generic measure. Using data from the US Valuation of EQ-5D Health States (n = 3,773), we focused on six conditions of interest (COI), e.g., arthritis, diabetes, depression, heart failure, cancer, and hay fever, and time trade-off values for 12 of 243 EQ-5D health states. For each COI, regression models compared differences in pooled health state preferences among four groups: COI, COI plus one or more additional conditions, no COI but other conditions, or no chronic conditions. No differences in health state preferences were found among the four groups for any of the COIs except for patients with cancer and additional conditions, whose mean scores were 0.07 lower compared to no chronic conditions (P < 0.01). The strongest predictors of health state preferences were race/ethnicity, age, and marital status. Most self-reported chronic conditions had a trivial impact on preferences for hypothetical health states, which suggests that utility algorithms for generic preference-based measures will be similar when estimated from preferences of the general population or patients with chronic illness, conceivably because both types of respondents have not experienced many health states in the classifier system.","[Pickard, A.

This paper empirically assesses the possible indirect effects of sugarcane expansion in Brazil's state of Sao Paulo, on forest conversion decisions in the country's Amazon region. Further, it examines the evidence for a mechanism through which these effects might materialize, namely a displacement of cattle ranching activities from Sao Paulo state to the Amazon.

The intention is not to propose infrastructure solutions that are currently technically feasible or justifiable, however; the objective is to present visions of future infrastructure that would only be possible with new advances in science and technology, or significant improvements and adaptations of existing knowledge and techniques. The All-in-One vision is explored using several vignettes, each of which envisions a novel, multi-functional infrastructure for serving future communities. The vignettes were conceived using imaginative exercises and brain-storming activities; each was then rooted in technological and scientific feasibility, as informed by extensive literature searches and the input of domain leaders. The vignettes tell their own stories, and we identify the challenges that would need to be overcome to make these visions into reality. The main aim of this work is to encourage radical approaches to thinking about future infrastructure provision, with a focus on rationalisation, efficiency, sustainability and resilience in preparation for the challenging times ahead. The All-in-One concept introduces the possibility of a unified and singular system for infrastructure service provision; this work seeks to explore the possibility space opened thereby.

The analysis benefited from the results of an empirical simulation, consisting in the application of the new voting methodology to past procedures of TDIs.

The banking, securities and insurance, as well as the postal financial institutions changed significantly, but are hardly converging to Anglo-American or liberal market models. We contend that Japans new financial system is best characterized as syncretic, with new, traditional and hybrid forms of practices, organizations and norms coexisting. Syncretism in industry was driven by a distinctive pattern of interest group politics we call syncretization. Strong political leadership, facing serious electoral threats, shifted the policy logic from gradual incremental reforms following traditional interest group dynamics, to rapid reforms that excluded the traditionally powerful interest groups most affected by these reforms. We support the notion that diverse industry outcomes can be complementary to broader political economic reforms that take Japan away from its traditional model, part of a broader convergence towards diversity.","[Kushida, Kenji E.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shimizu, Kay] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA",Stanford University; Columbia University,"Kushida, KE (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kkushida@stanford.edu; ks2679@columbia.edu,,,,,,,55,7,7,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

These initiatives were established at regional and often national level, without major interaction among countries in Europe. With the expansion of the European Union in the 1980s, when Mediterranean countries were incorporated in the EU, the issue of forest fires increased in relevance, mainly due to the damages caused by fires in the natural areas of these countries. Initial EU policies related to fires date back to the 1980s, in which the European Union elaborated the first voluntary Regulations to support the development of forest fire information systems in the countries. Although EU environmental policies promoted the development of national systems, the first steps towards the development of a European fire information system did not take place until the late 1990s. Such a system was initially discussed between the European Commission services and the Member States in 1998. Although the development of the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) started at this time, its official establishment came only in place with the publication of the Forest Focus regulation in 2003, which included within its implementation rules the reference to EFFIS. Since its establishment, EFFIS has influenced the further development of EU environmental policies on forest protection. It has further shaped the link of these to other forest and regional policies, which, although not fire-specific, did address the issue of damages caused by fires to the European environment and its population. The present article describes the steps in the development of the EU fire policies and EFFIS. It provides a synoptic view of how fires are included in different sectoral policies of the EU, and suggests ways in which the continuation of forest fire monitoring and management may be included in future European policies.

We use partial frontier approaches to mitigate the influence of outliers and the curse of dimensionality. Our estimation considers idiosyncratic variables at the school, class, and student levels. Our model is applied to a sample of students in fourth year of primary school in urban schools in Chile. Results are in line with previous findings that less than 30% of the variance in students' educational attainment is attributable to their schools. Results also corroborate that a model considering only student-level variables yields high inefficiencies not attributable to school management, but rather to inadequate resource-endowment policy. Therefore, when disregarding specific variables concerning the resources allocated to the schools, the performance of those schools is undervalued, largely because inefficiencies caused by suboptimal resource endowments or difficulties arising from the socioeconomic environment are instead attributed to poor school management.

In order to protect these populations and provide harvest opportunities for recreational anglers, the fishery is often managed with separate regulations for wild and hatchery salmon. This article examines how the value of recreational fishing is affected by changes in wild and hatchery salmon regulations and catch rates in the Northwest region of the US. Using a discrete choice experiment, we estimate saltwater fishing trip preferences. We integrate the estimated preferences with auxiliary creel data in order to conduct simulations of willingness to pay that vary in bag limits and catch rates, conditioning on current fishery conditions. We find statistically significant differences between the recreational values for wild and hatchey salmon, and our simulations highlight the fact that these differences depend on baseline levels of catch rates and bag limits.","[Anderson, Leif E.; Lee, S.

The great promise of performance-based approaches is that they are believed to provide a more cost-effective approach to achieving desired objectives. This article examines the challenges in designing performance-based regulatory approaches in forestry by analyzing the case of regulatory reform in British Columbia, Canada, in the 2000s. A key barrier to achieving a more performance-based regime includes the inherent challenge of identifying measurable objectives when the underlying causal mechanisms between forestry and environmental values are so poorly understood. The distinguishing feature of the new framework in British Columbia is not that it is performance-based, but that it provides greater flexibility to foresters in achieving policy goals through management planning. The design challenge is to find performance standards specific enough to be meaningful and enforceable but not so specific that they eliminate the very flexibility in means that performance-based regulation is trying to promote. In forestry in British Columbia, this challenge has proven sufficiently daunting that its new system of forest practices has proven to be far less performance-based than initially envisioned.

Besides, the philosophy of measurement system analysis (MSA) depends on measurement error which hides true process capability. So it must be implemented prior to any process improvement activities to minimize the measurement errors. Since the capability of each quality system is related to the accuracy of its measurement system, this research developed a novel method for MSA. To increase accuracy and precision of MSA, analyzing measurement systems under fuzziness of its indices have been investigated. In order to obtain much more accurate indices, we develop a new method in measurement system analysis with fuzzy considerations which makes an important contribution within MSA literature. To do so, we propose fuzzy measurement system analysis (FMSA) by considering gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R) index as a triangular fuzzy number. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method has been demonstrated within a case study in automotive parts industry.","[Kazemi, Abolfazl] Islamic Azad Univ, Qazvin Branch, Dept Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin, Iran; [Hajipour, Vahid] Islamic Azad Univ, Qazvin Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Qazvin, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Kazemi, A (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Qazvin Branch, Dept Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin, Iran.",abkaazemi@qiau.ac.ir; v.hajipour@qiau.ac.ir,"Hajipour, Vahid/AAX-4459-2020; Kazemi, Abolfazl/AAV-1844-2021","Hajipour, Vahid/0000-0002-3974-6403; Kazemi, Abolfazl/0000-0003-1870-2206",,,,,24,2,2,0,8,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Under the term of mixed culture we understand the cultivation of two different crops at same field simultaneously, in particular mixture of leguminous and non-leguminous crops. The need to cultivate these crops for improving soil fertility and sustainability is often neglected, but positive influence of legumes in crop rotation is widely recognized. This work deals with impact of mixed-culture cultivation on microbial activities in rhizosphere, because they have direct influence on leaching of nutrients from soil. Substrate Induced Respiration (SIR) and content of ammonia nitrogen in microbial biomass (INDEX of nitrogen availability) were chosen as a main indicator of microbial activities in soil. SIR and INDEX were determined in soil sample, which were removed from rhizosphere of Winter Pea (WP), Winter Wheat (Control). Moreover, soil sampling was performed from rhizosphere of Wheat and Winter Pea (W+WP), which both plants species grew together. Significantly the highest SIR was found in variant W+WP (13.6 mu g CO2-C g(-1).h(-1)) in comparison with the control. The highest content of ammonia nitrogen was found in variant W+WP (369.5 mg.kg(-1)). Based on the results from this experiment, authors conclude that the cultivation of mixed-culture has a positive effect on microbial activity and decrease in leaching of mineral nitrogen.","[Kintl, A.; Elbl, J.; Zahora, J.; Hynst, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kintl, A (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",antonin.kintl@mendelu.cz,"Záhora, Jaroslav/L-6534-2018; Kintl, Antonín/AAJ-3773-2021; Elbl, Jakub/I-5056-2018; Kintl, Antonín/I-8171-2018","Kintl, Antonín/0000-0002-0031-083X; Elbl, Jakub/0000-0001-6401-1516;",,,,,11,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,322,326,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800055,0

Pertaining to scarce empirical work on the issue, there are conflicting arguments but not common agreement about this matter yet. In this regard, we specify an empirical model describing the case benefiting from P. Krugman (1991) and other empirical studies. Employing a balanced panel data set that covers 22 European countries and 23 manufacturing industries for the period 1995-2008, we estimate in general two different regression models, a panel model and country by country estimates from the time series. Findings reveal that overall direct indicators of the integration have had significant impact on the dispersion of the industries in European countries, while some other factors have significantly induced the countries to concentrate/specialize in fewer numbers of industries. On the other hand, due purely to some of the measured integration and other indicators contained in the model, we observe a definite industrial concentration only in 3 countries and a definite industrial diversification only in 2 countries of Europe. The integration indicators and other determinants have affected the industrial distribution differently across the countries.","[Kose, Seyit] Abant Izzet Baysal Univ, Dept Econ, Bolu, Turkey",Abant Izzet Baysal University,,kseyit@yahoo.com; aykutsarkgunesi@beun.edu.tr,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,3,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-1-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,108,129,,,,,,22,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336025300010,0

The evaluation was performed at the South Moravian Region with a total area of 1,100 km(2). RapidEye satellite images of the 2012 and borders of land blocks from iLPIS were used for this study. The first step was a selection of bare arable land through polygons of arable land from the system iLpis and pixels of arable land obtained through standard differential vegetation index (NDVI). An image classification was performed on these grounds in order to create class of information describing the spectrum of surfaces forming the bare soils. To classifications were included areas of bare soul with pixel count higher or equal to 50 % of the original number of pixels of bare soils in areas selected through data from the system iLpis. A coefficient of variation was used to rate variability. Information and The best images as far as for the information were images taken in March before the beginning of the growing season. This data was the most variable of all evaluated scenes, both in terms of assessment of statistical dispersion of the file and changes detectable by remote sensing. In subsequent phases of the project, all gathered results will be compared and refined with other information sources.","[Novak, J.; Lukas, V; Kren, J.; Klimanek, M.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Novák, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jaroslavxnovak@gmail.com,"Jaroslav, Novák/B-5173-2014; Klimanek, Martin/H-8476-2012; Kren, Jan/R-5055-2018; Lukas, Vojtech/G-1573-2010","Jaroslav, Novák/0000-0002-0808-7863; Klimanek, Martin/0000-0002-5401-7268; Kren, Jan/0000-0002-5229-398X; Lukas, Vojtech/0000-0001-8051-3305",,,,,12,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,114,119,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800018,0

EOs from clove (Caryophyllus aromaticus), cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and oregano (Origanum vulgare) in 4 and 16 mu l.l(-1) concentrations was tested in vivo on potatoes against Phoma foveata. Potatoes treated by the same manner have been analyzed for their sensory properties. High inhibition was found on potatoes treated with O. vulgare EO - the mean of growth were 0.27 mm (16 mu l.l(-1)) and 2.24 (4 mu l.l(-1)) and C. Aromaticus 1.8 mm (16 mu l.l(-1)) and 2.87 mm (4 mu l.l(-1)). Statistically significant differences was found only between two tested samples in organoleptic analyzes. To our knowledge, never have been obtained in such low concentrations inhibiting fungal growth as in our study even in combination with any physical or chemical treatment. Method using evaporation and distribution of EO with warm air flow is suitable for future utilization in antimicrobial protection of any fruit and vegetables. EO vapors with warm air flow could be also applicable e.g. in seed treatment or field applications as well as postharvest treatment of different agricultural products, instead of synthetic fungicides, preferentially by organic farmers.","[Smid, J.; Kloucek, P.; Legarova, V] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Crop Prod, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Smid, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Crop Prod, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",smidj@af.czu.cz,"Legarová, Veronika/ABH-4232-2020; Legarová, Veronika/E-9128-2018; Kloucek, Pavel/E-7549-2018","Legarová, Veronika/0000-0002-7915-2159; Kloucek, Pavel/0000-0001-8035-0542",,,,,12,1,1,0,5,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,609,613,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800105,0

(2012) and the subsequent reply by Paruelo recently published on Forest Policy and Economics. Forests have long been recognized as the main ecological construction and restoration means for their multiple ecosystem services. But forests usually cannot simultaneously produce these multiple services due to the trade-offs among competing functions. These services have different spatial-temporal scale characteristics and corresponding different stakeholders. Rational management decisions depend on local conditions, needs, and underpinning ecosystem processes. The geographic differences could mask the true role of forests for the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and ET, producing different effects in arid and humid areas. Large-scale afforestation in the arid areas will undoubtedly result in water consumption, reducing the availability of runoff water. Therefore, this needs to be considered very cautiously. Pricing strategies are not sufficient for forest-water related issues, and inappropriate incentives will result in wasted water resources. It is necessary to integrate administration and human-values guidance for the sustainable management of forest ecosystem services. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Researchers examining this issue are confronted with difficulties in defining reasonable measures of competition within local educational markets. We approach the problem through the application of Geographical Information System (GIS) tools to the development of a school competition index (SCI) for the state of Mississippi. The SCI captures the degree of competition each public school in the state faces from peer private schools spatially located within their local market area. We find that higher degrees of competition from private schools significantly increase public primary and high school efficiency, as measured by the proficiency rates on high-stakes examinations. It is anticipated that the current results will inform policymakers regarding the viability of competition-based reforms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence suggests that the price paid informally to medical staff is negotiated either directly or indirectly between patients and medical staff. The aim of this paper is to measure the imperfect information that exists on the amount that has to be paid informally to medical staff. We measure the extent to which patients pay more than the amount medical staff expect informally and the extent to which medical staff request less than patients are willing to pay informally. A two-tiered stochastic frontier model is developed to estimate indicators of patients' and medical staff's imperfect information on informal payments and the effects on the amount the other party is minimally expecting or maximally willing to pay informally. The estimates are based on informal payments to medical staff in the inpatient health care sector in Albania. We use data from the Albania Living Standards Measurement Survey 2002 and 2005. The pooled samples include 707 individuals who have visited inpatient health care services in these 2 years. Our results show that medical staff has less information on the patients' maximum willingness to pay informally than patients have on medical staff's minimum expected amount. These estimates do not depend on categories of illnesses but on certain socio-demographic characteristics.","[Tomini, Sonila] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Groot, Wim; Pavlova, Milena] Maastricht Univ, Dept Hlth Org Policy & Econ, CAPHRI, Maastricht Univ Med Ctr,Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Groot, Wim] Maastricht Univ, Topinst Evidence Based Educ Res TIER, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); Maastricht University,"Tomini, S (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",Sonila.tomini@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Pavlova, Milena/B-4778-2011","Pavlova, Milena/0000-0002-6082-8446",,,,,36,29,30,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We focus on the case of subsidies for renewable resources produced under increasing marginal costs, and assume that both the renewable resources and the fossil fuels are currently in use. Such subsidies have a direct effect and an indirect effect working in opposite directions. The direct effect is the reduction in demand for fossil fuels at any given price. The indirect effect is the reduction in the current equilibrium price for fossil fuels, which tends to increase the amount of fossil fuels demanded. Whether the sum of the two effects will actually result in an earlier or later date of exhaustion of the stock of fossil fuels depends on the curvature of the demand curve for energy and of the supply curve for the renewable substitute.

While a strong external labour market may be a sign of economic dynamism, very high turnover rates may indicate a failure of the sort of organisational attachment among professionals that is needed to foster organisational learning. Moreover a 'brain drain' from the country of Malaysian-educated engineers remains an ongoing concern. Although this phenomenon is popularly attributed to the 'job-hopping' propensities of young Malaysians, it is argued here that firms, through their human resource management (HRM) practices, have an important role to play in encouraging stronger rates of knowledge worker retention. The article reports on research findings indicating varying levels of organisational commitment by a sample of Malaysian engineers. It examines possible links between high turnover and HRM approaches that afford employees few other forms of voice than exiting the firm. Evidence is provided that employee participation in decision-making, particularly relating to training and development, and the perceived fairness of performance appraisal practices, contribute to feelings of perceived organisational support (POS), and that this sense of support influences engineers' commitment and thus turnover intentions.",,,,fusherna@yahoo.com,"RAHMAN, RABEATUL HUSNA ABDULL/AAQ-3624-2020",,,,,,70,9,13,0,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Following T.S. Kuhn, these breaks with the past are seen as paradigm changes. We perceive planned adaptation of forestry and forests under climate change as a new paradigm change, precipitated once more by forest carbon. To be sustainable, forest management and conservation must embrace planned adaptation to and mitigation of mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. The current initiative of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries (REDD) represents, beyond its original mitigation goal, a major facet of planned adaptation of forests and adjoining sectors in developing countries. The initiative is gaining a powerful momentum for enhancing sustainable forest management in developing countries. REDD may also adapt relations between developing and developed countries in another paradigm change. Worldwide observations of climate change impacts on forests and IPCC forecasts project an image of forests and forestry entering a new era. Dealing with this future by relying on autonomous adaptation is unlikely to suffice. Climate change will alter site and ecological conditions, increase risk in many forests, create new gaps in knowledge, increase the value of forest carbon and wood energy, and expand the international and human dimensions of forestry. Ending the proverbial seed dormancy of new developments in forestry, change is underway and appears expedient. We conclude that anticipatory planned adaptation of all facets of forestry to climate change imposes mitigation and adaptation as new boundary conditions for sustainable forest management and conservation, and amounts to a paradigm change.

The Polish Promotional Forest Complex (PFC) concept was introduced in the 1990s. We analysed the emergence of this concept, its objectives and establishment, and its perceived outcomes on the ground. We conducted a literature review and sent out a questionnaire to all forest management units involved with the established 19 PFCs in Poland. The results indicate that the management in PFCs largely satisfied its objectives. However, in the context of SFM, this management was unbalanced to the advantage of the ecological dimension while paying little attention to either social or economic sustainability. This finding correlated with the SFM principle not being clearly defined in the policies for the PFC concept. Our results thus indicate that PFCs became neither pioneers in implementing pro-ecological forestry nor exemplary models for other Polish forests. We conclude that sustainable development as a process towards the goal of sustainability in countries in transition requires time and a change in attitudes among stakeholders that reflect both SFM policy and the transition from government to governance.

Even in the presence of academic tenure, workplace mobbing remains a prevalent issue in academe. This study develops an economic model that employs a Stackelberg differential game in order to analyze the interaction between a university administrator (or administrators) and a professor who is being mobbed by university administration, perhaps for political reasons related to the professor's use of academic freedom and/or tenure to publicly criticize the actions of university officials. One of the model's implications is that it is optimal for the professor to increase his or her research in order to increase job mobility when subjected to downward mobbing, and that the university administration may succeed in pushing out the tenured professor if the administration's mobbing actions are greater than a combination of professor's optimal salary and threshold quitting rate. In the long run, however, the institution and the administrator may lose if the professor leaves and his replacements do not keep up the research productivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This article analyses the extent to which this harmonization process is informed by regulatory and standard-setting guidelines drawn respectively from WTO jurisprudence and an array of relevant international instruments; at the same time, it argues that the fisheries subsidies negotiations can result in the WTO taking a more definite position on the 'issue' of environmental PPMs.","[Meliado, Fabrizio] UNECE, Trade & Sustainable Land Management Div, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Meliadò, F (通讯作者)，UNECE, Trade & Sustainable Land Management Div, Geneva, Switzerland.",fabriziomeliado@hotmail.it,,,,,,,133,4,4,0,7,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This paper explores the likely impacts of climate-induced changes on the provisioning of forest ecosystem goods and services and its effect on the economic and social well-being of the society, including the national economy and the livelihoods of forest-dependent people. The analysis focuses on four identified vulnerable sectors - food (NTFPs), energy (fuelwood), health (medicinal plants) and water (freshwater) through a multi-stakeholder dialog at national and regional levels. We use a vulnerability assessment framework by combining the elements of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to conceptualize vulnerability in these sectors. The identified sectors in relation to the forest ecosystem are discussed in view of providing an understanding of the sector's potential adaptive capacities for policy intervention. Our analysis presents the possible implications of the vulnerability of these sectors for planning local and national adaptation strategies. Local and national adaptive capacities to respond to climate impacts in the forest sectors includes: reducing poverty, enhancing food security, water availability, combating land degradation and reducing loss of biological diversity.

This behavior may be associated with central bank intervention.","[Garcia-Suaza, Andres F.] Univ Nacl Rosario, Dept Econ, RA-2000 Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Garcia-Suaza, Andres F.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain",National University of Rosario; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,,jgomezgo@banrep.gov.co; andres.garcia@urosario.edu.co,"Gomez-Gonzalez, Jose/D-2843-2016; Garcia-Suaza, Andres/K-9084-2016","Gomez-Gonzalez, Jose/0000-0002-7600-9699; Garcia-Suaza, Andres/0000-0002-9617-6873",,,,,38,6,7,0,15,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The second digit of the earnings reported as earnings before interest and tax, earnings after interest and tax, or earnings per share is found to occasionally serve as the reference point. In addition, the manipulation of earnings management shows a negative relationship between earnings management and investor stock returns. Such findings have important implications for investing decisions made by Taiwanese stockholders, who traditionally have concerns about the quality of a firm's financial statements.","[Wu, Shih-Wei; Lin, Fengyi] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Coll Management, Dept Business Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Fang, Wenchang] Natl Taipei Univ, Coll Business, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taipei University of Technology; National Taipei University,"Lin, FY (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Coll Management, Dept Business Management, Taipei, Taiwan.",swu@ntut.edu.tw; linfengyi.tw@gmail.com; fang@mail.ntpu.edu.tw,,,,,,,26,14,14,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

J,"Muraca, B",,,,"Muraca, Barbara",,,Towards a fair degrowth-society: Justice and the right to a 'good life' beyond growth,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CAPABILITIES,"A critical scrutiny is presented of the ethical assumptions of growth and degrowth theories with respect to distributive justice and the normative conditions for a 'good human life'. An argument is made in favor of Sen's and Nussbaum's 'capabilities approach' as the most suitable theoretical framework for addressing these questions. Since industrialization economic growth has played a key-role as an attraction pole, around which issues of social justice, political stability, and welfare protection seemed to gravitate. Accordingly, it is considered as a necessary condition for both intragenerational and intragenerational justice. These assumptions have been subjected to substantial critique by degrowth-thinkers, according to which economic growth is rather a threat than a condition for intragenerational and intergenerational justice. However, a theoretical underpinning of these assumptions is missing so far. In the paper I analyze the ethical and moral assumptions in both approaches by focusing on the theories of justice that are implicitly laid down as a background for their arguments (welfarism, resourcism, and the capabilities-approach). In a detailed analysis of the main critical points formulated by degrowth advocates I take the capabilities approach perspective and show why it can offer a more adequate normative underpinning for the conceptualization of a degrowth society.

J,"Sundmacher, L",,,,"Sundmacher, Leonie",,,The effect of health shocks on smoking and obesity,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Economics of Obesity; Economics of Smoking; Habit Formation; Discrete-Time Duration Model,WEIGHT-LOSS; IMPACT; RISK; AGE,"To investigate whether negative changes in their own health (i.e. health shocks) or in that of a smoking or obese household member, lead smokers to quit smoking and obese individuals to lose weight. The study is informed by economic models ('rational addiction' and 'demand for health' models) which offer hypotheses on the relationship between health shocks and health-related behaviour. Each hypothesis was tested applying a discrete-time hazard model with random effects using up to ten waves of the German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) and statistics on cigarette, food and beverage prices provided by the Federal Statistical Office. Health shocks had a significant positive impact on the probability that smokers quit during the same year in which they experienced the health shock. Health shocks of a smoking household member between year t-2 and t-1 also motivated smoking cessation, although statistical evidence for this was weaker. Health shocks experienced by obese individuals or their household members had, on the other hand, no significant effect on weight loss, as measured by changes in Body Mass Index (BMI). The results of the study suggest that smokers are aware of the risks associated with tobacco consumption, know about effective strategies to quit smoking, and are willing to quit for health-related reasons. In contrast, there was no evidence for changes in health-related behaviour among obese individuals after a health shock.","Berlin Univ Technol, Dept Hlth Care Management, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Sundmacher, L (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol, Dept Hlth Care Management, H80,Str 17,Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",leonie.sundmacher@tu-berlin.de,"Sundmacher, Leonie/B-7696-2016",,,,,,45,23,25,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

More than one half of China's exports are related to international production fragmentation. These processing exports generate relatively little value added but also relatively little emissions. We argue that existing estimates of the CO2 content of China's exports are significantly biased because production fragmentation has not been taken into account appropriately. Using a unique tripartite input-output table, we are able to distinguish processing exports from normal exports. Our results show that China's emissions as embodied in its exports are overestimated by more than 60% if the distinction between processing exports and normal exports is not made. Another finding is that each Yuan of value added generated by processing exports leads to 34% less CO2 emissions than a Yuan of value added generated by normal exports. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
