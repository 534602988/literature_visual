Hence, in addition to providing finance, monitoring and advice for small private firms, VCs play a significant role in mature public firms and have a broader influence in promoting innovation than has been established in the literature.","[Celikyurt, Ugur] Koc Univ, Coll Adm Sci & Econ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Sevilir, Merih] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Shivdasani, Anil] Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",Koc University; Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Shivdasani, A (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",anil.shivdasani@unc.edu,"Celikyurt, Ugur/Y-8756-2018","Celikyurt, Ugur/0000-0002-7136-4640",,,,,47,43,55,1,76,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Network effects imply that an improvement in a particular link in a network generates effects in many other elements of that network, while spillover effects can be defined as those impacts occurring beyond the regions where the actual transport investment is made. These two related effects entail a redistribution of impacts among regions, and their omission from road planning is argued to cause the systematic underestimation of the profitability of transport projects and therefore the public financing they require. However, traditional transport appraisal methodologies fail to consider network and spillover effects. In this study we focus on the spillover impacts of two highway sections planned in the city region of Eindhoven, located in the Dutch province of Noord-Brabant, a region with traffic congestion problems. The new road infrastructure will be financed mainly by national government, the province and the urban region of Eindhoven ('Stadsregio Eindhoven'), which consists of 21 municipalities. We measure the benefits of the additional links in terms of travel time savings and the accompanying monetary gains. The results show that important spillovers occur in those municipalities close to the new links. The province of Noord-Brabant will benefit the most. We also found important spillovers in the province of Limburg. This latter province will benefit from reduced travel times without contributing financially to the establishment of the analysed new road links. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Germany as a case study, 690 survey participants were each given one of four different fictitious newspaper articles describing negative effects of meat consumption - either in terms of adverse effects on human health, on climate change, on animal welfare or on personal image. The analyses show that animal welfare and health arguments have the strongest effects at reducing meat consumption in both men and women.

The repetitive trade tensions between Lithuania and Russia inspired theoretical as well as empirical investigation of a very actual economic political problem. Considering that the paper analyses the research problem: what tariff and non-tariff barriers usually are applied for Lithuanian export to Russia? The aim of the paper is to investigate the nature of international trade development between Lithuania and Russia from the standpoint of trade barriers which were applied starting 1998. The object of the research is tariff and non-tariff trade barriers which are applied for Lithuania's export to Russia. It is a key to stress that Russia's trade protectionist policy concerning Lithuanian products has more prohibition and power demonstration but not the internal market protection nature. The investigation is based on theoretical analysis of economic theory in order to provide arguments for economic benefit of removing trade barriers as well as to systemize the structure of existing tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. This structure could be used for further analyses of recognition of trade restrictions application in other countries. The European Commission's TARIC Consultation methodology of application of trade barriers for EU's export to Russia as well as methodology of World Trade Organization for trade profiles were applied for systemization of different trade restrictions. The empirical findings reflect international trade tendencies between Lithuania and Russia in the period of 2007 - 2012 and tariff and non-tariff barriers which were practically applied on export from Lithuania to Russia.

As a result, there is a number of methods and models for the measurement and assessment of intellectual capital today. Especially in industrial sectors with fierce competition, intellectual capital is a decisive factor for the competition success. Consequently, the methods and models for the measurement and assessment of intellectual capital should offer according insights into the interdependencies between intellectual capital and the competition success of a company. However, most of available methods, models and frameworks are explicitly for the external reporting of intellectual capital. It is almost impossible to comprehend cause-effect relationships between the intellectual capital and the competition success of a company with the help of these techniques. It is a debatable point whether the intellectual capital of a company is well described with elements that have possibly no connectivity to the competitive success of a company. Nevertheless, this paper deals with a model for the measurement and assessment of intellectual capital relating to competition factors. The model has already been applied in a pilot study in a software company. The following research questions were central for the study: What is the intellectual capital of a software company? Can cause-effect relationships between the intellectual capital and the competition success of a software company be comprehended? If yes, is it possible to develop relevant elements of the intellectual capital to increase the competition success of a software company? The pilot study provided substantial understanding of the intellectual capital and the cause-effect relationships to the competitive success of a software company. Even though the knowledge and the experience of the developers are important requirements to participate in the software market, but finally for the competitive success the strategies and the interventions of the management are responsible.

Then a concrete example follows, the conditions of such business relations are described from the viewpoint of a firm operating in the machinery industry in the South Moravian Region. As a result, several forms of inter-firm cooperation are demonstrated and the experiences related to them are compared with the ones from previous research published in academic journals.

The survey had the aim of gathering information on the state of art and practice in the field of disaster resilience and promoting co-operation and interdisciplinary methodologies in research and education. The survey has been carried out by means of a questionnaire focusing on disaster-resilience projects and on the main challenges faced in interdisciplinary working. The results of the questionnaire, which collected 57 answers from more than 20 European countries and few extra European countries as well, allow for three main considerations: i) projects involved 5 different disciplines as average and geography and sociology were present in the majority of the projects; ii) the level of interconnection between disciplines seems intermediate, meaning that information and methods are exchanged, but a full integration of methods and concepts into a common shared language and system of axioms is missing; iii) the lack of a common framework and common terminology represents a major barrier to good interdisciplinary work. The results highlight the role played in disaster-resilience design by social and cultural aspects, which are instead not often adequately considered in the practice. The establishment of an education on resilient design of urban system, which includes both social and technological aspects, emerges as a possible solution to overcome barriers to interdisciplinary work and improve the efficacy and quality of resilience design.

For this purpose, a GIS mapping system for Tyne and Wear, UK, was built. The system included topographic maps of the area, boundary maps of Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA), and aggregated census statistics datasets for LSOAs. Criteria relating to census attributes and the nature of transport were employed to identify 'hotspots' by GIS enquiry to provide suitably matching areas, which then formed the basis of the sampling frame. The research project was concerned with commuters' travel choices and so the study needed to identify commuters. In this case-study context, it is not possible to select fully homogeneous areas, so the GIS 'hotspots' approach allowed the identification of areas where there were a high concentration of commuters with multiple alternatives for travel to work. A pilot study showed that the GIS origin-based approach was good in collecting a balanced sample, as compared to an employment-based destination survey. This paper explores the benefits and costs of these origin- and destination-based approaches. In the origin-based home sample, households with paper-based surveys were targeted after identification by GIS. This origin approach requires more data preparation compared to the alternative of an employer-based, destination-based sample that could use online survey methodologies. The paper concludes by identifying GIS as an important tool in selecting a sample area for data collection using multiple criteria, but argues that plans for data collection need to be flexibly constructed to overcome unexpected challenges. Although this paper focuses on a transport research case study, the methodology presented can be applied to survey design and selection of sample areas in other disciplines.

Real-time displays at stops are expensive to install and given the current rate of Smartphone take-up, there could be benefits from using Quick Response (QR) codes linking to adapted, mobile friendly, webpages displaying arrival times of buses. This paper reports on a QR code implementation trial on 44 bus stops in six distinct areas of Southampton, UK. Each bus stop was fitted with a poster containing a unique QR code, linking to a website giving live bus arrival information taken from the Southampton traffic control centre. Two types of poster were developed (simplistic with minimal text, and a more comprehensive one) to understand what level of instruction was necessary for QR code use. The number of hits at each stop were monitored via the website and surveys of users through an on-line questionnaire (accessed via the QR code) and face-to-face interviews. The results suggested that there was very little variation in the use of QR codes at stops by day of the week or between peak and inter-peak times but there were variations by geographical area. QR code use improved wait time acceptability and feelings of safety and well-being with the vast majority of users finding the system easy to use. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, data collected by the authors from a sample of 11 large-scale rose farms in Kenya in 2011 (covering around 20% of national output) points to the adoption of systems that, in CT terms, combine industrial' and civic' elements.

Quality is not an easily definable concept. This paper aims to discuss the most common problems that make significant impact on the quality of innovation statistics and to propose an approach for determining innovation data quality. In this paper author developed a system of collecting and processing innovation statistical data and identified various problems of this process at the every stage of data collecting and processing. Author identified the following problems in the context of quality of innovation statistics: lack of co-operation between statisticians and respondents, methodological difficulties, lack of a common understanding and a harmonisation of the innovation process, difficulties to motivate enterprises to provide correct and accurate data, lack of understanding of the significance of the interpretation of statistical information as an integral part in the planning process of innovation policy etc. The quality of innovation statistics should be improved.","Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Jesilevska, S (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",mozir@inbox.lv,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,199,207,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500019,0

This paper presents some interesting results: (i) Contrary to the traditional view, social welfare can be enhanced by a tax when the time discount factor is low. (ii) Property tax causes the monopolist to spread production over two periods and increases the total stock of products, which enhances social welfare. (iii) The Coase conjecture fails and a monopolist produces only in period 1 and does not produce in period 2 when marginal cost is high. (iv) A mixed strategy of leasing and selling can be a unique solution, and a property tax encourages the monopolist to choose to sell even when the marginal cost is zero. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

On the negative side, the degradation of environmental quality caused by entrepreneurial activities requires serious attention. As such, sustainable entrepreneurship has been suggested as an attempt to alleviate environmental problems. However, embarkation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on environmental management is still not promising. Furthermore, there are scant studies in regard to motivation and propensity in the development of sustainable entrepreneurs among SMEs practitioners. Thus, this study was conducted to address the factors associated with propensity for sustainable entrepreneurship among owners-managers of SMEs. A total of 249 SMEs were randomly selected as the sample of this study and surveyed through self-administered questionnaires. Based on the descriptive analyses, this paper found that owners-managers of SMEs generally possessed positive or favorable attitude towards sustainability, concerned about social pressures on sustainability, perceived that sustainable entrepreneurship was attractive and perceived themselves as having sufficient ability for sustainable entrepreneurship. Furthermore, they also exhibited high level of propensity for becoming sustainable entrepreneurs. The correlation analysis revealed that all the hypotheses were supported. Specifically, sustainability attitude, social norm, perceived desirability and perceived feasibility recorded positive association with propensity for sustainable entrepreneurship. However, perceived feasibility recorded a stronger strength of association than sustainability attitude, social norm and perceived desirability. This paper also suggested that future researchers should employ different types of analyses and could attempt to investigate the actual sustainable entrepreneurial behavior among SMEs.

Rather than being viewed as a supportive industry to other functional areas previously, now, logistics has been regarded as a strategic industry on its own. In the Asia Pacific region, the potential for growth is very promising. Logistics has emerged from merely a supporting activity that facilitates trade to a crucial sector by which the nation's competitiveness is measured. In other countries especially highly advanced countries such as United States of America and United Kingdom, logistics had already become prominent and acknowledged as a critical factor of competitive advantage and the increasing importance is due on the expansion of the international trade as well as the globalization strategy of companies in their respective business and Malaysia has no exception on this particular issue. To make sure logistics industry together with supply chain management comply with the needs of current trend in the industry, they need complete support system and one of the system is the communication system. Effective communication system is one of the crucial elements in making a smooth operations in logistics industry. This study was conducted to explore key issues related to communication systems in logistics industry. Three objectives were set, firstly to find out communication method that practiced among parties involved in logistics industry. Next is to identify patterns of communication network practiced by the main parties in the logistics industry and last but not least to identify the current problem of communication channel used in terms of disseminating information to all parties in logistics industry. The research found that good communication flow and devices is crucial in logistics industry. There are certain devices are identified as must have in logistics industry such as mobile phones and the research also found that most of parties involved in logistics process can be considered as technology-savvy as far as communication is concerned. This research concludes that, communication and information technology is crucial for logistics industry, therefore those who suppose to provide right from infrastructure to human capital must cope with latest needs and rapid development in both aspects.

The aim of the paper is to outline differences in the socio-demographic and employment characteristics of Estonian people who have worked in a neighbouring country - Finland and Sweden (East-West mobility) and Latvia and Russia (East-East mobility). In a broader context the paper tries to provide some new empirical evidence based knowledge of possible differences in determinants of the East-West and East-East cross-border labour flows. The results of the study show that the consequences of cross-border labour mobility are twofold. Cross-border labour mobility can support economic development of both source and target country but also generate some threats of brain waste taking into account the sharp increase of lower-skilled jobs of people who are working in economically well-developed neighbouring countries. In order to achieve the expected win-win situation of the increasing international labour mobility, policy measures that reduce possible skill mismatches and brain waste and create favourable preconditions for effective skills exchange and return migration should be further elaborated and implemented.","[Paas, Tiiu; Kaska, Mart] Univ Tartu, Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Paas, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.",tiiu.paas@ut.ee,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,276,286,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500026,0

In this era of the knowledge economy, intellectual capital appears to be the most important competitive factor for any company. The measurement of intellectual capital can help a company to improve its business processes and competitiveness, among other things. Given the fact that the nature of intellectual capital is abstract, intangible, and difficult to measure, a challenge has arisen for managers to evaluate intellectual capital performance effectively. Despite the fact that several methods have been proposed to assist managers in this area, there is still a scarcity of approaches that are able to combine accurate data from financial reports and subjective judgments by experts, and that are dedicated to measuring intellectual capital in the context of choosing a set of the most promising new product lines. This forms the motivation to propose a method for intellectual capital performance evaluation in the field of new product development that is based on a fuzzy logic approach. Intellectual capital includes many intangible factors, and as a result, it is difficult to evaluate intellectual capital performance using only traditional crisp values. Therefore, an evaluation of intellectual capital is proposed according to linguistic variables used by experts. The proposed fuzzy logic approach applies fuzzy linguistic variables to express the level of qualitative evaluation of each intellectual capital dimension in the context of new product development. The use of the proposed approach can support the decision-makers in the choice of a set of product lines that are most promising, improving the planning and implementation of intellectual capital management, aiding companies in building their competitive advantages, and helping companies achieve sustainable development. The feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated by the result of intellectual capital performance evaluation for a sample set of new product lines.","[Relich, Marcin; Witkowski, Krzysztof; Saniuk, Sebastian; Kuzdowicz, Pawel] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Zielona Gora, Poland",University of Zielona Gora,"Relich, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Zielona Gora, Poland.",m.relich@wez.uz.zgora.pl; k.witkowski@wez.uz.zgora.pl; s.saniuk@wez.uz.zgora.pl; p.kuzdowicz@wez.uz.zgora.pl,"Saniuk, Sebastian/D-6371-2016; Relich, Marcin/D-3486-2013","Saniuk, Sebastian/0000-0002-9014-036X; Relich, Marcin/0000-0003-1193-432X",,,,,25,3,3,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,153,160,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000019,0

We further expand our previous work and argue that the type of knowledge (tacit/explicit) and the proper control mechanism play an important role for the creation of trust between partners and affect knowledge transfer success. Four, in depth interviews with presidents/CEOs of Greek companies with IJV participation, were conducted. Overall, they consider the transfer of knowledge from their companies to the IJVs as very successful. The results indicate that tacit knowledge is considered to be one of the major strengths of the Greek companies and among their most important contributions to the IJVs. Furthermore, tacit knowledge and trust were revealed as key factors to IJV success. Finally, our findings reveal that formal and clear control mechanisms arc positively related to the development of trust when they are established at the initial stages of the IJV establishment.

We explore the fundamentally different question of how federal grants at time period t affect state tax policy in the future. Federal grants often result in states creating new programs and hiring new employees, and when the federal funding is discontinued, these new state programs must either be discontinued or financed through increases in state own source taxes. Government programs tend to be difficult to cut, as goes Milton Friedman's famous quote about nothing being as permanent as a temporary government program, suggesting that it is likely that temporary federal grants create permanent (future) ratchets in state taxes. Far from being purely an academic question, this argument is why South Carolina's Governor Mark Sanford attempted to turn down federal stimulus monies for his state. We examine both the impact of federal grants on future state budgets and how federal and state grants affect future local government budgets. Our findings confirm that grants indeed result in future state and local tax increases of roughly 40 cents for every dollar in grant money received in prior years.","[Sobel, Russell S.] Coll Charleston, Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Crowley, George R.] Troy Univ, Sorrell Coll Business, Manuel H Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, Troy, AL 36082 USA",College of Charleston; Troy University System; Troy University,"Crowley, GR (通讯作者)，Troy Univ, Sorrell Coll Business, Manuel H Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, Troy, AL 36082 USA.",sobelrs@cofc.edu; grcrowley@troy.edu,,"Sobel, Russell/0000-0001-6820-5414",,,,,32,14,18,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2014,158.0,1-2,,,,,167,187,,10.1007/s11127-012-9957-5,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AA3FZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330979600014,0

It builds on Song, Storesletten, and Zilibotti (2011) who construct a growth model consistent with salient features of the recent Chinese growth experience: high output growth, sustained returns on capital investment, extensive reallocation within the manufacturing sector, sluggish wage growth, and accumulation of a large trade surplus. The salient features of the theory are asymmetric financial imperfections and heterogeneous productivity across private and state-owned firms. Capital controls and regulation of banks' deposit rates stifle competition in the banking sector and hamper the lending to productive private firms. Removing such regulation would accelerate the growth in productivity and output. A temporarily undervalued exchange rate reduces real wages and consumption, stimulating investments in the high-productivity entrepreneurial sector. This fosters productivity growth and a trade surplus. A high interest rate mitigates the disadvantage of financially constrained firms, reduces wages, and increases the speed of transition from low- to high-productivity firms.","[Song, Zheng] Univ Chicago Booth, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Storesletten, Kjetil] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Oslo; University of Zurich,"Song, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago Booth, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,45,20,22,1,45,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

This article adds to the literature by providing a complementary perspective of poverty between 1984 and 2011. We discuss the evolution of poverty in Indonesia using international poverty lines-$1.25 per person per day (in 2005 purchasing power parity dollars) and $2.00 per day, and we add $10.00 per day. We generate estimates of poverty since 1984 and make projections based on various trends in growth and inequality. We find that Indonesia has the potential to become a high-income country by around 2025 and end $1.25-per-day and $2.00-perday poverty by 2030, but this will require strong economic growth and favourable changes in distribution. Looking ahead, the end of poverty in Indonesia may mean that a large proportion of the population will remain vulnerable to poverty for some time to come, suggesting that public policy priorities will need to balance insurance and risk-management mechanisms with more 'traditional' poverty policy.","[Sumner, Andy] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Edward, Peter] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",University of London; King's College London; Newcastle University - UK,"Sumner, A (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England.",,,"Sumner, Andy/0000-0002-8995-7065",,,,,55,11,11,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

In this context, and after a certain time, the EU began a series of systematic changes and coordination within its institutional framework and undertook concrete measures with the goal of correcting national economic policies, and at the same time it also established the coordination, supervision, and implementation of (non)binding recommendations for individual member countries. The measures were applied to public finance, to reducing deficits in national budgets at the level of the Maastricht criteria and to encouraging structural reforms, proportionately to each particular member state. Since 2010, the overall program of these coordinating activities and their regular monitoring has taken place within the framework of the European Semester. On the basis of its full membership in the EU (since 1 July 2013) the Republic of Croatia in 2014 has been completely included in the regulations and obligations that arise from that program: from procedures to reduce excessive deficits over the next three years (2014-2016) to a series of structural changes within a special national program in the framework of the European Semester. What to do to fulfill the formal conditions and criteria, and moreover to raise the performance level of the national economy not only within the EU but globally, is the fundamental question and challenge that the Republic of Croatia is facing in the new economic framework of the EU.","[Vedris, Mladen] Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Dept Econ, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,mladen.vedris@pravo.hr,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,421,446,,,,,,26,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000031,0

In recent years, however, international and domestic food prices have risen considerably, partly as a result of rising oil prices. A growing body of literature indicates that world oil supplies will become increasingly scarce and expensive in the coming years, due to the depletion of easily extractable reserves. This poses a significant threat to agricultural production in South Africa, which is overwhelmingly derived from oil-intensive commercial farming. To mitigate the risk of serious disruptions to food production and distribution, the agriculture sector may require government support in the form of temporary fuel subsidies and, possibly, prioritised fuel access in order to cope with oil price shocks and potential fuel scarcity. Furthermore, to boost resilience and improve sustainability for the longer term, the agriculture sector should embark on a programme aimed at gradually reducing the reliance on petroleum products by adopting practices such as conservation agriculture and agro-ecological farming methods. In addition, since the current food distribution system is heavily reliant on road transport, and thus exposed to fuel price and supply shocks, the mitigation strategy should aim at a partial relocalisation of agricultural production and consumption, for example, by developing urban agriculture.","[Wakeford, J.; Swilling, M.] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Publ Leadership, ZA-7806 Hout Bay, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Wakeford, J (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Publ Leadership, 20 Riverside Terrace, ZA-7806 Hout Bay, South Africa.",jjwakeford@gmail.com; mark.swilling@spl.sun.ac.za,,,National Research Foundation (NRF),National Research Foundation (NRF),"The financial assistance of the National Research Foundation (NRF) towards this research is hereby acknowledged.

The simulation experiments show that the correct (data-generating) form can be conclusively discriminated from its competitors.

To the extent that bank depositors and creditors are even partially protected by public guarantees, we show that it is in the interests of bank shareholders to choose more risky investments than would be socially optimal, and therefore to design a CEO contract with excessive risk taking incentives. Thus, we argue that current corporate governance arrangements in the banking sector are not efficient. In this setting, we show that putting in place one of the aforementioned mechanisms could yield the socially optimal outcome at no cost. We also identify some limitations and potential perverse effects of these mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Because employees are motivated to exert additional effort toward better performance, the value of transferred ownership claims proxied by ESO expense represents a cost of generating firm value. There are several econometric issues, most notably including the fact that the disclosed ESO expense is an endogenous variable. Without controlling for the simultaneity problem, inferences based on results from OLS analyses may be misleading. More importantly, a considerable amount of ESO expense data is censored at zero. Such a censoring problem can make the population distribution severely skewed, resulting in estimation bias. Therefore, we need to take into account the censored data issue. No prior studies have considered these two issues simultaneously. Failure to control for both censoring problem and endogeneity could explain the inconsistent results documented in prior studies. In this paper, we use the two-stage quantile regression (QR) proposed by Amemiya (1982) and Powell (1983) to examine possible nonlinear relationships, especially whether conditionally higher-stock price (or better performing) firms show a stronger negative pricing effect of ESO expense (that is, the relation between ESO expense and share price) than conditionally lower-share price firms. Our results suggest that the linear regression model greatly underestimates this negative pricing effect at higher quantiles, so the nonlinear relationship is obscure when using the standard linear model. We also consider alternative interpretations as to why heterogeneity exists in the pricing effect of ESO expense and assess whether our results concur with these explanations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The frames may influence consumers' upgrade intentions and decisions as a result of their different perceptions of psychological costs. In two experiments, participants in the free gift frame assigned more (fewer) costs to the focal (supplementary) product than did those in the bundle condition; those in the free gift condition also perceived higher (lesser) residual value and were less (more) likely upgrade to focal (supplementary) items than people in the bundle condition. Moreover, the framing effect of sales packages on upgrade intentions was moderated by the promotional format (price discount vs. trade-in) at the time of the upgrade decision. The effect of the sales package frames on upgrade intentions became more pronounced when the temporal separation was short and usage frequency was low. These findings have significant implications for both theoretical developments and marketing practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Did these improvements mitigate the 2008-2009 Crisis? This paper brings the first systematic analysis of the role of three main efforts: consolidation in supervision, decreasing central bank involvement and improving supervisory governance. The analysis employs a new and complex database on supervisory architecture and governance for 102 countries and uses two new indicators to evaluate the supervisory regime: the Financial Supervision Herfindahl Hirschman (FSHH) and the Central Bank Supervisor Share (CBSS) Indexes. The empirical tests allow us to disentangle the relative effects of the supervisory regimes on macroeconomic resilience. We conclude that two supervisory features-supervisory consolidation and supervisory governance-were negatively correlated with resilience, while central bank involvement in supervision did not have any significant impact. Our results show that the conditions under which micro-features of the supervisory design produce automatically macro-optimal outcomes are far from identified, and consequently contradict what was the generally accepted view before the crisis.

Regulatory and legal changes can help traditional banks to move their assets off their balance sheets into the lightly regulated shadows and thus enable regulatory arbitrage through the securitized sector. This paper adopts a global vector autoregression (GVAR) methodology to assess the effects of regulatory capital arbitrage on equity prices, house prices and economic activity across 11 OECD countries/regions. A counterfactual experiment disentangles the effects of regulatory arbitrage following a change in the net capital rule for investment banks in April 2004 and the adoption of the Basel II Accord in June 2004. The results provide evidence for the existence of an international finance multiplier, with about half of the countries overshooting U.S. impulse responses. The counterfactual shows that regulatory arbitrage via the U.S. securitized sector may enhance the cross-country reallocation of capital from housing markets towards equity markets.

This form of trust, in contrast to arguments by Paldam and others, has value independent of experience. Using data from a survey of metropolitan Philadelphia in 1996, I show that if you believe that most people can be trusted, you are substantially more likely to see your neighborhood as safe at night even controlling for both the objective level of crime as well having been the victim of a crime, having had parents who were the victims of crime, watching local television news (which exposes people to violent events), where you live (central city and suburb), and gender. Trust thus reduces perceptions of risk independently of personal experience.","Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Uslaner, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",euslaner@umd.edu,,,,,,,25,20,22,1,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2013,157.0,3-4,,,SI,,629,639,,10.1007/s11127-013-0082-x,0.0,,,11,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,269AT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328213100013,0

The analysis is implemented on a panel of 15 EU countries, from 1970 to 2011.

After the Maastricht Treaty, there was a significant reduction in the impact of economic variables, especially inflation, on electoral outcomes. During the current economic crisis the capacity to control the budget deficit appears to be the main determinant of incumbents' vote shares.","Univ Minho, Nucleo Invest Polit Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Veiga, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Nucleo Invest Polit Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",linda@eeg.uminho.pt,"Veiga, Linda Gonçalves/B-6294-2009","Veiga, Linda Gonçalves/0000-0003-0160-9486",Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PEst-C/EGE/UI3182/2013] Funding Source: FCT,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),,,38,5,7,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2013,157.0,3-4,,,SI,,411,428,,10.1007/s11127-013-0113-7,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,269AT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328213100004,0

In one regime, liquidity shocks have mostly insignificant effects on bond prices, whereas in another regime, a rise in illiquidity produces significant but conflicting effects: Prices of investment-grade bonds rise while prices of speculative-grade (junk) bonds fall substantially (relative to the market). Relating the probability of these regimes to macroeconomic conditions we find that the second regime can be predicted by economic conditions that are characterized as stress. These effects, which are robust to controlling for other systematic risks (term and default), suggest the existence of time-varying liquidity risk of corporate bond returns conditional on episodes of flight to liquidity. Our model can predict the out-of-sample bond returns for the stress years 2008-2009. We find a similar pattern for stocks classified by high or low book-to-market ratio, where again, liquidity shocks play a special role in periods characterized by adverse economic conditions.

Furthermore, the welfare difference persists even after widows are absorbed into male headed households. An examination of individual measures of well-being further reveals that, relative to other women, worse outcomes for ever-widowed women persist through remarriage.

Changes in a commodity index, currency volatility and, to a lesser extent, a measure of liquidity predict in-sample the payoffs of dynamically re-balanced carry trades, as evidenced by individual and joint p-values in monthly predictive regressions at horizons up to six months. Predictability is further supported through out-of-sample metrics, and a predictability-based decision rule produces sizable improvements in the Sharpe ratios and skewness profile of carry trade payoffs. Our evidence also indicates that predictability can be traced to the long legs of the carry trades and their currency components. We test the theoretical restrictions that an asset pricing model, with average currency returns and the mimicking portfolio for the innovations in currency volatility as risk factors, imposes on the coefficients in predictive regressions.

Our evidence for the US and the Euroarea suggests that, during periods of high volatility, deviations from rational asset pricing are more persistent and spillovers between the markets are substantially amplified.

Besides of its visualization capabilities, the SOFSM can be used as an early-warning model that can be calibrated according to policymakers' preferences between missing systemic financial crises and issuing false alarms.

To answer this question, this paper sets up a dynamic currency union model with monopolistic competition and sticky prices, hiring frictions, and real wage rigidities. In our analysis, we focus on the differentials in inflation and unemployment between countries, as they directly reflect how the currency union responds to shocks. We highlight the following three results. First, we show that it is important to distinguish between different labor market rigidities as they have opposite effects on inflation and unemployment differentials. Second, we find that asymmetries in labor market structures tend to increase the volatility of both inflation and unemployment differentials. Finally, we show that it is important to take into account the interaction between different types of labor market rigidities. Overall, our results suggest that asymmetries in labor market structures worsen the adjustment of a currency union to shocks.","[Abbritti, Mirko] Univ Navarra, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Mueller, Andreas I.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Navarra; Columbia University,"Abbritti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.",mabbritti@unav.es; amueller@columbia.edu,"Mueller, Andreas I/ITT-1344-2023; Mueller, Andreas I/N-3400-2014","Mueller, Andreas I/0000-0002-1542-4960",,,,,36,5,7,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The authors argue that economic vulnerability and risky balance sheets are correlated because they derive from common factors. These factors include a low stock of human capital, inexperience (relative youth), and, in some cases, the legacy of discrimination in housing, education, and employment. Innate cognitive ability interacts with formal education and on-the-job experience to build human capital, while the legacy of discrimination may attenuate the translation of cognitive ability and education into human capital. Acquiring financial knowledge of risk management also requires time and experience and is more valuable to those with high levels of human capital and savings available to invest. Given the combination of these factors, individuals and families who are young, less cognitively able, and/or members of historically disadvantaged minorities are more likely to be economically vulnerable and to hold risky balance sheets because they lack financial knowledge and experience. Moreover, balance sheets of economically vulnerable families before the recent recession were especially risky after a decade of financial liberalization and innovation that increased the access of such families to homeownership and historically high leverage. Economically vulnerable families should avoid doubling down with risky balance sheets to enhance their future household financial stability.","[Emmons, William R.; Noeth, Bryan J.] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Emmons, WR (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,,,Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Washington University in St. Louis,Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Washington University in St. Louis,"William R.

The adoption of Basel Accords and the balance sheet leverage cap imposed by Canadian banking regulations did not change this cyclical behavior of Canadian bank capital. We find Canadian banks to be well-capitalized and that they hold a larger capital buffer in expansion than in recession, which may explain how they weathered the recent subprime financial crisis so well. This evidence that Canadian banks ride the business and regulatory periods underscores the appropriateness of a both micro- and a macro-prudential through-the-cycle approach to capital adequacy as advocated in the proposed Basel III framework to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector.

The implied excess Sharpe ratio is intended as an excess Sharpe ratio (versus the underlying stock) that investors can expect to enjoy from portfolios that include options and is a useful ex ante indicator that can be easily calculated. There are a variety of ways to include options in a portfolio, but we theoretically show that the combination that produces the largest implied excess Sharpe ratio is the best way to maximize the short-term Sharpe ratio. The selection process uses implied excess Sharpe ratio, which is easily calculated from stock lending fees implied by stock prices and actual stock lending fee. It does not require historical simulation or prediction of share price average growth rates and is highly transparent as it can be easily reproduced (at a low calculation cost). Hence, the implied excess Sharpe ratio is a simple but effective tool for investors seeking returns in exchange for a certain amount of risk that want to use the options market efficiently. The short-term Sharpe ratio is not necessarily the only criterion, but is a rational benchmark of portfolio performance closely related to criteria such as the long-term Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown. To examine the benefit of the concept, we construct an investment strategy that automatically selects from multiple candidate portfolios that are made up of combinations of Nikkei futures and Nikkei listed options the portfolio with the largest implied excess Sharpe ratio. Back-testing shows that this investment strategy performs well over the long term as well. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Economic valuation can help guide policy makers to understand the value of marine resources and the cost of neglecting MPAs by expressing the value of their goods and services in monetary terms. This paper presents an analysis of the economic value of a group of marine parks in Seychelles. The travel cost method is used to establish willingness-to-pay of international tourists for trips to marine parks in Seychelles from their observed behaviour. The average per-trip consumer surplus is approximately (sic)128 for single-site visitors and (sic)65 for multiple-site visitors. The total social welfare value attributable to the recreational opportunity in marine parks is approximately (sic)3.7 million annually. These results provide policy makers with a strong justification for government investment needed to maintain marine sites in Seychelles.,"[Mwebaze, Paul] CSIRO, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia; [Mwebaze, Paul; Macleod, Alan] Food & Environm Res Agcy, York, N Yorkshire, England",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Food & Environment Research Agency,"Mwebaze, P (通讯作者)，CSIRO, 41 Boggo Rd,Dutton Pk, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia.",paul.mwebaze@csiro.au; alan.macleod@fera.gsi.gov.uk,"Mwebaze, Paul/J-5905-2013; MacLeod, Alan/AAO-7539-2020",,,,,,70,13,16,0,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

It thus represents an extension of traditional political budget-cycle analyses assessing the impact of elections on overall revenue. We appeal to the opportunistic political budget model of Drazen and Eslava (2010) to predict the relationship between taxation structure and elections. Panel data from 56 developing countries over the 1980-2006 period reveals a clear pattern of electorally-related policy interventions. Taking the potential endogeneity of election timing into account, we find robust evidence of lower indirect taxes being applied by incumbent governments in the period just prior to an election. Indirect tax revenue in election years is estimated to be 0.3 GDP percentage points lower than in other years, corresponding to a fall of about 3.4% of the average figure in the sample countries, while there is no such relationship with direct tax revenue.","Univ Auvergne, CERDI, Ctr Studies & Res Int Dev, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Ehrhart, H (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI, Ctr Studies & Res Int Dev, 65 Bld F Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",helene.ehrhart@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,28,31,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2013,156.0,1-2,,,,,195,211,,10.1007/s11127-011-9894-8,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,164WW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320443600013,0

Internationally, the classical political economy approach to agrarian transitions has been challenged by positions arguing (a) that neoliberalism and the international corporate food regime have led to a new dominant contradiction between the peasantry and multinational agribusiness or (b) that the agrarian question for capital has been bypassed. It is shown that most analyses of the agrarian question in India, including those of Indian Left parties, tend to adhere either to the classical political economy approach, or their analyses are close to the peasantry versus the corporate food regime approach. In spite of this, it is here argued that an empirical analysis of agrarian transition in India lends credence to some aspects of the third position; that is, the argument that the agrarian question for capital has been bypassed.

Consequently, we inquired about the distance to these individuals, frequency of contacting them, and the mode of contact. Half of the respondents' social contacts lived within 15-min walking distance and the interviewed inhabitants contacted 98% of all people that they knew only by walking and meeting face-to-face. After examining the determinants of the size, density, and geographical extent of the inhabitants' personal networks, we employed multilevel analysis to explore the relevance of physical and social distance as well as personal characteristics for frequency of interaction.

Parent companies supply inside funds to new firms that, due to large investment requirements and low pledgeable cash flows, cannot raise enough external financing. The financing advantage of pyramidal structures is pervasive in many countries, exists regardless of whether new firms are set up by business groups or by smaller organizations, and is an important underpinning of entrepreneurial activity.

We build a simultaneous three-equation model exploring the determinants of industries' R&D intensities, innovative turnover, and profit growth, highlighting the complexity of relationships, reciprocal influences, and feedback loops.

It uses an Integrated Assessment Model (AD-WITCH) that describes the relationships between different adaptation modes (reactive and anticipatory), mitigation and capacity building to analyze the optimal portfolio of adaptation measures. Results show that the optimal intertemporal distribution of climate policy measures is characterized by early investments in mitigation followed by large adaptation expenditures a few decades later. Hence, the possibility of adapting does not justify postponing mitigation. Moreover, a climate change policy combining mitigation and adaptation is less costly than mitigation alone.

Two methodologies are utilized: the maximum likelihood estimation, and Ait-Sahalia's parametric specification test. While the results from the parametric specification test advocate strongly for specifying more flexible drift and diffusion functions, nonlinear drift structure often only adds negligible benefit in terms of the likelihood function value.

Usually the Romanian consumers place the price in the forefront of their service/mobile phone services acquisition, but an objective analyze of the quality of the mobile phone services has to take into account both technical aspects of the services and the interfacing services too. Therefore, this paper takes into account technical characteristics of the services such as national telephony coverage, data transmission services coverage, the signal quality, maximum speed of data transfer as well as related services such as distribution network, sales and support sales services, after-sales services, and range of available terminals.

Our findings suggest a structural difference between synchronized and non-synchronized trading hours.

J,"Guillaume, F",,,,"Guillaume, Florence",,,The αVG model for multivariate asset pricing: calibration and extension,REVIEW OF DERIVATIVES RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Multivariate asset pricing; alpha VG model; Calibration; Calibration risk,LEVY PROCESSES; VARIANCE; RETURNS,"Luciano and Semeraro proposed a class of multivariate asset pricing models where the asset log-returns are modeled by a multivariate Brownian motion time-changed by a multivariate subordinator which consists of the weighted sum of a common and an idiosyncratic subordinator. In the original setting, Luciano and Semeraro imposed some constraints on the subordinator parameters such that the multivariate subordinator is of the same subordinator sub-class as its components, leading to asset log-returns of a particular L,vy type. This restriction leads to marginal characteristic functions which are independent on the common subordinator setting. In this paper, we propose to extend the original model by relaxing the constraints on the subordinator parameters, leading to marginal characteristic functions which become a function of the whole parameter set. Under this generalized version, the volatility of the log-returns depends on both the common and idiosyncratic subordinator settings, and not only on the idiosyncratic one, which makes the generalized model more in line with the empirical evidence of the presence of both an idiosyncratic and a common component in the business clock. For the numerical study, we compare the calibration fit of both univariate option surfaces and market implied correlations for a period extending from the 2nd of June 2008 until the 30th of October 2009 under the two model settings and assess the calibration risk arising from different calibration procedures by pricing traditional multivariate exotic options. In particular we show that the decoupling calibration procedure fails to accurately replicate the market dependence structure under the original model for highly correlated asset returns and we propose an alternative methodology which rests on a joint calibration of the univariate and the dependence structure and which leads to an accurate fit of the market reality under both the generalized and original models.","Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Math, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Guillaume, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Math, Celestijnenlaan 200 B, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.",florence.guillaume@wis.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,24,27,27,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

In equilibrium, some investors trade on their own account, but others decide to delegate trading to professional fund managers. Flow-performance incentive functions describe how much capital clients provide to funds at each date as a function of past performance. Convex flow-performance relations imply that the average fund outperforms the market in recessions and underperforms in expansions. When the share of capital that is delegated is low, all funds follow the same strategy. However, when the equilibrium share of delegated capital is high, funds with identical incentives employ heterogeneous trading strategies. A group of managers borrows to take on a levered position on the stock. Thus, fund returns are dispersed in the cross-section and the outstanding amounts of borrowing and lending increase. The relation between the share of delegated capital and the Sharpe ratio typically follows an inverse U-shaped pattern.","[Kaniel, Ron] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Kondor, Peter] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",University of Rochester; Central European University,"Kaniel, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Simon Sch Business, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",ron.kaniel@simon.rochester.edu; kondorp@ceu.hu,,,,,,,51,34,42,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

It analyzes the frequency and length of walking episodes, categorized by origins, purposes, and destinations, and also investigates distance-decay functions for major destinations. The study employs day-after recall time diary and questionnaire data from the 2007-8 Space Time Activity Research (STAR) survey conducted in Halifax, Canada. GPS co-ordinate data enhanced the accuracy of location information, start times, and end times of the 1790 AT walking episodes, while GIS software was used to compute a shortest-path distance between the origin and destination of each episode. Home is both the most common origin and destination for AT walks, and the most common purpose is travel-to-shop rather than travel-to-work. Most walks are to non-home locations, such as retail establishments and offices. Particularly important are restaurants and bars, grocery stores, shopping centers, banks, and other services. All major destinations show strong distance-decay effects: most walks are shorter than 600 m, and very few exceed 1200 m. The assumption employed in the walkability literature, that one should restrict the 'neighborhood of opportunity' to walking destinations within 1000 m of the home, is seen to be well justified. However, a planning policy focus on the walker's home neighborhood is revealed as questionable, since the majority of walking trips do not originate from the home. The relationship between urban land-use patterns and walkability may therefore require some rethinking. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Critics, however, have claimed it is unproven, or simplifies the agency by which smallholders respond to risk. This paper presents empirical research in eight Karen villages in Thailand to identify how resource scarcity is linked to adaptive responses including livelihood diversification. The paper argues that autonomous adaptation is driven by how environmental change and scarcity present livelihood risks, rather than physical risks alone. Adaptation planning therefore should acknowledge different experiences of risk, and socio-economic barriers to adaptation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that internal capital markets transmit favorable and adverse shocks by affecting subsidiaries' reliance on their own internal funds for lending. We also find that the transmission of financial shocks varies across types of shocks; is strongest among subsidiaries in Central and Eastern Europe, followed by Asia and Latin America; is global rather than regional; and becomes more conspicuous in recent years. We also explore various conditions under which the international transmission of financial shocks via internal capital markets in multinational banking is stronger, including the subsidiaries' reliance on funds from their parent bank, the subsidiaries' entry mode, and the capital account openness and banking market structure in host countries.

The valuation discounts on opaque asset investments decline over the 2000-2006 period only to be followed by a sharp reversal in 2007.

Besides the usual efficiency-rent extraction trade-off, some specific trade-off between quality enhancement and cost reduction effort or between efficiency and selection deterrence must be taken into account. Under moral hazard, we show how a prospective price can result in the first best allocation when health care demand increases with quality. When demand does not depend on quality, the first best can be achieved only in the case of a perfectly altruistic provider. Under adverse selection, we exhibit the optimal contract between a regulator and a provider when severity is not observable.

This study employs newly-constructed product-level data covering 32 products and 49 host countries over the period 1993-2008 and finds evidence that FDI by upstream firms leads to additional exports of intermediate goods from the home country. The finding of a complementary relationship between FDI and intermediate exports from Japan runs counter to the popular view that the growing overseas activity of multinational enterprises could replace intermediate exports from a home country, thereby depriving the home country of job opportunities.

We find that solvent borrowers are more likely to default strategically when the bank's expected strength is low, although loan repayment is a Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium. Borrowers are also less likely to repay when other borrowers' expected repayment capacity is low, regardless of banks' fundamentals. We show that changes in expectations about bank and borrower fundamentals change the risk dominance properties of the borrowers' coordination problem, and that these changes subsequently explain strategic defaults. For the individual borrower, loss aversion and negative past experiences reduce repayment, suggesting that bank failure can be contagious in times of distress. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) has operated in the nation's capital since 2004, funded by a federal government appropriation. Because the program was oversubscribed in its early years of operation, and vouchers were awarded by lottery, we were able to use the gold standard evaluation method of a randomized experiment to determine what impacts the OSP had on student outcomes. Our analysis revealed compelling evidence that the DC voucher program had a positive impact on high school graduation rates, suggestive evidence that the program increased reading achievement, and no evidence that it affected math achievement. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of recent policy developments including the reauthorization of the OSP and the enactment or expansion of more than a dozen school voucher or voucher-type programs throughout the United States in 2011 and 2012.","[Wolf, Patrick J.; Kisida, Brian] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Gutmann, Babette; Rizzo, Lou] WESTAT Corp, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Puma, Michael] Chesapeake Res Associates LLC, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; [Eissa, Nada] Georgetown Publ Policy Inst, Washington, DC 20057 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Westat,"Wolf, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, 201 Grad Ed Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",,,"Kisida, Brian/0000-0003-0582-6162",,,,,47,60,88,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

We develop a theoretical model and examine the effects of institutional differences on modes of commercialization, entrepreneurship or licenses to established firms, as well as on probabilities of successful commercialization. We find that the US system is less conducive to entrepreneurship than the Swedish system if established firms have some advantage over faculty startups, and that, on average, the probability of successful commercialization is somewhat higher in the United States.

Throughout these transformations, an appreciation of governance is key to understanding the process. In recent years, seaports have undergone dramatic changes in governance as reported in academic and policy literature. The World Bank, for example, outlined a well-known taxonomy of major governance models. However, this literature does not capture of the specificities of local environments, or embed the changes in specific institutional and economic contexts. This paper analyses embeddedness in ports and their associated governance structures. We analyse and discuss (i) the complexity and the heterogeneity of the institutional framework, (ii) the multi-layered decisional chain, (iii) the geo-economic dimension, and (iv) the socio-cultural environment of reformed ports. The paper takes a dynamic view of port reform trajectories. We illustrate the theoretical discussion with a comparison of ports in France and Italy.

The traditional wake-up call effect of a crisis is muted by this numbing effect of deposit insurance.","[Karas, Alexei] Roosevelt Acad, Dept Social Sci, Middelburg, Netherlands; [Pyle, William] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT USA; [Schoors, Koen] Univ Ghent, CERISE, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Karas, A (通讯作者)，Roosevelt Acad, Dept Social Sci, Middelburg, Netherlands.",a.karas@roac.nl; wpyle@middlebury.edu; koen.schoors@ugent.be,"Karas, Alexei/IWM-4431-2023; Schoors, Koen/N-7059-2019","Schoors, Koen/0000-0002-4159-8083; Karas, Alexei/0000-0002-6149-1208",,,,,34,83,93,1,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

However, there are theoretical reasons suggesting that three dimensions of EO (innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking) may possess differential relationships with performance in smaller firms. This study utilizes a sample consisting of 1,668 small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in nine countries across 13 different industries to provide a finer-grained analysis of the EO-performance relationship. Specifically, we theorize and test a non-monotonic influence of innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking on SME performance. Innovativeness and proactiveness displayed predominantly positive U-shaped relationships with SME performance. Risk-taking, however, displayed a predominantly negative U-shaped relationship with SME performance. Further, individualism was found to positively moderate the relationships between innovativeness-performance and proactiveness-performance. Taken together, these results suggest that differential relationships exist between three dimensions of EO and SME performance, with important theoretical implications for future EO research.","[Kreiser, Patrick M.] Ohio Univ, Coll Business, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Marino, Louis D.] Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce & Business Adm, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Kuratko, Donald F.] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Dept Management & Entrepreneurship, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Weaver, K.

Mergers between funds with similar management objectives, as reflected by average portfolio book-to-market ratio, price-earnings ratio, beta and market capitalization values, outperform mergers between funds with dissimilar strategies. This superior performance transcends lower portfolio rebalancing costs which might be realized between merging funds which hold more assets in common. These results suggest that mutual fund mergers create collaborative benefits between funds with similar strategies. We also examine if fund governance structures influence the fund pairing process, testing if stronger fund oversight mitigates pairing mismatches. We find that less independent boards of trustees and boards with higher compensation are related to greater strategic mismatches between funds. These results suggest that more entrenched boards are more tolerant of fund mismatches which benefit the investment company, yet are not in investor's best interests. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this approach, first the linearity of the series was tested, and when the linearity was rejected, the threshold autoregressive (TAR) panel unit root test, which splits the data into two regimes, was employed to examine the stationarity properties of the series. Because the null of linearity was rejected in the first step, we tested the stationarity of the series using the TAR panel unit root test. In the TAR panel unit root test, we found that the United Kingdom was the transition country whose per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions determined the switch from one regime to the other. The results showed that convergence existed in the first regime and divergence, in the second. When we tested whether absolute or conditional convergence existed, we found that the per capita CO2 emissions were conditionally converging in the first regime.","[Yavuz, Nilgun Cil; Yilanci, Veli] Istanbul Univ, Dept Econometr, Fac Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul University,"Yavuz, NC (通讯作者)，Istanbul Univ, Dept Econometr, Fac Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",yavuznc@istanbul.edu.tr; yilanci@istanbul.edu.tr,"Yilanci, Veli/B-1891-2010; cil, nilgun/AAC-7286-2020","Yilanci, Veli/0000-0001-5738-690X; cil, nilgun/0000-0003-4732-227X",,,,,31,79,80,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Design/ methodology/ approach: It employed quantitative method in examining the said relationship against a real-life scenario of major change in a single entity of a Multi National Corporation - Repso Malaysia. Through on-line questionnaire, a total of 247 employees of various functions, job levels and cross border cultures made up the case study of this research. Findings: The findings of the research confirmed the positive relationship of conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and openness to experiences with sense of urgency. The trait of neuroticism revealed a negative but non-significant relationship to sense of urgency and duly supported with justification by the research. Research limitations/ implications: The paper addresses the limitations, first, the use of modified instrument lacks the established knowledge of its validity and reliability within the contexts of the case organization. Secondly, the researcher has no control on who actually responds to the questions. Thirdly, the research sample represents only single entity and cannot be generalized to the total population. Practical implications: Other than contributing to the body of knowledge over a subject which is empirically scarce, the research further renewed the importance of micro level analysis of an organization i.e. individuals rather than only the macro level. Originality/ value: The research prides its originality and ends with comprehensive practical recommendations for company in blending the elements of employees' personality into arriving to the desired state of sense of urgency to change.

However, little is known about the intensity of these emotional reactions and how they relate to other factors in the auction process. In this article, we present an experiment in which subjects participated in a sequence of first-price sealed-bid auctions. The psychophysiological measures skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) were recorded as proxies for both the intensity and the valence of emotions. Our results show that the deceleratory responses in HR when losing an auction are stronger than when winning an auction. The drop in BR itself can be interpreted as a reaction to stimuli with negative emotional valence. Moreover, we found that winning an auction induces a stronger SCR compared with losing an auction. Interestingly, this effect even holds for different value classes and different amounts of payoffs. Moreover, we show that bidders' SCR amplitude increases in the relation to the amount of money at stake. However, we cannot make a definite determination as to whether the valuation or the potential nominal payoff triggers this effect. We conclude that psychophysiological methodologies are appropriate for the measurement of rewarding, as well as immediate aversive emotions in market decision making, and even allow identifying fined-grained emotional characteristics.","[Astor, Philipp J.] FZI Forschungszentrum Informat, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Adam, Marc T.

Starting from a systemic approach of internal audit and internal control, our research intends to identify the synergies between internal audit functions and their impact on corporate governance quality. Moreover, technological advancement seems to have a crucial influence on internal audit. Our findings suggest that, by means of technologies' optimization, we will come to change the perspective of internal audit, which will require more sophisticated tools and applications. For this goal, we elaborated a conceptual model for the analysis of internal audit effectiveness hoping that the results of our research would open the way for future studies in the operational field.

We find major improvements in certain market access conditions and little change in others. There is generally low correlation between alternative indicators of market access. All-purpose indicators may not accurately reflect specific market access conditions of interest. Distances to physical infrastructure are often not representative of farmers' access to markets; changes in specific market access conditions may have more to do with the behaviors of marketing agents.

But the outcome of these projects seems to be far less than that was expected. The sustainability and the success that seemed promising at the initiation of these projects were never achieved even after the technology was fully implemented. One of the major reasons for this tethered success is the fact that technology was simply forced into their businesses instead of completely understanding the drawbacks in the existing processes or investigating new ways of utilizing technology to conduct their business. It is clear that there is a considerable lack of knowledge and expertise in the field of Business Process Re-engineering and that this is hindering the ability of many of the current e-government projects from fully realizing its goals. This research begins by emphasizing the possibility of further improving public and private sector organizations with the introduction of BPR.

Our results show a significant and positive effect for stock-financed deals in the cross-border acquisitions. This result is robust to a set of commonly used control variables in the literature. In order to find a justification for such positive reactions for stock financed deals, we investigate the long-term operating performance of cross-border cash- and stock financed deals. Our results do not show any significant difference. It appears that market is overenthusiastic about the cross-border stock financed deals and overestimates the synergy gains. Market corrects for this overreaction for cross-border stock financed deals in the subsequent periods. We carry out a detailed buy-and-hold abnormal return (BHAR) analysis to evaluate the long term stock returns for these firms. Our results show that cross-border stock financed deals significantly underperform in the long-run compared to the cross-border cash financed deals. Further, we examine the role of stock payment in mitigating information asymmetry in cross-border deals and alleviating the risk arising from making acquisitions in a foreign market with lower corporate governance rating. Our results show that stock payment is viewed as a possible remedy for reducing information asymmetry and lowering corporate governance related risk in cross-border acquisitions.

While many have studied factors which determine the business performance of family-owned firms, none has investigated how succession issues (ranging from authoritarian owner, communication problem with siblings, incompetencies, motivation to succeed, differences in opinions and decision-making power) and succession experience on part of second or third generation owner (2GO/ 3GO) could affect the links to the performance of such firms. The purpose of this paper is to reaffirm various factors influencing family business performance among sixty family-owed firms situated in Northeastern of Peninsula Malaysia, and establish succession issues and experience as the potential mediators which are contributive to the business well-being. The main data source for the study was self-administered surveys of fifty-five 2GOs or 3GOs, of three major races (Malay, Chinese and Indian) in Kelantan, Malaysia. Descriptive, correlation and regression analyses were conducted to interpret findings. The research shows that management style, relationship among family members, values and beliefs and preparation of heir significantly influence family business performance in this context. Succession issues are found to have partially mediated and succession experience fully mediates the relationship among the antecedents with business performance. Both theoretical and practical implications as well as avenues for future research are discussed.","[Ghee, Wee Yu; Bin Ibrahim, Mohamed Dahlan] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Fen, Crystal Yap Sheau] Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand",Universiti Malaysia Kelantan; Auckland University of Technology,,yughee@umk.edu.my; dahlan@umk.edu.my; crystal.yap@aut.ac.nz,,,,,,,65,1,1,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,556,+,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200057,0

A variety of technological, social and economic issues must be addressed and settled throughout these interactions in order to achieve an effective transfer. As interactions become a major concern in achieving an effective transfer, a research was conducted on a few case studies of IT transfer in Malaysia, with an objective to propose a different approach in guiding for an effective IT transfer. The research was based on an Actor-Network Theory that has a robust framework to explore and analyze human and non-human interactions.

The introduction of PCA in 1992 and TARP in 2008 constitute significant regulatory regime changes, and provide the necessary framework to explore whether regime-dependent risk-shifting or risk-taking is present. We find strong evidence of risk-shifting and risk-taking over the post-PCA regime spanning the period 1992-2008. We interpret this evidence as indication of ineffectiveness of PCA in controlling risk-taking and risk-shifting. The finding of risk-taking just prior to the recent financial crisis suggests that risk-taking may be a factor contributing to this crisis. As risk-taking and risk-shifting are important aspects of bank behavior (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2009), these results are of interest to bank regulators and important to Basel III.

Survey data were collected from 206 banking employees. Results of the hierarchical regression analyses postulate that both distributive and procedural justice are the predictors of job satisfaction and personality traits serve as moderators of the relationship between organizational justice and job satisfaction. Specifically, the effect of distributive justice on job satisfaction is most pronounced among individuals scoring high on agreeableness and conscientiousness, but low in neuroticism. However, the effect of procedural justice is most pronounced among individuals scoring high on agreeableness only. This research points out the necessity of including personality traits to better understand the impact of justice on job satisfaction and suggests that managers might apply different strategies for dealing with different personality traits to create an overall environment of fairness and enhance job satisfaction.","[Karapinar, Pinar Bayhan] Hacettepe Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Karapinar, PB (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",pbayhan@hacettepe.edu.tr,"METIN CAMGOZ, SELIN/ITU-7843-2023; CAMGOZ, SELIN METIN/I-8491-2013; Karapinar, Pinar/AAE-1672-2021; KARAPINAR, PINAR BAYHAN/I-8489-2013","KARAPINAR, PINAR BAYHAN/0000-0003-0534-8885",,,,,81,1,1,1,61,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Traditional economists describe a rational decision-maker as the one who takes into consideration only feasible alternatives which an individual ranks according to preferences and eventually chooses the best possible alternative within the budget. According to behaviorists the rational choice approach fails to reflect realities in many cases because it ignores such people's psychological peculiarities as self-control problems; limited attention; choice avoidance; etc. Behavioral theories have their own drawbacks though. Many of them are discussed in D. K. Levine's article Is behavioral economics doomed? the ordinary versus extraordinary. In general the author criticizes behaviorists on the grounds of wrong conclusions derived from experiments and blindness to obvious reasons for certain individual behavior. Closer look at the flaws in behaviorist approach found by D. K. Levine is given in this paper; arguments in support of rational choice theory are based, among other things, on neuroscience findings.","[Korlyakova, Darya; Horejsi, Bronislava] Univ Econ, Prague VSE, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,korlyakova.d@gmail.com; bronislava.horejsi@vse.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,13,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,679,689,,,,,,11,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100068,0

Recent work has shown that investment decisions by conglomerate firms are consistent with value maximization; conglomerate firms trade at an average premium relative to single-segment firms when value weighting; and the valuation premia and discounts, both for conglomerates and single-segment firms, are driven by differences in the production of unique differentiated products. A profit-maximizing theory of the firm that considers how firms select their organizational structure can explain these recent findings and much of the large variation in findings in the conglomerate literature.

For a long time till present, the role of economic activity was the maximization of production and revenues for which physical activities needed large amounts of materials. The followers of Bioeconomy warn that humanity will face economic and social challenges due to economic growth powered by energy from exhaustible resources. Confronting the crisis of resource depletion, human consciousness of the world changed: the future generations have the right to access the natural resources and their needs should be met by the development projects. The protection of the environment for future through the minimization of the entropy of individual actions should be the goal of environmental policies, laying the basis for a sustainable development. Environmental fiscal policy is an essential part of fiscal policy in the EU. Policy makers should design viable economic instruments for pollution control and natural resource management. Thereby, environmental fiscal policy will be able to promote efficient energy consumption in order to decrease resulting emissions and to generate environmentally sound products. Environmentally-related taxes, which are environmental effective, can ensure fiscal sustainability by achieving revenues and can have distributional implication. Thus, environmental taxes can ensure sustainable development, which is an ideal introduction to the complex relationships between the economy, society and the environment. Through this paper, we intended to present a review of the structure, level and trends of environmental fiscal policy and taxation in Romania and the other nine post-communist EU countries, over a medium-to long-term. Several countries from Central and Eastern Europe have developed environmental fiscal systems with an extensive welfare policies, although there were some uncertainties about the prospect of establishing a high degree of harmonisation among environmental taxation.","[Mascu, Simona] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Acad Econ Studies, Doctoral Sch, Bucharest, Romania; [Ciote, Cristina Steliana; Lipara, Daniel] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Doctoral Sch Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania; [Paraschiv, Gabriela-Mihaela] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Constanta, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Ovidius University,,,"MASCU, SIMONA/AAP-7960-2021",,,,,,8,1,1,1,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,127,134,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400017,0

It reviews economic literature on religion, both the modern tradition of economic analysis of religious behavior and the Weberian tradition of analyzing consequences of religion for economy. Two local applications are used for illustration. The first one is an analysis of religious participation in post-communist countries; the second one is an examination of the role of religion in the post-communist transition. Changes in religious participation can be interpreted, among other models, using a model of individual time allocation. This model provides a good explanation for the post-communist period. The examination of the role of religion in the post-communist transition indicates that Western Christianity provides better conditions for introducing free market institutions as compared to Orthodox Christianity and Islam.

The price indexes show a dramatic increase in both commercial and residential land prices over several years prior to their peak in 2006-2007 and a steep descent since then. These fluctuations have exceeded those in well-known indexes of home prices and commercial real estate prices. Because those indexes price a bundle of land and structures, this comparison implies that land prices have been more volatile than structures prices over this period. This result is a key element of the land leverage hypothesis, which holds that home prices and commercial property prices will be more volatile, all else equal, in areas where land represents a larger share of real estate value.

The parents of these first and second grade students and the kindergarten students were asked to fill in these questionnaires. A questionnaire prepared by the researchers and consisting of 76 questions was administered to the parents of the kindergarten students in order to measure their parents' environmental perception, 12 of which were prepared to measure the demographic characteristics and 64 of which were prepared for the perception measurement. In the study, the relations between the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the parents and their environmental perceptions were tried to be found out. Moreover, to what extent the parents put into practice what they know was analyzed so that it can be shown how the information acquired affects the behavior acquisition. In line with the findings obtained, the fact that the awareness of the parents themselves on environment and ecosystem should be improved so that they can transfer the proper actions and approaches they have internalized to their children was found out. Emphasizing the environmental education in every part of the life and providing this education through non-governmental organizations and the experts and the efficiency of the media in this regard were among the results. In addition, the environmental awareness studies should begin during childhood for the sustainability of the environmental awareness education and the media studies should be heavily focused on so that the socio-cultural behavior changes could be ensured in the society and the social media studies should be made.","[Ozyaral, Oguz; Ayra, Funda] Yeni Yuzyil Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kaya, Ertugrul] Okan Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Yeni Yuzyil University; Okan University,,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,387,392,,,,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400051,0

Development of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) concept can be understood as a response of society on the first problem, the growing demand for spatial information, respectively growing relevancy of spatial information for everyday's functioning of states, business and citizens. In Europe frame for development of national and European SDI's is given by European Union INSPIRE Directive, regardless to fact is some country member of European Union or not. This is also valid for seven countries in the region of Western Balkans, which have joined their efforts to solve the issues and develop their national SDI's in line with INSPIRE through the execution of number of national and today regional INSPIRATION project. Mentioned activities and projects are also dealing with second problem, the lacking knowledge about GIS, SDI, other modern technologies and managerial skills necessary for NSDI development. But, in the field of education there is no clear guidance, like INSPIRE directive regarding legislative and technical issues, so therefore the differences in approaches are bigger and issues requesting responses and solutions even more visible and critical. Past decade in development of modern government administrations supported with GIS based and SDI organized public spatial information in the region has shown that many issues are relevant for it. Those issues, structured in legislative, technical and educational segment, should be well balanced and interconnected to achieve synergy between them. In the segment of (geosciences) education there are several critical areas which require attention. Promoters of SDI development lack on information about stakeholders and users level of technical and educational preparation and their perception of SDI, stakeholders and users need support and additional education to become able to participate in SDI development, educational institutions need to participate in SDI development to be able to define curricula's and courses for all SDI involved groups, etc. Dealing with mentioned issues, this paper presents the current situation in the education referring to GIS and IPP, and describes the activities carried 7out for the purpose of creating the environment that would provide quicker and more efficient implementation of NSDI based on better information given to the subjects and users in the region of Western Balkans with emphasis on Croatia.","[Posloncec-Petric, Vesna; Bacic, Zeljko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Geodesy, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,,"Posloncec-Petric, Vesna/AAH-5856-2019; Posloncec-Petric, Vesna/AAA-7521-2019; Bačić, Željko/C-8741-2014","Posloncec-Petric, Vesna/0000-0001-6335-6942; Bacic, Zeljko/0000-0001-6076-8896",,,,,6,0,0,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,445,451,,,,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400059,0

Next, the author focuses on the field of road means of transport and presents progressive technologies of cargo transport. Among others, the use of longer semi-trailers (Eurotrailer, LongPlex) and EMS (European Modular System) vehicle combinations is solved. These vehicle-combinations bring the operator (road-transport enterprise) an increase of transport capacity and/or an increase of payload. They also reduce fuel consumption, environmental impact (in the field of air pollution) and external costs of road cargo transport.

To meet this goal, a comparison of edge production capacity that is based on the full utilization of animal waste and the possibility of using excess land for selected commodities in crop production (wheat, barley, maize, canola, sunflower, potatoes) with sustaining of 105% self-sufficiency for period 2002 to 2015 is used. Theoretical potential for biogas production is further converted to the possibility of producing electricity and heat for individual regions. The potential for biogas production from animal wastes and crop production in the Czech Republic (2012) is on the level of 2,252.62 million m3.

These trends determine the demand for products of the forest industry, which includes not only the demand for goods of the forest industry, but also the supply of services of this industry, i.e. sustainable forest management services. Latvia, compared with other European countries, belongs to the group of countries rich in forests; in Europe, forests occupy on average 33% of the area of dry land, yet, in Latvia forests occupy 50.9% of its territory. As regards the distribution of forests by ownership, the responsibility for the sustainable management of forest resources in Latvia is proportionally divided into two approximately equal parts between the national government and private forest owners. The JSC LVM (Latvijas valsts mai) manages half of the total area of Latvia's forests. Owing to effective forest business and the increase trend in the area of forests, the total growing stock persistently increased and amounted to 579 mln m3 in 2011. Given the above-mentioned facts, the research aim is to identify the role of the state enterprise in providing the sustainable development of the forest industry, taking into account the fact that, at the same time, the enterprise has to be developed. In the present research, the forest industry of Latvia was characterised, the performance of the JSC LVM, including revenues gained from selling its main goods and services, was critically and justifiably examined. To identify the possibilities of development for the enterprise in relation to the forest industry's sustainability, a matrix for internal advantages in competition and criteria of attractiveness in foreign markets was constructed.

Both studies disregard the costs of the pension system transformation, in contrast to the world literature and previous Czech studies. In addition, sensitivity analysis is not included, and some of the input parameters used are optimistic. A number of other input parameters remain unknown. Even without further analyses, it is so obvious that entering the second pillar is quite disadvantageous for the economy and the state. The opt-out is only effective for a small group of the wealthiest employees, which is also caused by the current construction of the public pensions. An optimal pension policy would comprise a division of today's public pillar into a solidarity pillar (financed from the state budget) and a public insurance pillar, in which old-age pensions would fully depend on contributions made to the pillar.","[Vostatek, Jaroslav] Univ Finance & Adm, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,,jaroslav.vostatek@vsfs.cz,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6159-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,304,313,,,,,,10,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA4GP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335696100033,0

A Monte Carlo Cash Flow model is programmed using @Risk simulation software. The model is programmed with three output variables: stream of revenues, profits/loss, and the resulting net present value (NPV) over ten year forecast period. The study finds that the likelihood of the NPV greater than zero is 63% on average. This indicates that the plant may be economically feasible, subject to model assumptions. Sensitivity and scenario analyses show that the NPVs were most affected by fluctuations in biodiesel price, canola seed price, and the price of seed meal. Indeed, over the long-term, feedstock price and biodiesel subsidies remain the major determining factors of profitability in biodiesel production. Historically, feedstock prices have been characterized by high volatility. The profitability of the biodiesel plant hinges to a large extent on the assumption that feedstock prices remain low and regular gasoline prices, especially petroleum diesel, remain stable over the forecast horizon. Moreover, the analysis assumes that the current biodiesel subsidy at $1.00/gallon remains in effect over the period of the study. Thus, removal of the subsidy would also render biodiesel production unprofitable given current feedstock prices.","[Yeboah, Anthony; Yeboah, Osei] N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA; [Naanwaab, Cephas; Owens, John] N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Agribusiness, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA; [Bynum, Jarvetta] N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Agribusiness Appl Econ & Agrisci Educ, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University; University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University; University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University,"Naanwaab, C (通讯作者)，N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Agribusiness, 1601 East Market St, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA.",yeboaha@ag.ncat.edu; cbnaanwa@ncat.edu; oyeboah@ncat.edu; owensj@ncat.edu; jsbynum@ncat.edu,,"Naanwaab, Cephas/0000-0001-8574-8349",,,,,28,13,17,0,11,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Instead, this debt bias creates significant inequities, complexities and economic distortions. These are likely to be larger than previously thought, especially in the financial sector. To tackle debt bias, the most promising reform is to introduce an allowance for corporate equity, as some countries have successfully done. Its main obstacle is a budgetary cost, estimated at around 15 per cent of current revenue, on average for a selection of advanced economies. This cost can be reduced by granting the allowance only to new investment.

In Germany, different from the U.S. and most other countries, turning a critical cutoff age does not cause a sharp discontinuity from juvenile to adult penal law, but rather implies a shift to a discretionary system of both adult and juvenile law, dependent on the courts' impression of moral and mental personal development of the adolescent at the time of the act. The German legal system draws the line of adulthood at some fuzzy age interval between 18 and 21, which is well above the thresholds prevailing in the U.S. (16 to 18 years, state specific) and other countries. Thus, the German evidence entails some external evidence to the previous literature mostly relying on U.S. data.

These twins have the same manager and similar performance but are sold to different investors with differing abilities to select and monitor managers. Comparing investor flows in retail and institutional twins, we find that institutional investors are more sensitive to high fees and poor risk-adjusted performance. Consistent with the reduction of agency problems from greater monitoring, retail funds with an institutional twin outperform other retail funds by 1.5% per year. After the institutional twin is created, expenses decrease while measures of managerial effort at the retail fund increase.","[Evans, Richard B.] Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA; [Fahlenbrach, Ruediger] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Virginia; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Evans, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, 292A Fac Off Bldg, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA.",evansr@darden.virginia.edu,"Evans, Richard/ABD-3431-2020","Evans, Richard/0000-0003-4631-0744",,,,,45,71,80,1,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The ICAPM places restrictions on time-series and cross-sectional behavior of state variables and factors. If a state variable forecasts positive (negative) changes in investment opportunities in time-series regressions, its innovation should earn a positive (negative) risk price in the cross-sectional test of the respective multifactor model. Second, the market (covariance) price of risk must be economically plausible as an estimate of the coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA). We apply our ICAPM criteria to eight popular multifactor models and the results show that most models do not satisfy the ICAPM restrictions. Specifically, the hedging risk prices have the wrong sign and the estimates of RRA are not economically plausible. Overall, the Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997) models perform the best in consistently meeting the ICAPM restrictions. The remaining models, which represent some of the most relevant examples presented in the empirical asset pricing literature, can still empirically explain the size, value, and momentum anomalies, but they are generally inconsistent with the ICAPM.

Our results suggest that information sharing by means of a credit registry does not affect access to or cost of credit, but improves loan performance. Specifically, loans granted after the introduction of the credit registry are 3% points less likely of turning problematic, representing a 35% reduction of the overall sample average arrear probability. We further find that the effect is more pronounced for repeat borrowers and in areas, where competition is weak. This indicates that information sharing among lenders improves loan performance mainly by disciplining borrowers to repay in their concern about future access to credit. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Taking into account a rule of default, we distinguish the default threshold from the unsustainability threshold. The former one corresponds to the upper limit to public debt; the latter one to the level above which, absent any further shock, the dynamics of public debt leads to future default. When this threshold is exceeded, the risk premium is high enough so as to generate future default, which itself feeds the risk premium. When a default occurs, the haircut applied on the existing amount of debt depends on the default rule. We show that a successful default is such that the ex post debt level is sustainable, which means that the ex post default risk premium is small enough and thus leads to a decreasing debt to GDP ratio. This implies that the haircut on public debt must be high enough.","[Guillard, Michel] Univ Evry Val Essonne, Evry, France; [Kempf, Hubert] Ecole Normale Super, Cachan, France; [Kempf, Hubert] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Saclay; Paris School of Economics,"Guillard, M (通讯作者)，Univ Evry Val Essonne, Evry, France.",michel.guillard@univ-evry.fr; hubert.kempf@ens-cachan.fr,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,12,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Value estimates from a pooled model suggest that the average WTP across Australian households is $21.68 per household per annum for 5 years, and that those values are higher for respondents with higher levels of education and income, respondents who live in Queensland, respondents who live further away, and respondents who plan to visit more often in the future.

The estimators and tests can be implemented for a single asset or jointly across portfolios. The traditional Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (1989) test arises as a special case of no time variation in the alphas and factor loadings and homoskedasticity. As applications of the methodology, we estimate conditional CAPM and multifactor models on book-to-market and momentum decile portfolios. We reject the null that long-run alphas are equal to zero even though there is substantial variation in the conditional factor loadings of these portfolios. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We do so by combining household data with population census and village survey records. Our results show that conditional on own household income, respondents report higher satisfaction levels when they experience an increase in their income over the past years. More importantly, individuals who report their income to be lower than their neighbours in the village also report less satisfaction with life. At the same time, our evidence suggests that relative wealth effect is stronger for the rich. Similarly, in villages with higher inequality, individuals report less satisfaction with life. However, when compared to the effect of absolute income, these effects (i.e. relative income and local inequality) are modest. Amongst other factors, we study the influence of institutional quality. Institutional quality, measured in terms of confidence in police, matters for well-being: it enters with a positive and significant coefficient in the well-being function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although these estimates are generated from different datasets, models, and estimation techniques, the values are comparable, such that the value of ecosystem services is greater than soybean rents for about 61% of the total area and 24% of the area where soybean rents are positive if protected areas are well enforced. Based on the balance between the benefits and costs of conversion, failure to value ecosystem services reduces total social welfare by 7.13 billion dollars annually relative to an optimum. Policy instruments that internalize the value of ecosystem services via protected lands, land conversion taxes, conservation subsidies, or excise taxes can avoid much of this loss. Regardless of intervention regime, policy makers should be cognizant of the diminishing net benefits of converting natural ecosystems to agriculture. Realizing the final 3.8% requires the conversion of an additional 15% natural ecosystems to soybean production.","[Mann, Michael L.; Kaufmann, Robert K.; Bauer, Dana Marie] Boston Univ, Ctr Energy & Environm Studies, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mann, Michael L.; Kaufmann, Robert K.; Bauer, Dana Marie; Gopal, Sucharita; Baldwin, James G.] Boston Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mann, Michael L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Vera-Diaz, Maria Del Carmen] Tufts Univ, GDAE, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Boston University; Boston University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Tufts University,"Mann, ML (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Ctr Energy & Environm Studies, 675 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",mmann1123@gmail.com,"Kaufmann, Robert K/I-4962-2017","Kaufmann, Robert K/0000-0002-5670-7027; Mann, Michael/0000-0002-6268-6867",,,,,35,12,15,1,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The paper highlights the importance of managing liquidity risk and creating a global financial system that can minimise regulatory arbitrage by large financial institutions. The paper argues that, unlike some industries such as the airline industry in which risk has been contained and yet the size and capacity of aircrafts have increased, in the banking system, less progress has been made to contain financial risk and allow large banks to expand their global activities. The paper argues that G-SIB are able to continue remaining large provided that a globally integrated financial system ensures effective global supervision of these large banks. The paper compares the US banking crises in the 19th century and the subsequent emergence of the US Federal Reserve System to the possibility of establishing a world central bank and a global supervisory board. Such new global institutions will have the capacity to reduce regulatory arbitrage, increase effective supervision, reduce systemic and liquidity risk and create a more stable global financial system.

The paper shows that they are particularly vulnerable to a banking crisis in the countries they export to. It also distinguishes between an income effect (during a banking crisis, income and exports to the country fall) and a disruption effect (a banking crisis disrupts the financing of trade channels). For the average country, the disruption effect is moderate (a deviation from the gravity predicted trade of between 1 and 5 percent). The paper finds however that the disruption effect is much larger and long-lasting for African exporters as the fall in trade (relative to gravity) is 10 to 15 percentage points higher than for other countries in the aftermath of a banking crisis. This vulnerability of African exports in the short run does not come from a composition effect, that is, from the fact that primary exports are disrupted more severely than manufacturing exports. Instead, the paper provides suggestive evidence that the dependence of African countries upon trade finance is an important determinant of their vulnerability to banking crises in partner countries.

The decentralization theorem predicts that the devolution of powers should increase aid effectiveness, since local decision-makers are better informed about local needs. Thereby decentralization may also have reverse effects, e.g., through coordination problems, excessive regulation, administrative costs, and local capture. We use panel data for up to 60 countries and find that aid contributes to economic growth in centralized developing economies. Whereas it is less effective or even harmful in decentralized countries. The cases of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Uganda support our findings. Our results imply that donor countries should carefully consider how the two development instruments foreign aid and decentralization interact. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This value is similar to that measured in another Brazilian city, Sao Paulo. The results show that, all other things equal, income has only a slight effect on the probability of being immobile. On the other hand, other factors connected with poverty, such as employment status, have a very strong effect. Inactive or unemployed workers and homemakers are the groups with the greatest number of immobile individuals. Figures are much higher in the poorer northern areas of the city than in the richer south. This strong geographic dimension of immobility is due to demographic structure effects, rather than neighborhood effects.

The point of view of potential passengers is fundamental for evaluating transit service quality as they are envisaged to be the real consumers of the planned services and can therefore be considered the most suitable judges. A stated preference survey of daily commuters to the central business district (CBD) in the city of Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, was carried out to elicit preferences towards the proposed Dar Rapid Transit (DART) service. Preferences towards the proposed DART service are considered to vary based on the residential location of the potential users. These preferences are evaluated on the attributes travel time, fare and comfort. A binary logit model was applied to establish utility functions that were analysed spatially in a GIS, where a utility value was computed for each spatial unit. This paper accordingly analyses spatial variation of transit service quality preferences for the proposed DART service using geo-spatial techniques. The study uses a scenario-based approach to evaluate the effect of the proposed DART service by comparing the 'without DART' scenario, a case representing the existing public transport (daladala), and a 'DART' scenario, representing the future proposed DART system. The results indicate that the proposed DART attributes considered in the study have a significant effect on DART service quality. The results further reveal that utility values are significantly varying spatially, particularly dependent upon distance to CBD. Comfort is the most important attribute in zones up to 5 km from the CBD, travel fare is more important in zones between 5 and 15 km from the CBD, while travel time is more important in zones beyond 15 km distance from the CBD. The overall results indicate that the DART is likely to be more attractive than the existing public transport system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we test the uniqueness of the US foreign listing premium by examining the premium achieved by foreign listings across a global set of stock exchanges. We highlight that the documented valuation premium for listing on US exchanges is not unique but common to many home and host markets including US firms that list abroad. The cross-sectional variation in the valuation premium appears to have little association with such cross-country institutional features as investor protection rules, law enforcement practice, or accounting disclosure standards. Rather the premium appears most related to variation in pre-listing valuation ratios. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We use this observation to repair the workhorse Stiglitz-Weiss model of credit rationing. Recent research has invalidated the distributional assumption on which that model is based. This paper shows that by adding the assumption that banks are capacity constrained, Stiglitz-Weiss rationing can occur again. It discusses how this finding can be related to the current policy debates on bank funding and credit provision. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Drawing inspiration from the capabilities approach and using household data from South Africa, linkages between assets and agency are identified by decomposing asset endowments' impact on future livelihood. By employing a method of path analysis akin to early heritability of traits studies, theoretical asset-based studies of chronic poverty are bridged with capabilities literatures. The interaction between assets and agency is shown to be as important as asset-to-asset complementarities. The results have wide ranging policy implications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Time geography is a useful approach for analyzing such datasets, as it provides a means for identifying the set of possible routes and stops for a vehicle between known locations, which is termed a potential path tree. This research extends the utility of the time-geographic approach by developing a method to generate probabilistic potential path trees that represent the space-time potential of a vehicle's movements. First, this research provides the mathematical formulation of the new technique, network-based time-geographic density estimation (TGDE), and demonstrates the computation using a hypothetical tracking dataset and road network. Its formulation operates as a network adaptation of classical TGDE, which has been previously employed to analyze the movements of objects travelling in continuous. Euclidean space. Second, network-based TGDE is applied in the context of analyzing vehicle tracking data collected by GPS and filtered to protect an individual's privacy. The method was used to map and quantify the vehicle's most likely routes, origins, intermediate stops, and final destinations. The results indicate network-based time-geographic density estimation provides a powerful approach for both geovisualizing and analyzing vehicle tracking data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the model, investment decisions depend on entrepreneurs' initiative to select investment projects ex ante, and financiers' incentive to control entrepreneurs ex post. Too much control discourages entrepreneurial incentive to initiate new investment, whereas too little control jeopardizes its productivity. This initiative-control trade-off is capable of generating endogenous reversal of investment booms, induced by an ongoing deterioration of project profitability. Investment fluctuations may arise even though no external shocks hit the economy and agents are perfectly rational.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Favara, G (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",gfavara@imf.org,,"Favara, Giovanni/0000-0002-7737-0128",,,,,54,17,18,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Household expenditure patterns measure intra-household allocation. The results show that female borrowers are better able to allocate their income toward goods more valuable to them and make major household decisions when their income increases.

This goal is achieved by introducing the notion of exponential-quadratic SDF or, equivalently, the notion of Second-Order Esscher Transform. The log-pricing kernel is specified as a quadratic function of the factor and the associated sources of risk are priced by means of possibly non-linear stochastic first-order and second-order risk-correction coefficients. Focusing on security market models, this approach is developed in the multivariate conditionally Gaussian framework and its usefulness is testified by the specification and calibration of what we name the Second-Order GARCH Option Pricing Model. The associated European Call option pricing formula generates a rich family of implied volatility smiles and skews able to match the typically observed ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using a simple model of cross-border mergers and acquisitions, it argues that the source of the volatility is important in resolving the puzzle. An empirical analysis of mergers and acquisitions by individual firms reveal that first-time foreign direct investment is discouraged by monetary volatility originating from the source-country, but can be encouraged by monetary volatility originating in the host country, especially when compared to domestic investment or expansion by existing multinationals. The regressions also reveal a large and positive euro effect on the number of first-time cross-border mergers within the European Monetary Union, even when controlling for domestic merger activity.","Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Russ, KN (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",knruss@gmail.com,"N, A/JUF-6197-2023","Russ, Katheryn/0000-0003-0997-8809",,,,,26,15,17,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Previous research on this issue focussed attention on passenger numbers to produce hierarchies of airports and traffic networks between them. The current paper adds to that knowledge by providing insight on measures such as the airlines and aircraft used to service cities at different levels in a hierarchy. Its core idea is that the arrangement of air services at cities reflects airlines' operations, seen via their size, the type of aircraft used and their mode of operation. The research uses a commercial data base that records a range of measures of air services. It applies that data to an established classification of cities to show the difference in the characteristics of services at three categories in the city classification. Results show differences in aircraft, airline size and mode of operation are apparent from one category of city to another. The results have implications for policy on the airline industry and airport management. As the approach is limited to a single year, and reports upon aggregate global results, there is considerable research potential in widening the analysis to include regions of the world, and also to explore changes over time.

Nevertheless, the investor ends up selecting portfolios within mental accounts and an aggregate portfolio that lie on the mean-variance frontier. Importantly, they assume that the investor only faces portfolio risk. In practice, however, many individuals also face background risk. Accordingly, our paper expands upon theirs by considering the case where the investor faces background risk. Our contribution is threefold. First, we provide an analytical characterization of the existence and composition of the optimal portfolios within accounts and the aggregate portfolio. Second, we show that these portfolios lie away from the mean-variance frontier under fairly general conditions. Third, we find that the composition and location of such portfolios can differ notably from those of portfolios on the mean-variance frontier. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

Importantly, this pattern emerges solely as a result of firms' strategic interaction in output markets. We show that the U-shaped relation between the state of demand and the propensity of firms to merge, documented in past studies, is driven by horizontal mergers in industries that are: (1) relatively more concentrated, (2) characterized by relatively strong competitive interaction among firms, and (3) characterized by relatively low merger-related operating synergies and restructuring costs.

We find that thrifts were more likely to survive the thrift crisis when their CEO also chaired the firm's board of directors. On average, chair-holding CEOs undertook less aggressive lending policies than their counterparts who did not chair their boards. Consequently, taxpayer interests were protected by thrifts that bestowed both leadership posts to one person. This is an important policy issue, because taxpayers become the residual claimants for depository institutions that fail as a result of managers adopting risky strategies to exploit underpriced deposit insurance.

These mechanisms, denoted as declarative and clock, are valuable because their incentive compatibility does not require strong assumptions such as risk neutrality or expected utility maximization. We show that, theoretically and empirically, with a sufficient fraction of nave participants, the clock mechanism elicits beliefs more accurately than the declarative. The source of this accuracy advantage is twofold: the clock censors nave responses, and participants are more likely to employ dominant strategies under the clock. Our findings hold practical value to anyone interested in eliciting beliefs from representative populations, a goal of increasing importance when conducting large-scale surveys or field experiments.","[Hao, Li] Univ Arkansas, Sam Walton Coll Business, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; George Mason University; George Mason University,"Hao, L (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Sam Walton Coll Business, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",lhao@walton.uark.edu; dhouser@gmu.edu,"Houser, Daniel/JXX-4326-2024","Houser, Daniel/0000-0003-3583-8201",,,,,42,23,23,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

The latter effect originates from firms debt rollover. When liquidity deterioration causes a firm to suffer losses in rolling over its maturing debt, equity holders bear the losses while maturing debt holders are paid in full. This conflict leads the firm to default at a higher fundamental threshold. Our model demonstrates an intricate interaction between the liquidity premium and default premium and highlights the role of short-term debt in exacerbating rollover risk.","[He, Zhiguo] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Xiong, Wei] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Xiong, Wei] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"He, ZG (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,"Xiong, Wei/AAD-9426-2022",,,,,,65,234,277,15,119,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Theoretically, the external agents capitalize on existing network structures, norms, and trust relations within a village in order to stimulate collective action. In practice, single purpose committees are often set up in communities with high unemployment and where people have no resources for successful collective action. This study aggregates household level data and combines it with a community level survey to provide evidence that a high number of externally initiated committees have a negative effect on aggregated trust and reciprocity within a community. This is caused by a stronger lack of downward accountability and transparency as well as coordination problems leading to unclear leadership. Further, a comparison between the old and new commons shows that because communities have different histories and thus different social cohesion and fundraising willingness, their relative advantages in the devolution process differ.

This study develops a simple political economic model to investigate the role of judicial oversight in the policy-making process for corruption deterrence, focusing on two dimensions of quality of the judiciary, namely efficiency and integrity. Our analysis explicitly accounts for the possibility that, while being independent of the political authority, the judiciary itself may be vulnerable to pressure from special interests. We study endogenous policy-making under complete information and provide general conditions for the existence of deterrence (zero-bribe) equilibria.

While there is plenty of evidence supporting the latter effect, there remains considerable controversy over whether public pensions crowd out private savings. This paper uses international micro-data sets collected over recent years to investigate whether public pensions displace private savings. The identification strategy relies not only on cross-country differences in generosity but also on differences in the progressivity or non-linearity of pension formulas across countries. We estimate that an extra dollar of pension wealth depresses accumulated financial assets around the time of retirement by 22 cents. An extra 10,000 dollars in public pension wealth reduces the average retirement age by roughly one month, which implies an elasticity of years of retirement with respect to pension wealth of 0.15.","[Hurd, Michael; Rohwedder, Susann] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA; [Michaud, Pierre-Carl] Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",RAND Corporation; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Hurd, M (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA.",mhurd@rand.org; michaud.pierre_carl@uqam.ca; susannr@rand.org,"Michaud, Pierre Carl/AAA-2357-2021","Michaud, Pierre-Carl/0000-0003-3114-4229","NIA NIH HHS [U01 AG009740, P01 AG008291] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,14,22,26,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Using observed housing sales from three Ohio MSAs in 2000, a spatial Durbin hedonic price model provides total marginal willingness-to-pay estimates for both characteristics of housing units and those of its neighbors. Using this revealed-preference approach, we find evidence suggesting individuals do value relative house size, but the absolute effect dominates. For instance, the estimates indicate that if all homes in Columbus were to increase in size by 100 square feet, the net effect of impacts on absolute and relative consumption would be to increase house prices by $605 on average. This stands in contrast to the stated preference literature, which frequently find individuals to be willing to forgo absolute well-being in exchange for relative status gains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The Government of Indonesia implemented such a policy as part of a bank restructuring in the aftermath of the 1998 banking crisis. Using difference-in-differences models, we find that strategic sale leads to a 12-15% cost reduction. These results are robust to the use of other estimators such as difference-in-differences matching estimators and stochastic-frontier analysis, to that of other performance measures such as return on assets and net interest margin, and to that of different sample types.

An appropriate use of reinsurance could reduce the underwriting risk of an insurer and thereby enhance its value. This paper complements the existing research on optimal reinsurance by proposing another model for the determination of the optimal reinsurance design. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the value-at-risk of the net risk of the insurer while subjecting to a profitability constraint. The proposed optimal reinsurance model, therefore, has the advantage of exploiting the classical tradeoff between risk and reward. Under the additional assumptions that the reinsurance premium is determined by the expectation premium principle and the ceded loss function is confined to a class of increasing and convex functions, explicit solutions are derived. Depending on the risk measure's level of confidence, the safety loading for the reinsurance premium, and the expected profit guaranteed for the insurer, we establish conditions for the existence of reinsurance. When it is optimal to cede the insurer's risk, the optimal reinsurance design could be in the form of pure stop-loss reinsurance, quota-share reinsurance, or a combination of stop-loss and quota-share reinsurance.

Utility mergers create wealth for the combined firm, consistent with both the synergy and collusion hypotheses.

We also find that the impact of mergers on consumer prices is consistent with synergy rather than collusion.

When investigating the hypothesis that AIDS affects skilled workers more severely than unskilled at the beginning of the epidemic, with the effect switching as the epidemic becomes more mature, the findings are that the economy can be 8% smaller along the transition path.

I estimate acreage conversion in response to shocks in sugarcane (a biofuels feedstock) and soybean (thought to be affected by United States corn ethanol production) prices in Brazil at a national and regional level. Using county-level data from 1973 to 2005, I consider a dynamic panel data model of input demand for agricultural land, conditioning on price changes of other commodities. The short-run crop-price elasticity of sugarcane acreage in Brazil is estimated to be approximately zero, whereas the elasticity of soybean acreage is 0.9 when both spot and futures prices change. The regional estimates for soybeans show considerable variation, and are highest in areas of ecological importance, such as the cerrado. Sugarcane estimates are more homogeneous. These results should be taken into account in impact assessments of biofuels.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hausman, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",calmirall@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,26,28,39,1,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We develop an algorithm to overcome this bias and use it to estimate PIN for nearly 80,000 stock-quarters between 1993 and 2004. We obtain two sets of PIN estimates by using the factorized likelihood functions in both Easley, Hvidkjaer, and O'Hara (EHO, 2010) and Lin and Ke (LK, 2011), respectively. We find that the estimate based on the EHO factorization is systematically smaller than the estimate based on the LK factorization, meaning that there is a downward bias associated with the EHO factorization. In addition, we find that boundary solutions appear with a very high frequency when the LK factorization is used. Thus it is necessary to use the LK factorization together with the algorithm in this paper. At last, we document several interesting empirical properties of PIN. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on the international literature on guiding and satisfaction with specific reference to guiding, we have constructed a questionnaire, subsequent to necessary analyses such as reliability and validity, and then the questionnaire, composed of different dimensions, has been administered to some 600 participants, thanks to the collaboration of tour guides and travel agencies. The results suggest that communicative skills of guides need some development. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It presents three main sets of results. First, the paper proposes a novel decomposition of the marginal cost of production that highlights the role of each factor input for the evolution of inflation. Second, conditional on an estimated interest rate policy reaction Junction, the paper demonstrates that no two structural shocks induce the same monetary policy response, even after controlling for the impact response of the real price of oil, and quantifies these differences. Third, the paper shows that the policy responses implied by a policy rule, whose coefficients were chosen to maximize U.S. welfare, differ substantially from the policy response implied by the same rule estimated on historical data. Among a wide range of rules, a rule that is easily implementable and that nearly maximizes U.S. welfare involves the Federal Reserve putting zero weight on the price of oil and responding to wage inflation without interest rate smoothing.

Furthermore, this paper also investigates the factors (quality attributes and household characteristics) differentiating these market segments from one another. Four separate steps were followed in an integrated manner in the investigation. Firstly, a representative sample was drawn for the Free State Province food consumers. Households are then segmented into smaller submarkets. The second step involved the use of principal component analysis to correct for the strong and prevalent underlying structure with respect to household preferences. In the final step, a binary logit model was applied to analyse the determinants of the market segments' food consumption. Five market segments are prevalent in the Free State Province, namely: Cluster 1 (34.7%) - inferior-product consumers; Cluster 2 (23.6%) - at-home (basics) consumers; Cluster 3 (26.6%) - balanced consumers; Cluster 4 (12.3%) - value-added-oriented consumers, and Cluster 5 (2.6%) - high-frequency consumers (broad product range). The final logit model that was applied consisted broadly of economic and non-economic variables. The results show that significant differences prevail amongst the five market segments, for both economic and non-economic variables included in the model. Producers, marketers and other participants in the food value chain can use this as a basis from which appropriate marketing strategies could be developed, formalised and implemented.","[Botha, F.; Taljaard, P.; Alemu, Z.; Jooste, A.; Pelser, A.] Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Botha, F (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",ferdieb@idc.co.za; taljaapr@ufs.ac.za; ZerihunA@dbsa.org; andre@namc.co.za; pelseraj@ufs.ac.za,"Pelser, André J/JBJ-0380-2023",,National Research Foundation (NRF) [TTK 2006062400001],National Research Foundation (NRF),"Financial assistance provided by the National Research Foundation (NRF), Thuthuka programme: TTK 2006062400001, is gratefully acknowledged.

We find that the spot exchange rate and 5-year swap rates respond by a similar magnitude to monetary surprises, implying there is little response of the forward exchange rate to this type of news. In contrast, the spot exchange rate responds by nearly three times as much as 5-year interest rates to CPI and GDP surprises, implying that forward rates appreciate to higher than expected CPI or GDP news. This is in contrast to standard theoretical models and US evidence. Lastly, we show that exchange rates but not interest rates respond to current account news.

After analyzing how best to fill this gap, a commitment was made to build a highly customized, internal education program using lecture, case study and project-based learning processes. Developing staff management skills, increasing loyalty and empowering complex decision-making have been some of the rewards realized from this commitment.

A stochastic frontier analysis was used to measure the TE and three methods in each cultivation stage were assessed. The data analyzed in this study were collected during a survey that covered the crop year of 2009 in two climatic regions. There was a great variation in the levels of efficiency, which ranged from 0.15 to 0.99 with a mean of 0.67. The mechanization index ranged from 0.06 to 0.52, showing a high variation in the application of farm machinery for rice production. The correlation between the mechanization index and TE strongly demonstrated the impact of mechanization on the efficiency of rice producers. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In our constructed trade models, the intervention effects comprise direct and interactive phases, and their overall effects are diverse. Empirical results show that intervention actions actually create the largest trade advantage for China in the China-japan case followed by the China-US case creating the next largest trade advantage for China. However, the trade balance is worsened in the China-European Unit case and in the China-Taiwan case. Considering the J-curve effect and the negative interactive effect in the China-European Unit case, the rate of the Chinese renminbi against the euro is not an appropriate intervention object for China.

The results suggest that earnings levels, both scaled and unsealed, have value relevancy on the Serbian capital market.

Instead, a firm's cost of capital is governed solely by the average precision of investors' information. With imperfect competition, however, information asymmetry affects the cost of capital even after controlling for investors' average precision. In other words, the capital market's degree of competition plays a critical role for the relation between information asymmetry and the cost of capital.

The paper applies the Bayesian Maximum Likelihood estimation to a small open economy model, proposed by Lubik and Schorfheide (2007). The study examines whether or not the Bank of Thailand (BOT) considers exchange rate movement, which is uncertain, in setting the policy rate. The paper considers various types of the Taylor rule: contemporaneous, backward-looking and forward-looking. The main finding is that the BOT responds to the exchange rate movement. The contemporaneous rule responding to the nominal exchange rate movement well characterizes the policy rate set by the BOT. The BOT focuses more on the contemporaneous economic condition than the lag of interest rate. Specifically, the rule illustrates that the BOT follows the Taylor principle, with on average the inflation-response coefficient is 1.515. Also, the BOT puts more weight on exchange rate stabilization relative to the output stabilization. Thus, the BOT has implemented flexible IT policy with exchange rate concern. (C) 2012 The Authors.

Currencies of the CEE countries are traded in the same basket and their ratings often move together. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the degree of heterogeneity across the Central and Eastern Europe in terms of financial stability. To analyse the main channels affecting the financial stability we include both quantitative variables and non-financial channels covering the behaviour or position of governments, households, enterprises, banking sectors, central banks and regulators. We conclude that even a very simple analysis and presentation of stylised facts confirms the inherent fallacy of aggregated financial stability considerations for CEE countries.

The concept of state gains a rejection out of the philosophies of natural harmony, as in the civil disobedience (Henry David Thoreau, 1849). Recently there emerged an antagonism between the state and markets given the fact that in the political economy of neoliberal framework states make use of markets for political gains while markets tries to accumulate at the cost of wellbeing. The frequenting financial crises, reducing supply of vital natural resources and the inability of markets to arbitrate demand and supplies envisage a greater role for the states in both industrialized and less developed countries. In the case of oil, the failure of private oil companies to balance between the national interests and profits lead to the nationalization of oil resources. Further the politicization of oil resources led to nationalization of oil companies in much of the west-Asian producer countries. Simultaneously the recipient nations of oil too found it imperative to establish public sector oil companies to meet the strategic requirements as well as to stabilize domestic markets. Market imperfections and the scope of differential and scarcity rent make it risky for states to leave oil resources to markets. Oil therefore becomes the most powerful source of state capitalism for its potential spill over into other resource based sectors in an expansionary framework. The dominating state role in oil and other industrial sectors however is expected to face growth constrains in the long run. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we employ bivariate choice models to investigate firm-level decision-making on foreign outsourcing and insourcing strategies. Analyzing Korean firm-level data, we find a possible complementarity between the two strategies and that a firm's choice of multiple sourcing strategies is related to its expected gains from increased bargaining power, reduced price risk in purchasing inputs, and costs saved in the production process. Furthermore, our empirical results reveal distinctive roles of various firm-specific characteristics in determining the two foreign sourcing strategies adopted by Korean manufacturing firms. J.

This paper analyzes community-managed water supply projects for the urban poor in Madhya Pradesh, India, to provide a better understanding of the gap between women's motivation to participate and their ability or agency to do so. It highlights how bridging this gap could be pivotal in strengthening women's role in water governance. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An online survey was administered to a sample of annual members of Australia's two bikeshare programs based in Brisbane and Melbourne, to assess motivations for joining the schemes. Non-members of the programs were also sampled in order to identify current barriers to joining bikeshare. Spatial analysis from Brisbane revealed residential and work locations of non-members were more geographically dispersed than for bikeshare members. An analysis of bikeshare usage in Melbourne showed a strong relationship between docking stations in areas with relatively less accessible public transit opportunities. The most influential barriers to bikeshare use related to motorized travel being too convenient and docking stations not being sufficiently close to home, work and other frequented destinations. The findings suggest that bikeshare programs may attract increased membership by ensuring travel times are competitive with motorized travel, for example through efficient bicycle routing and priority progression and, by expanding docking station locations, and by increasing the level of convenience associated with scheme use. Convenience considerations may include strategic location of docking stations, ease of signing up and integration with public transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to traditional empirical work that allocates the benefit of tax exemption only to current holders of tax-exempt bonds based on current interest rates, we incorporate the fact that the existence of tax exemption causes the taxable interest rate to rise and the tax-exempt rate to fall. As a consequence, on the sources side, tax exemption can increase after-tax income for holders of both taxable and tax-exempt bonds. On the uses side, consumers of both private and public goods are affected by the higher cost of funds to private and federal government borrowers, the lower cost of funds to state and local borrowers, and the lower cost of funds to private-sector entities with access to the proceeds of tax-exempt borrowing. Overall, higher income individuals remain the primary beneficiaries of tax exemption on the sources side with this new approach, but less so than under the traditional approach. On the uses side, households who consume a relatively large share of state and local public services, such as those with several school-age children, receive significant net benefits.","[Galper, Harvey; Rueben, Kim; Auxier, Richard] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Eng, Amanda] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA",Urban Institute; Cornell University,"Galper, H (通讯作者)，Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",hgalper@urban.org; krueben@urban.org; rauxier@urban.org; are54@cornell.edu,,,,,,,21,4,8,0,7,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The employer has private information about firm profitability, proposes a wage and a bonus, and can outsource part of the production, in each period. The union can either go on strike or reduce the worker's effort (i.e., decide a slowdown or work-to-rule) as a response to a low wage or a low bonus. We construct perfect public equilibria in which strikes (or slowdown) appear randomly on the equilibrium path, during finite-duration spells triggered by the occurrence of a low-profitability state. Equilibria exhibit money-burning (i.e., conflict) and wage-compression as in the recent literature on relational contracts; they are first-best inefficient. We discuss empirical implications of the model and applications to the public sector. Paris dustmen are taken as an illustration. An important advantage of our theory is that it allows for equilibrium regime changes, induced by changes in the environment. Following a drop in outsourcing costs, strikes may disappear and be replaced by other forms of conflict that are less easily observable. This has consequences for the empirical work on strikes.

We find that the same phenomenon also holds for consumers' perceptions regarding attributes associated with genetically modified (GM) products. When given information on health (nutrients) and water use of certain crops, consumers reduce their quality perceptions compared to the situation wherein they are given only health or only water use information. In addition to replicating the findings on this phenomenon in another product category - that of GM products - we extend the theory by showing that multi-attribute information results in lower perceptions of attributes in addition to deflated total evaluation. This finding provides another explanation of consumers' resistance to GM products beyond risk and negative predisposition. Our findings can be used to guide policy makers in designing educational campaigns.","[Heiman, Amir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Heiman, Amir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Agr Econ Res, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Heiman, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, POB 12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",amir.heiman@mail.huji.ac.il,"heiman, Amir/S-1377-2016","heiman, Amir/0000-0002-8469-5211",,,,,63,5,5,1,29,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

This paper offers a solution to this disagreement, suggesting that Volatility carries not only a positive direct effect, but also a negative indirect effect, operating through the insurance mechanism of government size. Theoretically, the net growth effect of volatility is then ambiguous. The paper reveals the underlying endogeneity of government size in a balanced panel of 90 countries from 1961 to 2010. In practice, the negative indirect channel dominates in democracies, but with less power to choose public services in autocratic regimes the positive direct effect takes over. Consequently, volatile growth rates are detrimental to growth in democracies, but beneficial to growth in autocracies. The empirical results suggest that a one standard deviation increase of volatility lowers growth by up to 0.52 percentage points in a democracy, but raises growth by 1.66 percentage points in a total autocracy. These findings point to a crucial intermediating role of governments in the relationship between volatility and growth. Both the size of the public sector and the regime form assume key roles.

While the RBA's rate rises exert a one-to-one and instantaneous impact on the loan rate, its rate cuts are only slowly and partially passed onto small businesses with a delay of 1-2 months. The results also suggest that the recent global financial crisis increased the cost of borrowing for small businesses in Australia by 2.21 %.

Economists only recently started to incorporate these arguments in theoretical models of heterogeneous firms and to test the implications of these models econometrically with firm-level data. Starting with the pioneering study by Greenaway, Guariglia, and Kneller (Journal of International Economics, 2007), a growing number of empirical papers looked at the links between financial constraints and export activities using data at the level of the firm. This article presents a tabular survey of 32 empirical studies that cover 14 different countries plus five multi-country studies. The big picture can be summarized as follows: financial constraints are important for the export decisions of firms: exporting firms are less financially constrained than non-exporting firms. Studies that look at the direction of this link usually report that less constrained firms self-select into exporting, but that exporting does not improve financial health of firms. The article argues that the results at hand should not be considered as stylized facts that can guide policy makers in an evidence-based way and suggests a strategy to further improve our knowledge in this area.","[Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wagner, Joachim] CESIS, Stockholm, Sweden",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020; Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536",,,,,48,39,40,1,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The strategic planning is seen as one approach that could help hotel managers to bust their hotel performance and to obtain a competitive advantage against the other hotels. This paper addresses the issue of strategic management in the hotel industry through a survey designed to identify the strategic practices that hotels from the North-Western part of Romania are using. The research study was based on a questionnaire that was administered to 65 key decision makers from the hotel industry in five large cities. The aim of the study was to offer a real picture of the strategic approaches that are implemented within the hotel industry. The study uses 25 statements that largely correspond to some of the most-cited strategic practices within the strategic management tourism literature. The hotels that took part in the study focused mainly on implementing the differentiation and innovation strategy. The ANOVA test showed that there are significant differences between the way in which these strategies are pursued according to several characteristics of the hotels (size, category and management type). The results offer valuable and consistent insights for both hotel managers who wish to develop better strategies and theoreticians who are interested in filling in the existing gap from the hotel literature.","[Bordean, Ovidiu-Niculae; Borza, Anca] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Bordean, ON (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",ovidiu.bordean@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Bordean, Ovidiu/ABA-3492-2020",,,,,,37,3,3,0,25,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1238,1252,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900015,0

Our results suggest that voluntary conservation increases substantially when water is scarce and the public value of the savings is greatest.

We use PIAT-Math scores as a measure of attainment and show that both the mothers' work and welfare use benefit children on average. Our simulation of a policy that combines a time limit with work requirement reduces the use of welfare and increases employment significantly. These changes in turn significantly increase children's cognitive attainment. This implies that the welfare reform was not only successful in achieving its stated goals, but was also beneficial to welfare children's outcomes. In another policy simulation, we show that increasing work incentives for welfare population by exempting labor income from welfare tax can be a very successful policy with some additional benefits for children's outcomes. Finally, a counterfactual with an extended maternal leave policy significantly reduces employment and has negative, though economically insignificant, impact on cognitive outcomes.","[Chyi, Hau] Univ Chicago, Natl Opin Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Chyi, Hau] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Ozturk, Orgul Demet] Univ S Carolina, Dept Econ, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Zhang, Weilong] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Pennsylvania,"Chyi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Natl Opin Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",hauchyi@gmail.com; odoz-turk@moore.sc.edu; weilongz@sas.upenn.edu,"Ozturk, Orgul/ACY-8203-2022",,,,,,33,0,0,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Property managers may have private incentives to control invasive species despite not having sufficient incentive to fully internalize the external costs of their role in spreading the invasion. Each property manager has a right to future use of his own property, but his property may abut others' properties enabling spread of an invasive species. The incentives for a foresighted property manager to control invasive species have received little attention. We consider the efforts of a foresighted property manager who has rights to future use of a property and has the ability to engage in repeated, discrete control activities. We find that higher rates of dispersal, associated with proximity to neighboring properties, reduce the private incentives for control. Controlling species at one location provides incentives to control at a neighboring location. Control at neighboring locations are strategic complements and coupled with spatial heterogeneity lead to a weaker-link public good problem, in which each property owner is unable to fully appropriate the benefits of his own control activity. Future-use rights and private costs suggest that there is scope for a series of Coase-like exchanges to internalize much of the costs associated with species invasion. Pigouvian taxes on invasive species potentially have qualitatively perverse behavioral effects. A tax with a strong income effect (e.g., failure of effective revenue recycling) can reduce the value of property assets and diminish the incentive to manage insects on one's own property.","[Fenichel, Eli P.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Richards, Timothy J.] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness & Resource Management, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Shanafelt, David W.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Yale University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Fenichel, EP (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",eli.fenichel@yale.edu,,"Richards, Timothy/0000-0001-8832-9609; Fenichel, Eli/0000-0002-7649-8250; Shanafelt, David/0000-0003-1853-3393",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM100471] Funding Source: Medline,NIGMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),,,84,50,58,0,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Using a CGE model, this paper finds that the MAC of CBEs is in general higher than that of PBEs, mainly due to limited substitution possibilities between energy and non-energy goods in final consumption compared to those in the choice of inputs in production activities under PBEs. Interestingly, when policies such as border carbon adjustments (BCAs) are introduced to reduce CBEs, net importers of emissions are better off, while net exporters of emissions are worse off in this approach compared to the PBEs target. If border tariffs are not allowed, the CBEs target turns out to be worse both for net importers and exporters of emissions.","[Ghosh, Madanmohan] Environm Canada, Anal & Modeling Div, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0H3, Canada; [Agarwal, Manmohan] Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Ghosh, M (通讯作者)，Environm Canada, Anal & Modeling Div, 10 Wellington St, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0H3, Canada.",madanmohan.ghosh@ec.gc.ca; magarwal@cigionline.org,,,,,,,46,4,4,0,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Consequently, the livelihood of the population linked to this ecosystem was disrupted. Faced with environmental dispossession, the population engaged in the defence of mangroves by articulating a national grassroots movement. In 2007, this movement implemented a novel identity politics strategy that linked mangrove ecosystem to indigeneity, and positioned itself as the 'Ancestral Peoples of the Mangrove Ecosystem' (PAEM). This paper focuses on the political economy of the shrimp-farming industry in Ecuador, showing the interrelation between environmental dispossession, collective action and identity formation, and analysing how this novel political identity is understood by different members of this social movement. The work argues that PAEM refers to a category that is closely linked to the processes of mangrove defence, in direct opposition to the shrimp farmer's identity, rather than to an essentialized conception of identity based on 'nativeness'.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Latorre, S (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Edifici C Campus UAB, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",sara.latorre.tomas@gmail.com,"Latorre, Sara/HTM-8334-2023",,,,,,65,12,12,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Both the 5-year investment grade iTraxx Europe and the 5-year investment grade CDX North America indexes are adopted as a market consensus of the overall credit risk in the financial system. Through a multivariate VAR model using historical data, the investigation uncovers three key findings. First, the equity returns for all systematically important institutions are inversely associated to shocks in the CDS index market. Second, European institutions demonstrate a stronger connection with the iTraxx whilst the US institutions are more closely related to the CDX. Furthermore, volatility originating in the CDS index market is unambiguously transmitted to both the insurance and the banking sector. Third, US banks are most severely distressed by the volatility transmission mechanism whilst European insurers are least affected. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

(2011) uncover a new anomaly (the MAX effect) related to investors' desire for stocks with lottery-like payoffs. Specifically, stocks with high maximum daily returns (high MAX) over the past month perform poorly relative to stocks with low maximum daily returns (low MAX) over the past month. We show that the MAX effect is strongly dependent on investor sentiment and is mainly due to the poor performance of high MAX stocks rather than high returns of low MAX stocks. Investors' desire to gamble in high MAX stocks is not limited to individual investors but is also present amongst some institutions. Controlling for past sentiment reduces the significance of the MAX effect. Our findings provide a behavioral underpinning to recent optimal beliefs theories (Brunnermeier et al., 2007) where investor optimism generates a preference for lottery-type securities.

Using a panel logit model over the period 2002-2009, we identify a banking liquidity measure, proxied by the LIBOR-OIS spread as a new determinant of banking crises.

The novelty of the paper is that the stock return indices are decomposed to several timescales using wavelet analysis and that the results are further used as inputs for the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) framework, which is used as a measure of comovement The results propose that the level of stock market comovement depends on regional aspects, the level of development and especially on the timescale of returns. These factors should be carefully considered in designing internationally diversified portfolios. The BRICs provide some portfolio diversification benefits, but it is not justifiable to treat all BRICs as a homogeneous group of emerging economies in terms of stock market comovement.

We emphasize the various ways in which the producers can respond to environmental regulations, and evaluate them in terms of their costs and their generation of secondary benefits. An application on the US electricity sector illustrates our main point: In our case, abatement technologies that reduce regulated emissions while leaving the plants' unregulated emissions unchanged appear to be among the least costly producer responses to the existing sulfur and nitrogen regulations, but at the expense of limited secondary reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. This finding raises questions about the magnitude of the much debated secondary benefits from future regulations on carbon dioxide emissions, since similar abatement technologies are currently being developed for carbon dioxide. With new environmental issues emerging over time, our findings suggest that regulators should signal the possibilities of new regulations on connected pollutants to producers. Such information may be relevant for producers when choosing current abatement strategies-with minor cost increases to deal with today's issues, overall compliance costs for near-future environmental problems may be lowered.","[Rodseth, Kenneth Lovold] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Romstad, Eirik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Rodseth, KL (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",klr@toi.no; eirik.romstad@umb.no,,"Rodseth, Kenneth Lovold/0000-0002-4453-2231",,,,,55,21,22,0,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Case studies have documented the influx of avant-garde artists and galleries into several neighborhoods, including Greenwich Village, Soho, and Chelsea, followed by yuppies and boutiques. Some researchers have used these examples to argue that artists and galleries can spur gentrification. An alternative hypothesis is that galleries choose to locate in neighborhoods with high levels of amenities. In this paper, I examine whether concentrations of galleries in Manhattan are associated with redevelopment of surrounding neighborhoods, conditional on initial neighborhood amenities. Results indicate that new galleries locate in high amenity, affluent neighborhoods, and near existing star galleries. In simple bivariate regressions, star gallery density is positively correlated with several metrics of building change. However, these correlations diminish when controls are added for initial neighborhood physical and economic conditions, and weaken still further under an IV approach. Results are consistent with galleries selecting neighborhoods that have a higher propensity to redevelop, due to the presence of observed and unobserved amenities.

As outright hank failures have been rare in Europe, the paper introduces a novel dataset that complements bankruptcies and defaults with state interventions and mergers in distress. The signals of the early-warning model are calibrated not only according to the policymaker's preferences between type I and II errors, but also to take into account the potential systemic relevance of each individual financial institution. The key findings of the paper are that complementing bank-specific vulnerabilities with indicators for macro-financial imbalances and banking sector vulnerabilities improves model performance and yields useful out-of-sample predictions of bank distress during the current financial crisis.

We suggest a new macroprudential risk management approach building on a system wide value at risk (SVaR). Under the SVaR metric, the contribution of individual banks to systemic risk is well defined and can be approximated by a Shapley value-type measure. We show that, in a SVaR regime, a fair systemic risk charge which is proportional to a bank's individual contribution to systemic risk diverges from the optimal macroprudential capitalization of the banks from a planner's perspective.

J,"Dercon, S",,,,"Dercon, Stefan",,,Is Green Growth Good for the Poor?,WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER,,,English,Article,,,,,,green growth; poverty,POVERTY,"The developing world is experiencing substantial environmental change, and climate change is likely to accelerate these processes in the coming decades. Due to their initial poverty and their relatively high dependence on environmental capital for their livelihoods, the poor are likely to suffer most due to their low resources for mitigation and investment in adaptation. Economic growth is essential for any large-scale poverty reduction. Green growth, a growth process that is sensitive to environmental and climate change concerns, can be particularly helpful in this respect. We focus on the possible trade-offs between the greening of growth and poverty reduction, and we highlight the sectoral and spatial processes behind effective poverty reduction. High labor intensity, declining shares of agriculture in GDP and employment, migration, and urbanization are essential features of poverty-reducing growth. We contrast some common and stylized green-sensitive growth ideas related to agriculture, trade, technology, infrastructure, and urban development with the requirements of poverty-sensitive growth. We find that these ideas may cause a slow-down in the effectiveness of growth to reduce poverty. The main lesson is that trade-offs are bound to exist; they increase the social costs of green growth and should be explicitly addressed. If they are not addressed, green growth may not be good for the poor, and the poor should not be asked to pay the price for sustaining growth while greening the planet.","[Dercon, Stefan] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Dercon, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,"Mena, Gabriela/M-4911-2015",,,,,,45,34,37,1,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Using data from a survey on firms located in North Norway, we ask whether AC plays a mediating role between different external knowledge inflows and innovative performance. The results are consistent with AC as an important mediator for transforming external knowledge inflows into higher innovative performance if we include all SMEs in the sample. However, this result is not robust when considering the sub-sample of non-R&D SMEs only. External knowledge inflows have a much stronger direct effect on innovation performance for non-R&D firms and leave a weak mediating effect of AC.

NTFPs accounted for 35 per cent of household income for participating households, second only to trading. Human capital variables and the value of assets were found to be significant determinants of both participation in business activities related to NTFPs and the associated household income, and the poor were more dependent on NTFPs than wealthier households.

Resilience of subjects was measured 5 years before the follow-up data was collected. The results show that the three dimensions of resilience (hardiness, resourcefulness and optimism) help to predict entrepreneurial success. The key factor in predicting the success of the entrepreneur is resourcefulness. This could be said about both men and women. However, the ability to predict entrepreneurial success of those who have hardiness and optimism is different for men and women. The influence of optimism on the success of their businesses is greater for women than for men. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

If regions are asymmetric with respect to the number of welfare recipients, Nash equilibria exist in which the region with the fewer poor attracts more taxpayers and sets higher taxes.

Using a sample of 953 US firms over the period 1999-2006, we show that there is a nonlinear relation between operational and financial hedging, confirming anecdotal evidence that many highly multinational firms do not hedge with derivatives. We find that operational hedging and financial hedging are significantly inversely related to firms' foreign exchange exposure, providing evidence that the two hedging techniques are complementary for all but the most highly operationally hedged firms. By comparing our findings for 1999-2006 with 1999-2009, we show that this complementarity breaks down when exchange rate volatility is high - as the effectiveness of financial hedging diminishes. An important message for firms is that operational hedges work, and they potentially provide better protection than financial hedging during times of stress. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We construct a new panel dataset to examine separately the key DD channels; namely, the Spending Effect and the Resource Movement Effect. Our analysis reveals that the standard DD mechanisms are also relevant at the regional level; specifically, we find that: (a) Resource windfalls are associated with higher inflation and a labour (capital) shift from (to) non-primary tradable sectors. (b) Resource windfalls in neighbouring regions are associated with a capital (labour) shift from (to) non-primary tradable sectors in the source region.

Most recent studies using disaggregated data to investigate why firms charge different prices for the same product on different markets focus on the cost component of prices and neglect the markup component. In this paper, we concentrate on the markup component and examine how variations in firms' export prices may reflect price discrimination by comparing the markup of firms with different pricing strategies. We make use of detailed firm-level data for exporting firms in the Swedish food sector consisting of both manufacturing and intermediary trading firms. The paper documents the export-price variations within the two sub-sectors and explores how different price strategies correlate with markups. The results offer new information beyond the fact that exporters tend to have a higher markup. In particular, we find that firms in the food-processing sector with a greater ability to discriminate across markets mark their products up even more. This result points to the importance of underlying firm decisions in order to explain differences in export premiums across firms. In addition, the results reveal that markups are a complex function of firm and destination characteristics, and that the relationship between markups and pricing strategies in the manufacturing sector is not necessarily observed in other sectors of the supply chain.","[Gullstrand, Joakim; Olofsdotter, Karin; Thede, Susanna] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Olofsdotter, K (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden.",Karin.Olofsdotter@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,41,8,9,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

I develop a discrete choice model that allows for both of these extremes as special cases, and use graphical techniques and simulations to compare their predictions to the data. I then use regression analysis to estimate the effect of quality on the propensity to enter foreign markets. A one-standard-deviation increase in quality increases the probability of entry by 25-50 %. Systematic differences in taste for different genre types are used to estimate a measure of cultural distance between countries. Movies in culturally dependent genres are less likely to enter foreign markets and their probability of entry is less sensitive to quality.

The second scenario is again subdivided into two parts - higher foreign savings as per the inference of the first scenario, and the constant foreign savings. We conclude that the economy undergoes contraction if import, export and exchange rate liberalisations are all implemented simultaneously.

Prior studies find that on average, managers issue more pessimistic guidance before than after grant dates. They interpret this asymmetric pattern as representing managers' opportunistic behavior. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether this pattern reflects managers' selective timing of bad news disclosures or a deliberate misrepresentation of underlying firm performance. This paper extends the literature by examining the effects of managerial stock option incentives on the accuracy and the information content of firms' voluntary earnings guidance. We find that pre-grant guidance significantly improves existing consensus earnings forecasts, and is similar in bias and accuracy to post-grant guidance. Moreover, investors and analysts react similarly to pre-grant vs. post-grant guidance, suggesting that the main consumers of earnings guidance view these two types of guidance to be equally informative. Our results are consistent with the notion that managers may opportunistically select the type or the timing of disclosures, but when they opt to disclose, they do not misrepresent the underlying firm performance. On the contrary, the seemingly opportunistic guidance before option grants improves overall firms' information environment, because it is at least as truthful and informative as post-grant guidance, and is issued more frequently than by managers who do not have incentives to report bad news before earnings announcements.","[Rees, Lynn; Tse, Senyo] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Accounting, Mays Business Sch, College Stn, TX USA; [Srivastava, Anup] Northwestern Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat Management, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mays Business School; Northwestern University,"Srivastava, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat Management, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",anup-srivastava@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,35,0,1,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

In developing coastal countries - where fishing activities are the mainstay of the population along the coast - livelihoods are being directly threatened. Although a number of studies exist on fishing regulations and those who violate them, little has been done on the relationship between intrinsic catch potentials/fishing skills and illegal fishing behavior. Using data on violations of light attraction regulation among small-scale fishers in Ghana, our results show that the risk of punishment, the amount of fishing experience, the skipper's age, and religious norms all influence the decision to violate fishing regulations. Most importantly, we found that violators and non-violators have different fishing skills.

The results suggest that moderately active and active individuals have shorter hospital stays than inactive individuals. On average, individuals with moderate to higher amount of physical activity stay 36% to 39% less than inactive individuals. Physical activity has consistent impact on hospital stays for the entire population as well as subgroup of people with or without chronic conditions. However, its effect is substantially larger for people with chronic conditions, especially for those who have diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. The paper also suggests that additional exercise once moderate level of exercise is achieved does not generate substantially large benefits in the form of shorter hospital stays. Hence, it provides additional evidence to support the recent physical activity guidelines for adults that highlight health benefits of moderate amount of regular physical activity.

This paper attempts to analyze the presence and nature of inter-country interactions in the process of ratifying such agreements. We develop a theoretical argument based on the notions of strategic substitutability and strategic complementarity and study the interactions among three different peer types: geographic neighbors, trading partners and green investment projects partners (in our case, clean development mechanism projects partners). We test for the presence of interactions by taking into account a temporal dimension, which constitutes a methodological contribution. To this end, we introduce spatially lagged endogenous variables into a parametric survival model and apply the proposed framework to the Kyoto Protocol ratification process. Our data sample covers 164 countries for the period 1998 to 2009. We find evidence that, while countries' ratification decisions are basically strategic substitutes, they become strategic complements once we focus on the ratification decisions of specific peers.","Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, CERDI, CNRS,UMR 6587, F-63009 Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Sauquet, A (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, CERDI, CNRS,UMR 6587, 65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63009 Clermont Ferrand, France.",alexandre.sauquet1@udamail.fr,,,,,,,59,13,13,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2014,159.0,1-2,,,,,141,158,,10.1007/s11127-012-0033-y,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AD3OX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333156600010,0

However, a comprehensive test comparing their performance against the traditional accounting-based approach or the contingent claims approach is missing in the literature. Using a complete database of UK Main listed firms between 1979 and 2009, our Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis shows that the hazard models are superior to the alternatives. Further, our information content tests demonstrate that the hazard models subsume all bankruptcy related information in the Taffler (1983) z-score model as well as in Bharath and Shumway (2008) contingent claims-based model. Finally, using a mixed regime competitive loan market with different costs of misclassification, the economic benefit of using the Shumway (2001) hazard model is clear, particularly when the performance is judged with return on risk weighted assets computed under Basel III.

Using a unique dataset of 654 French listed firms spanning 1998-2007, this study provides evidence that stock price synchronicity increases with excess control, supporting the argument that controlling shareholders tend to disclose less firm-specific information to conceal opportunistic practices. Additionally, this study shows that firms with substantial excess control are more likely to experience stock price crashes, consistent with the conjecture that controlling shareholders are more likely to hoard bad information when their control rights exceed their cash flow rights. Another important finding is that firms' stock prices are less synchronous and less likely to crash when controlling shareholders own a large fraction of cash flow rights. This is consistent with the argument that controlling shareholders have less incentive to adopt poor disclosure policies and to accumulate bad news, since high cash flow ownership aligns their interests with those of minority investors.

We find that the housing portfolio share immediately after moving to a more valuable house is higher during periods of high expected growth in house prices. We also find that the share of wealth invested in risky assets is lower during periods of high expected growth in house prices. Finally, the decrease in risky portfolio holdings for households moving to a more valuable house is greater in high-growth periods.

Because the disclosure of trading information has increased, investors can now observe the trading decisions of other people clearly, potentially leading them to follow the shrewd traders (Lin, 2009). For these reasons, the shrewd traders could try to conceal their real motives to avoid information leaks. The main contribution of this research lies in extending the stealth trading strategies suggested by Barclay and Warner (1993) and Blau, Van Ness, and Van Ness (2009) to cover the influence of pre-trade transparency and to consider how shrewd traders can utilize the selection of both the trade size and the time interval to conceal themselves in the more transparent market. The empirical results show that with greater transparency, the weighted price contributions (WPC) of the larger trades decrease while those of smaller trades increase significantly. According to the order placement pattern and the distribution of order quantity for each type of order size differs for institutional and individual investors, I infer that the price changes for the median-low trades could be attributed to the order splitting strategies of institutions, while the cause of the increasing price changes for small trades could be that individuals are undertaking trades more confidently as the observed information is added. Additionally, the intraday patterns of the price changes for the larger trades display a U pattern, while those for the smaller trades are an inverse-U pattern, particularly in the more transparent market.

We explore the impacts of offshoring on the production pattern of finished goods, tradable fragment prices, and welfare in a partial equilibrium context. The policy implications of attempts to restrict offshoring are also considered. The analysis shows that an offshoring equilibrium may exist in the absence of comparative advantage in fragments, that offshoring is welfare improving if the costs are sufficiently small, and that attempts (by both countries) to prevent offshoring may paradoxically lower both fragment use and price.","[Oladi, Reza; Gilbert, John] Utah State Univ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, San Antonio, TX USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Oladi, R (通讯作者)，4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",reza.oladi@usu.edu,"Oladi, Reza/AAA-7218-2019; Gilbert, John P/A-9031-2009","Oladi, Reza/0000-0002-4621-7622",,,,,26,4,4,1,15,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

With Eaton-Tamura-Tobit, Heckman, and Helpman-Melitz-Rubinstein estimation of the gravity equation using Hanson and Xiang's data, we are unable to find any evidence for the HME. Finally, the HME evidence is also absent for a sample of Canadian provinces' exports to U.S. states.

I propose that the main reason is that survey-based research applying popular social cognitive theories often underestimates the influence of social norms due to various errors of omission. In this article, I particularly focus on a too narrow conception of the process through which perceived social norms influence decision-making (i.e., intention formation) and behavior. Research suggesting a number of different paths through which perceived social norms influence behavior is reviewed, followed by a reanalysis of previously published data sets from research on pro-environmental and other types of behavior to test hypotheses derived from this literature. The results confirm that survey studies that include perceived social norms as one among several antecedents of pro-environmental intentions and behavior usually dramatically underestimate the influence of norms. It is concluded that studies on the relative impact of social and other antecedents of behavior should avoid oversimplifications and build their models on a theoretically sophisticated understanding of how norms influence behavior.","[Thogersen, John] Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Business Adm, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Thogersen, J (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Business Adm, Bartholins Alle 10-Bld 1327-124, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",jbt@asb.dk,"Thøgersen, John/G-6253-2013","Thøgersen, John/0000-0003-0613-8062",,,,,55,22,25,3,41,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Outcome of globalization and formation of human capital in Japan,JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sumo wrestling; Body mass index; Human capital; International labor mobility; Immigrant,IMMIGRATION,"Sumo wrestling is a traditional fighting sport in Japan and has been popular since the 18th century (the Edo period). Using a data set for all sumo wrestlers in the post-World War II period, this paper investigates how wrestlers' body mass index (BMI) is associated with their win rate and absence rate. Further, the effect of BMI is compared between an early period (before the emergence of foreign wrestlers) and later period (after the emergence of foreign wrestlers). After accounting for endogenous bias using instrumental variables, the key findings are that (I) there is no positive relationship between the BMI and win rate in either the early or later period and (2) there is a positive relationship between the BMI and absence rate in the later period but not in the early period. From the findings in this paper, I make the argument that an increase in the number of immigrants with human capital different from that of domestic labor leads the domestic labor to obtain human capital that does not match its characteristics, thereby reducing its performance.

These barriers are measured using human genetic distance from the technology frontier. The results based on cross-sectional data for 123 countries suggest that genetic distance to the global frontier has an economically and statistically significant effect on financial development, in that countries that are genetically far from the technology leader tend to have lower levels of financial development. Genetic distance is found to have the largest effect, even after controlling for other determinants of financial development established in the literature. These findings indicate that cultural barriers to the diffusion of financial technology across borders impact financial development by influencing the follower countries' ability to adopt and adapt innovations from the frontier.

We develop a theoretical framework of tax evasion decisions that is based on two behavioral assumptions: (1) taxpayers are endowed with reference dependent preferences that are subject to hedonic adaptation and (2) in making their choices, taxpayers are affected by ethical concerns. The model generates new predictions on how a change in the tax rate affects the decision to evade taxes. Contrary to the classical expected utility theory, but in line with previous applications of reference dependent preferences to taxpayers' decisions, an increase in the tax rate increases tax evasion. Moreover, as taxpayers adapt to the new legal tax rate, the decision to evade taxes becomes independent of the tax rate. We present results from a laboratory experiment that support the main predictions of the model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

IMPACT AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF AN ECONOMICS FACULTY,AMFITEATRU ECONOMIC,,,English,Article,,,,,,services; educational services; consumer; satisfaction; educational programme; economics as a specialization; responsibility; econometric model,SCIENCE; GOODS,"The aims of this paper are to provide a conceptual delimitation of educational services and their main and secondary components, and to quantify the level of satisfaction of specific consumers in academic organizations specializing in economics, with a view to restructuring their responsibilities. The method of statistical investigation is the thorough investigation including the graduates of bachelor and master courses in the accounting economic field, based on a questionnaire assessing the opinions of 138 graduates from the Faculty of Economics of Pitesti, which covers the full spectrum of 93 distinct variables. The databases were analyzed from a descriptive statistical standpoint with the software package Eviews, focusing on the normality of distributions. The major assumptions concern identifying variables intensely associated with the level of satisfaction of educational services consumers, for the first three and six main service categories, defined by 36 variables marked by respondents, plus another three and respectively six categories in further 15 variables, which define secondary educational services (according to the correlation ratio). Educational organizations belonging to the academic area are naturally concerned with the requirements expressed in the complex concept of satisfaction of those trained through the programs and specializations of a faculty (in this case, an economic faculty), with the aim that the educational services provided in a sustainable manner should cover nearly all their expectations as consumers (students and MA trainees), and also the educational requirements for shaping and training skills that the graduates need in order to succeed in the labour market. The differentiated behaviours of the consumers of educational services can be found at the end of the paper, in a number of econometric models that allow a coherent strategy; they lend a much greater responsibility to the organization doing the job, namely by improving the reputation of an economics faculty, reflected in the vectors and the detailed rating and specific to such surveys. The impact of educational services and the responsibility of the academic organizations for these services to be, through accurate and complete information, conducive to providing satisfactory performance for graduates in the labour market, are the core of the last section of this paper. The conclusions round out the whole endeavour, completing and detailing some necessary upcoming projects.","[Savoiu, Gheorghe; Necsulescu, Consuela; Taicu, Marian; Serbanescu, Luminita] Univ Pitesti, Fac Econ Sci, Pitesti, Romania; [Crisan, Emil] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Savoiu, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pitesti, Fac Econ Sci, Pitesti, Romania.",gsavoiu@yahoo.com,"Crisan, Emil/A-8698-2019; Taicu, Marian/I-6085-2013; Serbanescu, Luminita/A-7022-2012; Săvoiu, Gheorghe/C-3569-2013; Necsulescu, Consuela/IAP-5651-2023; Necsulescu, Consuela/IAP-5757-2023","Crisan, Emil/0000-0001-7076-3386; Săvoiu, Gheorghe/0000-0002-9596-793X;",,,,,46,3,3,1,21,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,88,107,,,,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300007,0

I exploit a quasi-experiment involving failed mergers to generate exogenous variation in acquisition outcomes of target firms. A difference-in-differences estimation reveals that, relative to failed targets, firms acquired in diversifying mergers produce both a smaller number of innovations and also less-novel innovations, where innovations are measured using patent-based metrics. The treatment effect is amplified if the acquiring conglomerate operates a more active internal capital market and is largely driven by inventors becoming less productive after the merger rather than inventor exits. Concurrently, acquirers move R&D activity outside the boundary of the firm via the use of strategic alliances and joint ventures. There is complementary evidence that conglomerates with more novel R&D tend to operate with decentralized R&D budgets. These findings suggest that conglomerate organizational form affects the allocation and productivity of resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study helps fill this gap by exploring individual firm location responses to traffic congestion within the Philadelphia metropolitan area between 2003 and 2007. This study tests whether existing, basic-industry firms flee congested areas to minimize exposure to the congestion externality. Relocation responses are estimated and compared for five separate industries (finance and insurance, health care, manufacturing, real estate and leasing, and wholesale trade) using firm-level data collected by InfoUSA and obtained from ESRI. Results suggest that congestion influences firm location decisions, but that the scale of congestion is important. While firms appear to relocate out of areas with high regionally-scaled congestion, areas with high local congestion are associated with a lower likelihood of relocating. In sum, while regional congestion appears to be a drag, local congestion appears to function as an amenity - implying that there is truth in the competing notions among engineers and economists of congestion as a diseconomy and among urban designers of congestion as an amenity.

It further proposed competing predictions about the moderating role of CEO tenure in the relationship. Data on a sample of 1262 Chinese firms across multiple industries provided robust support for the bell-shaped effect of external search breadth. Longer CEO tenure was shown to strengthen the relationship such that firms led by long-serving CEOs gained more innovation benefits from broad technology search than those led by new CEOs.","Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Dept Management & Mkt, Taipa, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Wu, J (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Dept Management & Mkt, Ave Padre Tomas Pereira, Taipa, Peoples R China.",Jiewu@umac.mo,,"wu, jie/0000-0002-4289-4204",,,,,71,32,33,1,83,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

A key contribution is to categorise and compare the heterogeneous methodologies used to extract ERPT measures in the empirical literature.

The presence of such beauty premiums may influence the labor supply decisions of attractive workers. For example, if one unit of a product by an attractive worker is more rewarded than that by her less attractive coworker, the attractive worker may put more effort into improving her productivity. We examine this possibility by analyzing panel data for individual female golfers participating in the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) tour. We found that attractive golfers recorded lower than average scores and earn more prize money than average looking players, even when controlling for player experience and other variables related to their natural talents. This finding is consistent with the notion that physical appearance is associated with individual workers' accumulation of human capital or skills. If the human capital of attractive workers is at least partly an outcome of favoritism toward beauty, then the premium estimates obtained by previous studies may have been downwardly biased.

This predictability of the amount of pension is also a necessary condition to enable workers to make an informed decision when they choose the age at which they wish to retire. However, the several retirement reforms across the past 20 years in France may have hindered the predictability of the level of pension in the French public pension system, by modifying calculation rules for workers who were already very close to retirement ages. We quantify this impact of retirement reforms on the predictability of pension for workers aged 50 and more, by running simulations using a microsimulation model. Although there exists in all cohorts a share of workers who were not impacted by retirement reforms and therefore enjoyed a good predicatability of their pension -, this happens to concern only a minority of workers. Among all cohorts born between 1933 and 1956, most workers actually had to face changes in calculation rules after the age of 50, and therefore could only make at that age - and also often at the age of 55 - a biased prediction of their future level of public pension.","[Aubert, Patrick] Conseil Orientat Retraites, F-75007 Paris, France; [Aubert, Patrick] CREST INSEE, Pune, Maharashtra, India",,"Aubert, P (通讯作者)，Conseil Orientat Retraites, 113 Rue Grenelle, F-75007 Paris, France.",patrick.aubert@cor-retraites.fr,"Aubert, Patrick/O-8709-2019","Aubert, Patrick/0000-0003-1777-8639",,,,,15,0,0,0,10,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The model allows to discuss the incentives for the defense contractors to use different size of offset packets in the bidding process for defense contracts. The results lead to the conclusion that the attempts of some governments to coordinate multilateral reduction of offset packages have a low chance of success in the contemporary defense markets.

Repeated flood shocks is one of the least researched phenomena associated with understanding the socioeconomic dynamics in flood disaster but is acknowledged to be a significant factor in flood impacts. The memory within, and its dynamics interrelated with, the complex socio-ecological system is therefore the main focus of this research. It is virtually impossible to understand the dynamics of socio-economic complexities of flood memory of a system without accounting for the human dimension of vulnerability and interrelated feedbacks associated with it that alter the overall resilience within the system. The concept of memory within the context of disasters has largely been restricted to studies of a psychological nature, however, it is realized that to understand the components of adaptability in environmental, social, and economic contexts, with reference to memory and resilience to repeated physical stress, is equally important. Previous research has identified a number of factors that affect the socio-economic vulnerability of affected population but few attempts has been made to integrate the factors to develop an aggregated system structure. This research adopts a method of structured literature review to identify the concepts and scope of memory in the system and explores those multi-faceted aspects of multi-scale and multi-level processes of memory and socio-ecological patterns to identify how such complexities react to changing stresses.

We find that FCs undermine average firm growth, induce anti-correlation in growth patterns and reduce the dependence of growth volatility on size. FCs are also associated with higher volatility and asymmetries in growth shock distributions, preventing young fast-growing firms especially from seizing attractive growth opportunities and further deteriorating the growth prospects of already slow-growing firms, particularly if old. The sub-diffusive nature of the growth process of constrained firms is compatible with the distinctive properties of their size distribution.","[Bottazzi, Giulio; Tamagni, Federico] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Secchi, Angelo] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, CES, Paris Sch Econ, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Paris School of Economics,"Bottazzi, G (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",bottazzi@sssup.it; angelo.secchi@univ-paris1.fr; f.tamagni@sssup.it,"Tamagni, Federico/AAF-3143-2020","Tamagni, Federico/0000-0001-6476-6388; Bottazzi, Giulio/0000-0003-2565-4732",,,,,48,87,99,3,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We consider a sample of 265 acquisitions undertaken by French listed firms during the 1997-2008 period. We find that the likelihood to finance the acquisition with debt is high, compared to equity financing, when the family voting rights are high, which indicates that the control motives affect financing choices significantly. We also find that financing decision is affected by control-enhancing mechanisms.

This article sets out to develop a measure for resilience to provide a concise tool for measuring and monitoring food security in comparative ways across countries. It presents the results of the development of a resilience score tested using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) household data for five African countries from two different time periods per country. Cluster analysis was used to classify households into socio-economic groups. The first index used Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA) and the second a simple sum of assets. Both indices were able to detect changes in household socio-economic status over the data periods in all five countries. However, the results for the two indices were not always consistent. The simple sum method results matched the published national Millennium Development Goal data more closely than the Categorical Principal Component Analysis method. The simple sum of assets has potential as an impact indictor for development programmes aimed at improving household food security and as a national to Millennium Development Goal indicator. It provides a simple tool for tracking resilience from data that is routinely collected through multiple in-country surveys and available from national statistics.","[Browne, M.; Ortmann, G.

The Sequential Panel Selection Method (SPSM) using Panel KSS test with a Fourier function-which is good enough to control for structural breaks and nonlinearity as well as cross-section dependency and heterogeneity is applied to per capita real GDP data for 52 African countries for the period 1969 to 2011. The SPSM classifies the whole panel into a group of stationary series and a group of non-stationary series that is very suitable to identify how many and which series in the panel are stationary processes. The empirical results from several conventional unit root tests indicate that the per capita real GDP for the countries are non-stationary, however, when the SPSM using the Panel KSS unit root test with a Fourier function is conducted, we find that the per capita real GDP are stationary in 50 out of the 52 African countries. Besides, we indicate that allowing for nonlinearities and structural breaks in the series results in more rejection of the null of unit root hypothesis. Our results thereby point out to the importance of the proper modeling of both structural breaks and nonlinearities in real output levels of developing countries. The findings imply that GDP fluctuations in African countries are overall transitory and they provide important policy implications for African countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Without schools, hospitals and other public buildings, society and economy could not function. Therefore a failure to consider the potential impact of climate change on municipal buildings would be both costly and detrimental to sustainable development. In this paper the authors present research undertaken to ascertain the potential impacts of climate impacts on municipal buildings in South Africa. A two-phase approach was adopted. Firstly the appropriate climate effects on a given building inventory, in a selected location, were determined; then the cost impacts on that building (based on a set of stressor-response functions) were applied. The results of the study predict that the total impact of climate change on buildings in South Africa could vary between USD $42.7 million average annual costs in the median scenario and USD $214.3 million average annual costs in the maximum scenario. The results presented are all incurred costs, which need to be addressed to avoid health and safety issues. However costs would be much higher if the existing stock was augmented without considering climate change impacts. The research provides an understanding of the cost of climate change and how the maintenance and adaptation of the unsustainable buildings may divert resources from sustainable development. The results of the research may also present an opportunity for existing buildings to be retrofitted with alternative, sustainable technologies, which serve to decrease vulnerability to climate change impacts going forward.

The ascending dynamics of new house building in the rural area, can be combined with the dynamics of the population mobility and increasing economic importance of agricultural activities at social levels.

The cost per ozone season of achieving these reductions is approximately $9 million (2008 USD).

The focus is not on external effects, but industries where economies of scale are introduced from adapting to pollution. The structure of the resulting oligopolistic market is endogenous, since the level of adaptation is chosen by the firms. The analysis of externalities usually disregards defensive or adaptation measures, with a few exceptions that point to considerable complications. The present debate on adaptation to climate change shows the importance of understanding defensive measures. I show that the market failure caused by economies of scale leads to production costs above the social optimum, i.e. to under-adapation. When pollution increases, adaptation only increases if demand is price inelastic. Otherwise, welfare loss from market failure decreases with pollution. The total welfare loss is only convex if demand is price inelastic and the influence of pollution on production costs is stronger than the influence of adaptation. Concave welfare loss has crucial implications for abatement policies.","Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Eisenack, K (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",klaus.eisenack@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Evidence suggests that (i) such student debt may have undesirable educational effects and potentially jeopardize household balance sheets and (ii) student loans may better support educational attainment and economic mobility if accompanied by other, non-repayable financial awards. However, given declines in need-based aid and falling state support for postsecondary costs, policymakers and parents alike have failed to produce a compelling complement to debt-dependent financial aid that is capable of improving outcomes and forestalling assumption of ever-increasing student debt for a majority of U.S. households. This article, which relies on longitudinal data from the Educational Longitudinal Study, finds parental college savings may be an important protective factor in reducing debt assumption. However, several other factors increase the likelihood students will borrow: perceiving financial aid as necessary for college attendance, expecting to borrow to finance higher education, having moderate income, and attending a for-profit college. After controlling for student and school variables, the authors find that parental college savings increase a student's chance of accumulating lower debt (less than $2,000) compared with students lacking such savings. Policy innovations to increase parental college savings such as children's savings accounts could be an important piece of the response to the student debt problem in the United States.","[Elliott, William; Lewis, Melinda] Univ Kansas, Sch Social Welf, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Grinstein-Weiss, Michal] Washington Univ, Sch Social Work, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Nam, Ilsung] Hallym Univ, Inst Aging, Chunchon, South Korea",University of Kansas; Washington University (WUSTL); Hallym University,"Elliott, W (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Sch Social Welf, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",,,,,,,,65,2,5,0,14,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Production expansion needs to be accompanied by reductions in the GHG emission intensity of agricultural products, if significant increases in emissions are to be avoided. Suggested farm management changes often have systemic effects on farm, therefore their investigation requires a whole farm approach. At the same time, changes in GHG emissions arising off-farm in food supply chains (pre- or post-farm) can also occur as a consequence of these management changes. A modelling framework that quantifies the whole-farm, life-cycle effects of GHG mitigation measures on emissions and farm finances has been developed. It is demonstrated via a case study of sexed semen on Scottish dairy farms. The results show that using sexed semen on dairy farms might be a cost-effective way to reduce emissions from cattle production by increasing the amount of lower emission intensity 'dairy beef' produced. It is concluded that a modelling framework combining a GHG life cycle analysis model and an economic model is a useful tool to help designing targeted agri-environmental policies at regional and national levels. It has the flexibility to model a wide variety of farm types, locations and management changes, and the LCA-approach adopted helps to ensure that GHG emission leakage does not occur in the supply chain.","[Eory, Vera; MacLeod, Michael; Shrestha, Shailesh; Roberts, David] SRUC, Scotlands Rural Coll, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland",Scotland's Rural College,"Eory, V (通讯作者)，SRUC, Div Res, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland.",vera.eory@sruc.ac.uk,"Eory, Vera/B-5329-2013; MacLeod, Matthew/D-5919-2013; Shrestha, Shailesh/J-5366-2019","MacLeod, Matthew/0000-0003-2562-7339; Shrestha, Shailesh/0000-0001-6053-0212; Eory, Vera/0000-0002-7134-3233; macleod, michael/0000-0003-2444-6886",Scottish Government Rural and Environmental Science and Analytical Services division (RESAS); European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [266018],Scottish Government Rural and Environmental Science and Analytical Services division (RESAS); European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)),"This analysis has been undertaken with Scottish Government Rural and Environmental Science and Analytical Services division (RESAS) funding to SAC and to ClimateXChange, and as part of the Animal-Change project which received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under the grant agreement no 266018.",,24,8,8,0,29,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Thus the focus of the paper is to analyze the impact of using different judgment scales on the resulting priorities and consistency to default scale as proposed by Saaty. Results suggest that judgment scales have a profound impact on criteria priorities but not on ranking of criteria. However, the consistency varies among applied judgment scales.

This frame explicitly refers to the governmental public spending covered from assembly of fiscal resources, and, in addition, to governmental public spending covered from other public financial resources, mainly manifested in the depth of the deficit character of the Romanian fiscal system. In essence, the dynamics of the governmental public spending financed from assembly of fiscal resources has partially followed the evolutions of the economic and social level during the analyzed period.On the other hand, the low functionality of the Romanian fiscal system is also suggested from the perspective of the connections between its two sides and the economic and social development.","[Frunza, Marius] Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",,,frunzammarius@gmail.com,"Frunza, Marius/C-1846-2013","Frunza, Marius/0000-0002-3509-1307",,,,,3,0,0,0,4,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-021-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,143,148,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346752000019,0

Any negative events, especially catastrophic, don't allow to execute plans and it can be a cause of abandonment of farms by farmers. This can upset the situation on food market. European Community, in its regulations, allows and even recommends the use of various support instruments. In response to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1857/2006 of 15 December 2006 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to State aid to small and medium-sized enterprises active M the production of agricultural products, subsidized crop and animal insurance were introduced in Poland. Much larger opportunities are offered by solution which are financed by assets derived from the mechanism of modulation and defined by Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers. That can be wider range of subsidized crop, animal and plant insurance or mutual funds. Mutual fund is a mechanism that allows affiliated farmers pay compensation for economic losses incurred as a result of animal and plant diseases and environmental incidents. This regulation defines the financial rules of the bind and the possible use of this mechanism in the public and the EU. At the same time, there are many concerns about the practical implementation of this solution. Mutual fund can be a complementary tool for the protection of risks, which cannot be accepted by the insurance market. Experiences of Member States with regard to its use are small, but the examples of countries in which it operates (in this article indicates the Italian example) suggest that it may be a simple in its design hut highly effective tool. And it will allow for more complete protection of agricultural production The paper tries to identify the organizational and financial solutions to the mutual fund concept and proposed the establishment of specific solutions for this mechanism in Poland. This paper will present a discussion of the benefits from the introduction of this solution on the Polish and European market for agricultural insurance. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Conversely, Business Intelligence (BI) and Master Data Management (MDM) are activities with challenges and issues, as financial organizations grapple with ways to make informed decisions that align with their projected business targets and goals. In this paper, the argument is that a profound understanding of master data management, as an activity, is vital to the delivery of real-time quality information, and subsequently an improved business intelligence. To this point, this paper explores and describes how an understanding of MDM activities may improve business intelligence in a financial bank. In this paper, MDM and BI are seen as activity systems. However, this paper focuses on the MDM activity and not the BI activity. Activity theory is used as a lens to analyze the activity system.

In response, local Maori recovery initiatives were collaborative, effective and shaped by cultural values, including the principle 'aroha nui ki te tangata' (extend love to all). Disaster sector stakeholders are increasingly recognising the value of community-led initiatives that facilitate social resilience. In contrast, cultural approaches to facilitating community resilience receive minimal acknowledgement. The Maori response to the Christchurch earthquakes and subsequent recovery process constitutes an exemplar of best practice. The Joint Centre for Disaster Research in partnership with the Christchurch Iwi (tribe) Ngai Tahu, conducted research to identify, and document the ways Maori cultural factors facilitated community resilience in response to the earthquakes. A Maori qualitative research methodology has shaped the community-based participatory research design. Maori research participants views were ascertained though semi-structured and focus group interviews. Dialogical and narrative interviewing approaches were used to foster community engagement, as well as capture Maori understandings and practices associated with disaster management, recovery and resilience. Data analysis drew on social theories, risk perspectives and indigenous epistemological concepts. Analysis of the results suggest that New Zealand's disaster response policies may be enhanced by the integration of Maori approaches to facilitating disaster risk mitigation, community recovery and social resilience. This paper documents the different levels of support that were extended to whanau (families), communities and responding agencies. The cultural principles that underpin the extension of support are examined in relation to Bruno Latour's theories about how technologies shape action and Putnam's ideas on social capital. The impact of cultural support strategies on social resilience is addressed and the relevance to national and local authority disaster recovery strategies outlined. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Based on prior research outcomes, the authors improved the overall analytical approach. This article expands the study boundary from Travis County through Bexar County to test the corridor between the San Antonio and Austin metropolitan areas. Nearby counties are also included, resulting in a total of six counties. In addition, a statistical tool, explanatory factor analysis (EFA), is added to fill the gap identified in the previous modeling practices. The project addresses transportation corridor planning in the Texas Urban Triangle at the regional scale. Its aim is to determine the most suitable locations for new transport infrastructure by employing a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS). The proposed SDSS provides a composite foundation for decision making to attain enhanced regional mobility, especially for a high-speed rail (HSR).

This process is usually done by a technician in the field, manually from obtained aerial/satellite images or semi-automatically by a software application. The first two options are very time consuming, hence expensive. Many companies therefore try to process at least part of this task automatically. The road inventory process comprises an identification of objects that can be found either on the road or in the road proximity. Examples include road signs, road markings, guardrails and many more. We can register much information about these objects, such as their position, condition or type. Generally, there are two sources for the extraction of information needed for the inventory. The first source is a set of images captured by a camera. The second source is data captured by a LiDAR. Either of them can provide different information; therefore, the choice of the source must be made with regard to the required information. In our article, we compare information that can be obtained from camera images and LiDAR measurements. This comparison is presented on three example objects: traffic signs, road markings and general pole-shaped objects (e. g. city lights or trees). Further, we describe a process based on our algorithm that detects traffic signs in LiDAR measurement and transforms the results to a common format used in geographic information systems. We test our method on an approximately two-kilometer long road in an urban area.

In a sample of 20,031 leveraged loan facilities originated between 1997 and 2007, facilities including a non-bank institution in their syndicates have higher spreads than otherwise identical bank-only facilities. Contrary to risk-based explanations of this finding, non-bank facilities are priced with premiums relative to bank-only facilities in the same loan package. These non-bank premiums are substantially larger when a hedge or private equity fund is one of the syndicate members. Consistent with the notion that firms are willing to pay a premium when loan facilities are particularly important to them, the non-bank premiums are larger when borrowing firms face financial constraints and when capital is less available from banks.

This model describes economics of innovative firms more accurately, than models, not accounting for learning. The investment and production policy of a single firm was specified and the results were applied to a macroeconomic model. The regimes of the models were studied theoretically and numerically, and the comparison of models with and without employees learning was performed. Optimal control problem for a single firm was solved and it was concluded that in general, there is a lag between firm establishment and production. Equations for parameters of balanced growth were derived and checked numerically. It was concluded that the dependency between the degree of importance of employees learning and the growth rate has a maximum.

Recent disasters have highlighted the exposure of urban cities to natural disasters and emphasised the need of making cities resilient to disasters. Built environment plays an important role in every city and need to be functional and operational at a time of a disaster and is expected to provide protection to people and other facilities. However, recent disasters have highlighted the vulnerability of the built assets to natural disasters and therefore it is very much important to focus on creating a disaster resilient built environment within cities. However the process of making a disaster resilient built environment is a complex process where many challenges are involved. Accordingly the paper aims at exploring the challenges involved in building a disaster resilient built environment. Paper discusses the findings of some expert interviews and three case studies which have been conducted in Sri Lanka by selecting three cities which are potentially vulnerable to threats posed by natural hazards. The empirical evidence revealed, lack of regulatory frameworks; unplanned cities and urbanisation; old building stocks and at risk infrastructure; unauthorised structures; institutional arrangements; inadequate capacities of municipal councils; lack of funding; inadequacy of qualified human resources; and corruption and unlawful activities as major challenges for creating a disaster resilient built environment within Sri Lankan cities. The paper proposes a set of recommendations to address these prevailing concerns and to build a more resilient built environment within cities. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

In particular it is argued that the exchange paradigm and the principle of unanimity lead to a conservative defence of the unequal and unjust status quo of such societies. These criticisms are often presented as unanswered and unanswerable. Indeed, public choice scholars have tended to pursue their own research agendas rather than engage such criticisms. This article seeks to make good this lacuna by providing a defence of the public choice account of power. It is shown that within the public choice approach the exchange paradigm and the unanimity principle serve as idealized models against which to judge real world institutional arrangements. As such, these models serve as a basis for critique of contemporary capitalist societies in which all individuals may be subject to predation as a matter of routine. It is shown that the public choice account of power addresses the legitimization and limitation of power, whereas the critics of public choice in effect propose to allocate power to those deemed deserving. Hence, the public choice approach provides a basis for a genuinely consensual politics and exposes the fact that alternative conceptions of politics are fundamentally non-consensual. On this basis it is concluded that the public choice account of power in contemporary capitalist societies is superior to that offered by its critics.","Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Meadowcroft, J (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England.",john.meadowcrcyft@kcl.ac.uk,,"Meadowcroft, John/0000-0001-6544-3409",,,,,41,9,12,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2014,158.0,1-2,,,,,85,100,,10.1007/s11127-012-9925-0,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AA3FZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330979600010,0

Two main methods conducted to support the investigation are surveys with firms in Vietnam for collection of primary data and in-depth interviews with experts from Vietnam commercial banks. The result suggests that there exists a need for derivatives by firms in Vietnam and also indicates that those firms are more concerned about derivative related issues. However, I find that the number of firms which have used derivatives at least once is moderate (only 16.19% of surveyed firms). In Vietnam, commodity derivative usage is the most common, followed closely by foreign currency derivatives and the least are interest rate derivatives. Among different types of derivative instruments, forward contracts are the most preferable in Vietnam. A relative majority of Vietnamese firms focus their use of derivative in hedging rather than in investment or speculation; however they face obstacles of lacking necessary information and understanding of these instruments. Finally, one notable reason for derivatives non-users is that derivatives have not been attractive and beneficial for firms due to inflexible exchange rate and interest rate regime in Vietnam.","[Nga, Nguyen T.

They are viewed as a cheap, efficient, and healthy means of navigating dense urban environments. This paper is the first to take a global view of bike-sharing characteristics by analysing data from 38 systems located in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. To achieve this, an extensive database depicting the geographical location and bicycle occupancy of each docking station within a particular system has been created over a number of years to chart the usage in the chosen systems (and others) and provide a consistent basis on which to compare and classify them. Analysis of the variation of occupancy rates over time, and comparison across the system's extent, infers the likely demographics and intentions of user groups. A classification of bike-shares, based on the geographical footprint and diurnal, day-of-week and spatial variations in occupancy rates, is proposed. The knowledge of such patterns and characteristics identifiable from the dataset has a range of applications, including informing operators and policymakers about the maintenance of a suitable balance of bicycles throughout the system area (a nontrivial problem for many bike-shares), the location of new docking stations and cycle lanes, and better targeting of promotional materials to encourage new users. Within the context of transport research, the systems utilised here are part of relatively small, closed environments that can be more easily modelled and validated.

Intellectual capital represents one of the intangible resources valued as an important element for entrepreneurial activities. Entrepreneurship and intellectual capital have become the focus of close observation and, thanks to their various multidisciplinary perspectives, several definitions have been presented for these two topics. However, there are still few studies clarifying the relationship between the concepts. Each entrepreneurial company is seen as a dynamic power, a source of job creation, economic growth and competitiveness. Intellectual capital is a topic of growing awareness because this phenomenon contributes, with growing emphasis, to the value creation of a company. Its importance has increased since enterprises began recognizing such intangible assets as a worthy source of competitive advantage and one of the keys to sustaining a company's advantage. Identifying non-economic factors that contribute to success in entrepreneurial activities and help to increase entrepreneurial performance is a difficult and challenging task. Therefore, several questions should be asked: What is the relationship between an enterprise's activities and its intellectual capital? What contributions add intellectual capital to the success, or more precisely, to the performance, of an entrepreneurial company? Is there a way to measure such impact and, if so, is it possible to get quantifiable data about this relationship, or are qualitative methods the only route to measuring this relationship? Which methods do companies use to measure their performance and do those methods consider factors of intellectual capital? The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of intellectual capital for entrepreneurship activities and to discover possible ways that such a tool might be used for impact evaluation. A theoretical framework of these topics is provided in order to obtain sufficient background for further research. The relationship of intellectual capital and performance of entrepreneurial companies is analyzed, followed by an elaboration of a theoretical model that may serve as a stepping stone for further discussions. Particular emphasis is placed on the situation in the Czech Republic.","[Prochazkova, Petra Tausl; Jelinkova, Eva] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Prochazkova, PT (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic.",pprochaz@kpm.zcu.cz; ejelinko@kpm.zcu.cz,"Prochazkova, Petra Tausl/I-5990-2016",,,,,,32,3,3,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,249,254,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000031,0

This study is based on the contention that proximity to alters and accessibility to services and degree of urbanization moderate this relationship. In addition, marking the contribution of this study to the literature, social interaction frequencies are dynamic and change over time. Therefore, face-to-face interaction frequencies are subjected to the history of interaction and distance dynamics between actors. By taking these aspects into account, important research questions can be addressed, for instance, would the frequency of meeting between an ego and an alter increase if the alter lives nearby now, but was previously located far away? Or how often would the ego meet an alter who was living nearby but moved to a more distant location now? The answers could provide important feedback to tie maintenance, strength, disappearances and social travel dynamics over time. This study draws from the concepts of path dependence, life course and accessibility and shows that history and accessibility indicators can explain part of the frequency of face-to-face interactions. Life cycle events were taken as triggers of these changes. Retrospective survey data are used for the analyses. Face-to-face social interaction frequency between egos and their alters was recorded before and after the life cycle event.

Currently, there are available data for more than forty years and it means that lots of information about changes in structure and Main tendencies can be studied. Since the emphasis is put on the comparable time series, it was necessary to prepare transformation of original data into national accounts. Historical figures on private consumption were published in line with the Material Product System that is not fully comparable with the System of National Accounts. Data on private consumption reflecting only material part of consumption had to be transformed into household consumption expenditures covering both expenditures for material and non-material products. The process of transformation of original data reflecting socialist statistical system is briefly described, as well as main differences. Key points of transformation are illustrated on selected years. Finally, original data are compared with reconstructed ones and differences are explained. The analysis provides useful information about main changes in consumption expenditures by CZ-COICOP. Finally, some often discussed issues like the relative increase of expenditures connected with housing, decrease of the share of foodstuff etc. can be proven now.","[Sixta, Jaroslav; Vltavska, Kristyna; Hronova, Stanislava] Univ Econ, Dept Econ Stat, Fac Informat & Stat, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic; [Hindls, Richard] Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, Fac Informat & Stat, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Sixta, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Econ Stat, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",sixta@vse.cz; kristyna.vltavska@vse.cz; hronova@vse.cz; hindls@vse.cz,"Hronova, Stanislava/AAA-8360-2021; Sixta, Jaroslav/J-9828-2014; Vltavská, Kristýna/J-1497-2017","Hronova, Stanislava/0000-0002-3568-9755;",,,,,14,5,5,1,19,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Almost all enterprises have the same conditions for their operation - capital, sources, environment; therefore competing with competitors is very difficult. Enterprises have to seek to differentiate from their competitors and thereby gain a competitive advantage. Most enterprises do not realize that this can be achieved just by their workforce. Employees' intellectual capital is the knowledge of employees, which is stored in their heads as well as the knowledge captured in enterprise documents. It is created by the stocks of knowledge, which are available to the company. It represents intangible resources, which together with material resources constitute the total value of the enterprise. Intellectual capital of an enterprise is a strong source of competitive advantage. Therefore, it is necessary for enterprises, within the interest of improving their competitive position, to seek to use it effectively. Employees' knowledge of one enterprise is different from the employees' knowledge of other enterprises, and thanks to them the enterprise can become unique in its area of activities. The fact should not be forgotten that the level of intellectual capital should continue to increase, especially through permanent education and training of employees. The aim of this paper is to introduce in theory the basic aspects of intellectual capital of an enterprise, to show its importance and the opportunity to transform it into competitive advantage. Attention is also paid to the opportunities for increasing the level of intellectual capital. The paper also discusses the opportunities for using intellectual capital of employees for creating innovations, which are considered to be the necessary condition of competitiveness for an enterprise in the global business environment. The analysis of intellectual capital was done on the basis of knowledge of current and available literature. The paper helps to clarify the confusion on this issue, because it leads to inefficient use of intellectual capital, which causes a reduction of competitiveness. The paper is intended mainly for business managers, but also for all those, who seek to differentiate from their competitors and to improve their market position in the current dynamically changing business conditions. The content of this paper helps them to change their view of the employees, to realize their importance and to see them as a source of competitive advantage.","[Sokolovska, Barbora; Caganova, Dagmar; Cambal, Milos] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Mat Sci & Technol Trnava, Inst Ind Engn & Management, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Saniuk, Anna] Univ ZielonaGora, Zielona Gora, Poland",Slovak University of Technology Bratislava,"Sokolovská, B (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Mat Sci & Technol Trnava, Inst Ind Engn & Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",barbora.sokolovska@stuba.sk; dagmar.caganova@stuba.sk; milos.cambal@stuba.sk; a.saniuk@iizp.uz.zgora.pl,"Saniuk, Anna/L-1821-2018; Caganova, Dagmar/D-2946-2017; Cambal, Milos/L-7363-2016","Saniuk, Anna/0000-0003-2560-9237; Caganova, Dagmar/0000-0002-6834-6126; Cambal, Milos/0000-0002-4855-0277",,,,,14,1,1,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,384,392,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000047,0

Based on the analysis of secondary data provided by the companies the aim of this paper is to identify the key areas of corporate philanthropy these companies focus on, describe the common characteristics and find the ways of corporate philanthropy that could be used by small and medium sized companies in the Czech Republic. SMEs have 99.8 % in the total amount of companies in the Czech Republic and they employ 68.5 % of employees. This fact makes them important and it is necessary to ensure their future competitiveness. Large companies usually focus on a long-term partnership with a certain NGO. The second most often activity is establishment of their own corporate foundation or endowment fund. Most often supported areas are children, family and young people. Large companies also support education. The three areas that were not supported (or just minimally) by the analyzed large companies were animals, homeless and old people. This could be a gap where the small and medium sized companies may fit in. There are two options how to do it. Individually by direct support or individual cooperation, and the second option is to cooperate with other companies from the same field, region or branch in the form of association, joint fund etc. The second way could be more beneficial for both parts - profit and non-profit organizations. These results could serve as a pre-research for the next more extensive study of philanthropy in the Czech Republic. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are facing the challenge that the intangibles which thus far have not been taken into account are to make transparent for their respective banks. At the same time banks adopt such qualitative information in their lending decisions to optimize their risk portfolio. This paper presents the tool box IC Future Check which has been developed and tested in cooperation with financial institutions and businesses within a project for the German Federal Ministry of Economy and Technology. In this context it shows how the IC Future Check systematically supports the communication between bank and business and increases the transparency of intangibles. In a case study of a German SME the practical use of the IC Future Check is demonstrated in the credit lending process. The presented tool IC Future Check can provide significant support to the communication between SMEs and banks and to reduce existing information asymmetries.

In conclusion, the phenomenon of organisational cynicism causes the employees to get alienated. (C) 2014 The Authors.

This study found that the physical dimension (i.e. women with disabilities, pregnant women, elderly women), four types of social dimension (i.e. homeless women, violence against women, widow with many dependents, women heading household), and two types of economic dimension (i.e. women with debt burden and women with lack of productive assets) are the most prominent dimension. Existing patriarchal culture and weak of gendered institution are the root causes of gender vulnerability.

In this paper, we investigate the existence of such findings in the Turkish labor market for the 2004-2010 period using Labor Force Survey data. We found evidence for wage and job polarization. Next, we show that occupations have significant contribution in explaining the change in wage distribution. In the literature, reasons behind these patterns are investigated using data on task composition of occupations. However, no such data is available for Turkey. Thus, to conduct research in identifying the sources of recent trends in the labour market, compiling data on occupation-task decomposition is important.","[Akcomak, Semih] Orta Dogu Tekn Univ, ODTU TEKPOL, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Gurcihan, Burcu] Turkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankasi, Arastirma Politikast Genel Mudurlugu, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Prime Ministry Turkey,"Akçomak, S (通讯作者)，Orta Dogu Tekn Univ, ODTU TEKPOL, Univ Mahallesi Durnlupmar Bulvan 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",akcomak@metu.edu.tr; Burcu.Gurcihan@tcmb.gov.tr,"Akçomak, İbrahim Semih/G-9632-2016","Akçomak, İbrahim Semih/0000-0001-8963-5771",,,,,39,1,1,0,18,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

The literature distinguishes between two main different lending technologies (LTs) for SMEs: transactional and relationship LTs. We find that banks lend to SMEs by using both LTs together, independently of the size and proximity of borrowers. Moreover, we show that the use of soft information decreases the probability of firms being credit rationed. Finally, we find that more soft information is produced when the bank uses relationship LT as primary technology individually or coupled with transactional LT. Our results support the view that LTs can be complementary, but reject the hypothesis that substitutability among LTs is somehow possible for outsiders by means of hardening of soft information.

Ito's calculus is implemented in order to obtain the first and second conditional moment of the driving stochastic differential equation for the volatility process. These analytical expressions are augmented by their lag and lag squared and are used to form the corresponding GMM estimator. The base case stochastic volatility model is extended to allow for the leverage effect and jumps in returns. Empirical estimation confirms the presence of fast mean reversion in volatility and jumps in returns for the 5-min S&P 500 stock market index. Further estimation results also seem to indicate the presence of jumps in the volatility process that are correlated to the jumps in returns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Its calculation is based on the following 7 economic pillars: (1) Institutional environment, (2) Business environment, (3) Financial stability, (4) Banking financial services, (5) Non-banking financial services, (6) Financial markets, and (7) Financial access. Pillar (4) is constructed from bond markets, stock markets, foreign exchange markets, and derivative markets. Pillar (5) includes a country's IPO activity, namely the IPO market share, IPO proceeds amount, and IPOs share of world IPOs. The stock market index provides a short-term account of financial activities, whereas the FDI provides a long-term broader account of the financial structure and health of an economy. As the performance and success of a given monetary policy would less likely be judged on short-term dynamics, it seems sensible to use the annual FDI as one of several economic and country attributes in a policy evaluation of Inflation Targeting. The paper offers a potential outcomes analysis of the impact of inflation targeting on inflation and inflation volatility, and focuses on advanced economies that adopt inflation targeting as a formal monetary policy. In order to deal with the counterfactual question, namely what would be the inflation rate for an adopting country had it not adopted this policy, the paper offers a new matching technique that subsumes the traditional propensity scores methods as a special case. The paper has different proposals for assessing matching based on the whole distribution of any scores. Additionally, the paper goes beyond the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and examines the entire distribution of inflation and its variability. It is found that the adoption of inflation targeting has helped lower inflation (not just the mean) for the targeting countries. However, it is shown that exact numerical quantification of this policy effect is as highly subjective as choosing ideal social welfare functions. The paper also finds no evidence of a larger gain for late adopters of inflation targeting. As for inflation variability, there is some robust evidence of small and often statistically insignificant reduction in variability due to targeting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The approach is based on using mixtures of double exponential or normal distributions as priors for correlation parameters, and on maximizing the resulting log-posterior (or penalized likelihood) using a stochastic optimization algorithm. The mixture priors are capable of clustering the correlations in several groups, each with separate mean and variance, and can therefore capture a large variety of structures besides sparsity. We apply this approach to the normal linear multivariate regression model as well as several other models that are popular in the literature but have not been previously studied for the purpose of regularization, including multivariate t, normal and t copulas, and mixture of normal distributions. Simulation experiments show the potential for large efficiency gains in estimating the density of the observations in all these models.

Our main results are as follows. First, bank shareholders fare significantly better with successful debt renegotiation by borrower firms than with the filing of a reorganization petition. Second, the stock market differentiates between reorganizations filed for opportunistic purposes and those reflecting formal financial resolutions. Third, the initial choice between debt renegotiation and reorganization filing is closely associated with the firm's bank relationships. However, this varies according to the relative bargaining power of firms and their banks, with the likelihood of successful debt renegotiation increasing with the bargaining power of the distressed firm. This suggests that a debtor-friendly bankruptcy system does not necessarily enhance the efficiency of the resolution of financial distress in a financial system where banks are the dominant providers of capital.","[Huang, Jiang-Chuan] TransWorld Univ, Dept Finance, Touliu, Taiwan; [Huang, Chin-Sheng; Lin, Hueh-Chen] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology,"Huang, JC (通讯作者)，1221 Zhennan Rd, Douliu City 640, Yunlin County, Taiwan.",g9320810@yuntech.edu.tw,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

At the heart of the reform package was the Hartz IV law, which resulted in a significant cut in the unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed. The paper develops a macroeconomic model with search and incomplete markets, calibrates the model economy to German data and institutions, and uses the calibrated model economy to simulate the effects of the Hartz reforms, and in particular Hartz IV, on the German labor market. The paper finds that the Hartz IV reform reduced the noncyclical unemployment rate in Germany by 1.4 percentage points. Employed workers benefited from the Hartz IV reform in welfare terms, but unemployed workers lost. It further finds that the Hartz I-III reforms reduced the noncyclical unemployment rate in Germany by 1.5 percentage points. Finally, the authors' analysis suggests that the Hartz reforms contributed to the good performance of the German labor market during the Great Recession.","[Krebs, Tom] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Scheffel, Martin] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Mannheim; University of Cologne,"Krebs, T (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",,"Scheffel, Martin/IST-9508-2023","Scheffel, Martin/0000-0002-9370-2321; Krebs, Tom/0000-0002-2500-4118",,,,,43,46,45,0,32,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

However, during housing booms, innovations to Expectations of Rising House Prices unrelated to News on Business Conditions account for a large part of macroeconomic fluctuations.

Our analysis reveals that FDI promotes exports in most panel observations, especially exports from physical-capital-intensive (PCI), human-capital-intensive (HCI) and technology-intensive (TI) industries. Yet by applying a differentiated cross-section-effect model, we determine that the export-generating potential of FDI is stronger in PCI, HCI and TI industries than in natural-resource-intensive or unskilled-labour-intensive industries, in which Indonesia has a comparative advantage. We also assess the influence of other determinants of export performance - namely, private domestic capital investment, GDP growth and exchange rates.

One commission structure is the currently used structure in the industry where both the seller's broker and the buyer's broker each receive a percentage of the sales price as their compensation from the seller. In an alternative commission structure, while the seller's broker still receives a percentage of the sales price from the seller, the buyer's broker is compensated by the buyer and the compensation is inversely related to the sales price. We find that how the buyer's broker gets compensated has significant implications. While both commission structures yield a similar probability of reaching an agreement, the alternative commission structure yields a lower price and a longer time to reach an agreement. Furthermore, the alternative commission structure achieves a better alignment of the interests of the buyer and the buyer's broker without affecting the earnings of the players in the transaction. We also find that the improvement in the alignment of interests is more significant for female buyers than for male buyers. Furthermore, a higher listing price by the seller and a higher initial bid price by the buyer each lead to a significant increase in the negotiated price. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, the empirical evidence on human capital externalities has been scarce and inconclusive. The missing evidence appears to be caused by misleading comparisons between private and social rates of return, by incorrect interpretations of regression coefficients, or by an inappropriate level of aggregation. Our own estimates point to relatively robust empirical evidence for a human capital externality that is about twice as large as a benchmark estimate, which is derived from a standard parameterization of a simple growth model. We ponder a possible causal link from human capital to social capital in the context of alternative views of long run development and argue that the grand transition view (Paldam 2002) is compatible with the existence of a large human capital externality.","[Thoennessen, Rasmus] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Gundlach, Erich] Univ Hamburg, GIGA Inst Asian Studies, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Gundlach, Erich] GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Hamburg; German Institute of Global & Area Studies; German Institute of Global & Area Studies,"Gundlach, E (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, GIGA Inst Asian Studies, Rothenbaumchaussee 32, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",rasmus.thoennessen@wiso.uni-hamburg.de; erich.gundlach@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,69,6,7,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2013,157.0,3-4,,,SI,,671,689,,10.1007/s11127-013-0080-z,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,269AT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328213100015,0

Using data on acquisitions among mutual fund management companies from 1991 to 2004, I estimate a two-sided matching model of the merger market jointly with equations representing merger outcomes. According to the empirical investigation, although the desire to achieve a sufficient scale to attract investors is a key driver for mergers, some mergers seem to be driven by objectives other than shareholder value maximization. I find that companies that are potentially prone to misaligned incentives between owners and managers are more acquisitive than others, yet have significantly worse post-merger operating performance.

The resultant literature has discussed the concept of private property and the characteristics of a public good, and offered an economic analysis of the status of lighthouses. This contribution sets out to situate the debate in the context of an economic policy for which the lighthouse is an asset subject to political rent seeking. Thus, it highlights the fact that the characteristics of rivalry and exclusion, which define the public good, are in fact influenced by governments, which decide the nature of the services produced by lighthouses. The weight of the institutional setting, together with political competition for the control of lighthouses, calls for interpretation relating to rent seeking. In this respect, the lighthouse, prior to being a capital asset, has already emerged as a political object that is a source of revenue for certain individuals.","Univ Paris Est, Ifsttar, Noisy Le Grand, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Carnis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, Ifsttar, Noisy Le Grand, France.",laurent.carnis@ifsttar.fr,"Carnis, Laurent/AAZ-2030-2021","carnis, laurent/0000-0001-8557-1424",,,,,22,13,15,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2013,157.0,1-2,,,,,51,56,,10.1007/s11127-012-9951-y,0.0,,,6,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,213WI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324090700005,0

The private sector, municipal government, and community often play competing roles in land-use decision-making processes that may include, or exclude, TOD. In the case of Ogden, Utah, the role of the city as a growth machine, or economic engine, in which private investment and gain is privileged over the communal, is differentiated from community based input in the efforts to shape that place. A close look at the city's transit proposals reveals that there is a need for balance within the triad of privatism, government, and community. As the case study presented here demonstrates, the role and importance of community activism in selecting appropriate transit and defining place should not be underestimated nor overlooked. Identification of the sources of tension between government, business, and community actors and within the public (government) sector (e.g., the mayor's office versus city council) could be instructive to communities both within the United States and abroad that may face similar land-use conflicts and transit challenges. Issues of zoning and route selection are also shown to be key variables in TOD planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Working with a large, anonymous money manager, we create an exogenous and sizeable shock to the supply of lendable shares by taking high loan fee stocks in the manager's portfolio and randomly making available and withholding stocks from the lending market. The experiment ran in two independent phases: the first, from September 5 to 18, 2008, with over $580 million of securities lent, and the second, from June 5 to September 30, 2009, with over $250 million of securities lent. While the supply shocks significantly reduce market lending fees and raise quantities, we find no evidence that returns, volatility, skewness, or bid-ask spreads are affected.

More specifically, I allow each partisan voter to contribute to her preferred candidate where the amount contributed depends on the relative positions of the two candidates. Candidates then use the donations to build valence through campaigning, which in turn affects the voting decision of impressionable voters. Since candidates are concerned with raising money as well as picking a policy position preferred by the median voter, I show that campaign contributions may lead to divergent equilibria in winner-take-all elections when politicians are policy-motivated, albeit only under stylized utility functions and donor densities. Further, under symmetric voter and donor densities, if either the donor density is single-peaked or the voter utility is concave, a unique equilibrium exists in which both candidates propose the ideal policy of the median voter.","Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02108 USA",Suffolk University,"Lambie-Hanson, T (通讯作者)，Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, 73 Tremont St, Boston, MA 02108 USA.",tslambie-hanson@suffolk.edu,,,,,,,20,1,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2013,157.0,1-2,,,,,3,24,,10.1007/s11127-012-9927-y,0.0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,213WI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324090700002,0

The case studies also illustrate that subcontracting is often a fragile strategy that leads to the eventual reabsorption of subcontracted tasks. We argue that the fragility of subcontracting the harvest rests on the inability of producers and labour contractors to negotiate a relationship that favours collaboration and problem solving. This failure is at the root of the high transaction costs of harvest subcontracting that force producers to resort to ancillary investments or sanctions, or to reabsorb some or all of the delegated tasks. A mismatch of resources and technical competence between producers and harvest labour contractors also contributes to inadequate performance of services. It is thus not surprising that harvest labour contractors are not always permanent fixtures; they may appear, disappear and reappear, particularly in fresh fruit export industries.","[Ortiz, Sutti] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02130 USA; [Aparicio, Susana] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Gino Germani Inst, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Tadeo, Nidia] Univ Nacl La Plata, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Boston University; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of La Plata,"Ortiz, S (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, 35 Greenough Ave, Boston, MA 02130 USA.",sortiz@bu.edu,,,,,,,88,8,11,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We show how the optimal inspection/penalty regime differs from the symmetric information case. Departing from previous literature, we allow for technical assistance, a policy instrument specifically permitted and commonly employed under Article 9 of the World Trade Organization Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement. We find the information asymmetry can make it optimal for the importing country to provide technical assistance grants for exporter risk abatement, even if it would otherwise be inefficient. Further, we show that fungibility of technical assistance with inputs in other sectors of the exporting economy affects the qualitative nature of optimal policy. If technical assistance has no outside value in the exporter's country, optimal policy is characterized by a menu of contracts balancing higher tariffs with lower penalties for being caught with an invasive. If technical assistance can be used in other sectors of the exporter's economy, it can introduce countervailing incentives making a uniform tariff/penalty combination optimal.","[Fernandez, Linda] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, Richmond, VA USA; [Sheriff, Glenn] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, Washington, DC 20460 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Sheriff, G (通讯作者)，US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave 1809T NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",lmfernandez@vcu.edu; sheriff.glenn@epa.gov,,"Sheriff, Glenn/0000-0001-9642-5529",,,,,24,5,5,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We focus on job tenure as an indicator of a good quality job match after unemployment. We match two sets of Japanese administrative data compiled by the public employment security offices: one includes information about the circumstances of job seekers receiving unemployment insurance, and the other includes information about job seekers applying for jobs. We first show a negative relationship between unemployment duration and the subsequent job duration. Restricting the sample to job seekers who changed search behaviors in the final 59 days before expiration of unemployment insurance, we secondly show an even greater negative effect of unemployment duration on the following job duration. The importance lies not only in the duration of unemployment. If job seekers keep a high reservation wage and a low search intensity because of the benefits of unemployment insurance, and change them in response to the expiration of insurance, prolonged unemployment will result in short job duration after unemployment.

This finding is in line with the small or insignificant macroeconomic impact of aid found in earlier studies and also suggests that exporters in recipient countries are not benefiting from improved trade relations with donors.","[Nowak-Lehmann, Felicitas; Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada; Cardozo, Adriana] Univ Gottingen, Iberoamer Inst Econ Res, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Nowak-Lehmann, Felicitas] Univ Gottingen, Ctr European Governance & Econ Dev Res, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Iberoamer Inst Econ Res, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [Herzer, Dierk] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth Dev & Transi, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Universitat Jaume I; University of Hamburg; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Nowak-Lehmann, F (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Iberoamer Inst Econ Res, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",fnowak@uni-goettingen.de; imartin@uni-goettingen.de; herzer@hsu-hh.de; sklasen@uni-goettingen.de; acardoz@uni-goettingen.de,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557; Cardozo Silva, Adriana R./0000-0003-4635-0287",,,,,65,30,35,0,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

It draws on a British cross-sectional data set that includes individual self-reported life satisfaction, household income and experienced domestic violence. The paper estimates the costs of domestic violence as the compensating variation of domestic violence resulting from estimating a life satisfaction regression equation. Some attempts to deal with the problem of self-selection into abusive relationships and to account for the endogeneity of household income are discussed and implemented. The results suggest that domestic violence is costed very highly by its victims, with estimates ranging from 27,000 pound to over 70,000 pound. Hence this paper contributes to the literature on valuing non-marketable goods and discusses the usefulness of a life satisfaction approach when estimating the costs of domestic violence.

Building upon three recent world-wide surveys on bank regulation (Barth et al., 2004, 2006, 2008), we contribute to this assessment by examining whether bank regulation, supervision and monitoring enhance or impede bank operating efficiency. Based on an un-balanced panel analysis of 4050 banks observations in 72 countries over the period 1999-2007, we find that tighter restrictions on bank activities are negatively associated with bank efficiency, while greater capital regulation stringency is marginally and positively associated with bank efficiency. We also find that a strengthening of official supervisory power is positively associated with bank efficiency only in countries with independent supervisory authorities. Moreover, independence coupled with a more experienced supervisory authority tends to enhance bank efficiency. Finally, market-based monitoring of banks in terms of more financial transparency is positively associated with bank efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In out-of-sample tests, top liquidity timers outperform bottom timers by 4.0-5.5% annually on a risk-adjusted basis. We also find that it is important to distinguish liquidity timing from liquidity reaction, which primarily relies on public information. Our results are robust to alternative explanations, hedge fund data biases, and the use of alternative timing models, risk factors, and liquidity measures.

Traditional Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition framework with constant elasticity of substitution utility and common productivity across firms fail to capture the extensive margin. To address this problem, this paper introduces continuum-quadratic utility while keeping the other assumptions unchanged and finds that lowering productivity affects not only the intensive but extensive margin as well. This paper highlights the importance of a second channel and argues that this channel should taken into account while calculating the loss of welfare due to a decrease in productivity. Hence, this paper suggests that alternative class of utility specifications (other than constant elasticity of substitution) have to receive more attention with monopolistic competition framework.","Ankara Univ, Dept Econ, Siyasal Bilgiler Fak, TR-06590 Ankara, Turkey",Ankara University,"Göksel, T (通讯作者)，Ankara Univ, Dept Econ, Siyasal Bilgiler Fak, Cemal Gursel Cad, TR-06590 Ankara, Turkey.",tgoksel@ankara.edu.tr,"Goksel, Turkmen/AAH-1410-2020",,,,,,7,1,1,0,7,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

On Improving Residential Energy Efficiency in Canada,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY-ANALYSE DE POLITIQUES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Residential energy efficiency; building retrofits; household energy use; dwelling characteristics; energy efficiency behaviour,POLICY,"The main use of energy in the residential sector in Canada is for space heating. Reductions in residential energy use, therefore, are likely to be achieved primarily through energy-saving retrofits, such as improved insulation. Reasons advanced to explain the foot-dragging of the residential sector in this regard are examined here, along with various policy options. Canadian survey data from 2003 are used to examine and compare the most energy-inefficient households who saw no need for retrofits with other households who provided a similar response, with a view to assessing whether there are factors that can be exploited to increase the uptake of such retrofits. The results suggest there is likely to be no quick fix. In the absence of large retrofit subsidies, with their accompanying free-rider problem, or a multi-pronged strategy that includes a whole array of policy instruments, including one that changes the relative importance of energy costs in household budgets, the outlook for sizeable improvements in residential energy efficiency in Canada via residential retrofits does not appear to be overly promising.","[Ryan, David L.] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada; [bin Jahangir, Junaid] MacEwan Univ, Dept Anthropol Econ & Polit Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Ryan, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada.",,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,8,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The contribution of the encomienda to the destruction of Indian populations was recognized by Spanish authorities at the time, yet the Crown persisted in introducing the most destructive form of the institution during the early stage of each colonial venture for over 200 years. Because the Crown financed the defense of its colonial possessions against other European imperialists, an addition to colonial capital, by increasing the return to an aggressor, imposed a defense-cost externality on the Crown. Since the cost of defending additional assets was higher in the Americas than in Spain, an efficient policy would have been to encourage the rapid transformation of human services into durable assets that could be transported to Spain. According to our defense-externality argument, the temporary encomienda and its parallel modification in each colonial episode becomes a rational Crown policy. The administration of Spain's distant colonial possessions, especially the adjustments in the restrictions on encomiendas, required information about the local conditions, and we argue that the Church, as designated protector of the Indians, may have played an unwitting role in the communication of information.","[Batchelder, Ronald W.] Pepperdine Univ, Malibu, CA 90263 USA; [Sanchez, Nicolas] Coll Holy Cross, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Pepperdine University; College of the Holy Cross,"Batchelder, RW (通讯作者)，Pepperdine Univ, Malibu, CA 90263 USA.",ron.batchelder@pepperdine.edu; nsanchez@hollycross.edu,,,,,,,36,11,17,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2013,156.0,1-2,,,,,45,60,,10.1007/s11127-012-9953-9,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,164WW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320443600004,0

Network change has the potential to impact on user's participation in social and economic activities both positively and negatively, the latter by reinforcing isolation and barriers to opportunity. At the same time, devolved governments across the United Kingdom continue to emphasise the role of transport in combating exclusion, and the need to address transport disadvantage through strategic policy and practical deliverables. It is within this context that the public bus service in Belfast underwent both network and organisational transformation from 'City-bus' to 'Metro' in 2005. This paper reports on recently completed academic research that examined the relationship between network transformation and transport disadvantage. Whilst the research study encompassed a variety of social groups including women, young adults and elderly people this paper specifically details the experience of low-income households. With an emphasis on methodology, the paper proposes a multi-phased method for evaluating the impact of change in urban areas. By using qualitative and quantitative methods, including the modelling of geographic information, the research tests a model for implementing and on-going monitoring of network change. The Belfast experience demonstrates how network transformation can have differentiated impacts, with the argument that these could have been mitigated by more fully understanding the implications arising from change. The lesson to be applied elsewhere is that 'unintended consequences' are a matter to be considered by policy makers, if possible before transformation occurs rather than working in the aftermath.

Travel times by different travel modes form an essential part of such an analysis. This paper aims to assess the comparability of different methods for calculating travel time by different travel modes. First, we briefly review the methods used in previous studies and identify different typical approaches, which we then compare. We use three computational models respectively for car and public transport (PT), implemented in our case study area, the capital region of Finland. In the car models, (1) the simple model ignores congestion and parking in travel time calculation; (2) the intermediate car model accounts for congestion but ignores parking; and (3) the more advanced car model takes into account all parts of the journey, including congestion and parking. For PT, (1) the simple model accounts for transit routes but ignores schedules; (2) the intermediate model incorporates schedule data in a simplistic way; and (3) the more advanced model adopts a door-to-door approach where true schedules (incl. congestion) and realistic route combinations are accounted for. Our results show that absolute differences in car and PT travel times are notable in the Greater Helsinki area, no matter which models are used for comparison. Modal travel time disparity appears smallest in the city centre area. We conclude that using conceptually corresponding models for car and PT travel time calculations is the key to achieving a reliable analysis of modal accessibility disparity. A door-to-door approach in travel time calculations (adopted in the most advanced models) also makes the results truly comparable in absolute terms. Finally, the more advanced the applied methods are, the more data hungry the analysis is. Here, recent developments in open data policies among urban transport data producers become very helpful.

The loan officers collect field data, meet with applicants, and make recommendations to the credit committee, which has the final say on both loan approval and loan size (LS). The loan officer's subjectivity is captured through gender bias. Our estimations indeed show subjective gender gap in LS. This gap is almost exclusively attributable to loan officers. We interpret this finding as evidence that, despite monitoring and wage incentivization, microcredit officers let their subjective preferences interfere with loan granting.

With the presence of credit frictions and interest rate rigidity, we examine the dynamics between housing prices, housing consumption and interest rates in response to policy shocks and exchange rate shocks. Unanticipated monetary contraction and currency depreciation decrease collateral-constrained households' housing consumption in accordance with lower home prices, less availability of domestic borrowing and lower lending rates. Compared to a closed economy, policy shocks have larger spillover effects on housing consumption in an open economy since the availability of foreign borrowing magnifies the impact of declining housing prices.

It has been both deeper and longer, but also the composition of the cutbacks in consumption expenditures differs, with a greater reliance on cuts to nondurable expenditure than was seen in previous recessions, and the distributional pattern across individuals differs. The young have cut back expenditure more than the old, as have mortgage holders compared with renters. By contrast, the impact of the recession has been similar across education groups. We present evidence that suggests that two aspects of fiscal policy in the UK in 2008 and 2009 - the temporary reduction in the rate of VAT and a car scrappage scheme - had some success in encouraging households to increase durable purchases.","[Crossley, Thomas F.] Koc Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Crossley, Thomas F.; Low, Hamish] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [O'Dea, Cormac] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",Koc University; University of Cambridge; University of London; University College London,"Crossley, TF (通讯作者)，Koc Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",Thomas_c@ifs.org.uk; hamish.low@econ.cam.ac.uk; cormac_o@ifs.org.uk,,"Low, Hamish/0000-0002-6064-9448; Crossley, Thomas/0000-0003-0952-7450",,,,,21,24,25,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

This research comes in the context of a slowly developing research based on empirical data in Romania in this area. However, best practices need to be promoted in order to stimulate change, in an increasingly complex and competitive environment, and with fewer resources available to organizations. By an in-depth longitudinal case study, we illustrate how both the ERP system and the case organization evolved, triggering a fit which consequently led to improving organizational performance. The paper has practical contributions for the Romanian business environment, in that Romanian managers and IT employees might become aware how they can leverage their ERP system to exploit its fuller potential, and regarding the importance of the organizational context for the implementation and post-implementation processes.","[Dumitru, Valentin Florentin; Albu, Nadia; Albu, Catalin Nicolae; Dumitru, Madalina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dumitru, VF (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",valentin.dumitru@cig.ase.ro,"Dumitru, Valentin Florentin E/N-2862-2014; Dumitru, Madalina/C-3885-2011; Dumitru, Madalina/AAC-5123-2022; Albu, Nadia/AAT-5491-2020; Albu, Catalin/A-5735-2010","Dumitru, Madalina/0000-0001-9159-6302; Dumitru, Madalina/0000-0001-9159-6302; Albu, Nadia/0000-0003-2953-9619; Albu, Catalin/0000-0002-3282-8414",,,,,44,15,15,0,44,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2013,15.0,34,,,,,518,531,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,156XV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319858100016,0

The results confirm the existence of a strong interdependence between export and R&D activities. Indeed, engaging in export (R&D) activities will increase a firm's chances of also engaging in R&D (export) activities. This, in turn, increases firms' chances of succeeding in export (R&D) activities. Additionally, once we control for firm heterogeneity, strong persistence still remains in each activity due to true state dependence. The results are robust in the use of alternative measures of internationalization (i.e. imports) and innovative activities (product and process innovation).","[Esteve-Perez, Silviano] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Rodriguez, Diego] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 2, Madrid 28233, Spain",University of Valencia; Complutense University of Madrid,"Esteve-Pérez, S (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",sesteve@uv.es; drodri@ccee.ucm.es,"ESTEVE, SILVIANO/AAD-2029-2021","ESTEVE, SILVIANO/0000-0001-8096-6259",,,,,58,71,77,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

To estimate credit supply changes, we apply an original approach based on stochastic frontier analysis. We use quarterly data for Russian banks covering the period from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2009. Our findings suggest that bank ownership affected credit supply during the financial crisis and that the crisis led to an overall decrease in the credit supply. Relative to domestic private banks foreign-owned banks reduced their credit supply more and state-controlled banks less. This supports the hypothesis that foreign banks have a lack of loyalty to domestic actors during a crisis, as well as the view that an objective function of state-controlled banks leads them to support the economy during economic downturns.

The empirical study shows that the GARCH implied VIX is consistently and significantly lower than the CBOE VIX for all kinds of GARCH model investigated when they are estimated with returns only. When jointly estimated with both returns and VIX, the parameters are distorted unreasonably, and the GARCH implied VIX still cannot fit the CBOE VIX from various statistical aspects. The source of this discrepancy is then theoretically analyzed. We conclude that the GARCH option pricing under the LRNVR fails to incorporate the price of volatility or variance risk premium.","[Hao, Jinji] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Zhang, Jin E.] Univ Otago, Otago Business Sch, Dept Accountancy & Finance, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Zhang, Jin E.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Washington University (WUSTL); University of Otago; University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jinzhang@hku.hk,,"Hao, Jinji/0000-0003-0679-1002",,,,,40,50,56,1,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

This abnormal performance reflects time-varying systematic risks and local-trading induced mispricing. Consistent with the mispricing explanation, the evidence of predictability is stronger among firms with low visibility and high local ownership.

But these models tend to treat physical capital as malleable, capable of reallocation among sectors over the time-period for which equilibrium is solved. Because the extent to which capital adjustment costs might dampen reallocation is not well understood, there is concern that CGE assessments understate the true costs of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction policies. This paper uses a multi-region, multi-sector CGE model to investigate cap-and-trade schemes, such as the European Union Emission Trading System which cover a subset of the economy, elucidating the effects of capital malleability on GHG abatement, the potential for emission leakage from abating to non-abating sectors, and the impacts on welfare. To simplify the complex interactions being simulated within the CGE model, that analysis is complemented with an analytical model. A partial climate policy results in negative internal carbon leakage, with emissions declining not only in capped sectors but also in non-regulated ones. This result is stronger when capital is intersectorally mobile. Interestingly, in partial climate policy settings capital malleability can amplify or attenuate welfare losses depending on the attributes of the economy.","[Lanzi, Elisa] FEEM, I-30124 Venice, Italy; [Wing, Ian Sue] Boston Univ, Deparment Geog & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Fondazione Mattei; Boston University,"Lanzi, E (通讯作者)，FEEM, I-30124 Venice, Italy.",elisa.lanzi@feem.it; isw@bu.edu,,,,,,,42,7,8,0,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Probabilistic methods are used to characterize the uncertainty of rates of deterrence, detection, and disruption, as well as losses. Since homeland security decisionmakers tend to be risk-averse because of the catastrophic or dire nature of the hazard or event, utility theory and Monte Carlo simulation methods are used to propagate uncertainties in calculations of net present value, expected utility, and probabilities of net benefit. We employ a break-even cost-benefit analysis to determine the minimum probability of an otherwise successful attack that is required for the benefit of security measures to equal their cost. In this context, we examine specific policy options: including Improvised Physical Secondary Barriers (IPSBs) in the array of aircraft security measures, including the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS), and including them both. Attack probabilities need to exceed 260 percent or 2.6 attacks per year to be 90 percent sure that FAMS is cost-effective, whereas IPSBs have more than 90 percent chance of being cost-effective even if attack probabilities are as low as 6 percent per year. A risk-neutral analysis finds a policy option of adding IPSBs but not FAMS to the other measures to be preferred for all attack probabilities. However, a very risk-averse decisionmaker is 48 percent likely to prefer to retain FAMS even if the attack probability is as low as 1 percent per yeara level of risk aversion exhibited by few, if any, government agencies. Overall, it seems that, even in an analysis that biases the consideration toward the opposite conclusion, far too much may currently be spent on security measures to address the problem of airline hijacking, and many spending reductions could likely be made with little or no consequent reduction of security.

The post-globalization inequality is a non-monotonic function of the pre-globalization proportion of skilled workers and of the globalization intensity.

However, higher test scores could signal higher academic value-added or higher ability, more sought-after intakes. In our research, we show that both school value-added and student prior achievement - linked to the background of children in schools - affect households' demand for education. In order to identify these effects, we improve the boundary discontinuity regression methodology by matching identical properties across admissions authority boundaries; by allowing for boundary effects and spatial trends; by re-weighting our data towards transactions that are closest to district boundaries; by eliminating boundaries that coincide with major geographical features; and by submitting our estimates to a number of novel falsification tests.

Evidence from Census data for four English cities,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Light rail; Car ownership; Census data; Travel mode change; Mode share; New rail schemes,METROLINK; IMPACTS; PLAN,"The paper examines, using English Census data, the impacts of four light rail schemes opened between 1991 and 2001 on car ownership and travel mode along the rail corridors. The effects of these schemes are isolated by comparing the changes in the new light rail corridors with those in 'control' areas. Control areas represent what would have occurred in the light rail corridors if the schemes had not been built. Despite two schemes achieving and even exceeding the forecast ridership, the proportion of households owning multiple cars increased in the light rail corridors and typically by more than in the control areas. Growing rail shares in the light rail corridors have mainly come from buses and the evidence for light rail reducing car use is less clear. This latter finding is of particular significance, given that a major justification for investment in light rail rather than bus schemes is their presumed ability to bring about major modal shift by attracting substantial numbers of car users.

It is analytically relevant to examine the degree of instability inherent to a distribution and, in the analysed case, the likelihood that the distribution and its evolution will increase or decrease the chances of reaching an agreement on climate policy. Two approaches were used to measure polarisation: the endogenous approach, in which countries are grouped according to their similarity in terms of emissions, and the exogenous approach, in which countries are grouped geographically. Our findings indicate a clear decrease in polarisation since the mid-1990s, which can essentially be explained by the fact that the different groups have converged (i.e. antagonism among the CO2 emitters has decreased) as the contribution of energy intensity to between-group differences has decreased. This lower degree of polarisation in CO2 distribution suggests a situation more conducive to the possibility of reaching EU-wide agreements on the mitigation of CO2 emissions.","[Antonio Duro, Juan] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, CREIP, Reus 43204, Spain; [Padilla, Emilio] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Padilla, E (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola, Spain.",juanantonio.duro@urv.es; emilio.padilla@uab.es,"Padilla Rosa, Emilio/J-8332-2013","Padilla Rosa, Emilio/0000-0002-9510-8262",,,,,28,19,19,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

First, we find that both the dollar volume and return on the peak day of the spam campaigns (SCs) are significantly higher compared to those on randomly selected non-spam dates. In addition, SCs reduce the number of zero trading days while the campaign is underway. Second, e-mails with a target price have significantly higher abnormal dollar volume and abnormal return on the peak day of the SC than e-mails without a target price. Thus, individual investors favor bets with unambiguous payoffs, which supports the ambiguity hypothesis. Finally, when the target price indicated in spam e-mails is about 53times the current price, the abnormal return of the SC peaked at 31%. We document a nonlinear relationship between abnormal return on the peak day of the SCs and the premium implied in the spam e-mails. Although investors overweight low probability events, the overweighting decreases when the probability becomes out of reach.

Further, state banks have been found to lend to their cronies, especially around elections. In this paper, we study the lending activities of state-owned and private banks during the period 1992-2010 and analyze the relationship between the credit these banks provide and local economic growth in Turkey during crisis periods and in election years. We find that the share of state-owned banks in the credit market in crisis periods and local election years is significantly higher than their share in non-crisis and non-election periods. The per capita real credit that state-owned banks provide during crisis years is found to be positively associated with local growth in all provinces. Our results suggest that although state-owned banks might issue loans for political reasons in election periods, they also seem to play an important role in offsetting the adverse effects of economic shocks, especially in developed provinces.

By analyzing the trends and fluctuations of daily stock return correlations and default correlations among the 22 largest bank holding companies and investment banks from 1988 to 2008, we find that daily stock return correlation is a simple, robust, forward-looking, and timely systemic risk indicator. There is an increasing trend in stock return correlation among banks, whereas there is no obvious correlation trend among non-banks. We also disaggregate the stock returns into systematic and idiosyncratic components and find that the correlation increases are largely driven by the increases in correlations between banks' idiosyncratic risks, which give rise to increasing systemic risk. Correlation spikes tend to predict or coincide with significant economic or market events, especially during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, we show that stock return correlations offer a perspective on the level of systemic risk in the financial sector that is not already captured by default correlations. Stock return correlations are not subject to data limitations or model specification errors that other potential systemic risk measures may face. Therefore, we recommend that regulators and businesses monitor daily stock return correlations among those large and highly leveraged financial institutions to track the level of systemic risk.

We document that commercial banks set up conduits to securitize assets worth $1.3 trillion while insuring the newly securitized assets using explicit guarantees. We show that regulatory arbitrage was an important motive behind setting up conduits. In particular, the guarantees were structured so as to reduce regulatory capital requirements, more so by banks with less capital, and while still providing recourse to bank balance sheets for outside investors. Consistent with such recourse, we find that conduits provided little risk transfer during the run, as losses from conduits remained with banks instead of outside investors and banks with more exposure to conduits had lower stock returns.

We distinguish between the decisions of whether or not to use a technology (inter-firm diffusion), and of how intensely to use a technology (intra-firm diffusion). The empirical model used accommodates several effects that have been postulated in the theoretical diffusion literature: firm and industry heterogeneity, strategic considerations and external effects. Data for 2,324 Swiss firms for the year 2008 is used, with separate information for four categories of energy-saving technology applications (electromechanical and electronic, motor vehicles and traffic engineering, construction, power-generating processes). The results reveal significant differences with respect to firm characteristics and adoption barriers between inter-firm and intrafirm diffusion. In practically all cases, positive net external effects of adoption can be found. Inducement effects, particularly those traced back to intrinsic motivations for environment-friendly technologies, show clearly positive effects on adoption behavior.","[Arvanitis, Spyros; Ley, Marius] ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Ley, M (通讯作者)，ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",arvanitis@kof.ethz.ch; ley@kof.ethz.ch,,,,,,,45,22,24,0,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The requirement to settle in cash with an option to settle physically leads to an unusual two-stage process. In the first stage, participants affect the amount of the bonds to be auctioned off in the second stage. Participants in the second stage may hold positions in derivatives on the assets being auctioned. We show that the final auction price might be either above or below the fair bond price because of strategic bidding on the part of participants holding CDS. Empirically, we observe both types of outcomes, with undervaluation occurring in most cases. We find that auctions undervalue bonds by an average of 6% on the auction day. Undervaluation is related positively to the amount of bonds exchanged in the second stage of the auction, as predicted by the theory.

This paper demonstrates the negative effects of positive international knowledge spillovers on economic growth. In other words, we obtain the possibility that educational investment for human capital is crowded out under global economic growth. To this end, we assume the phenomenon of international knowledge spillover, effects of population growth on human capital accumulation, and non-unity intertemporal elasticity of substitution in an endogenous growth model along the lines developed by Arnold. This model comprises R&D activities along the lines proposed by Jones and human capital accumulation along the lines proposed by Uzawa and Lucas. The results show that even if international spillover increases, low-growth traps without human capital investment emerge in some cases, for example, an economy with a large intertemporal elasticity of substitution and a high population growth rate.

We model cross-country variations of the microfounded economic freedom-corruption relationship using multilevel models. Additionally, we analyse this relationship by disentangling the determinants for several components of economic freedom because not all areas affect corruption equally. The results show that the extent of the macro-effects on the measures of (micro)economic freedom for corruption, identified by the degree of economic development of a country, can explain why a lack of competition policies and government regulations may yield more corruption.

Second, it conducts an overall assessment of the reforms implemented and highlights some open issues that were underscored by the crisis and that were only partially addressed afterward. It is argued that the framework for financial regulation and supervision in the EU after the crisis is still poorly equipped to deal with (or to prevent) future financial crises mainly because of the political constraints encountered during the reform process.

The empirical results show that share ownership by foreign institutions (both financial and non-financial) increases firm-level stock return volatility, even after controlling for a complete ownership structure, firm size, turnover, and leverage, and correcting for potential endogeneity problems. However, the results also show that foreign individual shareholdings reduce volatility. Furthermore, we document a positive relationship between domestic shareholdings (individual, institutional, and governmental) and firm-level stock return volatility. Empirical results with interaction terms show that foreign institutional ownership increases firm-level return volatility by strengthening the positive impact of liquidity on volatility.

The acquisition of this index was based on our own measurement methodology, starting from two classes of determinants for responsible supply chain management, with eight measuring variables, through the content analysis of various reports published by the World Economic Forum. The analysis of the correlation matrix established the intensity of the links between the proposed measuring variables. The application of the regression method on the multifactor econometric model has shown that responsible supply chain management is positively influenced by the GDP per capita, public services to improve business performance, infrastructure quality and performance of environmental actions. The results of the study have revealed that performance of responsible supply chain management depends rather on the national and local policies to stimulate social responsibility practices than on the level of economic development. Most of the time, organizations are concerned with the accountability of responsible supply chain management voluntarily, being aware of the long-term benefits to their business.","[Ganescu, Mariana Cristina; Asandei, Mihaela; Gangone, Andreea; Chirila, Camelia] Constantin Brancoveanu Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania",Constantin Brancoveanu University,"Ganescu, MC (通讯作者)，Constantin Brancoveanu Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania.",cristina_ganescu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,49,3,3,0,41,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2013,15.0,33,,,,,154,169,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,087FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314746900012,0

However, chartists face a considerable degree of trading uncertainty because technical indicators such as moving averages are essentially imperfect filters with a nonzero phase shift. Consequently, technical trading may result in erroneous trading recommendations and substantial losses. This paper presents an uncertainty reduction approach based on fuzzy logic that addresses two problems related to the uncertainty embedded in technical trading strategies: market timing and order size. The results of our high-frequency exercises show that 'fuzzy technical indicators' dominate standard moving average technical indicators and filter rules for the Euro-US dollar (EUR-USD) exchange rates, especially on high-volatility days.

Second, the presence of outside assets with negatively skewed returns can further increase the agency cost if the manager is incentivized to pursue outside opportunities. These effects motivate narrow mandates and tight tracking error constraints to most fund managers except those with exceptional talents. Our model sheds light on capital immobility and market segmentation that are widely observed in financial markets, and highlights important effects of negatively skewed risk on institutional incentive structures.

Without joint management, strengthening the MRC's governance has a huge potential to achieve welfare gains and it requires that the interests of all stakeholders be equally balanced. A bargaining approach shows that the LMB has no incentive to negotiate with China and is better off strengthening the MRC's governance instead.

The business-cycle component of consumption is extracted by employing a detrending filter adjusted for the length of a subject country's business cycles, rather than a standard detrending filter, and the cost of business cycles using the extracted component is extracted. Estimated costs in developing countries based on the adjusted filter are found to be significantly different from those based on the standard filter. Hence, in measuring the costs of business cycles in developing countries, we should be careful about the choice of a detrending filter. The results also indicate the following findings: 1) in developing countries, there is probably more room to improve the cost of non-business-cycle fluctuations than that of business-cycle fluctuations, and 2) the cost of business cycles is not strikingly large, even when it is estimated from a model strongly disfavoring business cycles.","Inst Econ Dev, Mihama Ku, Chiba 2618545, Japan",,"Kodama, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Dev, Mihama Ku, 3-2-2 Wakaba, Chiba 2618545, Japan.",mkodama@ide.go.jp,,,,,,,19,2,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Hence, through investigating the recent development of dry ports in four Brazilian states, the paper investigates how institutional framework affects the bureaucratic and logistical roles of dry ports in emerging economies.

We present a robust and intelligent Portable Batch System (PBS) implemented with petri-net segmentation and firing squad model with the integration of an external scheduling module that employs the Maui Scheduler which has full knowledge of the available queued jobs, running jobs and usable system resource.","[Adebiyi, Marion; Okujeni, Efe] Covenant Univ, Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Fatumo, Segun] Univ Cambridge, London, England",Covenant University; University of Cambridge,"Marion, (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria.",marion.adebiyi@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; efeokujeni@gmail.com; sf14@sanger.ac.uk,"Fatumo, Segun/W-5880-2019; Adebiyi, Marion Olubunmi/HZL-1145-2023; Fatumo, Segun/AAI-8845-2021","Adebiyi, Marion Olubunmi/0000-0001-7713-956X; Fatumo, Segun/0000-0003-4525-3362",,,,,7,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,2075,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500205,0

Today sixty-year-old person if not affected by any serious health handicap is still a person full of energy, power and, yet, mature and experienced enough to handle regular work tasks as well as unpredictable situations not possible to manage only by a routine approach. (Jensik, 2013) Currently, the Age Management Concept, i.e. personnel management considering age and changing skills of employees within organisation, starts to be applied and implemented to some extent within the human resources management area. Thus, the organisation management, with in this concept, should approach to every single employee differently, understand their individual needs, support their continuous growth or development, and, on the other hand, accept their limits or weaknesses. These weaknesses should be minimised or removed completely in the employee organisation management mutual synergy. It is, thus, obvious that each employee shall have other positives and other negatives not only regarding the gender, work performance or position, but also with regard to the biological age. In this context, Vortelova (2013) presents the research of Manpower conducted in 2007 and focused on individual generations of employees from the perspective of social categories for the area of human resources management. It involves five generations of employees in total where one generation is limited by the duration approximately of 15 years. It concerns the generation of Pre-Boomers: employees born before 1946, and further the generation of Baby Boomers: employees born within the years from 1947 to 1960. The third generation is the X Generation: employees born during the years from 1961 to 1975. Typical for this generation is that the people are willing to work hard, they have distinctive individualistic features, money means value for them, and they strive not to run into debts, they make clear decisions between their family and career, and have rather pessimistic view of the world. The third generation is called Y Generation: employees born during the years from 1976 to 1990. This generation only sees money as a mean and willingly run into debts, requires good remuneration for work, willingly changes working places and, usually, does not seek any sense in the job, and requires more flexible working hours. The fifth generation is indicated as Z Generation: employees born during the years from 1991 to 2005. This youngest generation is highly interconnected and globalised, is constantly online, and uses advanced means of communication and technology. Pillinger (2008) or Polcakova (2011) define the Age Management Concept as a complex approach leading to the solution of demographic changes at the work place, supporting age diversity and management of work processes within the physical and social environment. The article offers a view to some of the partial results of quantitative and qualitative research conducted within the author's doctoral thesis focused on specific aspects of personnel management of employees of the age category 50+ in conditions of Czech and Slovak organisations and, further, of TACR (Technology Agency of the Czech Republic) grant project, OMEGA Programme to support applied social-science research and experimental development, registration No. TD010129, Performance Potential of Employees 50+, and specific forms of companies' human resources management. The main purpose of the article is to initiate discussion over the Age Management Concept or philosophy itself. Does, therefore, the personnel management considering the age and changing skills of organisation employees mean an opportunity or, on the contrary, a threat for the complex operation of the whole organisation?","[Bejtkovsky, Jiri] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,bejtkovsky@fame.utb.cz,"Bejtkovsky, Jiri/B-2001-2018","Bejtkovsky, Jiri/0000-0003-1600-3487",,,,,18,1,1,5,20,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,805,813,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500077,0

We focus on studies that look at the distribution of costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies. We also examine potentially important trade-offs between efficiency and equity that arise in the context of environmental policy, as well as transition effects. In many of the applications surveyed here, environmental policies can be regressive. Strategies are discussed to reduce this regressivity through the use of revenues from certain policy instruments. With regard to the distribution of the benefits of environmental policy, we conclude that there is a need for more spatially disaggregated studies that simultaneously capture the spatial and socioeconomic impacts of environmental policy.","Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Bento, AM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",amb396@cornell.edu,"Bento, Antonio/ABC-2937-2020",,,,,,62,40,51,3,48,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Recently, Lu, Huang and Gerlach (2010) proposed a skewed-EWMA estimator to calculate Value-at-Risk (VaR) for individual financial assets that take into account their volatilities. Skewed-EWMA estimator is derived from the asymmetric Laplace distribution and considers both skewness and heavy tails of the return distribution. This method is adaptive to the time-varying nature in practice by adjusting shape parameter in the distribution. In this paper, we extend the skewed-EWMA procedure introduced by Lu and Li (2011) to estimate the risk of complex portfolios with dependencies modeled via Student t copula and Clayton copula. We develop Monte Carlo simulation procedure, which combines copula techniques with skewed-EWMA forecasting of the volatility of the risk factors and asymmetric Laplace distribution.

The first is that the majority of people weigh objective probabilities nonlinearly. The second regularity, although less commonly acknowledged, is that there is a large amount of heterogeneity in how people distort probabilities. Despite this, little effort has been made to identify the source of heterogeneity. We explore the possibility that personality type is linked to probability distortions. Using validated psychological questionnaires, we clustered participants into distinct personality types: motivated, impulsive, and affective. We found that the motivated participants viewed gambling as more attractive, whereas the impulsive participants were the most capable of discriminating non-extreme probabilities. Our results suggest that the observed heterogeneity in probability distortions may be explained by personality profiles, which can be elicited though standard psychological questionnaires.","[Capra, C.

Two problems hinder these debates the paucity of reliable data on small-scale agriculture, and lack of clarity on the meaning of terms such as smallholder and small-scale farmer. This paper applies class-analytic perspectives on social differentiation to critically examine these terms, and explores the prospects for accumulation from above and from below through agrarian reform, drawing on wider debates within the Southern African region. It focuses in particular on smallholder irrigation schemes, potentially a key focus of policy, and presents research findings on production and marketing of fresh produce in one such scheme in Tugela Ferry, KwaZulu-Natal. Survey data show that farming households combine agriculture and various forms of off-farm labour, as is often the case throughout the region, and that accumulation in small-scale agriculture is constrained by a number of factors, including the inherited and largely untransformed agrarian class structure of South Africa. In this context, expanded access to land and water is a necessary but not sufficient condition for such accumulation; wider structural change is also required.","Univ Western Cape, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Cousins, B (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",bcousins@uwc.ac.za,,,,,,,67,87,103,1,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

It is important to realise, however, that the improving mortality may sooner or later cause the discussed problem of the ageing of the population. Scientists state that the human body can live up to 120 years. Naturally this assumes that will be found a cure for the diseases that are the most frequent causes of death. If a cure could be found for these diseases, then people could be living to the age of 120 years by 2070. More and more often people are asking what proportion of the extra years would one live through in health and what proportion in illness? In this context the indicator of the healthy life expectancy is used. In this paper we compare the development of healthy and life expectancy in selected European countries and for selected ages.

This article develops an evaluation framework that takes the tensions between these two objectives into account. It then assesses the results of GBS in Nicaragua under two administrations.

Changes in the population structure can be projected and thus enable preparation in advance for development of regions and the business sector. Analyses show that the population ageing must be seen as a challenge and not as a threat. The diversity management policy and investments into human resources, incl. ageing employees, seem to be an alternative aimed at increasing their productivity and preserving required competencies so that to compensate changes in working force. Human resource management may implement new HR practices or adjust applied ones that conform to needs and possibilities of different generations.

The potential of global competitiveness that abounds in Nigeria can only be translated into real growth when corruption is reduced to its barest minimum and service delivery enhanced. The fourth republic (Obasanjo's administration) was characterized by the waging of a serious anti-corruption war which became its singsong throughout the eight years of rule. Beyond rhetorics, anti-graft agencies were established and enabled by appropriate legislations to investigate corruption cases, prosecute offenders and confiscate their properties. This research examines the transition conditions in which the crusade against corruption was waged during the Obasanjo years (1999 to 2007). It offers a critical assessment of the extent of results achieved during the years with regards to the resolve to stamp out corruption. Issues discussed, among other factors, include the anti-corruption initiatives engaged, the impact of the anti-corruption reforms, the existence of weak institutions, the dysfunctional electoral system and the ubiquitous presence of lack of leadership by example in the anti-corruption war. The study points out that although the anti-graft reforms had the potentials to reduce corruption and make Nigeria a globally competitive economic force, they were largely a failure due to the myriad of delivery challenges identified. It is against the background of the ongoing war against corruption in Nigeria that it proffers recommendations to bring to reality the laudable intentions of the anti-corruption fight in the country.","[Faboyede, Olusola Samuel; Mukoro, Oluku Dick; Oyewo, Babajide] Coll Dev Studies, Dept Accounting, Sch Business, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",,,samuel.faboyede@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; oluku.mukoro@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; jiide.oyewo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"OYEWO, BABAJIDE/ABG-5995-2022","OYEWO, BABAJIDE/0000-0002-4499-601X",,,,,16,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,2142,2154,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500211,0

A particular interest is given to the effects of government support policies. Almost all empirical studies on the determination of land prices either refer to the net present value method or the hedonic pricing approach. While the two approaches have different theoretical basis, they converge in their empirical implementation. Empirical studies use a broad range of variables to explain land values and we systematise these into six categories. In order to investigate the influence of different measures of government support on land prices, a meta-regression analysis is carried out based on 242 observations from 26 articles. Results indicate that a 10% decrease of agricultural support would decrease land prices by 3.3% to 5%. Therefore, a considerable part of farm subsidies is realized by initial owners of land instead of operating farmers. Results in regard to differences in capitalization for different support measures are ambiguous. Model assumptions, data structure and estimation techniques do have a significant influence on capitalization estimates.","[Feichtinger, Paul; Salhofer, Klaus] Tech Univ Munich, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Feichtinger, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Volkswirtschaftslehre Umweltokon & Agra, Alte Akad 14, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",Paul.Feichtinger@tum.de,"Salhofer, Klaus/ACN-4362-2022","Salhofer, Klaus/0000-0002-4119-648X",European Commission through the Factor Markets Project [245123-FP7-KBBE-2009-3],European Commission through the Factor Markets Project,The authors thank guest editor Alfons Balmann as well as two anonymous referees for their very helpful comments and suggestions.

By modelling an appropriate non linear model, we find no strong evidence in favour of the above commonly accepted view.

Improving the occupational self efficacy of elderly (50+) employees will prove vital for the sustainability of competitive advantage of those organizations. Tacit knowledge of elderly employees generates value addition. Implementation of HRM practices targeted at elderly employees has become topical with an increasingly ageing workforce globally. The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) mode is of specific significance in enhancing the occupational self efficacy of elderly employees. Studies have revealed that occupational self efficacy and motivation are positively related to the training effectiveness of those employees. It has been proven that employees with high occupational self-efficacy have confidence to test new behaviours that are demanded in careers. Empirical evidences suggest that leadership and mentoring initiatives can substantially improve the occupational self-efficacy of employees. This gives a clear indication about the potential role, and impact of managers and Human Resources professionals in the value addition to organisations and to the stakeholders.","[Jayawardena, L. N.

This makes the environment more competitive and therefore a need for corporate diversity is produced. This diversity may be fulfilled by a customer-centric approach and customer co-creation in service innovation. At first, the research is focused on customer-centric approach as whole. As a customer-centric approach are evaluated customer segmentation, feedback detection, solution of dissatisfaction, existence of loyalty system and evidence time between transactions. The second part of the research concerns the usage of customers as the source for the innovation process. As the proactive approach is considered direct participation of customers on innovation process, direct approaching of customer base, collaboration with lead-users in terms of service testing etc. As the reactive approach is considered service innovation based on complaints or compliments, warranty claims or social media monitoring. As a result, the research compares customer-centric approach between SMEs.

We find that both wage-earners who receive a lower income than predicted, i.e. have a negative residual, and those who receive a higher income than predicted, i.e. have a positive residual, are more likely to become self-employed than those who receive an income close to the predicted one. However, splitting self-employment into different types depending on corporate form and number of employees, we find that the self-employed are drawn from both tails of the residual distribution only if it is a matter of unincorporated firms. Wage-earners who become self-employed and start an incorporated firm are only drawn from the top of the residual distribution.

Because our analysis is based at the farming system level, we have been able to estimate the allocative (price) inefficiency of vegetable producers. Another significant finding of this study is that we have shown the economic inefficiency of each input under consideration. We have also applied a technique that calculates shadow prices of land and labor (for which no price information was available) using existing price information for diesel input under existing production inefficiencies. We found relatively large inefficiencies in the production of vegetables, both technical and allocative, whereas technical inefficiency played a relatively major role in overall inefficiency. As the model's results show, seed is economically the most inefficiently used input in producing vegetables.

The ability to access opportunities, services, social networks and other goods is highly dependent upon the ability to access private and/or public transport. However, there are many barriers to transport access for people with disabilities. This paper considers access to the transport system for those with a specific learning disability, namely, dyslexia. The paper reports results from a series of focus groups, which highlight the problems accessing and using travel information for this group. The contribution of inaccessible information to mobility-related social exclusion is highlighted. It is argued that there is a need for accessible information as a component of strategies to tackle mobility-related social exclusion. In this context, the paper presents a number of recommendations that may facilitate greater ease of use of private and public transport for those with dyslexia, with an emphasis upon actions to create more accessible information systems. Such improvements are likely to benefit those with other learning disabilities, while also improving the usability of information systems for non-disabled travellers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

I start by summarizing the evidence on cross-sectional return predictability and the failure of standard (consumption) capital asset pricing models (CAPMs) and their conditional versions to explain these predictability patterns. Part of the recent literature focuses on ad hoc factor models, which summarize the cross section of expected returns in parsimonious form, or on production-based approaches, which suggest links between firm characteristics and expected returns. Without imposing restrictions on investor preferences and beliefs, neither one of these two approaches can answer the question of why investors price assets the way they do. Within the rational expectations paradigm, recent research that imposes such restrictions has focused on the intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM), long-run risks models, as well as frictions and liquidity risk. Approaches based on investor sentiment have focused on the development of empirical proxies for sentiment and for the limits to arbitrage that allow sentiment to affect prices. Empirical work that considers learning and adaptation of investors has worked with out-of-sample tests of cross-sectional predictability.","[Nagel, Stefan] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Nagel, Stefan] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Nagel, Stefan] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nagel, Stefan] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 3PZ, England",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Nagel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",stenagel@umich.edu,,,,,,,172,26,31,2,45,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4805-2,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Consistent with these predictions, in some specifications, past style returns help explain future stock returns after controlling for size, book-to-market and past stock returns. We also use comovement to identify style investing and assess its impact on momentum. High comovement momentum portfolios have significantly higher future returns than low comovement momentum portfolios. Overall, our results suggest that style investing plays a role in the predictability of asset returns. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Yavuz, M.

The synthetic measure of development proposed by Zdzislaw Hellwig is one of the methods of linear arrangement. It enables the classification of companies in relation to the set variables, that are financial ratios and their relative growth rates. The purpose of the article is to choose which set variables (financial ratios or profitability ratios - their nominal values as well as their relative growth rates) should be used in order to point out the best quantile portfolio. Companies are divided into five quantile portfolios due to their position in the ranking that is constructed on the base of the synthetic measure of development. The author uses data of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2001 and 2011. The rankings and portfolios are built separately for each year. As a result, it can be stated that the second portfolio of the ranking constructed on the base of financial ratios is better than portfolios constructed on the base of profitability ratios.","[Wegrzyn, Tomasz] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Appl Math, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,,tomasz.wegrzyn@ue.katowice.pl,"Wegrzyn, Tomasz/X-6849-2018",,,,,,15,8,8,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1554,1564,,,,,,11,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100156,0

Employing China's provinces data during the period 2003-2010, the results firstly demonstrate that there is nonlinear relationship between technology gap and reverse technology spillover, and two threshold values of technology gap exist. In addition, positive reverse technology spillover exists in the high-level technology gap districts. Meanwhile, negative reverse technology spillover exists in the middle-level technology gap districts.

Current solvency regulations have been criticized for their focus on individual firms rather than the system as a whole. We show how an insurance program can be designed to deal with systemic risk through a risk charge on participating institutions. The risk charge is based on the generalized co-conditional tail expectation, a conditional risk measure adapted from conditional value-at-risk. Current regulations have been criticized on the grounds that their capital requirements are procyclical. They require extra capital in periods of extreme stress thus exacerbating a crisis. We show how to construct a countercyclical risk charge and illustrate the approach using a numerical example.","[Boyle, Phelim] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Kim, Joseph H.

We find evidence that (1) the disparate results in prior work stem from differences in both sample composition and empirical design, (2) on balance the results suggest a negative association between board busyness and firm performance, and (3) the inclusion of firm fixed effects dramatically affects the conclusions drawn from, and the explanatory power of, multivariate analyses. we also explore alternative empirical definitions of what constitutes a busy director and find that commonly used proxies for busyness perform well relative to more complex alternatives.

We find that family control curbs the level of CEO total and cash compensation, and the fraction of equity-based compensation. Moreover, we do not observe a significant effect of family control on the excess level of total and cash compensation. This evidence indicates that controlling families do not use CEO compensation to expropriate wealth from minority shareholders. We show that institutional ownership is associated with higher levels of CEO cash and total compensation in Continental Europe, especially in family firms. Also, foreign institutional investors have a positive and significant impact on CEO compensation level. Finally, results indicate that institutional investors affect CEO pay structure: they increase the use of equity-based compensation in both family and non-family firms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the 2004 Chilean health reforms that sought to regulate private insurers, and measure their effects on gender and age inequality. We find that reforms intended to decrease these inequalities largely failed. Analysis of this failure demonstrates the importance of the politics of implementation. When reforms threaten profits, private providers may act to undermine reforms in the implementation process. Given the widespread emergence of private providers in social policy systems, understanding their stakes in implementation is key to more effective, equality-enhancing reforms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper focuses on the erosion of the preferences granted by the EU in the rice industry. Since 2004 there has been a sharp decrease in border protection for the EU rice industry. Because the EU grants trade preferences to a considerable number of rice exporting developing countries, the reform implied preference erosion as well. By addressing the impact of preference erosion on developing countries rice exports to the EU, this paper contributes two original insights to the literature: first, by proposing a new empirical approach to compute the preference margin when tariff rate quotas are in force which is based on the assumption of the existence of fixed costs and economies of scale in international trade; second, by estimating the trade elasticities of preferences by means of a dynamic panel gravity equation to deal with the issues of endogeneity of preferences and persistency in bilateral trade flows. The results show that the way preference margins are calculated matters significantly when assessing the existence and extent of their erosion and the values of trade elasticities. Finally, the estimations highlight the fact that the impact of preferences is still very strong for some of the countries concerned.","[Scoppola, Margherita] Univ Macerata, Macerata, Italy; [Raimondi, Valentina; Olper, Alessandro] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy",University of Macerata; University of Milan,"Scoppola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Macerata, Italy.",scoppola@unimc.it,"RAIMONDI, VALENTINA/AGY-1199-2022","RAIMONDI, VALENTINA/0000-0002-5431-7885",,,,,44,8,8,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Furthermore, temporal declines in investment persistently reduce general trust, trust in villagers, and trust in business partners.

We find some support for Anthony Scott's (1993) hypothesis that publications with Canadian content are delayed until later career stages, but we also find strong evidence of declining interest in Canadian content for newer faculty hired since 1990 and for faculty in Canada's top-rated departments. Canadian academics have tended to publish in the Canadian Journal of Economics (CJE/RCE) early in their career and Canadian Public Policy/Analyse de polituqes (CPP/Adp) in mid-career, but both these outlets feature fewer publications from faculty hired since 1990. Publication in the CJE/RCE persists for top departments into mid-career but is less common among those hired with a PhD from outside Canada, while publication in CPP/Adp is more likely among faculty in departments outside the top ten. The contracting supply of content for Canadian economics journals, particularly CPP/Adp, appears to be aggravated by the recent hiring and retention decisions of departments seeking to improve their ranking based on top journal publications.","[Simpson, Wayne] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Emery, J.

Those needing care prefer to receive it at home rather than in institutional settings. Public authorities prefer to provide care in residential settings, which are generally lower cost than institutional care. The trend away from institutional provision towards care at home is endorsed by national governments and by the OECD. Nevertheless, as the number requiring care increases, this policy shift will maintain the level of housing demand above what it would otherwise be. It will also have distributional consequences with individuals less likely to reduce their housing equity to pay for institutional care, which in turn will increase the value of their bequests. Empirical analysis using the UK Family Resources Survey and the British Household Panel Survey shows that household formation effects involving those requiring long-term care are relatively weak and unlikely to significantly offset the effects of this policy shift on the housing market and on the distribution of wealth.",,,,,,"Bell, David/0000-0002-4538-6328; Rutherford, Alasdair/0000-0003-2530-1195",,,,,35,8,9,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

On average, the burden of subsidy reform is substantial and is approximately neutrally distributed across income groups; a $0.25 decrease in the per liter subsidy results in a 5% decrease in income for all groups. More than half of this impact arises from the indirect impact on prices of other goods and services consumed by households. Fuel subsidies are a costly approach to protecting the poor due to substantial benefit leakage to higher income groups; in absolute terms, the top income quintile captures six times more in subsidies than the bottom.

Using data on product characteristics of automobiles sold on the German domestic market over the period 2001-2006, we construct a competitiveness or fitness indicator for each car model applying non-parametric efficiency measurement techniques. The basic question we intend to answer is whether cars providing a higher quality-price ratio for consumers tend to increase their market share compared to variants with lower quality-price ratios. The relationship between a car models' fitness and its market performance is empirically tested in a regression framework. The results show that the principle of growth of the fitter is working as suggested by evolutionary theory. In particular, we find that car models with considerably lower fitness than the market average lose additional market shares, whereas models with above-average fitness gain additional market shares.","[Soellnerz, Rene] Univ Jena, DFG RTG Econ Innovat Change, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Cantner, Uwe] Univ Jena, Fac Econ & Business Adm, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Cantner, Uwe] Univ So Denmark, Dept Mkt & Management, Grp I2M, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Krueger, Jens J.] Univ Technol, Dept Law & Econ, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Southern Denmark; Technical University of Darmstadt,"Söllnerz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, DFG RTG Econ Innovat Change, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",uwe.cantner@uni-jena.de; krueger@vwl.tu-darmstadt.de; rene.soellner@uni-jena.de,"Cantner, Uwe/A-9187-2015","Cantner, Uwe/0000-0002-2067-493X",,,,,78,16,17,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We find the major reason for this response is the alleviation of borrowing firms financial constraints. We also find that new loan announcements are associated with a positive stock price effect even when prior loans made to the same borrower already trade on the secondary market.

The entrepreneurial process occurs because people are motivated to pursue and exploit perceived opportunities. It is rooted in the theory that action is the result of motivation and cognition. Therefore, this paper applies elements of goal theory and social cognitive theory to develop a motivational model of nascent entrepreneurial start-up outcomes. The objective of this model is to renew attention on motivational constructs in entrepreneurship research. Additionally, it provides predictive value for the likelihood of new firm founding among nascent entrepreneurs. Results suggest that motivational antecedents among nascent entrepreneurs significantly influence the likelihood of quitting the start-up process versus continuing nascent entrepreneurial start-up efforts.","[Hechavarria, Diana M.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Management, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Renko, Maija] Univ Illinois, Dept Managerial Studies, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Matthews, Charles H.] Univ Cincinnati, Ctr Entrepreneurship Educ & Res, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Hechavarria, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Cincinnati, Dept Management, Lindner Hall 516, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",hechavda@mail.uc.edu; maija@uic.edu; charles.matthews@uc.edu,"Renko, Maija/X-4691-2019","Renko, Maija/0000-0003-4669-6122; Hechavarria, Diana/0000-0002-3819-8206",,,,,92,86,115,3,121,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using data on published airfares of Lufthansa, British Airways, Alitalia and KLM for the main city-pairs from Italy to the rest of Europe, our empirical findings substantially confirm the propositions of the theoretical model. We find that competition among full-service carriers appears to affect the price levels of the business and the leisure segments asymmetrically: there are small reductions in the leisure segments and significant reductions in the business segment of the aviation market. In contrast, competition with low-cost carriers reduces both the business and leisure fares of full-service carriers quite uniformly, with an emphasis on the mid-segment fares. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The recorded geography of dialects comprehensively portrays local cultural similarities that have been evolving for centuries, and provides an ideal opportunity to measure cultural barriers to economic exchange at a fine geographical scale. In a gravity analysis we show that cross-regional migration flows in the period 2000-2006 are positively affected by historical dialect similarity. Using different empirical strategies, we show that this finding indicates highly time-persistent cultural ties that foster economic exchange across regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We build on the pioneering efforts of Hunt and Stefan (2007) from Calgary, Alberta by considering three types of movements: tour-based; fleet allocator; and internal/external. Some sub-models from Calgary are transferred, while others are newly developed. The framework is implemented and validated for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) as a case study. A list of 185,790 records of individual business establishments in the GTHA was acquired from InfoCanada to conduct the microsimulations. The achieved results are promising with favorable correlations between observed and simulated commercial vehicle flows. We conclude that the modeling framework from Calgary can be transferred and used to depict the travel patterns of commercial vehicle movements in other urban areas. This can be beneficial when refined and costly data are unavailable to study urban commercial vehicle movements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We assume that the insurer is able to replicate the life insurance contract's cash flows via assets traded on the capital market and can hence apply risk-neutral valuation techniques. The policyholder, on the other hand, will take risk preferences and diversification opportunities into account when placing a value on that same contract. Customer value is represented by policyholder willingness to pay and depends on the contract parameters, that is, the guaranteed interest rate and the annual and terminal surplus participation rate. The aim of this article is to analyze and compare these two perspectives. In particular, we identify contract parameter combinations thatwhile keeping the contract value fixed for the insurermaximize customer value. In addition, we derive explicit expressions for a selection of specific cases. Our results suggest that a customer segmentation in this sense, that is, based on the different ways customers evaluate life insurance contracts and embedded investment guarantees while ensuring fair values, is worthwhile for insurance companies as doing so can result in substantial increases in policyholder willingness to pay.","[Gatzert, Nadine] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Insurance Econ, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Schmeiser, Hato] Univ St Gallen, Inst Insurance Econ, Chair Risk Management & Insurance, CH-9010 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of St Gallen,"Gatzert, N (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Insurance Econ, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",nadine.gatzert@wiso.uni-erlangen.de; hato.schmeiser@unisg.ch,,,,,,,19,33,35,2,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

In SME lending, banks largely rely on soft information, because the scale and scope of hard information are limited. We analyze whether and how hard and soft information affects the borrower's bargaining power vis-A -vis its bank. We use the fact that, for a given credit rating, certain borrowers obtain better loan terms than others to define measures of relative bargaining power. Using SME loan data from the USA and Germany, we find that more favorable soft information (management skills and character) increases borrower bargaining power. We also show that more favorable soft than hard information improves borrower bargaining power. The results are not driven by manipulation or statistical limitations of the credit ratings. Our study suggests that soft information represents an important and direct determinant of borrower bargaining power, affecting the outcomes of the loan contracting process.","[Grunert, Jens] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; [Norden, Lars] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Norden, L (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",lnorden@rsm.nl,,,,,,,42,53,60,2,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We identify an organizational form with a rule of ex-post bargaining and compare four types of organization: horizontal organizations, inverted pyramidal hierarchies, pyramidal hierarchies and vertical hierarchies. We show that if the human capital investments of all members are perfectly complementary, the horizontal organization is chosen. If the investments of two players including the owner are essential, the inverted pyramidal hierarchy can occur. Pyramidal hierarchies minimize the agency cost if investments are non-firm-specific. The vertical hierarchy emerges when the owner can motivate a player who undertakes firm-specific investment by assigning him to the middle tier. We also examine who should be assigned to the middle tier in a vertical hierarchy. J. Japanese Int. Economies 26 (3) (2012) 369-392.

Becker's seminal work on the economics of fertility serves as the theoretical foundation for this literature. After describing Becker's economic model, we review the empirical literature on fertility responses to social welfare policies, tax policies, the mandated health care coverage of infertility treatments, abortion policies, and government-sponsored family planning services. We also address several Supreme Court cases that have played an important role in the interpretation of these policies. Where relevant, this retrospective describes the distributional effects of these natalist policies. We also discuss the limitations of this literature and identify important gaps. Unlike most developed countries that have created strategies to increase fertility to support their ageing population, the United States spends considerably less time and thought on this issue. Our reading of the literature suggests that we have many public policies that have affected and continue to influence the fertility choices made by families in the United States and that this is a topical area that deserves more attention in policy debates.","[Lopoo, Leonard M.; Raissian, Kerri M.] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Maxwell Sch, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,"Lopoo, LM (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Maxwell Sch, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",,,,NICHD NIH HHS [R03HD060783] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,114,21,26,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

We add to the existing literature by investigating if the positive relationship between investment in information and intensity of trading in financial assets is sensitive to the sources of information used by investors, and if this influence is different for overconfident and non-overconfident investors. Our results confirm the classical statement that the more frequently individual investors invest in information, the more they trade in financial products. They also confirm behavioral finance findings that overconfident investors, who show a better than average bias, trade more frequently. Our findings are novel showing that the more overconfident and non-overconfident investors invest in information the more they trade, but the trading behavior is sensitive to the sources of information used.

We posit that disproportionately high fees are prevalent in funds with multiple share classes and those with weak governance structures. Using a comprehensive sample of index mutual funds for the from 1998 to 2007, we find that internal governance mechanisms matter primarily for funds with relatively small share classes where investors often face increased search costs and/or restricted access to competitive mutual funds. Additionally, we find that funds managed by publicly held sponsors are associated with disproportionately higher fee spreads (about 28 basis points). The results are robust to the inclusion of board characteristics, share class structure, and investment objectives. Overall, our findings suggest that competition and agency considerations are important determinants in the pricing of mutual funds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

European TBSFs finance new investments by relying primarily on internal funds, due to capital market failures induced by asymmetric information.

It is unclear whether European venture capital has been able to certify the quality and enhance the growth of funded companies. Compared with the NASDAQ, there is little development of trading in high-tech stocks in Europe: the so-called New Markets established in the 1990s collapsed in the wake of the Internet bubble crash.

Mechanism design theory and empirical evidence suggest that repeated choice tasks per respondent induce strategic behaviour. We find evidence that strategic opportunities provided by the order in which choice sets are presented to respondents affect choice decisions (strategic response). The results suggest, however, that respondents may solely respond to high cost rather than low cost inconsistencies. That is, respondents are more cost sensitive, and thus have a lower willingness to pay (WTP), if the same or a similar level of provision was offered in a previous choice set at a lower cost than if it was not. Yet, the cost sensitivity, and thus WTP, remains unaffected if the same or a similar level of provision was offered in a previous choice set at a higher cost. Our findings further indicate that cost sensitivity increases (and thus WTP decreases), when respondents progress through the choice task, with this increase (decrease) lessening as more choice questions are answered.

This paper provides new evidence using the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England. I provide estimates of the income gradients in university participation overall and at a group of high-status institutions (the Russell Group). I also investigate the extent to which these gaps may be driven by discrimination against students from lower-income backgrounds by universities, by considering income gradients in applications. I find substantial differences in university entry overall and at Russell Group institutions between students from high- and low-income families. However, I show that most of the difference is driven by application decisions, particularly once I control for ability at age 11. This suggests that universities do not discriminate against students from poorer backgrounds. Instead, those students are less likely to apply. These findings suggest that policies aimed at reducing the university participation gap at the point of entry are likely to face small rewards. More likely to be successful are policies aimed at closing the substantial applications gap, particularly by ensuring that students from poorer backgrounds have the necessary qualifications to apply.","Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Anders, J (通讯作者)，Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1E 7HU, England.",jake@jakeanders.co.uk,"Anders, Jake/I-5576-2013","Anders, Jake/0000-0003-0930-2884",,,,,28,39,43,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

By relying on two factors for stochastic volatility, the model allows for stochastic leverage and is thus able to explain time-varying slopes of the smiles. The use of Wishart processes for the covariance matrix of returns enables the model to also capture stochastic correlations between the assets. Our model offers an integrated pricing approach for both Quanto and plain-vanilla options on the stock as well as the foreign exchange rate. We derive semi-closed form solutions for option prices and analyze the impact of state variables. Quanto options offer a significant exposure to the stochastic covariance between stock prices and exchange rates. In contrast to standard models, the smile of stock options, the smile of currency options, and the price differences between Quanto options and plain-vanilla options can change independently of each other.

Alton; Kliesen, Kevin L.; Meyer, Andrew P.; Wheelock, David C.",,,"Federal Reserve Lending to Troubled Banks During the Financial Crisis, 2007-2010",FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Numerous commentaries have questioned both the legality and appropriateness of Federal Reserve lending to banks during the recent financial crisis. This article addresses two questions motivated by such commentary: Did the Federal Reserve violate either the letter or spirit of the law by lending to undercapitalized banks? Did Federal Reserve credit constitute a large fraction of the deposit liabilities of failed banks during their last year before failure? The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) imposed limits on the number of days that the Federal Reserve may lend to undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized depository institutions. The authors find no evidence that the Federal Reserve ever exceeded statutory limits during the recent financial crisis, recession, and recovery. In most cases, the number of days that Federal Reserve credit was extended to an undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized depository institution was appreciably less than the number of days permitted under law. Furthermore, compared with patterns of Fed lending during 1985-90, the authors find that few banks that failed during 2008-10 borrowed from the Fed during their last year prior to failure, and even fewer had outstanding Fed loans when they failed. Moreover, Federal Reserve loans averaged less than 1 percent of total deposit liabilities among nearly all banks that did borrow from the Fed during their last year. It is impossible to know whether the enactment of FDICIA explains differences in Federal Reserve lending practices during 2007-10 and the previous period of financial distress in the 1980s. However, it does seem clear that Federal Reserve lending to depository institutions during the recent episode was consistent with the congressional intent of this legislation.

By making it possible to track a large number of individuals over extended time periods and across a number of tax rate changes while controlling for important additional determinants, available tax-return information from Sweden allows for statistical estimation of the influence that income taxes have on the probability of becoming self-employed. The changing tax rate structure combined with the fact that the Swedish tax system does not provide additional tax benefits to small-business entrepreneurs compared with those who work as employees provides a powerful setting through which to examine the tax rate structure's influence on individuals' choice to become self-employed. Contrary to many earlier studies based on US data, this paper finds that both average and marginal taxes have a negative impact on the decision to become self-employed.","Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Hansson, Å (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden.",asa.hansson@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,47,32,32,1,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Based on the average annual gastrointestinal (GI) illness risk in the U.S. from drinking water of about 5 illnesses per 100 population, eliminating the GI risk has a median annual value per household of $219. The considerable heterogeneity in the values arises largely from differences in attitudes towards risk and price sensitivity. Using interval regressions, we find that valuations are greater for those who perceive a high personal risk, consume a large quantity of tap water, or are environmentalists. The paper explores several methodological issues pertaining to the iterative choice format involving a choice between two policies characterized by their cost and GI risk. The analysis adjusts for starting point effects by basing valuations on the tradeoffs that are estimated to prevail at the equitable tradeoff rate, which is the starting cost-water quality tradeoff rate that produces a 50-50 split in the initial policy choice between policies with greater tradeoff rates and policies with lower tradeoff rates. The heterogeneity in valuations is also explored by examining quantile regression results and the determinants of the unbounded valuation amounts at the low and high extremes.","[Viscusi, W.

According to these, the first finding of this study is that, under the first regime which is below the threshold level, low inflation has significantly positive impact on economic growth. On the other hand, under the second regime which is above the threshold level, high inflation has a significant negative effect on economic growth. The second finding of this study, by examining the effect of 2007 global economic crisis, is that the economic crisis only changes the inflation threshold value. This finding shows that rising inflation is an important obstacle to economic growth due to negative effect. Due to global economic crises and their impacts on inflation and growth, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey should follow a determined strategy to eliminate inflation.

Our analysis of their data shows, even using their low-power statistical tests, there is significant international evidence supporting the SAD effect. Employing modern, panel/time-series statistical methods strengthens the case dramatically.

Yet the remarkably productive fisheries of the basin, and the livelihoods of rural people this production supports, are increasingly confronting a series of threats related to hydropower development and other socio-ecological processes. These threats are in turn driven by long-standing efforts to transform the Mekong basin shared by China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam through water resource development into a more vigorous source of regional economic development through appropriation of the basin's biophysical processes.

I present several new pieces of evidence addressing the question, focusing on whether credit unions, which are often held as the strongest potential competitors to payday lenders, do (or might) viably compete in the payday loan market. National payday loan offerings by credit unions show that very few credit unions currently offer payday loans. Credit union industry reports suggest that those credit unions offering such loans seem unwilling or unable to undercut substantially the prevailing prices set by payday lenders. Those industry reports also reveal that lower-priced credit union loans generally ration riskier borrowers out of the market by imposing greater restrictions on approval and repayment; risk-adjusted prices for credit union payday loans may not be lower at all. Survey evidence suggests that most current payday borrowers prefer higher-priced but less restrictive standard payday loans to lower-priced but more restrictive alternatives offered by credit unions. The combined demand- and supply-side evidence suggests that one should not expect credit unions (or by extension banks) to offer lower-priced, higher-quality alternatives for consumers who currently use payday loans.

Choices regarding the income measure and sharing unit to be analyzed, as well as other methodological choices, carry significant implications for assessing income trends. In particular, we show that focusing on tax units rather than households and not adjusting for sharing unit size greatly reduces measured growth in middle class income, as does excluding the effect of taxes and the value of in-kind benefits. As an example, we demonstrate how much these distinctions change the observed distribution of benefits from the tax exclusion of employer provided health insurance.","[Burkhauser, Richard V.] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Larrimore, Jeff] US Congress, Joint Comm Taxat, Washington, DC USA; [Simon, Kosali I.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA",Cornell University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Burkhauser, RV (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",rvb1@cornell.edu; jeff.larrimore@mail.house.gov; simonkos@indiana.edu,"; Burkhauser, Richard/G-5403-2015","simon, kosali/0000-0002-3231-1466; Larrimore, Jeff/0000-0001-9715-3983; Burkhauser, Richard/0000-0003-4629-0253",,,,,35,39,42,0,12,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We find that a firm's cashflow features affect not only the leverage target, but also the speed of adjustment toward that target. Heterogeneity in adjustment speeds is driven by an economically meaningful concept: adjustment costs.

Three potential explanations are put forward to explain these empirical findings: (1) non-migrating household members are likely to increase their labor supply in order to defray migration-related expenses; (2) neighboring households increase their labor supply to help family members migrate after they become more aware of the benefits of remittances; and (3) remittances overcome credit constraints, thus generating employment.","RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Posso, A (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,"Posso, Alberto/0000-0003-4226-7072",,,,,23,27,29,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

In this paper I specifically examine how mobile lives unfold through social networks, facilitating the forming and reforming of connections people have with others, near and distant. I argue that movement itself is not so significant. Its importance rather stems from how it enables people to be connected with each other, to meet and to remeet over time and across space. Movement makes connections. These connections form patterns or networks, which many commentators see as the critical feature of contemporary life. Much travel thus involves making new connections and extending one's network or sustaining one's existing networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We illustrate this result when industry players make simultaneous or sequential investment decisions in the face of two negative externalities. One externality arises when all competing firms invest, thus eroding the gains to investment accruing to any one firm. Another externality arises when some firms do not invest and lose out to rivals who do invest. The value of investment therefore depends on the investment's intrinsic merits and the actions of all competitors. Our analysis can rationalize investment patterns that might appear suboptimal when such externalities are ignored. For instance, our simultaneous model can justify investment levels that might otherwise be interpreted as under- or over-investment. Our sequential model shows that value-maximizing firms might optimally herd in their investment decisions. We present evidence supporting key aspects of both the simultaneous and sequential models.

This permits us to interpret the component in common to both of them as a global factor. We introduce time variation into the model to investigate whether indicators are decoupling from global factors over time.

In addition, we examine the moderating effects of two family characteristics, parenting style and the generation gap (parent-child age difference), on the relative weight of adolescents' personal attitudes vs. social influences within the family as predictors of adolescents' pro-environmental behaviour. Results show that the adolescents' pro-environmental behaviour is heavily influenced by the dominating norms within the family and in particular by how strongly they are manifested in their parents' behaviour.

The surprise in the FX market seems to affect stock markets in the US and Japan, respectively. In particular, we find that the interest rate surprise in the US and inflation surprise in Japan tend to overstate the impact that these surprises would have on the respective stock market.

Theory suggests that the more autonomous women are within the household, the greater influence they will have in that allocation. This paper utilizes several measures of a woman's autonomy within the household. It is hypothesized that the greater the woman's autonomy, the more likely she will be to visit a doctor, rather than other traditional sources of healing/care, when ill. This hypothesis is tested using data drawn from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India. The results lend support to the importance of autonomy for a woman in increasing her likelihood of visiting a medical doctor when ill. Additionally, the results show that socio-economic differences go a long way in explaining differences in healthcare choices for the sick.","[Grabowski, Richard] So Illinois Univ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Self, Sharmistha] Missouri State Univ, Springfield, MO 65897 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; Missouri State University,"Grabowski, R (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",sself@missouristate.edu; ricardo@siu.edu,,,,,,,10,8,9,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Based on the framework of Williamson, we argue that culture located in social embeddedness level can shape contracting environments by serving as an informal constraint that affects human actors' incentives and choices in market exchange. We therefore expect national culture to be related to debt maturity structure after controlling for legal, political, financial, and economic institutions. Using Hofstede's four cultural dimensions (uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, power distance, and masculinity) as proxies for culture, and using a sample of 114,723 firm-years from 40 countries over the 1991-2006 period, we find robust evidence that firms located in countries with high uncertainty avoidance, high collectivism, high power distance, and high masculinity tend to use more short-term debt. We interpret our results as consistent with the view that national culture helps explain cross-country variations in the maturity structure of corporate debt. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The tourism literature abounds a number of studies into tourism and economic growth nexus through a variety of methods such as Granger-causality, co-integration, regression analyses. However, there are hardly any studies incorporating input-output analysis. Within this context, this study sets out to examine the tourism and economic growth nexus by means of input-output analysis, covering forward and backward linkage effects, based on the 2002 input-output table, which is the latest one released by TURKSTAT.

All audit firms are aware that the human resource is their most important asset and recognize the importance of finding the balance between the skills of audit team members and the complexity of audit engagements. The main purpose of this optimization process is to help auditors not taking unnecessary risks avoid underauditing and to keep costs to a competitive level avoid over- auditing. We propose a multiple regression model for determining the optimum number of hours to be involved on audit engagements depending on several client related parameters e. g. financial performance indicators, client size, complexity of client operations, etc.. Further, we examine the possibility of using the model for creating an expert system that would assist in selecting the right mix of audit team members depending on their experience and skills.","[Dobre, Florin; Vilsanoiu, Daniel; Turlea, Eugeniu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,flndobre@yahoo.com,"TURLEA, EUGENIU/P-1688-2016; Dobre, Florin/A-2856-2016","Dobre, Florin/0000-0001-7779-9488",,,,,8,1,1,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-5671,,,PROC ECON FINANC,,,2012,3.0,,,,,,204,210,,10.1016/S2212-5671(12)00141-4,0.0,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDU99,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315040100029,0

It analyses contract farming from the small-scale farmer perspective to better understand the implications for small-scale farmers of contractual arrangements with processing and/or marketing firms. The paper, based on empirical research conducted in the Limpopo Province of South Africa using a combination of qualitative and econometric analyses, argues that contract farming is not a panacea for small-scale farmers. On the one hand, contract farming improves agricultural production for contract farmers who benefit from increased incomes, enables better access to services and resources, and creates new opportunities to participate in markets. However, on the other hand, the results show that contract farming remains limited and mostly involves the already better-off, who have benefitted from specific development paths and public support. This case study shows that contract farming in itself does not appear to provide an efficient means of reducing poverty, nor does it provide an institutional tool through which to improve rural livelihoods. It does, therefore, not represent a tool appropriate for the majority of small farmers or for redressing the historical imbalances in the South African agricultural sector.","[Freguin-Gresh, S.] CIRAD, UMR ART Dev, Managua, Nicaragua; [Freguin-Gresh, S.] Univ Ctr Amer, Inst Invest & Desarrollo Nitlapan, Managua, Nicaragua; [d'Haese, M.] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Anseeuw, W.] CIRAD, UMR ART Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Anseeuw, W.] Univ Pretoria, Postgrad Sch Agr & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",CIRAD; Ghent University; CIRAD; University of Pretoria,"Freguin-Gresh, S (通讯作者)，CIRAD, UMR ART Dev, Apartado A 242,Campus UCA, Managua, Nicaragua.",freguin@cirad.fr,,"Freguin Gresh, Sandrine/0000-0003-2750-106X; D'Haese, Marijke/0000-0002-0544-3420",,,,,49,19,20,2,38,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2012,51.0,3,,,,,24,51,,10.1080/03031853.2012.749567,0.0,,,28,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,081XC,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314354700002,0

Alternative hoteliers provide a different tourism product with several points of differences when compared with traditional hoteliers.

Missing from the equation between elections and democracy is political accountability. Parties' obsession with coalition building as a route to political power has made it difficult for voters to attribute success or failure to elected officials. Coalition government allows politicians to send contradictory messages, and in 2012 religious minorities - which are neither banned nor protected - have paid a heavy price for the lack of accountability and leadership. In Jakarta an outsider, Joko Widodo, won the gubernatorial election despite facing an incumbent backed by a broad coalition. His victory illustrates that coalition building does not guarantee success, and that the electorate is mature enough not to be swayed by appeals to religious and ethnic sentiment. This gives heart to those hoping to strengthen democracy and democratic values in Indonesia.","Asia Fdn, Kabul, Afghanistan",,"Hamid, S (通讯作者)，Asia Fdn, Kabul, Afghanistan.",,,,,,,,31,11,11,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

We compare the equilibrium when inspection is the only policy option relative to the equilibrium that emerging when nations may also manipulate the tariff. Ruling out the tariff causes socially excessive stringency in general, social welfare losses if domestic supply is highly inelastic, and in some circumstances an increase in the real tariff, measured as the difference between world and domestic prices.","[Margolis, Michael] Gettysburg Coll, Dept Econ, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA; [Shogren, Jason F.] Stroock Prof Nat Resource Conservat & Management, Laramie, WY USA; [Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",Gettysburg College; University of Wyoming,"Margolis, M (通讯作者)，Gettysburg Coll, Dept Econ, 300 N Washington St, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA.",mmargoli@gettysburg.edu; jramses@uwyo.edu,"Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X",,,,,14,11,11,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

They have become a very popular urban revitalization tool, but their formation is still largely unexplained. Theory implies that BIDs will form if they add to aggregate welfare and if the marginal net benefit of membership is positive. I test this for the neighborhood overall and at the BID boundary. Using unique, micro-level and longitudinal data from New York City, I employ survival analysis methods to estimate the likelihood of a neighborhood forming a BID. I then estimate the likelihood of the marginal property's BID membership by comparing the characteristics of properties located immediately inside and outside of the BID boundaries. I find that BIDs are more likely to form when there is more commercial space over which the BID benefits can be capitalized and when there is homogeneity in service and spending preferences across properties. BIDs also tend to form in neighborhoods that possess signs of appreciation and growth. Generally, BIDs are more likely to form in neighborhoods with higher valued properties with the exception of very wealthy areas. The BID boundary, however, is comprised of relatively less valuable properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

One of new rules is product classification. The Search Experience Credence has been an eye opener for both retailers and researchers. But while it is a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one, because online buyers are influenced by several factors.

It first provides an overview of fishery products exports from Mauritius, before reviewing SPS requirements facing exporters. This paper finally reports on the findings of a survey conducted among Mauritian fish exporters to assess the importance of SPS measures as a factor affecting exports. Results show that SPS requirements have not acted as a major barrier for Mauritian exports to the European market but in fact have provided them with a competitive edge. It was, however, acknowledged that SPS requirements and private voluntary standards, to a smaller extent, were increasing in importance. The most important reported factors affecting exports are freight, and other direct export costs. The findings also show that the majority of fishery exporters have adopted a reactive compliance strategy. It is therefore proposed that Mauritian exporters should adopt a more proactive approach in their compliance strategy, increasingly moving towards new market opportunities such as private food safety standards.","[Neeliah, S.

They are ahead of India in including IFRS in the curriculum for students. An understanding of Indian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and IFRS standards is an urgent need for today's students. Therefore, by investigating the perception of IFRS among Indian management students, this study aims to assess the level of planning for adopting the standards and also assist management schools and universities with decisions regarding adopting IFRS in Indian Accounting curriculum. According to the empirical results of the study, the adoption of IFRS mainly depends on the need and interest among students to understand the subject. If students are knowledgeable about the positive impact of the course, they are more likely to take these courses when management colleges or universities offer them. Further, successful integration to the course also depends upon efficient training of instructors, use of appropriate pedagogy and availability of relevant reading materials. (C) 2012 The Authors.

Moreover, agriculture remains an important sector in Namibia owing to the fact that its national economy is widely dependent on agricultural production. Cattle producers in the Northern Communal Areas (NCAs) have an option to market their cattle via the formal or informal market. Efforts have been made to encourage producers to market their cattle through the formal market; however, these proved to be futile as the strategy yielded limited improvements. In this study, a number of variables have been analysed to determine factors that influence cattle marketing decisions. Factors influencing the marketing decision on whether to sell or not sell through the formal market have been analyzed using the Probit model. Factors influencing the amount of cattle sold through the formal market, assuming that a producer uses the formal market to sell cattle, were analysed using the Truncated model. Testing the Tobit model against the alternative of a two-part model was done using Cragg's model. Results from empirical research suggest that problems with transportation to MeatCo, marketing experience and the age of cattle producers are some of the factors that significantly influence the decision whether or not sell through the formal market. The accessibility of marketing-related information, accessibility of new information technology, the age of respondents and a lack of improved productivity are some of the factors that influence the proportional number of cattle sold through the formal market. The results suggest that substantially more information is obtained by modelling cattle marketing behaviour as a dual decision-making framework instead of a single decision-making framework.","[Shiimi, T.] Univ Orange Free State, Dept Agr Econ, Polytech Namibia, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Taljaard, P.

Focusing on households with family farm businesses, we find that a delay in monsoon onset does not have a significant effect on the welfare of rice farmers. However, rice farm households located in areas exposed to low rainfall following the monsoon are negatively affected. Such households appear to be able to protect their food expenditure in the face of weather shocks, but at the expense of their non-food expenditure. We also use propensity score matching to identify community programs that might moderate the impact of this type of shock. We find that access to credit and public works projects has the strongest moderating effect. This is an important consideration for the design and implementation of adaptation strategies.","[Skoufias, Emmanuel; Katayama, Roy S.; Essama-Nssah, B.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Skoufias, E (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,15,19,23,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

In contrast with the hypothesis that target firms underperform in the pre-acquisition period, we find that the operating performance of target firms, measured over the three year period before the initial acquisition announcement dates, is comparable to that of their industry peers and the stock returns over the same period are significantly higher than their benchmarks. Even though target OROA declines after acquisitions, target firm stock returns stay significantly higher than do their benchmarks.

A common method of measuring private information is the PIN measure, which uses statistical estimation of a sequential trade model of the trading process to estimate the probability of informed trading. A notable limiting feature of PIN is that one must aggregate very fine intraday data over very long macro horizons in order to estimate it In this paper, our aim is to develop and implement a dynamic intraday measure of the probability of informed trading that circumvents this aggregation issue and allows for the measurement of information based trading activity at much higher frequencies.

However, we also document a sharp decline in the tri-party repo funding of Lehman in September 2008.","[Copeland, Adam; Martin, Antoine] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Walker, Michael] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Copeland, A (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA.",,,,,,,,24,81,98,1,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

However, the empirical evidence is very mixed. We apply meta-regression analysis to quantify the size of inter-jurisdictional fiscal interactions and to explain the heterogeneity in empirical estimates. Several robust results emerge. While there are significant country differences, tax interactions exist in all countries studied and they are strongest in terms of total tax and weakest in terms of income tax. Interactions differ according to level of government: compared to the municipal level, horizontal tax competition is stronger when the jurisdiction is a county or a nation. We show that tax competition has actually not grown over time and that econometric specifications and estimation strategies influence reported fiscal interactions.","[Costa-Font, Joan] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Costa-Font, Joan] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [De-Albuquerque, Filipe] Univ London, Dept Econ, Birkbeck, London, England; [Doucouliagos, Hristos] Deakin Univ, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Ifo Institut; University of London; Deakin University,"Doucouliagos, H (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",j.costa-font@lse.ac.uk; fpires01@mail.bbk.ac.uk; douc@deakin.edu.au,"Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919; Doucouliagos, Hristos/0000-0001-5269-3556",,,,,48,9,9,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2014,161.0,3-4,,,,,451,470,,10.1007/s11127-014-0170-6,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AT7XF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345147000010,0

Adoption of ERM represents a radical paradigm shift from the traditional method of managing risks individually to managing risks collectively allowing ERM-adopting firms to better recognize natural hedges, prioritize hedging activities towards the risks that contribute most to the total risk of the firm, and optimize the evaluation and selection of available hedging instruments. We hypothesize that these advantages allow ERM-adopting firms to produce greater risk reduction per dollar spent. Our hypothesis further predicts that, after implementing ERM, firms experience profit maximizing incentives to lower risk. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that firms adopting ERM experience a reduction in stock return volatility. We also find that the reduction in return volatility for ERM-adopting firms becomes stronger over time. Further, we find that operating profits per unit of risk (ROA/return volatility) increase post ERM adoption. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, related lenders have an information advantage in pricing a borrower's future political exposure, while non-related lenders do not have such an advantage.

The framework models investment funds' distress dependence explicitly and captures the time-varying non-linearities and feedback effects typical of financial markets. It measures investment funds' systemic credit risk in three forms: (1) credit risk common to all funds within each of the seven categories the Eurosystem reports to the ECB; (2) credit risk in each category of investment fund conditional on distress on another category of investment fund and; (3) the buildup of investment funds' vulnerabilities over time which may unravel disorderly. In addition, the estimates of the common components of the investment funds' distress measures contain early warning features, and the identification of their drivers is useful for macroprudential policy. The ranking of drivers of those common components in terms of importance differs from the ranking of the drivers of the common components of marginal measures of distress. This framework contributes to the formulation of macroprudential policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the possibilities for smallholders to engage in plantations as a potential means for poverty alleviation. The paper analyzes the possibilities through an empirical study of household tree growing in rural Vietnam, with a focus on differences in the capacities of households to gain land endowments and translate endowments into tree entitlements. Employing Heckman regression models and qualitative institutional analyses, the paper finds that better-off households are more likely to possess forestland, grow trees, and invest in plantations than poor ones. In addition, land, plantations, and investment tend to be larger for the better-off than the poor.

The research explores the evolution of the market, institutional and governance forces behind these organizations' strategic orientation, while acknowledging their interdependence and interrelationship. To that end, it builds a conceptual framework analysing these organizations' strategies in different points in time.

In this respect, it is crucial that firms that employ personnel survive. In this article, we investigate the role of the technological environment in determining the survival chances of employer entrepreneurs, defined as owner-managers of firms that employ personnel. We estimate survival models to analyze durations as an employer entrepreneur, using micro-panel data from EU-15 countries drawn from the European Community Household Panel. As indicators for the technological environment, we use a country's R&D expenditures, a country's employment share of high-tech and knowledge-intensive sectors, and a country's number of patent applications to the European Patent Office. We find strong support for a positive relationship between these indicators of the technological environment in country j and year t and survival chances of employer entrepreneurs in that same country and year. Our analysis also suggests that a selection effect may be part of the explanation in the sense that in a more advanced technological environment, relatively more 'high-quality' individuals select into entrepreneurship.","[van Stel, Andre] Panteia EIM, Zoetermeer, Netherlands; [Maria Millan, Jose; Roman, Concepcion] Univ Huelva, Dept Econ, Huelva, Spain",Universidad de Huelva,"van Stel, A (通讯作者)，Panteia EIM, Zoetermeer, Netherlands.",a.van.stel@eim.panteia.nl; jose.millan@dege.uhu.es,"Millan, Jose Maria/K-1656-2013; Tapia, José María Millán/S-6187-2019; Roman Diaz, Maria Concepcion/K-6782-2017","Millan, Jose Maria/0000-0002-5884-8106; Tapia, José María Millán/0000-0002-5884-8106; Roman Diaz, Maria Concepcion/0000-0002-2757-2274; Van Stel, Andre/0000-0003-4512-654X",,,,,56,12,16,4,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We find that in more concentrated industries firms' management earnings forecasts are less frequent and have shorter horizons, their disclosure ratings by analysts are lower, and they have more opaque information environments, as measured by the properties of analysts' earnings forecasts. Also, when these firms raise funds they prefer private placements, which have minimal SEC-mandated disclosure requirements, over seasoned equity offerings. Overall, our findings suggest that firms in more concentrated industries disclose less and avoid certain financing decisions that have non-trivial disclosure implications, presumably due to proprietary costs of disclosure.

Many developing and emerging countries successfully weathered the worst crisis since the Great Depression. Was it good luck? Was it good policies? This paper compares growth during the Asian and global financial crises. It finds that a looser monetary policy played an important role in mitigating crisis. It also finds that higher private credit, more financial openness, less trade openness, and greater exchange rate intervention worsened economic performance. Better macroeconomic management was key to good economic performance, which is confirmed by our analysis of Latin American countries. Finally, there is also evidence for the sample of 31 emerging markets that high terms of trade had a positive impact on resilience.","[Alvarez, Roberto; De Gregorio, Jose] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [De Gregorio, Jose] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC USA",Universidad de Chile; Peterson Institute for International Economics,"Alvarez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,41,8,8,3,24,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

PVAR estimation results, based on panel data for 29 economies, are used in simulating impulse response functions. Since economic shocks may affect high-frequency and low-frequency components of volatility differently, using a conventional time-domain approach to study volatility may lead to spurious results. Accordingly, the paper also studies the dynamics of the most destabilizing (high-frequency) components of exchange rate volatility, which are isolated using spectral methodology. While our investigation reveals interesting dynamic interrelationships between macroeconomic as well as financial variables and exchange rate volatility, we find little evidence of significant difference in the responses of macroeconomic and financial variables to the overall volatility vis-vis the high-frequency components thereof. The feedback effects from exchange rate volatility to macroeconomic and financial variables are found to be much stronger for developing countries relative to developed economies. These findings are confirmed by variance decompositions and are largely immune to several robustness checks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Tourism makes no exception, the travel agencies being nowadays confronted with the necessity of keeping the pace with the new technology. Airline companies - and the transport companies in general, oriented by these changes, created online divisions specialized in direct sales towards the final consumer. Thus, many traditional travel agencies were determined to move their activities in the virtual space, partially or totally. Abundant online information communicated by tourism agencies or simple people sharing their experiences about tourism destinations all over the world made changes in consumer behaviour. Many reviews are objective, but in the same time many are written in order to denigrate the competition and others are written by special people hired especially for promoting some resorts or hotels on travel blogs. A great number of companies from various sectors of economy prefer this type of advertising because it is very efficient and involves less financial resources than other forms of promotion. In tourism sector as well, managers often hire specialized personnel, recognized and credible in online environment, for posting positive reviews and comments on different sites or blogs in order to create notoriety and a better image of the touristic services offered. Hence, in order to identify the way tourists perceive the influence of online counselling when deciding for a touristic package or a touristic destination, a quantitative research has been deployed for this purpose, its results being presented in the current paper. Thus, as the analysis shows, despite the large use of Internet when getting informed about a future trip, users are aware that reviews and advices posted online are not very objective.","[Sabou, Gabriel Cristian; Nistoreanu, Puiu; Vlad, Denisa] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Sabou, GC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",gabriel.sabou@yahoo.com,"Sabou, Gabriel Cristian/N-4633-2015; Puiu, Nistoreanu/C-1021-2009","Puiu, Nistoreanu/0000-0002-8369-7899",,,,,16,4,4,0,41,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1279,1287,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900018,0

We argue that, on average, Latin American countries have graduated in terms of their policy responses in the sense that they have been able to switch from procyclical to counteryclical policy responses. This average response, however, masks a great deal of heterogeneity with some countries (such as Chile, Brazil, and Mexico) leading the graduation process and others (like Argentina and Venezuela) still showing procyclical policy responses. We further argue that countercyclical policy responses have been effective in reducing the duration and intensity of crises. Finally, we relate our analysis to the current crisis in the Eurozone and argue that, like in many instances in Latin America, procyclical fiscal policy has aggravated the duration and intensity of the crisis.","[Vegh, Carlos A.; Vuletin, Guillermo] Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Vegh, Carlos A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Vegh, Carlos A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Vegh, Carlos A.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Vuletin, Guillermo] Latin Amer Initiat, Global Econ & Dev Program, Washington, DC USA; [Vuletin, Guillermo] Latin Amer Initiat, Global CERES Econ & Social Policy, Washington, DC USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Brookings Institution,"Vegh, CA (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,,,,,,,50,12,16,1,7,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Motivated by the presence of various crisis events contained in our sample, we detect time-variation and structural breaks in volatility spillovers. Particularly during the financial crisis of 2007, we find effects consistent with the notion of contagion, suggesting strong and sudden increases in the cross-market synchronization of chronologically succeeding volatilities. Investigating the role of mean breaks and conditional heteroskedasticity in the realized volatilities, however, we find the latter to be the main driver of breaks in volatility spillovers.

We find that corporate governance practices improved significantly over this period. This evolution is due to two main factors: 1) growth in Novo Mercado and Level II (NM&L2) listings, mainly through IPOs by new firms, and 2) improved practices at non-NM&L2 firms, principally through adopting governance elements required for NM&L2 listing. Governance practices for firms already listed on NM&L2 were stable. Adoption of the elements of our governance index that are required for NM&L2 listing predicts higher firm value. In contrast, adoption of the remaining elements of our index does not predict firm value. Thus, governance changes appear to respond to investor preferences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The existing hedge fund databases do not seem to provide reliable and unambiguous information on the reasons of hedge fund exits. In this paper, we consider that the causes of hedge fund exits are latent, and develop a competing risks model with two exit specific hazard functions, one for each cause of exit. We further allow both exit specific hazard functions to depend on unobserved heterogeneity terms that can be mutually dependent. In this way, we investigate the interdependence between the exit specific hazard functions, and explore their determinants. We show that even without observability on causes of exit, the two sets of coefficients, one for each cause of exit, can be estimated. We find an evidence of strong dependence between the unobserved heterogeneities. We also find that the estimated coefficients of the observed covariates are generally similar whether unobserved heterogeneities or the dependence between them is taken into account or not. However, the estimated exit specific hazard functions are significantly different, due to the standard negative duration dependence in the case of omitted heterogeneity.

We employ a dataset of a wide range of business regulation indices from the Doing Business project of the World Bank. Results for the credit regulation indices show that the strength of creditor rights is negatively related to bank performance as measured by cost efficiency, although this effect subdues during the recent crisis period (2008-2010). On the other hand, credit information sharing improves efficiency, a result that is further strengthened during the crisis. Tax-compliance costs and entry regulation constrain bank efficiency. More stringent regulation of labour, in terms of minimum wage and dismissal costs, and insolvency regulation are positively associated with efficiency. Furthermore, regulation that protects investors from management expropriation, such as the extent of director liability, exerts a positive impact on bank efficiency and more so in the crisis years. Finally, we use interaction terms between the business regulation variables and institutional quality as measured by the rule of law and control of corruption. Results show that there are cases that institutional quality influences the individual effects of specific types of business regulation on bank efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A large literature has emerged to explain this phenomenon. A leading explanation is that skill-biased technological change (SBTC) increased the demand for skilled labor relative to unskilled labor. In a calibrated vintage capital model with heterogenous labor, this paper examines whether SBTC is likely to have been a major factor in driving up the wage premium. Our results suggest that the contribution of SBTC is very small, accounting for about 1/20th of the observed increase. By contrast, a gradual and very modest shift in the distribution of human capital across workers can easily account for the large observed increase in wage inequality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Consider a policy to reduce carbon emissions. To what extent should the policy objective be a reduction in the expected temperature increase versus a reduction in risk? Using a simple model of a stock externality that evolves stochastically,I examine the willingness to pay (WTP) for alternative policies that would reduce expected damages versus the variance of those damages. I compute iso-WTP curves (social indifference curves) for combinations of risk and expected return as policy objectives. Given cost estimates for reducing risk and increasing expected returns, one can compute the optimal risk-return mix for a policy, and the policy's social surplus. I illustrate these results by calibrating the model to data for global warming.","[Pindyck, Robert S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Pindyck, RS (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",,,,,,,,31,7,7,3,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

On the other hand, the increase toward higher positive correlations between crude oil-stock and -bond market occur in a near instantaneous fashion after the 2008 global financial crisis. Following Fed's tapering signals in 2013, we observe a considerable rise in the crude oil-dollar index correlation for both short- and long-run components.

Firstly, analyzed are the properties of arbitrage; and secondly, the factors explaining arbitrage are tested. Empirical analysis concerns a decade of intraday data of five US equity indices and is also implemented in both daily and intraday frequencies. The cost-of-carry model (log base) significantly quantifies arbitrage in the US equity markets. The properties of the log-base arbitrage are similar to the ones expected and to those of the implied arbitrage as well. The significance of the cost-of-carry model (log-bases in the levels of price, return and volatility series) is also proved by rejecting the unbiasedness hypotheses of the model. The arbitrage price, return, volatility and correlation series are significantly explained by illiquidity. The Options/Stock trading volume ratio is significantly explained by arbitrage. The duration of arbitrage opportunities is 1.2 min (72 s), indicating that the market eliminates profitable deviations rather quickly. Volatility risk premium, jump risk, lagged arbitrage returns, realized skewness implied ratio, and option trading volume significantly explain arbitrage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using this control sample approach facilitated by the existence of second-tier, exchange-regulated markets in the EU, we find that, on average, IPO underpricing declined on Member State-regulated markets after Member States adopted corporate governance codes containing SOX-like provisions. We do not find a similar reduction in IPO underpricing on exchange-regulated markets. Our results are robust to alternative specifications, and our findings support the view that elevating corporate governance standards increases transparency and reduces information asymmetries that affect IPO valuations.

The SRL model combines option pricing theory with market information and balance sheet data to generate probabilistic measure of systemic liquidity risk. It enhances price-based liquidity regulation by linking a bank's maturity mismatch impacting the stability of its funding with those characteristics of other banks, subject to individual changes in risk profiles and common changes in market conditions impacting funding and market liquidity risk. This approach can then be used (i) to quantify an individual institution's time-varying contribution to expected losses from system-wide liquidity shortfalls and (ii) to price insurance premia that provide incentives for banks to internalize the social cost of their individual funding decisions.

Two theoretical approaches were contrasted: (1) The process approach predicting that choice deferral varies as a function of information form, and (2) the communication approach predicting an interaction of information form and domain-specific knowledge. Participants were presented with different laptops described in an absolute (e.g. '300 GB hard disc'), evaluative-numerical (e.g. 'hard disc with 30 out of 100 points in an expert rating') or evaluative-verbal (e.g. 'bad hard disc') information form, and they could choose to buy one of the laptops or defer. Domain-specific knowledge was also assessed. In Study 1, evaluative-numerical and evaluative-verbal values led to more deferral in people with high domain-specific knowledge. The pattern for evaluative-numerical and evaluative-verbal values was replicated for a different information organization in Study 2. Study 3 showed that absolute values led to more deferral the less knowledgeable participants were and demonstrated that domain-specific knowledge and deferral were unrelated when absolute and evaluative-verbal values were presented in combination. In sum, the results support the communication approach and have methodological implications for decision research and theoretical implications for understanding choice deferral in real-life decisions.
