We explore the role of financial frictions in exacerbating the misallocation of resources and explaining this drop in TFP. We build a two-sector model of a small open economy with a working capital constraint on the purchase of intermediate goods. The model is calibrated to Mexico before the 1995 crisis and subjected to an unexpected shock to interest rates. The financial friction generates an endogenous fall in TFP and output and can explain more than half of the fall in TFP and 74 percent of the fall in GDP Per worker. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, we provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of the determinants of ethnolinguistic diversity in the world. We introduce a model of cultural and genetic drift where new groups endogenously emerge among peripheral populations in response to an insufficient supply of collective goods. In line with our model, we find that the duration of human settlements since prehistoric times has a strong positive association with current levels of ethnolinguistic diversity. Diversity is further negatively correlated with the length of modern state experience and with distance from the equator. Our results are thus consistent with both evolutionary and constructivist hypotheses of ethnolinguistic fractionalization.","[Ahlerup, Pelle; Olsson, Ola] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Ahlerup, Pelle] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg Ctr Globalizat & Dev, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg,"Olsson, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,"Olsson, Ola/H-2574-2012","Olsson, Ola/0000-0003-2125-2672",,,,,70,105,107,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

However, using US data since 1950 we show that the macroeconomic response pattern to stock market volatility shocks has changed substantially over time. The negative response of GDP growth to such shocks has become smaller over time. Further, while during earlier parts of our sample both a slowdown in consumption and investment growth contribute to a reduction of GDP growth, during later parts, only the investment reaction contributes to the GDP slowdown. A variance decomposition for consumption growth shows that the contribution of stock market volatility becomes negligible as we go from earlier to later parts of the sample, while the corresponding decomposition for investment growth reveals an increase in the role of stock market volatility.

There are two common ways of setting national minimum wages: they are either government legislated or the byproduct of collective bargaining agreements, which are extended erga omnes to all workers. We develop a simple model relating the level of the minimum wage to the setting regime. Next, we exploit a new data set on minimum wages in 68 countries having a statutory national minimum level of pay in the period 1981-2005. We find that a Government legislated minimum wage is lower than a wage floor set within collective agreements. This effect survives to several robustness checks and can be interpreted as a causal effect of the setting regime on the level of the minimum wage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This may occur when incentives adversely affect individuals' altruism, ethical norms, intrinsic motives to serve the public, and other social preferences. The opposite also occurs-crowding in-though it appears less commonly. In the fifty experiments that we survey, these effects are common, so that incentives and social preferences may be either substitutes (crowding out) or complements (crowding in). We provide evidence for four mechanisms that may account for these incentive effects on preferences: namely that incentives may (i) provide information about the person who implemented the incentive, (ii) frame the decision situation so as to suggest appropriate behavior, (iii) compromise a control averse individual's sense of autonomy, and (iv) affect the process by which people learn new preferences. An implication is that the evaluation of public policy must be restricted to allocations that are supportable as Nash equilibria when account is taken of these crowding effects. We show that well designed fines, subsidies, and the like minimize crowding out and may even do the opposite, making incentives and social preferences complements rather than substitutes.","[Bowles, Samuel] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM USA; [Bowles, Samuel; Polania-Reyes, Sandra] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Polania-Reyes, Sandra] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",The Santa Fe Institute; University of Siena; University of London; University College London,"Bowles, S (通讯作者)，Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM USA.",,"Polanía-Reyes, Sandra/ABB-1561-2021","Polanía-Reyes, Sandra/0000-0001-6451-1254",,,,,198,420,465,9,255,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

It also reviews whether the employment of race-based (Bumiputera-biased) policies is an effective method to help nurture highly entrepreneurial small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The case of large Bumiputera enterprises indicates that horizontal inequality-based policies has unproductive outcomes. Although well-connected Malay corporate captains did emerge by the mid 1990s, many of them lost control of their businesses during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, and these conglomerates did not actively foster Bumiputera SMEs. Malaysia has well-formulated programs that support SMEs, but their procedures, specifically involving creating Bumiputera capital as well as redistributing equity, do not promote an environment for productive entrepreneurship. The new economic policy regime, recently unveiled, continues emphasizing the distribution of wealth along ethnic lines at its essence, although now the emphasis will be on picking winners from among entrepreneurial Bumiputeras in a transparent manner These assertions will not result in a fairer system of picking and supporting Bumiputera SMEs as these documents do not discuss devolution of power to key oversight institutions to ensure checks and balances in the award of state-generated rents.","Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Gomez, ET (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",etgomez@um.edu.my,"Gomez, Edmund Terence/B-8444-2010","Gomez, Edmund Terence/0000-0002-5066-461X",,,,,43,14,14,0,17,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Rapid growth coincided with extensive state interventions in the economy, and considerable controversy exists as to how much this performance should be credited to the country's state-led development strategy and to what extent the lessons from that experience might be portable or applied elsewhere. The salience of this issue has grown as South Korea has become a more important provider of development assistance and advice. Now the country faces challenges in maintaining its superior economic performance, notably interrelated problems revolving around the country's demographics, long-term fiscal position, and lagging productivity in the services sector domestically, and a taxing environment externally. Finally, the country confronts scenarios involving potential instability, collapse, and/or absorption of its neighbor, North Korea.","[Noland, Marcus] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Noland, Marcus] East West Ctr, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics,"Noland, M (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, 1750 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",mnoland@piie.com,,,,,,,45,12,14,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

In this experiment clients are faced with a variant of a multi-armed bandit problem with a random end-time. On the known arm (the task screen), clients can earn a certain payment per completion of a decoding task. However, clients may also opt for the unknown arm where they earn an uncertain amount if they end the experiment on this expert screen. The amount is uncertain to the clients because the value is being communicated through an expert with conflicted incentives. A control session provides for direct transmission of the value to the clients. Our results show that ambiguity aversion is alive-and-well in this environment. Also, when we vary the wage rate on the known arm we find that higher opportunity cost clients are less likely to heed the advice of conflicted experts.","[Norton, Douglas A.; Isaac, R.

We use a research design that exploits day-to-day variation in the composition of the jury pool to isolate quasi-random variation in the composition of the seated jury, finding evidence that (i) juries formed from all-white jury pools convict black defendants significantly (16 percentage points) more often than white defendants, and (ii) this gap in conviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at least one black member. The impact of jury race is much greater than what a simple correlation of the race of the seated jury and conviction rates would suggest. These findings imply that the application of justice is highly uneven and raise obvious concerns about the fairness of trials in jurisdictions with a small proportion of blacks in the jury pool.","[Anwar, Shamena] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England",Carnegie Mellon University; Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London,"Anwar, S (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,"zhou, justin chuanbao/E-4519-2012","zhou, justin chuanbao/0000-0003-1372-3462",,,,,31,156,204,0,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

While the pros and cons of such a regulatory feature are widely discussed in the literature, the optimal design of such a cap and the attendant economic and environmental consequences have yet to be subjected to quantitative analyses. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation/dynamic programming approach to investigate the impact of different carbon price cap designs on an individual firm in the energy generation industry. Specifically, we model the firm's choice between a pulverized coal combustion plant and a combined cycle gas turbine plant, a large hydropower plant, a solid biomass plant and an on-shore wind farm. Our results show that the effects of a maximum carbon price set by the regulator is largely independent of its exact characteristics, albeit not of its level. A higher cap favors low-carbon technologies in general. However, due to differences in their cost structures, a price cap has different impacts on the relative attractiveness of the specific alternative technologies investigated.","[Mestel, Roland; Palan, Stefan] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Banking & Finance, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Brauneis, Alexander] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Inst Financial Management, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria",University of Graz; University of Klagenfurt,"Palan, S (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Banking & Finance, Univ Str 15-F2, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",alexander.brauneis@aau.at; roland.mestel@uni-graz.at; stefan.palan@uni-graz.at,"/AAN-9747-2021; Palan, Stefan/I-8886-2014","Palan, Stefan/0000-0002-6650-1452; Mestel, Roland/0000-0002-8292-0382",,,,,10,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2012,39,2,,,SI,,217,231,,10.1007/s10663-012-9188-5,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309994100004,0

We use a standard equilibrium business cycle model with technology following an unobserved regime-switching process. After 1984, according to Kim and Nelson (1999a), the variance of U.S. macroeconomic aggregates declined because boom and recession regimes moved closer together, keeping conditional variance unchanged. In our model this makes the signal extraction problem more difficult for Bayesian households, and in response they moderate their behavior, reinforcing the effect of the less volatile stochastic technology and contributing an extra measure of moderation to the economy. We construct example economies in which this learning effect accounts for about 30% of a volatility reduction of the magnitude observed in the postwar U.S. data.","[Singh, Aarti] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",University of Sydney; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Singh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, H04 Merewether Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",aarti.singh@sydney.edu.au,"Bullard, James/L-8120-2016","Bullard, James/0000-0002-1142-6803",,,,,24,8,11,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

In spite of this centrality, emergence in economics has not been subject to an extensive critical analysis. This paper remedies this deficit. We identify several conditions that economic patterns (i.e. rule-systems, structures) must satisfy to qualify as emergent: (1) material realization (emergent patterns are realized in physical structures and processes); (2) coherence (pattern is not a mere aggregate but a systemic whole); (3) non-distributivity (pattern possesses global properties absent from its parts); (4) structure dependence (systemic properties depend upon connective structure). These four core features are common to all forms of emergence in economics. Evolutionary economic systems also exhibit extra-strength versions of emergence, which require that patterns possess one or more additional features: (5) genuine novelty; (6) unpredictability in principle; and (7) irreducibility. We introduce three basic forms of emergence that occur in economic systems-minimal, diachronic and synchronic emergence-and apply these ideas to capital formation at all levels of economic order. The economy-wide capital structure exhibits strongly emergent properties (both diachronic and synchronic) that depend on its structural and functional organization; it is not a mere aggregate of capital goods. Within the realm of capital phenomena, we also compare the distinguishing characteristics of emergent and spontaneous (self-organizing) orders. We provide a case study of the iPhone as an emergent capital pattern to illustrate conditions (1)-(7) above and the different types of emergence. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Several factors contributed to this decline such as benign global economic conditions and growing credibility of domestic macroeconomic policies, yet factors related to industrial organization and market competition have been somewhat overlooked. Using measures of retail competition intensity reflecting the prevalence of high-productivity, modern-format retailers, we find that the decline in retail goods price inflation, and particularly food price inflation, was associated with increased retail competition. This may be linked to improved living conditions as households allocate more to health and education. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (2) (2012) 194-210.

We provided three years of recruiting services to help young women in randomly selected rural Indian villages get jobs in the business process outsourcing industry. Because the industry was so new at the time of the study, there was almost no awareness of these jobs, allowing us in effect to exogenously increase women's labor force opportunities from the perspective of rural households. We find that young women in treatment villages were significantly less likely to get married or have children during this period, choosing instead to enter the labor market or obtain more schooling or postschool training. Women also report wanting to have fewer children and to work more steadily throughout their lifetime, consistent with increased aspirations for a career.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Jensen, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,,,,,,,52,224,286,4,79,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The socially concerned firm considers one group of stakeholders in its objective function and maximizes its profit plus a share of consumer surplus. Both firms have the option to hire a manager who determines the production quantity on behalf of the firm's owner. We find that in the subgame-perfect equilibrium of this game both firms hire a manager and delegate the production choice. If the unit production costs of the firms are similar, then the socially concerned firm has a higher market share and even higher profit. Interestingly, we observe that the relationship between the share of consumer surplus taken into account by the socially concerned firm and its profit is non-monotonic. As the share increases, the socially concerned firm's profit first increases and then decreases. The conclusion is that it pays off to take stakeholder interests into account, but not too much.

We develop a dynamic principal-agent model in which a principal (a government) delegates the prevention of a disturbance-such as riots, protests, terrorism, crime, or tax evasion-to an agent who has an advantage in accomplishing this task. Our setting is a standard repeated moral hazard model with two additional features. First, the principal is allowed to exert direct control by intervening with an endogenously determined intensity of force which is costly to both players. Second, the principal suffers from limited commitment. Using recursive methods, we derive a fully analytical characterization of the intensity, likelihood, and duration of intervention. The first main insight from our model is that repeated and costly equilibrium interventions are a feature of optimal policy. This is because they are the most efficient credible means for the principal of providing incentives for the agent. The second main insight is a detailed analysis of a fundamental trade-off between the intensity and duration of intervention which is driven by the principal's inability to commit. Finally, we derive sharp predictions regarding the impact of various factors on the optimal intensity, likelihood, and duration of intervention. We discuss these results in the context of some historical episodes.","[Padro i Miquel, Gerard] London Sch Econ, London, England; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,"Miquel, GPI (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,ESRC [ES/F041764/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F041764/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,84,27,34,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

J,"Pangestu, M",,,,"Pangestu, Mari",,,Globalisation and its discontents: an Indonesian perspective,ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"It is indeed a great honour for me to give the 2011 Heinz Arndt Memorial Lecture. The first time I met the great Professor Heinz Arndt was as a nine-year-old back in 1966 when our family first came to Canberra and Heinz was my father's (Panglaykim) new boss. I recall that he picked us up at the airport and within the first week we had visited his house in Deakin, where he gave me and my two brothers games such as Chinese checkers and books that his own kids had outgrown. So my first thought was: what a kind and thoughtful man. Little did I know that I would end up being what he often termed his academic grandchild. I never took a class from Heinz or was fortunate enough to be supervised by him. However, I had many interactions with him when I was a student at the Australian National University (ANU) and, upon graduation, as an aspiring young academic. He had an important influence on the course of my life. First, he encouraged me to do my PhD in the USA. After I completed my masters at the ANU under Peter Drysdale, I toyed with the idea of continuing with a PhD at the Research School of Pacific Studies. However, Heinz convinced me to go to the USA because he thought it would widen my horizons. He was right. Second, there was the importance of being disciplined and thorough in undertaking country or regional research. One of the most important initiation exercises for an academic working on Indonesia was to do a Survey of Recent Developments for the Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies. I recall being given a yellowed document that had been formulated by Heinz with precise guidelines on topics, structure, and people to see and interview. We found similar guidelines on regional surveys when we did economic surveys of all the provinces a few years later. I found that doing the research and interviews for the survey was the easy part. The hard part was the two weeks spent in Canberra writing up the survey and being subjected to peer review. The draft was presented to the editorial team and others, including, of course, the venerable Professor Arndt. I am glad to say that I passed in terms of substance; but of course there were lots of edits to do following Heniz's traditional typed-up comments, both general and specific! Third, despite being a formidable figure and someone with a reputation for strong opinions, Heinz was the same kind and thoughtful man I remembered as a nine-year-old. He always had the time of day for the young academics, especially those from Indonesia. I had many cups of tea with him as a student and later as an aspiring academic. I still recall his room in University House filled with his books and the filing cabinet near the bathroom, where he would inevitably pull out the right references and reading materials that one needed. I learned a lot about the importance of mentoring and encouraging the youngmany of whom have succeeded and are in the room today. This lecture is to honour Professor Heinz Arndt. I believe Professor Arndt was a true internationalist and therefore he would tackle with gusto the rumblings of discontent on globalisation. He would be thorough in trying to understand the manifestations of globalisation and its sources of discontent. He would also be of the firm belief that the benefits of globalisation outweigh its costs and come up with strategic ideas on how to best manage globalisation to counter globaphobia. I hope I do justice to this topic in the Heinz Arndt tradition.",,,,mpangestu@pacific.net.id,,,,,,,20,1,4,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

There is evidence of sample selection bias in the case of young men, suggesting that they use economic factors to make their educational choices more than women do. Education is an important determinant of success in the labor market. The instrumental variables used in the selection equation-the local unemployment rate, expected lifetime earnings and the opportunity cost of education-have a statistically significant impact on the probability of pursuing an education. In contrast to several previous studies relative to mature market economies, ours found that in high unemployment areas, young people prefer to seek a job rather than study. This in fact contributes to the persistence of regional unemployment.","Univ Napoli 2, Santa Maria Capua Vetere, Caserta, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Pastore, F (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli 2, Palazzo Melzi, Santa Maria Capua Vetere, Caserta, Italy.",,"Pastore, Francesco/B-1481-2012; Pastore, Francesco/I-4950-2019","Pastore, Francesco/0000-0002-8156-1453; Pastore, Francesco/0000-0002-8156-1453",,,,,37,12,15,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

They find that SCC estimates are highly sensitive to uncertainty in extrapolating damages to high temperatures at moderate-to-high levels of risk aversion, but only modestly so at low levels of risk aversion. While in the absence of risk aversion, all of the SCC estimates but one agree within a factor of two, with a moderate level of risk aversion included, the differences among estimates grow greatly. For example, one composite damage specification, combining elements of different literature-derived specifications and roughly taking into account calibration uncertainty, yields SCC values 32% higher than the standard quadratic DICE damage function in the absence of risk aversion. With a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 1.4, however, the same uncertain specification yields SCC values almost triple those of the standard function. The authors conclude that failure to consider damages uncertainty and risk aversion jointly can lead to significant underestimation of the SCC.","[Kopp, Robert E.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Kopp, RE (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",robert.kopp@rutgers.edu,"Kopp, Robert E/B-8822-2008; Golub, Alexander/E-8224-2019; Golub, Alexander/ABC-8470-2020","Golub, Alexander/0000-0002-3586-1447; Kopp, Robert/0000-0003-4016-9428",,,,,45,42,47,2,22,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 30,2012,6,,,,,,,,201213.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-13,0.0,,,41,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,934YJ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303482500001,0

This assumption runs counter to another line of theorizing in which individual legislators maximize their own chances of winning reelection. To resolve this tension, the paper presents a model of party platform choice that relaxes only the assumption that parties are teams in the classical two-party spatial model. Platforms are chosen by majority rule among all legislators within a party. Politicians seek to win their own seats in the legislature, but they must run under a common party label. In both single-member district and proportional representation systems, equilibrium platforms are shown to diverge substantially, with one party located near the 25th percentile of the voter distribution and the other near the 75th percentile, rather than converge to the median. The model also yields predictions concerning short-term economic shocks, incumbency advantages, and gerrymandering.","[Ansolabehere, Stephen; Snyder, James M., Jr.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Leblanc, William] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Needham, MA USA",Harvard University,"Snyder, JM (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jsnyder@gov.harvard.edu,,,,,,,36,16,18,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

I find that the introduction of family planning is associated with significant and persistent reductions in fertility driven both by falling completed childbearing and childbearing delay. Although federally funded family planning accounted for a small portion of the post-baby boom US fertility decline, my estimates imply that they reduced childbearing among poor women by 19 to 30 percent.","Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Bailey, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",baileymj@umich.edu,,"Bailey, Martha/0000-0002-7692-6040","NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041028, R03 HD058065, R03 HD066145] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,60,61,85,0,20,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

However, after this crisis it became clear that both are connected locally and internationally.

As predictors of subsequent job loss, the expectations data perform better with numerical than with ordinal verbal descriptors. On average, employees overestimate the chance of losing their job; while they underestimate the difficulty of job replacement.

The states where a single vote was most likely to matter are New Mexico, Virginia, New Hampshire, and Colorado, where your vote had an approximate 1 in 10 million chance of determining the national election outcome.

The sample includes 47 studies of interfuel substitution in the industrial sector, in manufacturing industry or manufacturing sub-industries, or in the macro-economy of a variety of developed and developing countries. Meta-regressions are estimated for the six shadow elasticities of substitution between coal, oil, gas and electricity. I find that at the level of the industrial sector as a whole the oilcoal, oilgas, oilelectricity and gaselectricity shadow elasticities of substitution are significantly greater than unity. The remaining elasticities between coal and gas and coal and electricity are insignificantly different from unity or zero due to their large standard errors. Substitution possibilities seem more constrained at the macro level and less constrained at lower levels of aggregation. Estimates of the elasticities of substitution from cross-section regressions are generally largest whereas fixed effects panel estimates are intermediate in magnitude, and time-series estimates are mostly much smaller. In order to obtain more precise and less biased estimates of long-run elasticities of substitution, there is a need for additional primary studies using large samples and/or the between estimator which econometric research suggests is likely to provide the best estimates of long-run elasticities.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Stern, DI (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Stern, David I/B-4700-2009","Stern, David I/0000-0001-6595-4268",,,,,90,97,104,0,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

A case in point is afforded by the status of a 'focus axiom' in the measurement of poverty. 'Focus' requires that a measure of poverty ought to be sensitive only to changes in the income-distribution of the poor population of any society. In practice, most poverty indices advanced in the literature satisfy an 'incomefocus' but not a 'population-focus' axiom. This, it is argued in the present paper, makes for an incoherent underlying conception of poverty. The paper provides examples of poverty measures which either satisfy both income and population focus or violate both, or which effectively do not recognize a clear dichotomization of a population into its poor and non-poor components, and suggests that such measures possess a virtue of consistency, and coherent meaning, lacking in most extant measures of poverty available in the literature.","[Subramanian, Subbu] Madras Inst Dev Studies, 79 2nd Main Rd, Madras 600020, Tamil Nadu, India; [Subramanian, Subbu] Indian Inst Technol, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Subramanian, S (通讯作者)，Madras Inst Dev Studies, 79 2nd Main Rd, Madras 600020, Tamil Nadu, India.",subbu@mids.ac.in,,,,,,,22,1,1,1,2,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 26,2012,6,,,,,,,,20128.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-8,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,928BO,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302954800001,0

The potential effectiveness of scarcity pricing depends upon the price elasticity of demand. This study applies panel data analysis to household level data to obtain short- and long-run estimates of the price elasticity of demand in Sydney. The period of the analysis spans June 2004 to June 2009, during which water usage prices increased in real terms by over 45 per cent. The data are disaggregated into residential user groups of owner-occupied and tenanted houses that did and did not participate in a subsidised water appliance efficiency programme, and housing units. Owner-occupied and tenanted houses are further disaggregated through clustering analysis based on property size. The estimated real price elasticities vary both across and within user groups. The weighted average real price elasticities are small, particularly in the short run. As well as overall price elasticities, the grouping and clustering of households provides insights into the way different households respond to changes in water usage prices, weather conditions and participation in water appliance efficiency programmes. The heterogeneity in responses is found to generate statistically different results compared with an aggregate model of all residential households.","[Abrams, Barry; Kumaradevan, Santharajah; Spaninks, Frank] Sydney Water Corp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Sarafidis, Vasilis] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Abrams, B (通讯作者)，Sydney Water Corp, POB 399, Parramatta, NSW 2124, Australia.",barry.abrams@sydneywater.com.au,,,,,,,33,22,27,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

Each party expects a higher probability of victory if the issue it chooses becomes salient in the voters' decision. But remarkably, the issues which are considered the most important ones by a majority of voters may not be given salience during the electoral campaign. An incumbent government may survive in spite of its bad policy performance if there is no sufficiently broad agreement on a policy alternative. We illustrate the analytical potential of the model with the case of the United States presidential election in 2004.","[Llavador, Humberto] Univ Pompeu Fabra & Barcelona GSE, Dept Econ & Empresa, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Colomer, Josep M.] Higher Council Sci Res IAE CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Llavador, H (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra & Barcelona GSE, Dept Econ & Empresa, R Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",humberto.llavador@upf.edu,"Colomer, Josep M/B-1739-2012; Llavador, Humberto/B-7908-2013","Llavador, Humberto/0000-0003-4058-7486",,,,,27,5,8,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

We propose a likelihood ratio (LR) test that assesses the significance of the correlation between regressors and individual eifects. By contrast to the Hausman test, the Mundlak approach identifies (to some extent) the regressors correlated with individual effects. The second advantage is that once the correlation with individual effects has been modelled through an auxiliary regression, the random effects specification provides consistent estimators and the effect of time-constant variables can be estimated. Some Monte Carlo simulations study the properties of tins proposed LR test in small samples and show that in some cases, it has a better behaviour than the Hausman test. We finally illustrate the usefulness of the extended Mundlak approach by estimating a house price model where some of the price determinants are time-constant. We slimy that ignoring the endogeneity of regressors with respect to individual effects leads to unreliable estimated parameters while results obtained using the Mundlak approach and the fixed effects specification are similar (concerning time-varying variables), implying that correlation between regressors and individual effects is well captured.","[Debarsy, Nicolas] Univ Namur, CERPE, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [Debarsy, Nicolas] Univ Orleans, Lab Econ Orleans, LEO UMR CNRS 7322, F-45067 Orleans 2, France",University of Namur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Orleans,"Debarsy, N (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, CERPE, Rempart Vierge 8, B-5000 Namur, Belgium.",nicolas.debarsy@fundp.ac.be,,"Debarsy, Nicolas/0000-0002-2262-0193",,,,,34,28,32,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

We proceed theoretically and econometrically. We find that the conflict between productive and allocative efficiency is not necessarily as stringent as the international competition policy literature suggests should be the case. In particular, we note that the strategic interaction between the large domestic producer and its competitors makes feasible a range of alternative price elasticities of demand, and empirically that all price elasticities of demand are less than or equal to unity. Nevertheless, the impact of market structure is such as to render feasible a wide range of possible levels of pricing power.","[Simbanegavi, Witness] Natl Treasury, Pretoria, South Africa",,"Simbanegavi, W (通讯作者)，Natl Treasury, Private Bag X115, Pretoria, South Africa.",witness.simbanegavi@treasury.gov.za,"Fedderke, Johannes/N-1411-2019","Simbanegavi, Witness/0000-0003-3109-9528; Fedderke, Johannes/0000-0003-4482-5939",,,,,29,0,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Under plausible assumptions, the present values of the gains from educational reforms for the EU aggregate add up to astounding amounts on the three considered reform scenarios: euro35 trillion (288% of current GDP) for an average increase of 1/4 standard deviations; euro95 trillion (785% of current GDP) for bringing each nation up to the top-performer Finland; and euro25 trillion (211% of current GDP) for reaching the official EU benchmark of < 15% low-achievers in basic skills by 2020. Seen relative to the present value of GDP over the same period, these gains amount to an average increase in GDP of 4.5-16.8%.

J,"Henriet, F",,,,"Henriet, Fanny",,,Optimal Extraction of a Polluting Nonrenewable Resource with R&D toward a Clean Backstop Technology,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMIC THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MODELS,"We study the optimal extraction of a polluting nonrenewable resource within the following framework: environmental regulation is imposed in the form of a ceiling on the stock of pollution and a clean unlimited backstop technology can be developed by research and development. More specifically, the time taken to develop a new technology depends on the amount spent on R&D. A surprising result is that the stringency of the ceiling and the size of the initial stock of the polluting nonrenewable resource have a bearing on whether environmental regulation speeds up the optimal arrival date of this new technology. Compared to a scenario with no environmental externalities, stringent environmental regulation drives up the optimal R&D investment and brings forward the optimal backstop arrival date only in the case of a large initial resource stock. Otherwise, if the initial resource stock is small, regulation reduces optimal R&D and postpones the optimal backstop arrival date. These results are explained by the two roles played by the backstop technology. First, the backstop serves to replace oil once it has been exhausted. As extraction is slowed down by regulation, the exhaustion of the nonrenewable resource is postponed and the long-run gains of innovation are lowered. Second, environmental regulation raises the short-run gains of innovation by increasing the cost of consuming just oil.","[Henriet, Fanny] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Henriet, Fanny] Banque France DGEIDEMS, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Henriet, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",fanny.henriet@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,7,7,1,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Understanding why Ghanas child mortality rate is lower than in neighbouring countries may offer useful insights for other developing countries that are trying to improve child health. This paper explores whether Ghanas lower mortality rate is mostly a result of greater household wealth, better implementation of national health policies, or more favourable geography. The paper uses micro level data for children under five to examine relative child mortality risk between Ghana and each of its three immediate neighboursBurkina Faso, the Ivory Coast and Togo. A Cox proportional hazards model is used to test which of the three ocontenders'health policy, wealth or geographybest explains Ghanas mortality advantage. The results of the analysis indicate that wealth variables are not able to explain any of the child mortality variation between Ghana and its neighbours. Geography and health policy variables each explain about 40 of the mortality gap between Ghana and Burkina Faso. Health policy differences alone are able to explain about 70 of the child mortality gap between Ghana and the Ivory Coast.

We use representative household level primary data for three states, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to depict various individual and social characteristics of the population in these states as well as those of the participants in the NREGS. We also model the stochastic dominance comparisons of per capita monthly expenditures of participants with and without alternative employment opportunities in the absence of NREG as well as the determinants of such opportunities. As an approximate measure of the net transfer benefits under NREGS, we consider shares of NREG earnings net of the opportunity cost of time in household income. The distribution of such net transfers across household characteristics as well as the distribution of benefits across villages in the three states is also discussed. In general, net transfers under the NREGS are quite modest. Why accurate measurement of such transfers matters in an anti-poverty strategy is elaborated. (C) 2011 Society for Policy Modeling.

In quest of the second crop in the oases of Uzbekistan Uzbek agriculture is usually described as a single crop: cotton, a legacy of the Soviet policy of regional specialization. The major change in production since independence is said to be the growing of wheat to the detriment of alfalfa with the goal of achieving self-sufficiency in the food supply. Studies by experts and researchers tend to overlook, as do national and international statistics, the development of the production of maize for fodder, a crop planted following the wheat crop, which is now essential in the economy and society of Uzbek oases. The reasons for this are discussed by inquiring into the operation of the country's administrations and the role played by international experts. After showing how maize has been hidden in national statistics and from experts, attention is turned to the author's assignment in Uzbekistan, in the Ferghana area, as part of the UNDP's Enhancement of Living Standards Program.","[Jozan, Raphael] Univ Paris Est Marne la Vallee, CNRS, ENPC, LATTS, Paris, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech,,,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,7,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

The fundamental innovation is that the remarriage decision is infinitely repeated and the problem is fully stationary, reflecting the contemporary reality in marriage markets. I show that cooperative behavior within marriage is possible in subgame perfect equilibrium both in a setting where marriage quality is independently drawn and in a setting with persistent spouse-specific characteristics and an evolving marriage market quality. I show that spouses engage in cooperative behavior most easily when they have intermediate patience levels, which is a non-standard but intuitive game theoretic result in this setting. This model also contributes to the game theory literature by proposing another avenue for sustained cooperation in a repeated prisoner's dilemma with endogenous exit: randomness in payoff streams.","Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah,"Malcolm, M (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, POB 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",mmalcolm@aus.edu,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The commonly used maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is very sensitive to highly intercorrelated explanatory variables. Therefore. a NB ridge regression estimator (NBRR) is proposed as a robust option of estimating the parameters of the NB model in the presence of multicollinearity. To investigate the performance of the NBRR and the traditional ML approach the mean squared error (MSE) is calculated using Monte Carlo simulations. The simulated result indicated that some of the proposed NBRR methods should always be preferred to the ML method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we examine the economics of integrating large-scale wind energy into a grid characterized by fossil fuel thermal generation (Alberta) that is only weakly linked to one characterized by hydroelectric assets and the ability to store power behind hydro dams (British Columbia). We use a mathematical programming model to investigate the impact of increasing the capacity of the transmission link between the two disparate grids, which has not been done previously, and thereby shedding light on the issue of greater grid integration as a means of addressing intermittent renewable power. We find that, as wind capacity increases, costs of reducing CO2 emissions fall with increased transmission capacity between the grids, although this does not hold in all cases. Costs of reducing CO2 emissions are lowest during periods of drought. Over all scenarios, emission reduction costs vary between $20 and $60/t of CO2. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a general framework for modeling information acquisition when a seller wants to sell an object to one of several potential buyers, who can each gather information about their valuations prior to participation in the auction. We first demonstrate that the optimal mal monopoly price is always lower than the standard monopoly price. We then show that standard auctions with a reserve price remain optimal among symmetric mechanisms, but the optimal reserve price lies between the ex ante mean valuation of bidders and the standard reserve price in Myerson (1981). Finally, we show that the optimal asymmetric mechanism softens the price discrimination against strong bidders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Using a dynamic factor model with 200 variables, we reach three main conclusions. First, although many of the events of the 2007-09 collapse were unprecedented, their net effect was to produce macro shocks that were larger versions of shocks previously experienced, to which the economy responded in a historically predictable way. Second, the shocks that produced the recession were primarily associated with financial disruptions and heightened uncertainty, although oil shocks played a role in the initial slowdown, and subsequent drag was added by effectively tight conventional monetary policy arising from the zero lower bound. Third, although the slow nature of the recovery is partly due to the shocks of this recession, most of the slow recovery in employment, and nearly all of the slow recovery in output, is due to a secular slowdown in trend labor force growth.","[Stock, James H.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Watson, Mark W.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Harvard University; Princeton University,"Stock, JH (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,81,380,441,1,32,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The paper begins with a typology of policies usable near the zero lower bound on interest rates. They are: (i) forward guidance of future policy rates; (ii) targeted asset purchases; and (iii) quantitative easing. Using this typology, I review the measures adopted by the BOJ and other central banks. I then offer a news analysis of the effects of the measures adopted by the BOJ on asset prices, comparing them with those adopted by the Fed. Many of the measures, with the exception of strategy (iii), are shown to have moved asset prices in the expected directions. Another exception is that most of the monetary easing measures failed to weaken the yen. Despite some effects on asset prices, however, the measures have failed to stop the deflationary trend of the Japanese economy clearly. I discuss some possible reasons for this and more general implications for monetary policy.","Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Ueda, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan.",,,,,,,,26,42,44,0,32,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

The change in the existing division of management control is theorized as the result of a shift in the existing bargaining power balance between the joint venture partners. To capture the change in the amount of the joint venture partners' bargaining power, we measure the joint venture partners capability change. Trust is also examined as an antecedent of the joint venture partners' capability change. So the link trust -> capability change -> control change is examined using data collected through interviews with 51 international joint ventures in Korea. The hypothesis that the trust established between foreign and Korean partners leads to changes in the both partners' capabilities has received support in the empirical test. The hypothesis that the capability change of foreign and Korean partners, in turn, leads to the change (or increase/decrease) in the extent of parent control exercised over the JV's management has also received support.","Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Choi, CB (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,41,1,1,1,27,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Is such generosity necessarily welfare enhancing for the giver? We present a theoretical framework that distinguishes two types of motivation: individuals like to give, for example, due to altruism or warm glow, and individuals would rather not give but dislike saying no, for example, due to social pressure. We design a door-to-door fund-raiser in which some households are informed about the exact time of solicitation with a flyer on their doorknobs. Thus, they can seek or avoid the fund-raiser. We find that the flyer reduces the share of households opening the door by 9% to 25% and, if the flyer allows checking a Do Not Disturb box, reduces giving by 28% to 42%. The latter decrease is concentrated among donations smaller than $10. These findings suggest that social pressure is an important determinant of door-to-door giving. Combining data from this and a complementary field experiment, we structurally estimate the model. The estimated social pressure cost of saying no to a solicitor is $3.80 for an in-state charity and $1.40 for an out-of-state charity. Our welfare calculations suggest that our door-to-door fund-raising campaigns on average lower the utility of the potential donors.","[DellaVigna, Stefano] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"DellaVigna, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Malmendier, Ulrike/0000-0002-2786-4365; List, John/0000-0002-1740-3848",,,,,29,467,555,15,390,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

In particular, the paper considers the conditions for simultaneous equilibrium of trade and asset balances, and whether such equilibria are stable or not. The conditions under which those equilibria continue to exist, and are reachable, are then analyzed when the markets are distorted by the common policy prescriptions of fixed exchange rates or defined limits to the size of current account surpluses or deficits. A better approach is derived from the idea of a trade space defining the areas in which it is safe to allow trade deficits and net foreign assets or debt to operate. This allows us to investigate and draw conclusions about the best policy options to make the system stable in the long run with respect to current account imbalances and net foreign debt. First, institutional arrangements that ensure stability and maximize trade space; second, an exchange rate minimum as a circuit breaker to prevent debt escalation; third, policies to raise trade elasticities and lower portfolio adjustments in order to limit imbalances in size.","[Hallett, Andrew Hughes] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Hallett, Andrew Hughes] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Oliva, Juan Carlos Martinez] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy; [Oliva, Juan Carlos Martinez] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC USA",George Mason University; University of St Andrews; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Peterson Institute for International Economics,"Hallett, AH (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",ahughesh@gmu.edu; jcmartinezoliva@piie.com,"Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023",,,,,,23,4,4,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

When parents are uneducated, their children often face difficulties in finishing school and therefore are likely to remain uneducated. Moreover, if children expect that other children of the same generation will not receive an education, they expect that firms will not create enough jobs for educated workers, and thus are further discouraged from schooling. These intergenerational and intragenerational mechanisms reinforce each other, creating a serious poverty trap. Escape from the trap requires the well-organized and combined implementation of a subsidy for schooling, support for disadvantaged children, and public awareness programs.","[Horii, Ryo] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808576, Japan; [Sasaki, Masaru] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Tohoku University; Osaka University,"Horii, R (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Aoba Ku, 27-1 Kawauchi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808576, Japan.",horii@econ.jpn.org; sasaki@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Horii, Ryo/S-2100-2019","Horii, Ryo/0000-0002-2083-1237","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22243022, 23530275, 23330080, 23730182] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,38,1,2,2,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We estimate a model of FDI outflows in which illicit money flows influence the volume of FDI directed toward countries considered to be centers of money laundering. We show that traditional models of FDI are not able to account for these investment flows and that our results are robust when additional explanatory variables such as host country tax rates, governance, corruption, and cultural differences between the home and host country are included in the model. We estimate that 6-10% of total FDI outflows and over 20% of FDI to money-laundering countries from our sample were made to facilitate illicit money flows.

Quantitative information informs the analysis of policy choices, enables the testing of hypotheses about determinants of this phenomenon, and can help with the accurate construction of national income accounts. Even as empirical analysis has burgeoned, some have expressed doubts about the quality and usefulness of some prominent measures. The fact that high-quality data is elusive is neither surprising nor a coincidence. The defining characteristic of tax evasion and informal economic activity-that they are generally illegal-often renders unreliable standard data collection methods such as surveys. Unlike invisible phenomena in the natural sciences, these invisible social science phenomena are hard to measure because of choices made by individuals. Analysis of tax evasion and the informal economy must proceed even in the absence of the direct observability of key variables, and theory should guide the construction and interpretation of evidence of the invisible. In this paper, we address what can be learned using micro or macro data regarding tax evasion and the informal economy under given conditions and assumptions, and critically review some of the most common empirical methods in light of our conclusions. We conclude with an entreaty for researchers in this field to enlist in the credibility revolution (Angrist and Pischke in J. Econ.

In this context the cases of Bulgaria and Romania are particularly interesting, because these countries belonged to the laggard group before they were exposed to EU conditionality from the late 1990s on and since then have improved their transition performance. Thus an empirical analysis of their transition performance before and after EU conditionality set in might improve our understanding of the relative importance of specific historical and cultural traits on the one hand and of EU conditionality on the other for transition performance.

Our main result characterizes those pricing rules C that are super-replication prices of a frictionless and arbitrage-free incomplete asset structure with a bond. This characterization relies on the equivalence between the sets of frictionless securities and securities priced by C. The former captures securities without bid-ask spreads, while the second captures the class of securities where, if some of its delivers is replaced by a higher payoff, then the resulting security is characterized by a higher value priced by C. We also analyze the special case of pricing rules associated with securities markets admitting a structure of basic assets paying one in some event and nothing otherwise. In this case, we show that the pricing rule can be characterized in terms of capacities. This Arrow-Debreu ambiguous state price can be viewed as a generalization for incomplete markets of Arrow-Debreu state price valuation. Also, some interesting cases are given by pricing rules determined by an integral w.r.t. a risk-neutral capacity.

The aim of this study is to test the effect of institutional structure on economic growth in 30 OECD countries by using the data of 2009 through the cross-sectional analysis method. In the study, the variables of political stability, accountability, the effectiveness of governments, regulatory quality, the rule of law and the control of corruption were used as institutional structure indicators.

This study analyzes both landscape and parcel level data to assess the causes and extent of deforestation in two Mexican coffee agroforests, as well as the likely environmental and welfare effects of policies designed to reduce tree cover loss. We find that shade coffee growers in Atzalan exhibit a relatively high elasticity of substitution between agricultural outputs: in response to low coffee prices, they have predominantly cleared their agroforestry parcels for production of tree crops. Shade coffee growers in Zozocolco exhibit a relatively low elasticity of substitution: agroforests were mostly either augmented with allspice trees or abandoned. Our policy simulations show that price supports for shade coffee would have larger effects on canopy preservation and welfare in Atzalan, even though Zozocolco is more marginalized.","[Baerenklau, Kenneth A.; Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Ellis, Edward A.] Univ Veracruzana, Ctr Invest Trop, Cordoba, Spain",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Baerenklau, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",ken.baerenklau@ucr.edu; eellis@uv.mx; rmarc004@ucr.edu,"Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo/F-9710-2018; Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo/Q-7051-2019","Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo/0000-0002-7925-7081",,,,,35,3,3,0,14,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

This article adds important value to the existing literature since, employing the panel data methodology in the sample of Spanish nonfinancial firms, it identifies whether excess cash holding affects firm value in general, and investment, financing and dividend decisions in particular. The results show how asymmetric information among the economic agents of the firm affects the cash reserves. In particular, shareholders could penalize the investment made by these firms and consider the positive effect that the debt in particular and the dividend policies exert on the firm.

The empirical results indicate that there is one threshold value of 97.82%, which divides our sample into two regimes. The mean of the real GDP growth rates in the left regime is 1.16% higher than that in the right regime. The significantly positive marginal effects of government debt ratio on real GDP growth in both left and right regimes are consistent with the stimulus view (Eisner, 1992). Neither debt overhang nor debt irrelevance exists in these OECD countries. Our findings also show that there is a significantly negative marginal effect of unemployment rate on real GDP growth in the left regime, but significantly positive in the right regime. This positive nexus between the unemployment rate and real GDP growth in the right regime is inconsistent with Okun's Law. Meanwhile, there is a significantly negative impact of inflation rate on real GDP growth in the left regime, but non-significantly negative in the right regime. The transitional behavior from the right to the left regime in Belgium in 2006 and in Canada in 1998 is good example for the highly indebted countries, such as Italy and Japan. Therefore, our empirical findings have important implications for fiscal policymakers, not only in these OECD countries but also in the rest of world.","[Chang, Tsangyao; Chiang, Gengnan] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan",Feng Chia University,"Chang, TY (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.",tychang@fcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,18,5,5,1,14,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The compromise effect refers to the tendency of individuals to choose an intermediate option in a choice set, while the attraction effect refers to the tendency to choose an option that dominates some other options in the choice set. This paper argues that both effects may result from an individual's attempt to overcome the difficulty of making a choice in the absence of a single criterion for ranking the options. Moreover, we propose to view the resolution of this choice problem as a cooperative solution to an intrapersonal bargaining problem among different selves of an individual, where each self represents a different criterion for choosing. We first identify a set of properties that characterize those choice correspondences that coincide with our bargaining solution, for some pair of preference relations. Second, we provide a revealed-preference foundation to our bargaining solution and characterize the extent to which these two preference relations can be uniquely identified. Alternatively, our analysis may be reinterpreted as a study of ( interpersonal) bilateral bargaining over a finite set of options. In that case, our results provide a new characterization, as well as testable implications, of an ordinal bargaining solution that is previously discussed in the literature under the various names of fallback bargaining, unanimity compromise, Rawlsian arbitration rule, and Kant-Rawls social compromise.","[de Clippel, Geoffroy; Eliaz, Kfir] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"de Clippel, G (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",declippel@brown.edu; kfir_eliaz@brown.edu,,,,,,,36,58,65,3,26,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

However, firms benefit from offering sick pay in terms of profits only if there is competition among firms for workers.

The theoretical part reviewed human resources and crisis management theories. The crisis case demonstrated in this paper was collected in Chinese language. The analysis focused on three key factors of crisis management process, strategy, leadership, and communication. Finally, the authors concluded that the crisis happened due to the poor communication and crisis strategy which resulted from an extreme authoritarian leadership in the organization. To change the management style and improve communications are the suggestions to the enterprise managers.

Making an investment decision it is very important to allocate resources properly. For the individual the costs of this investment include poor wages and direct costs. It can be assumed that individuals with higher education will be paid more than the others without education. Thus, the investment in higher education (human capital) is useful as long as there is a positive difference between marginal benefit and marginal costs. Higher education is a guarantee of a higher life quality. But, in order to ensure the higher life quality, such main factors as individual skills and labour productivity should be eximined. Investment in human and physical capital doesn't only promote the growth of labour market. The investment such as lower inflation rates and freer trade (lower limits) also stimulates the economic growth. The ability to absorb easily technological change increases labour productivity and efficiency. Education, lifelong learning and health are very important investment in human capital. The foreign scientists performed researches and proved that income growth of individuals depends on the level or degree of education the individual has gained. Rate of return on investment in human capital is positive even after direct and indirect costs estimation. The individuals with higher education have higher incomes in comparison with individuals with college education. Education is one of the most important development factors of the modern knowledge based economy. However, educational and scientific development requires the long-term and huge investment. This investment also should be assessed from the social aspect. On the one hand investment in human capital should be stimulated; on the other aspect it should assess their effectiveness. As the investment in human capital is a complex problem from both practical and scientific aspect, so the practice of such evaluation and applied methods do not give an unambiguous answer. It is very important to evaluate the effectiveness of this investment, to estimate the detention of the time, the money flows: incomes (revenues) and outcomes (expenditures).","[Giziene, Vilda; Simanaviciene, Zaneta; Palekiene, Oksana] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44320 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Giziene, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Kestucio St 8-203, LT-44320 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vilda.giziene@ktu.lt; zaneta.simanaviciene@ktu.lt; oksana.palekiene@ktu.lt,"Simanaviciene, Zaneta/W-3675-2019; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/U-7817-2019; Giziene, Vilda/HGC-9674-2022","Simanaviciene, Zaneta/0000-0001-6008-2405;",,,,,39,8,13,4,71,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The empirical results demonstrate that the volatilities of price are significantly larger than those of rental for each type of real estate markets throughout the whole sample period. Besides, the findings indicate that the correlations between price and rental are time-varying, and the average correlation in the housing market is much larger than those in the other three markets. Also, the conditional correlations in the factory market are the most volatile, while those in the office market are relatively stable.

Linear and VAR models are applied to analyze robustness. The linear model shows that, over the long run, a 1% appreciation of NEER causes a decline in the CPI inflation rate of 0.132% and PPI inflation rate of 0.495%. The VAR model supports the results of the linear model, suggesting a fairly low CPI pass-through and relatively higher PPI pass-through. Furthermore, this paper finds that, with the fixed exchange rate regime, CPI pass-through remains higher. The exchange rate regimes influence on CPI pass through, combined with the fact that appreciation diminishes inflation, suggests that the Chinese government could pursue a more flexible exchange rate policy. In addition, reasons for low exchange rate pass-through for CPI are analyzed. The analysis considers price control, basket and weight of Chinese price indices, distribution cost, and imported and non-tradable share of inputs.","Univ Munich, Munich Grad Sch Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Jin, XW (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich Grad Sch Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",Xiaowen.Jin@campus.lmu.de,,,,,,,25,7,8,0,18,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59,2,,,SI,,135,156,,10.2298/PAN1202135J,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,956MH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305093300002,0

They used a cross-sectional empirical framework that considered growth from two kinds of factors, initial levels of steady-state variables and control variables (e. g. investment ratio, infrastructure). Recent literature suggests that Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation of dynamic panel data models produce more efficient and consistent estimates than Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or pooled regression models. Following Cellini (1997), we also consider co-integration and error-correction methods for the growth regression. We extend the previous research for Asian countries of Kim (2009) to developed countries. Following the implications of semi-endogenous growth theory, we regressed output growth on a constant, 1-year lagged output (initial income) and the determinants of steady-state income (investment rate, population growth, the quadratic (or linear) function of Research and Development (R&D) intensity). The regression suggests faster significant convergence. This contradicts with that of Mankiw et al. (1992), which asserts that the speed is lower when considering broad concept of capital including human capital. The coefficients for the determinants of steady-state income, especially for the quadratic function of R&D intensity, are significant and occur in the expected direction. Our results suggest that adopting appropriate growth policy, an economy can grow more rapidly through transition dynamics or changing fundamentals.","ChungJu Natl Univ, Div Liberal Arts, Chungbuk 380702, South Korea",,"Kim, B (通讯作者)，ChungJu Natl Univ, Div Liberal Arts, 50 Daehakro Chungju, Chungbuk 380702, South Korea.",byungw@cjnu.ac.kr,,"Kim, ByungWoo/0000-0002-9188-3288",,,,,47,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It shows that, even if there are over 40 complex environmental information systems and over 100 databases in the Czech Republic, new policies must have well-defined goals and corresponding informational components designed to manage satisfactory ex-post assessment.","[Kreuz, Jaroslav; Sauer, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Inst Sustainable Business, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kreuz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Inst Sustainable Business, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Sauer, Petr/J-5952-2015","Sauer, Petr/0000-0003-3025-8064",,,,,16,2,3,0,10,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

(COMEX). Empirical results show that the transition function is a logistic type. In region 1, the price of crude oil is low. The sign of VIX is positive. USD/yen exerts negative impact on gold market due to the way that gold market functions as a factor of hedge against portfolio and geopolitical risk. In region 2, the price of crude oil is higher (the demand for crude oil may be stronger). The economy is prosperous; VIX turns low; USD/yen increases. Investors have more money from other financial markets to buy gold, thus, causing gold futures price to rise. Besides, gold is both a hedge and a safe haven for developing countries but not for emerging countries; therefore, the relationships between gold and MSCI-E are positive in both regions.","[Lee, Wo-Chiang; Lin, Hui-Na] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Lin, Hui-Na] Chihlee Inst Technol, Dept Banking & Finance, New Taipei City, Taiwan",Tamkang University,"Lee, WC (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",wclee@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,12,12,13,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

(1994, 1995) and Weymark (1995), uses weighted average of loss of foreign reserves and depreciation of local currency to capture foreign exchange market pressure. However, it does not take into account the effect of capital control on foreign exchange market pressure. With effective capital control, the conventional EMPI tends to under-or overestimate the actual foreign exchange market pressure, depending on the magnitude of capital control. We adopt a monetary approach to derive a formula for new EMPI under capital control. Then we test the difference between the old and the new EMPI with China's data. The result shows that the conventional EMPI overestimates the actual foreign exchange market pressure by 91% in average.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Chinese Acad Finance & Dev, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Chinese Acad Finance & Dev, 39 Xueyuan Nan Lu Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",jieli.cn@gmail.com,"Li, Jie/IWV-2094-2023",,,,,,16,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Variability of employees' behaviour during disaffection was modelled based upon identification of factors affecting employee turnover revealed by deduction method and verified by quantitative survey. Formulation of problematic phenomenon and its verification leads to formulation of critical variables in order to lower disaffection and its costs in organisations. Different responses to impulses determine the level of dependence between the primary. impulse (factors influencing employee turnover) and a reaction which is further elaborated according to the significance for the organisation. Differences in behaviours of employees in small national companies and large multinationals and their reactions to impulses are also described. The questionnaires were focused on revealing internal organisational factors leading to turnover. Respondents were part of a survey only if they left their previous job willingly. Thus, results can help to predict internal organisation causes leading to employee turnover and employee behaviour during disaffection.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Linhartová, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic.",linhartoval@pef.czu.cz,"Depoo, Lucie/ABE-4039-2020","Depoo, Lucie/0000-0003-4296-875X",,,,,34,6,6,0,8,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

A sequence of increasingly sophisticated dynamic demand models, most recently Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2009, hereafter GR), have been developed to overcome these problems. We apply both models to new data on the US digital camera market. In addition, we demonstrate that the GR model can be specified as a BLP model plus an additional set of terms. This suggests that a dynamic model can be estimated as a BLP model plus a non-parametric function which is less computationally demanding. As a first step to implementing this semi-parametric approach we estimate a BLP model augmented with age as a proxy for the non-parametric component. We find that demand for digital cameras is more elastic when demand dynamics is accounted for in both the dynamic model and the BLP model with the age proxy. This suggests that the market is more competitive though the results are consistent with firms engaging in intertemporal price discrimination. Merger simulations predict the lowest price and quantity changes using the GR model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This SAM consists of 85 sectors of the economy, three factors of production and nine categories of occupational households. The Indian economy is becoming structurally biased towards capital intensive sectors, such as service and energy production. The energy production sector itself is the most energy intensive sector as of 2003-2004.","[Pal, Barun Deb] NCAER, New Delhi, India; [Pohit, Sanjib] Natl Inst Sci Technol & Dev Studies, N Delhi, India; [Roy, Joyashree] Jadavpur Univ, Kolkata, India",Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Institute of Science Communication & Policy Research (NIScPR); Jadavpur University,"Pal, BD (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI, New Delhi, India.",palbarundeb@gmail.com,"; Pohit, Sanjib/E-6185-2015","Pal, Barun Deb/0000-0002-2584-6155; Pohit, Sanjib/0000-0002-7376-7574; Roy, Joyashree/0000-0002-9270-8860",,,,,37,11,14,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

First, I consider the claim that high levels of government borrowing drive up interest rates. These high rates then produce a heavy burden of government debt as well as heavy inflationary pressures. The evidence reviewed regarding each of these concerns demonstrates that none have emerged as serious matters since the enactment of the ARRA. Given this conclusion, the paper then questions why the ARRA did not then succeed in generating a strong economic recovery. I advance three primary reasons for the failure of the ARRA to achieve a strong recovery: (i) the ARRA relied too heavily on tax cuts as a means of bolstering private spending; (ii) household wealth declined dramatically during the recession, tied to the collapse of the financial bubble, and this in turn weakened the willingness of households to increase spending; and (iii) credit markets were locked up, especially for smaller businesses, despite the highly expansionary monetary policy stance adopted by the Federal Reserve. Building on these findings, I then develop a series of policy proposals aimed at promoting both a strong recovery in the short term and at reducing any remaining structural deficit issues in the longer term. The short-term programme focuses on extending loan guarantees, especially to small businesses, and taxing the excess reserves held by commercial banks. The longer-term agenda focuses on reducing government costs for health care and the military, and on increasing revenue through establishing taxes on financial market transactions.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Pollin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",pollin@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,37,18,22,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The aim was to establish whether men and women would exhibit different degrees of self-interest when making a constrained choice. Around 1800 subjects from east-central England prioritised three different types of cancer screening. Most also provided written explanations for their rankings and these were classified into explanatory themes. Logistic regressions using socio-demographic and attitude data predicted the type of screening chosen as first priority. The analysis revealed that many men and women did indeed assign similar priorities to the different types of screening and, even when the priorities differed, these were often justified by similar arguments relating to technical aspects of the interventions and to self-interest. However, women were far more likely than men to prioritise a type of screening from which they themselves would benefit directly and the variations in preferences and explanations between the sexes occurred primarily because of differences in other-regarding attitudes. The bias towards screening of females was driven by women's greater worries about the disease in question and by men's benevolent sexism with respect to women's wellbeing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Carbon is captured not only in tree biomass but also in forest soils. Forest management and public policy can strongly influence the sequestration process. Economic policies can provide incentives for both forest expansion and contraction. Systems that provide prices for carbon sequestration or taxes for emissions can have important effects on emission and sequestration levels. Issues involve carbon additionality, permanence, and leakage. Forest measurement, monitoring, and verification also provide serious challenges.

The long-term and short-term elasticities of demand with respect to gasoline prices and income are of paramount interest in this study. In Senegal, rising food prices, unemployment and shortage of electric supply are always associated with the spiking cost of world oil prices. To understand the external shocks of world oil price and demand for gasoline in Senegal, this study tested a log linear model against the linear model of the demand-for-oil function with lagged dependent variables as an explanatory variable. Here, the linear specification of the demand for oil is rejected in this study in favor of the log linear. The natural log transformation is typical when using high frequency data and significantly reduces skewness and kurtosis. Generally in this study, I found that short run elasticity is smaller than long-run elasticity and gasoline demand is inelastic with respect to both price and income for both the short and long runs in Senegal. This is why researcher like Moosa posits that this assertion can be rationalised on the grounds that oil is such an important commodity that does not have close substitutes at least for its uses (1998, p. 3).

Not only for individual countries but also for the European Union as a whole the promotion of high value-added activities, in particular in lower development small open economies which hardly recover from external economic shocks and experience significant social problems due to high unemployment level remains a relevant issue. The country's competitiveness and level of development, as well as the country's economy growth, depend on high value-added investment growth, and both private and public investments play a significant role in economy of each country. Government's role, in particular through the fiscal policy, in the promotion of these activities is crucial. The prevailing view in the scientific literature is that in developed countries public investment crowds out private investment, while in developing - crowds in, but it is not clear under what conditions these effects occur because the countries are very different. Also the effect of the taxes revenues and the government expenditure indicators on private investment is unclear because the effect of these variables on private investment has not been studied comprehensively. So the aim of the research is to evaluate the relationship between fiscal policy indicators, such as the government revenues from taxes and the government expenditure, and private investment comprehensively including indicators of macroeconomic environment in the Baltic States, by applying correlation and regression analysis. The conducted research revealed the existence of strong direct relationship between the fiscal policy indicators and private investment in the Baltic States, showing the importance of fiscal policy to private investment. During the analysis of detailed tax and expenditure indicators it has been established that the strongest relationship exists between the current taxes on income, wealth, etc and public investment with private investment. The current taxes on income, wealth, etc indicator explains about 86 percent of the private investment fluctuations and the gross fixed capital formation by public sector indicator explains about 80 percent of the private investment fluctuations in the Baltic States, whereas the effect of these indicators on private investment is analyzed separately, while macroeconomic indicators of a country explain only about 8-13 percent of the private investment fluctuations.","[Sineviciene, Lina; Vasiliauskaite, Asta] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Sineviciene, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55-408, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",lina.sineviciene@ktu.lt; asta.vasiliauskaite@ktu.lt,"Sineviciene, Lina/M-7562-2018",,,,,,49,7,7,2,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The model generates adjustment dynamics in line with the historical facts on savings and economic growth in Europe from the High Middle Ages to today. Along a virtuous cycle of development more wealth leads to more patience, which leads to more savings and further increasing wealth. Savings rates and income growth rates are thus jointly increasing during the process of development until they converge towards constants along a balanced growth path.

This attitude is confirmed by the fact that there are many scientific works on brand image. But there is a lack of theoretical and empirical research on the formation and strengthening of an image of a private brand. It should be noted that theoretical and empirical research, performed by Reda (2002), Ailawadi et al. (2003), based on Batra and Sinha (2000), Garretson et al. (2002), Burton and Lichtenstein (1998), confirm that factors that influence the formation and strengthening of the image of a private brand have not been sufficiently analysed. The scientific problem of this article is formulated with the help of the following questions: what is the influence of a store's image and factors that determine it on the image of a private brand? The aim of this article is to analyse and summarize factors that form private brand image theoretically, and to test them empirically with the help of the example of the store Aprangos galerija. The methods of comparative analysis of scientific literature and systematization were used in order to reach the set aim. Quantitative research method (survey) was applied for empirical research of private brand image strengthening in the aspect of the store Aprangos galerija. Factor analysis was used for data analysis. Multiple linear regression was used for identification of causalities between variables. Based on the analysis of scientific literature, having summarized the results of the performed theoretical and empirical research it is stated that one of the sources of competitive advantage for stores is the creation of a positive and strong private brand image in consumers' consciousness. It should be noted that brand identity elements and associations, related to the product itself and its perceived quality and emotions, form a positive private brand image. Having revealed the conceptual essence of an image, having analysed the structure of a company's image, having identified factors that determine a store's image and based on the results of scientific theoretical and empirical research it is stated that a store's image depends on the following factors: services, convenience, quality, product variety, product prices, and store atmosphere. The results of the performed empirical research have shown that factors forming a store's image (convenience and store atmosphere) have the biggest influence on a positive private brand image. It should be noted that factors determining a store's image such as product variety and price also form a positive private brand image. Based on theoretical provisions and results of empirical research a conclusion is made that in order to strengthen a private brand image it is necessary to make decisions related to the store's place, atmosphere, stock formation, and pricing.","[Virvilaite, Regina; Dailydiene, Migle] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Virvilaite, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",regina.virvilaite@ktu.lt; migle.dailydiene@yahoo.com,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,30,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Equivalence scales are a useful tool for preparing income data for further analyses (such as analyses of poverty or inequality), as they reflect the structure of households. The modified OECD scale is the official equivalence scale applied by Eurostat since the 1990's. The authors of this approach discussed whether a single equivalence scale should be used for all European Union member states, or whether specific (different) equivalence scales should be used in the cross-country comparisons. In the study we simulate application of various combinations of adult/child household members' weights to a linear type equivalence scale at national and regional level of Slovakia. According to the results the distribution of poverty rate estimates at regional level is in coherence with the results estimated at national level. Only the administrative region of the Capital City of Bratislava is exceptional, as there is very weak coherence in the results due to high variability in the data.","[Zelinsky, Tomas] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Tartal'ova, Alena] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Prague 11000, Czech Republic",Technical University Kosice; Charles University Prague,"Zelinsky, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",tomas.zelinsky@tuke.sk; alena.tartalova@tuke.sk,"Zelinsky, Tomas/D-1539-2010; Mojsejova, Alena/AAA-6027-2020","Zelinsky, Tomas/0000-0001-7198-0278; Mojsejova, Alena/0000-0002-0495-0324",,,,,13,4,4,0,2,TECH UNIV KOSICE,KOSICE,"FAC ECONOMICS, INST REGIONAL & COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, KOSICE, 00000, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-1225-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,57,65,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3LJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359860200006,0

Such changes have triggered manufacturers to rethink their global operations. This article studies potential global manufacturing trends from a supply chain perspective. A mixed integer programming model suggests that these changes have negatively affected the region's competitive advantages as its labour-intensive production mainly targets at the mass market and competes on low costs. Three production relocation trends are affirmed, i.e. the relocation to lower-cost areas within China, lower-cost Asian countries and areas near end markets. However, it is also discovered that the GPRD region still attracts businesses with its formation of industrial clusters, the enhanced comparative advantage against competing regions in inland China or Asian lower-cost countries under high oil prices, and Hong Kong's being a robust location choice to host trade operations.","[Zhang, A.; Huang, G.

This article utilizes a unique survey conducted in a UK city region and analyses the effect of commuting time and mode of transport on self-reported job satisfaction. Two cohorts of respondents are constructed based upon income levels, thus establishing the offsetting effect of income on commute. The study finds that commuting time has a negative effect on the utility of workers. However, the effect is found to be income dependent, with those earning the most having no negative effect from commuting time.

The issue is not straightforward since in these surveys completed durations of unemployed individuals are not observed yet they constitute the basis for calculating the kind of index that has been proposed to measure the extent of unemployment in a way that goes beyond the unemployment rate. The index proposed by Shorrocks has robust normative foundations and has an equivalent representation in terms of average complete duration and the density of completed durations. Building upon earlier work applied in the United States for estimating the average completed duration, we present a method that enables the index to be calculated based on an estimate of the density of completed durations. The approach is illustrated in the context of comparing male-female unemployment differences in France, where historically female unemployment has been higher than that of males.","[Bazen, Stephen; Joutard, Xavier; Niang, Mouhamadou M.] Aix Marseille Univ AMSE, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Bazen, Stephen; Joutard, Xavier; Niang, Mouhamadou M.] EHESS, Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bazen, S (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ AMSE, CNRS, Marseille, France.",stephen.bazen@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

However, evidence of their influence in strategic interaction is scant. We experimentally investigate the effect of defaults on contributions to a public good and attempt to shed light on potential channels through which they operate. Our main experimental findings show that defaults influence contribution behaviour: preference for a suggested contribution significantly increases when it is presented as the default. However, this effect seems not to operate primarily through information conveyance or expectations about others' behaviour. Default contributions, thus, appear to have an attractive power that goes beyond recommendation signals and expectation influences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In line with the Tinbergen-Aoki condition, the monetary authority establishes two policy instruments, one for accomplishing each target: the monetary policy rate, and the stock of foreign exchange reserves. Monetary policy analysis is built around a non-microfounded augmented New Keynesian DSGE model estimated through Bayesian techniques for the Guatemalan economy. It is found that each instrument is efficient in accomplishing its own target. Nevertheless, a coordinated effort is required for central bank policymakers before employing both instruments simultaneously, in order to avoid sending mixed signals to economic agents about its monetary policy stance, and endanger the achievement of its inflation target (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Three decades of persistent economic growth in China has been accompanied by high income inequality, which may in turn be caused by the inequality of opportunity in education and health. In this paper, we find that there is a strong correlation of health status between parent and their offspring in both the urban and rural sectors, suggesting the existence of intergenerational health inequality in China. The correlation is robust to various model specifications, including the control of unobserved household heterogeneity using instrumental variables. We also find that parents' socio-economic characteristics and environmental choices are strongly correlated with their own and their children's health, supporting the nature-nurture interaction hypothesis. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition further indicates that 15% to 27% of the rural-urban inequality of child health is attributable to the endowed inequality from their parents' health. An important policy implication of our study is that the increasing inequality of income and opportunity in China can be ameliorated through the improvement of the current generation's health status and living standards.

With a higher elasticity of substitution, the marginal cost advantage becomes more important if it is to dominate the home market effect.

The results from the simulation study show that there is at least one group of the estimators of k that regularly has a lower mean squared error than the ML method for all different situations that have been evaluated. Finally, we show the benefit of the new method using the classical Dehejia and Wahba dataset which is based on a labour market experiment.","[Locking, Hakan; Shukur, Ghazi] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, Kalmar, Sweden; [Mansson, Kristofer; Shukur, Ghazi] Jonkoping Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, Jonkoping, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Jonkoping University,"Shukur, G (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Internatl Business Sch, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, POB 1026, SE-551 Jonkoping, Sweden.",ghazi.shukur@jibs.hj.se,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

While this behavior put the intended protection to debtor and creditor at risk, economic theory does not rule out a welfare enhancing effect. We test the hypothesis that the judicial auctions' design reduces the welfare of those intended to protect and, consistent with the predictions of our model, we find it is more likely for Courts to appoint the less effective auctioneers and that the net price received by creditors and debtors in judicial auctions is about 18% to 33% below those that could be obtained in private auctions.","[Paredes, Ricardo D.; Crisosto K, Andres; Marti C, Philippe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Paredes, RD (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",rparedes@ing.puc.cl,"Paredes, Ricardo D/M-1653-2013",,,,,,22,0,0,0,12,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

This paper demonstrates that China's leading position in high-tech exports is a myth created by outdated trade statistics, which are inconsistent with trade based on global supply chains. Current trade statistics mistakenly credit entire values of assembled high-tech products to China, thus greatly inflating its exports. This paper adopted a value-added approach to more accurately measure high-tech exports, revealing that, in 2009, China's value-added accounted for only about 3 percent of the total value attributed for its exports of iPhones and laptop PCs. Furthermore, if assembly is the only source of value-added by Chinese workers, in terms of technological contribution, these assembled high-tech exports are indifferent from labor-intensive products, and so they should be excluded from the high-tech classification.","[Xing, Yuqing] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1006008, Japan; [Xing, Yuqing] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1006008, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Xing, YQ (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Kasumigaseki Bldg 8F 3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan.",yxing@adbi.org,,,,,,,4,31,33,3,99,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

The program consisted in offering free additional math courses, taught by undergraduate students from some of the most prestigious Mexican universities, to the lowest performance students in a set of marginalized schools in Mexico City. We exploit the information available in all students' (treated and not treated by the program) transcripts enrolled in participating and non-participating schools. Before the implementation of the program, participating students lagged behind non-participating ones by more than a half base point in their GPA (over 10). Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that students participating in the program observed a higher increase in their school grades after the implementation of the program, and that the difference in grades between the two groups decreases over time. By the end of the school year (when the free extra courses had been offered, on average, for 10 weeks), participating students' grades were not significantly lower than non-participating students' grades. These results provide some evidence that short and low-cost interventions can have important effects on student achievement.","[Gutierrez, Emilio] ITAM, Ctr Invest Econ, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico; [Rodrigo, Rodimiro] Dept Econ Prod, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Gutiérrez, E (通讯作者)，ITAM, Ctr Invest Econ, Camino Sta Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico.",emilio.gutierrez@itam.mx; rodimiro_rodrigo@hacienda.gob.mx,,,Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura,Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura,"We thank the Ministry of Education (SEP) in Mexico City for providing the data and the Laboratory of Initiatives for Development (LID) for the commitment with the evaluation.

We induce variation in enforcement by randomly assigning students to rooms with different monitoring levels. The second phase is post-exam. In this phase, all students are subject to the same low level of monitoring. Our outcome variable is the probability that students steal a pen in the post-exam phase. We find that enforcement in the exam phase has a strong intertemporal spillover on compliance in the post-exam phase: students subject to a high monitoring level in the initial phase are about 33% less likely to steal the pen than students subject to low initial monitoring.

Voters can trade votes for a numeraire before making a decision via majority rule. We identify a sufficient condition guaranteeing the existence of an ex ante equilibrium. In equilibrium, only the most intense voter on each side demands votes, and each demands enough votes to alone control a majority. The equilibrium strongly resembles an all-pay auction for decision power: it makes clear that votes are only a medium for the allocation of power. The probability of a minority victory is always higher than efficient and converges rapidly to one-half as the electorate increases, for any minority size. The numerical advantage of the majority becomes irrelevant: democracy is undone by the market. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Secondly, we analyse the effects of financial, knowledge and market barriers on the innovation outcomes of the firms. The data is taken from the Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC) for Spanish firms for the period 2004-2010. We use a structural model with three equations corresponding to the decision to carry out R&D or not, the R&D effort, and the production of innovations. The results of the econometric estimations show, first, that R&D intensity is positively related to process innovation.

These dual views define a lower and an upper bounds on awards, which are used to implement the so-called Double Recursive Process.

We find conditions under which the asymptotic risk of the averaging estimator is globally smaller than the unrestricted least-squares estimator. For the Mallows averaging estimator under homoskedastic errors, the condition takes the simple form that the regressors have been grouped into sets of four or larger. This condition is a direct extension of the classic theory of James-Stein shrinkage. This discovery suggests the practical rule that implementation of averaging estimators be restricted to models in which the regressors have been grouped in this manner. Our simulations show that this new recommendation results in substantial reduction in mean-squared error relative to averaging over all nested submodels. We illustrate the method with an application to the regression estimates of Fryer and Levitt (2013).","Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hansen, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Hansen, Bruce E/AAZ-5224-2020",,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1258858] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,49,55,67,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The findings suggest the existence of co-movements among exchange rates. The exchange rate global factor seems to play a central role in explaining exchange rate variability in Western Europe, whereas regional and country-specific factors are the most important ones in North America and Central and Eastern Europe, respectively. Finally, the paper shows empirical evidence in favour of the connection between exchange rate global factor variability and macroeconomic fundamentals.

We find that technical change reduces the NOx marginal cost about 28.3% in 2000-2004 and 26.5% in 2004-2008. However, more stringent regulations enacted the NOx budget program results in lower NOx emission levels as plant operators install more advanced NOx, abatement equipment which in turn causes an overall increase in marginal abatement cost.

In addition to the uniform pricing (UP) constraint, which is an obligation to serve all consumers at an identical price, constraints considered are the coverage constraint (CC), which is an obligation imposed on one of the firms to serve a given segment of the market, and the license constraint (LC), which is a minimum or a maximum coverage restriction that is imposed on entrants. We show that adding the UP constraint to both a CC and a LC leads to an increase in welfare.

However, ex post reduced form estimates of the effects of DST find no evidence of energy savings and find some evidence of a small increase in energy use. This paper investigates this disconnect using detailed individual time use data to look at the behavioral effects of DST. We study how individuals change their time use in response to the abrupt shift in daylight associated with DST. We leverage two natural experiments to identify the effect of DST on behavior. First, we study periods around the annual shift in daylight induced by moving into and out of DST. Second, we compare activities by time interval before and after the change in DST start dates that occurred in 2007. We find cautious evidence that individuals are shifting potentially energy intensive activities earlier in the day, which is consistent with earlier findings of increased energy usage.

Vela",,,Towards a political economy of the theory of economic policy,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Theory of economic policy; Policy ineffectiveness; Rules versus discretion; Mathematical tools,TIME,"The theory of economic policy, in its mathematical modes, may be said to have had two incarnations, identified in terms of pre-Lucasian and ultra-Lucasian on a timescale whose origin can be traced to the Scandinavian works of the 1920s and early 1930s, beginning with Lindahl, Frisch, Myrdal and Hammarskjold. The end of the ultra-Lucasian period, in Frances Fukuyama senses, might well have been the date (2004) of Prescott's Nobel Prize Lecture. The codification of what may be called the 'classical' theory of economic policy was initiated in the pioneering formalisations by Frisch and Tinbergen, and elegantly summarised in Bent Hansen's early (1955), advanced text book. The launching pads for the ultra-Lucasian period were the Lucas critique, the elementary saddlepoint dynamics-based policy ineffectiveness 'theorem' of Sargent and Wallace and the dynamic programming-based time-invariance proposition of Kydland and Prescott. Further, the important contribution by Ramsey is another kind of 'origin'. In this article I first try to trace a path of the mathematisation of the theory of economic policy, from this specific origin to the stated culminating point. Second, an attempt is made to expose the nature of the Emperor's New (Mathematical) Clothes in which the mathematisation of the theory of economic policy was attired. Finally, it is shown that the obfuscation by the mathematics of efficiency, equilibrium and the fundamental theorems of welfare economics can be dispelled by an enlightened, alternative mathematisation that makes it possible to resurrect the poetic tradition in economics and 'connect the prose in us with the passion' (E. M. Forster) for policy in the manner in which Geoff Harcourt has 'connected' them.","[Velupillai, K. Vela] New Sch Univ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Velupillai, K.

In previous work the role of diversity with regard to personal characteristics within entrepreneurial teams, such as education, gender and nationality was not clear. Specifically, we focus on task-oriented (e.g., education, experience) and relations-oriented (e.g., age, nationality) dimensions of diversity. The participants of our experiment had to decide on providing early-stage funding to a team of start-up managers whereas the diversity of these teams varied across treatment groups. We find that task-oriented diversity is positively and significantly related to the willingness of respondents to provide capital. Interestingly, the same applies for relations-oriented diversity. This suggests social capital of an entrepreneurial team matters to a greater extent to funding decisions of external investors than the behavioral integration of the team's human capital. Entrepreneurial teams must therefore carefully balance the social costs of non-task-related diversity and the access to financial resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In 2004, Medicare began to risk-adjust capitation payments to private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to reduce selection-driven overpayments. But because the variance of medical costs increases with the predicted mean, incentivizing enrollment of individuals with higher scores can increase the scope for enrolling overpriced individuals with costs significantly below the formula's prediction. Indeed, after risk adjustment, MA plans enrolled individuals with higher scores but lower costs conditional on their score.

We conclude that governance matters for mitigating industrial water pollution.

J,"Gordon, RH; Kopczuk, W",,,,"Gordon, Roger H.; Kopczuk, Wojciech",,,The choice of the personal income tax base,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Income tax; Tax base; Optimal taxation,COMMODITY TAXATION,"Starting with Vickrey (1945) and Mirrlees (1971), the optimal tax literature has studied the design of a personal income tax. The assumed ideal would be to tax earnings ability. Earnings ability is unobservable for tax purposes, however. Past papers have focused instead on designing a tax on labor income. Existing tax bases, though, depend on a broader range of information about each individual than just labor income. In principle, this supplementary information can help in designing a tax that has more attractive distributional properties, by more closely approximating an ability tax. The objective of this paper is to lay out theoretically and estimate empirically how to make best use of available information about each individual in addition to earnings, in a setting where the first-best tax would be an ability tax. The theory lays out an equity/efficiency trade off when choosing the tax base. In the empirical work, we find the tax base that is best on equity grounds alone. We find that the choice to tax couples based on their joint income, and the inclusion of dividends, interest income, and dependents' deduction in the tax base in roughly their current form can be rationalized simply based on their value in better approximating an ability tax, without any need for supplementary motivations for these provisions. However, the inclusion of mortgage and property tax payments in the list of itemized deductions cannot be defended on these grounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Existing work has used bequest receipt to signal a parent's access to credit markets when investing in his children's human capital. However, measurement error in bequest receipt generates misclassification error and, in turn, attenuation bias. Employing switching regressions with imperfect sample separation to deal with this error, we show that the intergenerational persistence of consumption in the United States for credit constrained families is much higher than that for unconstrained families, contrary to what the theory implies. This means that children from constrained families are more likely to have consumption levels similar to those of their parents than children from unconstrained families.

We consider two policy instruments: an income tax rate and the split of government spending between consumption and production services. The Markov-perfect policy implies a higher income tax rate and a larger proportion of government spending allocated to consumption than those chosen under a commitment constraint on the part of the government. As a consequence, economic growth is slightly lower under the Markov-perfect policy than under the Ramsey policy. Under the Markov and Ramsey optimal policies, a higher weight of leisure in households' preferences leads to a lower optimal income tax rate and a lower proportion of public resources devoted to consumption. We also show that the policy bias that would arise when imposing a Markov policy designed ignoring the presence of leisure in the utility function would lead to a significant welfare loss.

The model shows that, when elasticity of demand for the product with a lower learning potential is lower than unitary, a reduction in the tariff imposed on this product, may shift the demand toward the product with a higher learning potential, thus enhancing economic growth in the exporter economy. Therefore, the current trend of reduction in tariffs on agricultural exports not only generates a positive welfare effect in the short run, but may similarly be beneficial for developing economies in the long run, since it also increases their incentive to develop sectors with higher growth potential.","[Azarnert, Leonid V.] Ariel Univ, Dept Econ & Business Adm, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel; [Azarnert, Leonid V.] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Ariel University; Ifo Institut,"Azarnert, LV (通讯作者)，Ariel Univ, Dept Econ & Business Adm, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel.",Leonid.Azarnert@ariel.ac.il,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We also discuss how the negative endogenous growth paradigm may help to account for it.

Steve Keen has proposed an alternative approach to macroeconomics which he sometimes labels as the 'Walras-Schumpeter-Minsky Law'. His key claim seems to be that as a consequence of endogenous money - the concepts of effective demand and aggregate supply should be redefined to include the 'change in [private] debt' as well as financial asset transactions. This paper cautions that doing so may generate more confusion than what the redefinitions seek to clarify. Further, while endogenous money is a fact, it is important to recognise the roles of financial intermediation and adverse trends in income distribution in shaping the macro patterns and financing relations that preceded the Great Recession in the United States.","Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Fiebiger, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,10,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Contrasting with previous literature, a small degree of vertical integration is always procompetitive because efficiency gains dominate foreclosure effects, and vertical integration even to full foreclosure can be procompetitive. Interestingly, vertical integration is more likely to be procompetitive if the industry is otherwise more concentrated. Extensions analyze welfare effects of integration and the incentives to integrate. Our analysis suggests that antitrust authorities should be wary of vertical integration when the integrating firm faces many competitors and should be permissive otherwise.","[Loertscher, Simon] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Reisinger, Markus] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany",University of Melbourne; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Loertscher, S (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",simonl@unimelb.edu.au; markus.reisinger@whu.edu,,,,,,,29,16,20,1,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

The pricing of the option is then performed once the equivalent correlation parameter between the long leg underlying and the proxy short leg component has been calculated. The main advantage associated with the moment matching approach proposed in this paper is a reduction of the diniension of the pricing problem: we can, indeed, continue using all the option formulas available in the literature for two-legged spread options, Le. spread options written on two underlyings. Besides it, the combined use of an option formula for two-legged spread options and the moment matching technique applied to the short leg component provides a good approximation to the Monte Carlo simulation. It is well-known that the Monte Carlo price and Greeks can be considered as the benchmark since no exact formula is available for the pricing and hedging of multi-asset spread options. The accuracy of our approach is even comparable to the one provided by using closed form approximation formulas based on three underlyings, where each underlying entering into the short leg component is treated separately.

Via a choice experiment households are offered the choice between a set of smart meters, described by six attributes: impact on the comfort and privacy level, functionality, visibility, cost savings, and investment outlay. We estimate a main effects conditional logit model and a main effects random parameter logit model, including interactions with socio-demographic characteristics. The results show that households have heterogeneous preferences for some attributes but not for others. The estimates are used to assess marginal willingness to pay values. From a policy perspective, our findings suggest that sufficient effort should be devoted to designing the smart metering devices and to informing households. Without careful preparation, a mandatory or voluntary roll-out of smart meters risks to be unsuccessful because device characteristics do not meet consumer needs. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V.

In a certain-lived monopoly, the leader invests sooner than in a duopoly if there is a risk of being preempted, and later than in a monopoly if the leader role is preassigned.

I consider a setting where firms spend on innovation and thereby influence the evolution of productivity. When distortions are tied to productivity, firm-level innovation falls and the distribution over productivity becomes right-skewed. Quantitatively, TFP and average output falls and is amplified through the innovation channel. When distortions are uniform across firms, instead of correlated with productivity, the effects on TFP and average output are dampened. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Finally, we construct various measures of exchange rate misalignment for all the exchange rates included in our panels.","[Zhang, Guangfeng] Aix Marseille Univ, Sch Econ, GREQAM, F-13236 Marseille, France; [MacDonald, Ronald] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Aix-Marseille Universite; University of Glasgow,"Zhang, GF (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Sch Econ, GREQAM, F-13236 Marseille, France.",guangfeng.f.zhang@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,6,6,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

How does foreign direct investment (FDI) affect IC in China? The significance of the topic, besides the intrinsic importance of IC, is heightened by outstanding performance of the Chinese industry and massive increase in FDI flows into China in the past decade. Yet empirical studies on the issue in the literature have been limited. This article attempts to close the gap by estimating the role of FDI with a large panel data of 21 manufacturing sectors for 31 regions in six years (2005-2010). We construct, following the method of UNIDO (2002), the IC index to measure multidimensional industrial performance. Several empirical specifications are developed for IC level and IC growth with both panel and cross-section data. Results suggest that FDI has large positive effects on China's industrial performance; such effects are much greater on low-tech manufacturing than medium- and high-tech industries, and the contribution is enhanced by FDI's interaction with local human capital. The role of FDI increases with FDI inflows over the period, and changes in FDI affect changes in industrial performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We use electoral and census data at the locality level to investigate the role of return migration on participation rates and electoral competitiveness. First, we run OLS and IV estimations for the 2009 municipal election, controlling for current emigration and using historical and distance variables as instruments for return migration and current emigration. Second, we build a panel dataset combining the 1998 and 2009 censuses and the electoral results for the municipal ballots of those two years to control for the potential time-invariant unobservable characteristics of the localities. We find a positive impact of the stock of return migrants on participation rates and on electoral competitiveness, which mainly stems from returnees from non-African countries. Finally, we show that the impact of returnees on turnout goes beyond their own participation, and that they affect more electoral outcomes in areas where non-migrants are poorly educated, which we interpret as evidence of a diffusion of political norms from returnees to non-migrants.

An often used modeling shortcut accounts for such developments using a one-sector model with shocks to the efficiency of investment in a capital accumulation equation. This shortcut is theoretically justified when some stringent conditions are satisfied. Using a two-sector model, we consider the implications of relaxing several of the conditions that are at odds with the U.S. Input-Output Tables, including equal factor shares across sectors. The effects of productivity shocks to an investment-producing sector of our two-sector model differ from those of efficiency shocks to investment in a one-sector model.

With withdrawals spread over the life of the annuities contract, the benefit promises to return the entire initial annuitization amount irrespective of the market performance of the underlying fund portfolio. Treating the dynamic withdrawal rate as the control variable, the earlier works on GMWB have considered the construction of a continuous singular stochastic control model and the numerical solution of the resulting pricing model. This paper presents a more detailed characterization of the pricing properties of the GMWB and performs a full mathematical analysis of the optimal dynamic withdrawal policies under the competing factors of time value of fund, optionality value provided by the guarantee and penalty charge on excessive withdrawal. When a proportional penalty charge is applied on any withdrawal amount, we can reduce the pricing formulation to an optimal stopping problem with lower and upper obstacles. We then derive the integral equations for the determination of a pair of optimal withdrawal boundaries. When a proportional penalty charge is applied on the amount that is above the contractual withdrawal rate, we manage to characterize the behavior of the optimal withdrawal boundaries that separate the domain of the pricing models into three regions: no withdrawal, continuous withdrawal at the contractual rate and an immediate withdrawal of a finite amount. Under certain limiting scenarios such as a high policy fund value, the time close to expiry, or a low value of guarantee account, we manage to obtain analytical approximate solution to the singular stochastic control model of dynamic withdrawals.

Finally, it appears that the impact of these shocks is the same for young boys and girls, which suggests that there is no gender-based discrimination in the allocation of resources within households.","[Rabassa, Mariano] Pontificia Univ Catolica, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rabassa, Mariano] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Skoufias, Emmanuel] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Jacoby, Hanan] World Bank, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica Argentina; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); The World Bank; The World Bank,"Skoufias, E (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",eskoufias@worldbank.org,"Rabassa, Mariano Javier/ABB-8444-2021","Rabassa, Mariano J./0000-0002-7638-400X",,,,,32,42,51,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The cointegration test results suggest the presence of long-run relations between oil prices and the following price indices: aggregate consumer price index, non-food and beverage price index, housing and furnishing price index, energy price index, non-raw food and energy price index and transportation and communication price index. Meanwhile, food and beverage price index and raw food price index are not cointegrated with the oil prices. From the dynamic analyses, we uncover evidence for asymmetric adjustments of the aggregate consumer prices, the non-food and beverage prices and the housing and furnishing prices towards their long-run values. Further, the effects of oil prices on inflation are observed to be significant in all goods sectors in the short run. The largest impacts of oil price changes are on the energy price inflation followed by the transportation and communication price inflation and the non-raw food and energy price inflation.","[Ibrahim, Mansor H.] Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Chancharoenchai, Kanokwan] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",INCEIF; Kasetsart University,"Ibrahim, MH (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",mansorhi@inceif.org,"CHANCHAROENCHAI, Kanokwan/HJI-8844-2023; Ibrahim, Mansor/AAU-6887-2020","Ibrahim, Mansor/0000-0003-0413-0075",,,,,34,24,24,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

To combat moral hazard, moderate copayments for the purchase of prescription drugs were introduced and increased several times. These measures, however, have been insufficient to buck the steadily increasing tide of Germany's statutory health care expenditure, making further reforms indispensable. Among a multitude of potential reform proposals, such as a switch to a health premia regime, are two policy options that provide for incentives to limit health care demand: mandatory deductibles and further elevating copayments. By combining an applied general equilibrium (AGE) model with abundant empirical data on heterogeneous household types, this article investigates the economic effects of these two policy options, thereby looking at both the current earnings-related SHI system and a hypothetical health premia regime characterized by per capita premia. As a key outcome, we find that the decrease in expenditure associated with both reform options is too small to induce substantial overall effects, most notably, because both the level of deductibles and the copayment rate are rather moderate in international contexts.","Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Chair Org Theory, D-56179 Koblenz Vallendar, Germany",,"Schubert, S (通讯作者)，Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Chair Org Theory, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Koblenz Vallendar, Germany.",Stefanie.Schubert@whu.edu,,"Schubert, Stefanie A./0000-0002-1087-1833",,,,,47,3,3,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using a utility function motivated by prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), we show that whilst lifecycle funds are vastly superior to money market funds (except for very low thresholds), they rank below balanced funds that maintain constant exposure to equities over time. As thresholds increase, lifecycle funds are also dominated by funds that switch assets conditional to prior investment performance.

The model represents horizontal oligopolistic relationships among producers, bilateral market power between producer (Russia) and transit (Ukraine) countries, detailed transport constraints, and operation decisions over a 20 year time horizon. To demonstrate the model's capabilities, a financial and market analysis of the proposed South Stream gas pipeline from Russia via the Black Sea to South Europe is summarized. Insights obtained include the following. First, expectations of high demand growth in Europe and/or transit risks do not justify the construction of the South Stream pipeline because under all demand and Ukraine transit interruption scenarios, the net benefits to the South Stream participants are negative (the NPV ranges from -$1.9 billion (bn) to -$7.4 bn). Second, Ukraine's perception of high transit market power vis-a-vis Russia may trigger the construction of the otherwise unprofitable South Stream project. Thus, under Ukraine's high transit market power scenario, the NPV of South Stream ranges between $2.4 bn and $24.5 bn. Third, we find that the South Stream investment increases the efficiency of the European gas market under the following conditions: (i) when gas demand in Europe grows 2% per year up to 2030, (ii) when Ukraine poses high transit market power, or (iii) under a combination of severe transit risks through Ukraine and low demand scenarios in Europe. It should be noted that the value of South Stream to both its project sponsors and the market as a whole is much higher when Ukraine exercises transit market power than under the high demand scenario. Therefore, whether Ukraine is likely to wield market power is crucial to the success of the South Stream project because that is the only scenario in which the project yields both a positive expected NPV to its sponsors and the highest value to the market as a whole.

I show that a fairly standard model of business and credit fluctuations with agency costs can neither generate the lagging behavior of business credit nor induce the observed cross-correlation patterns of output, investment, and business loans.

Taking the Smets-Wouters model as the central bank's approximating model, the paper's main findings are as follows. First, a central bank's credibility can have large consequences for how policy responds to shocks. Second, central banks that have low credibility can benefit from a desire for robustness because this desire motivates the central bank to follow through on policy announcements that would otherwise not be time-consistent. Third, even relatively small departures from perfect credibility can produce important declines in policy performance. Fourth, the risk premium shock represents an important potential source of model misspecification. Finally, as a technical contribution, the paper develops a numerical procedure to solve the decision-problem facing an imperfectly credible policy-maker that seeks robustness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, by constructing an environmental efficiency index for 111 countries from 1980 to 2009, we are able to empirically test for one such link. An improvement in the environmental efficiency index in terms of carbon dioxide emissions reflects a decrease in the cost of efforts to mitigate the environmental costs associated with growth. Countries that improve their environmental efficiency are found to experience strong international trade effects, both through increased exports and increased imports. While the positive link between efficiency improvements and exports is supportive of the Porter hypothesis, the positive link between efficiency improvements and imports is supportive of strong positive income effects on account of environmental efforts. These results, which are robust to alternative estimation strategies, lend strong support to global efforts to improve countries' environmental efficiencies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show that a model that assumes trade in intermediate goods brings the dynamics of an otherwise standard small open economy closer to what is observed in the data. With trade in intermediate goods, movements of international relative prices affect the economy through an additional channel, denoted the cost channel. A model embedding this channel comes closer to business cycle data in several dimensions compared to models with trade in final goods only. It increases the share of output variance explained by foreign shocks, lowers the exchange rate pass-through, and delivers a positive international correlation of outputs. In addition, the matching of other business cycle moments is at least as good as in a model with trade in final goods only.","[Eyquem, Aurelien] Univ Lyon, Lyon, France; [Eyquem, Aurelien] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France; [Eyquem, Aurelien] GATE Lyon St Etienne, Ecully, France; [Eyquem, Aurelien] Univ Lyon 2, F-69365 Lyon 07, France; [Eyquem, Aurelien] GREDI, Espoo, Finland; [Kamber, Guenes] Reserve Bank New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Lyon 2; Reserve Bank of New Zealand,"Kamber, G (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank New Zealand, Dept Econ, 2 Terrace,POB 2498, Wellington, New Zealand.",Gunes.Kamber@rbnz.govt.nz,,,,,,,24,6,6,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

To do so, we exploit information on the German local business tax which is set autonomously by German municipalities. As the dates for local council elections vary across German states, the data allows us to disentangle effects related to the timing of elections from common trends. The findings support the notion of a political cycle in tax setting as the growth in local business tax rates is significantly reduced in the election year and the year prior to the election, while it significantly increases in the year after the election. This pattern turns out to be robust against a number of sensitivity checks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This article builds on the gender peer effects literature in a number of ways. First, we focus on early elementary school students, for which fewer studies exist. We also test whether effects in early elementary grades are subject-specific. Contrary to findings for older grade levels, we find that estimates by gender are subject-specific for the early elementary grades. Second, previous studies using similar estimation have focused on very different geographical areas, while this study makes use of nationally representative elementary school data for the United States. Third, we explore whether effects vary across grades, for which the existing literature finds mixed results. We find that the negative subject-specific effects of having a higher proportion of boys in the classroom increases in magnitude across grades, with insignificant effects in kindergarten, negative and significant by first grade, and larger negative and significant effects by third grade. Our findings suggest that a more balanced gender mix in the classroom is optimal for both reading and math comprehension for both boys and girls. However, regarding math performance, there is also suggestive evidence that a 100% separation of genders could improve girls' math performance without consequences for boys' math performance, motivating further research into single-gender subject-specific instruction.","[Graves, Jennifer] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Gottfried, Michael A.] Loyola Marymount Univ, Sch Educ, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Loyola Marymount University,"Graves, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",mgottfri@lmu.edu; jgraves@ou.edu,"Graves, Jennifer/K-9465-2017",,,,,,49,2,2,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

A best-answer rule provides a unique, efficient equilibrium in which all users respond in the first round, for substitutes valuations over information. However, the best-answer rule isolates the least efficient equilibrium for complements valuations. We demonstrate alternate scoring rules that provide an efficient equilibrium for distinct subclasses of complements valuations, and retain an efficient equilibrium for substitutes valuations.

This paper quantifies the effects of these eligibility expansions within the context of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. I construct a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with indivisible labor supply expanded to include an endogenous household choice of health insurance coverage and calibrate it to U.S. data. I establish that changes in the distribution of labor and welfare associated with removal of asset testing are driven by exit of high productivity and high wealth households from the labor market. I then expand my analysis to the 2010 Affordable Care Act to demonstrate that removal of asset testing is critical to the obtained results even when combined with other provisions of the Act. Finally, I find that a simple asset test for eligibility of health insurance transfers undoes the distortion to the household labor supply decision among high productivity types. These results are robust to the introduction of employer premium contributions, an independent health insurance market, and idiosyncratic shocks to eligibility for employment-based health insurance.

The potential for a transition towards cleaner and more efficient fuels and technologies is assessed by zooming in on three fuel-stove combinations. We find substantial demand and positive willingness to pay for the fuel-stove combinations in three locations representing different decision environments. Demand is significantly higher in the peri-urban and the resource abundant rural location than in the resource scarce rural location. The presence of better developed consumer markets for fuels in these locations functions as an important driver for cookstove adoption. Although charcoal and ethanol stoves are preferred over improved firewood stoves, continued firewood usage is expected. Energy switching behavior cannot be substantiated. Instead, energy stacking is more likely, where charcoal and ethanol add to and extend a household's energy portfolio. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The correlation between different crop yields due to rotations or systemic risks requires estimation of joint yield distribution for multiple crops. In this article, we apply a nonparametric method to estimate bivariate yield distributions using farm-level yield data of wheat and corn in Shandong Province in China. Then, the simulated yields are used to evaluate the expected indemnity of one traditional and one hypothetical crop insurance programme. Our results reveal that the nonparametric bivariate method is very flexible in shaping the yield probability density functions to estimate local idiosyncrasies and correlation between two crops. It is also feasible to simulate the nonparametric yield distributions at a satisfying level of accuracy. The simulation results show that the hypothetical two-crop insurance contract can be more affordable to farmers than traditional individual crop insurance contracts.","[Zheng, Qiujie] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Econ, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Wang, H.

Although the amount of aggregate reserves is determined almost entirely by the policy initiatives of the central bank that act on the asset side of its balance sheet, the motivations of individual banks in accumulating reserves differ and respond to the impact of changes in the economic environment on individual institutions. We undertake a systematic analysis of this massive accumulation of excess reserves using bank-level data for more than 7000 commercial banks and almost 1000 savings institutions during the U.S. financial crisis. We propose a testable stochastic model of reserves determination when interest is paid on reserves, which we estimate using bank-level data and censored regression methods. We find evidence primarily of a precautionary motive for reserves accumulation with some notable heterogeneity in the response of reserves accumulation to external and internal factors of the largest banks compared with smaller banks. We combine propensity score matching and a difference-in-differences approach to determine whether the beneficiaries of the Capital Purchase Program of the Troubled Asset Relief Program accumulated less cash, including reserves, than non-beneficiaries. Contrary to anecdotal evidence, we find, that banks that participated in the program accumulated less cash, including reserves, than nonparticipants in the initial quarters after the capital injection.

Under dictatorship the labour market is monopsonistic; democratization involves instituting a competitive labour market. Workers sometimes have a credible threat of revolution and this may affect the dictator's investment decision; it may also induce democratization. The possibility of a 'political development trap', where the dictator stifles development to stay in power, emerges. The model is used, inter alia, to explain the effects of the 1832 Reform Act in the UK and the worldwide positive correlation between income and democracy.","[Ellis, Christopher J.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Fender, John] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Oregon; University of Birmingham,"Ellis, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

However, it has been neither particularly well understood nor well measured. Non-linear pricing is of practical importance for statistical agencies who, in constructing price indexes, are often required to compare the relative price of a product-variety of two different sizes. It is usually assumed that prices change one-for-one with package and pack size (e.g. a 1-liter cola costs half as much as a 2-liter bottle). We question the wisdom of such an assumption and outline a model to flexibly estimate the price-size function. Applying our model to a large U.S. scanner dataset for carbonated beverages, at a disaggregated level, we find very significant discounts for larger-sized products. This highlights the need to pursue methods such as those advocated in this paper.","[Fox, Kevin J.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Fox, Kevin J.] Univ New S Wales, CAER, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Melser, Daniel] Moodys Econ Com, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Fox, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",k.fox@unsw.edu.au,,"Melser, Daniel/0000-0003-0452-818X; Fox, Kevin/0000-0003-2364-4979",,,,,24,8,9,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We establish a dual-channel model which consists of a manufacturer, an online shop owned by a manufacturer and a retailer. We first examine the ordering decisions and establish the existence of the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Then we study other decisions under two types of transshipment price setting: exogenous and endogenous. Under exogenous transshipment price, we investigate the wholesale price decisions of the manufacturer. And then we find that the transshipment strategy with wholesale price contract can coordinate the supply chain only under a certain condition and cannot accommodate arbitrary divisions of the profit. So we further develop an all-unit quantity discount contract to coordinate the supply chain and achieve win-win outcome. Under endogenous transshipment price, we use Generalized Nash Bargaining Solution to study the transshipment price decisions and obtain a transshipment price mechanism. We find that the transshipment price mechanism always coordinates the supply chain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Daily futures and spot price series on eight commodities from the Indian commodity exchanges (MCX and NCDEX) were examined for the period 3rd January, 2008 to 31st December, 2012.The results of frequency domain analysis suggest that there is a strong unidirectional relationship from futures to spot in almost all the selected commodities. This indicates that futures market has a powerful price discovery function in all the selected commodities; which in turn indicates the efficiency of Indian commodity futures market.

They provide livelihood for billions of people. Yet their role in economic development remains controversial with some viewing informality as pent-up potential and others viewing informality as a parasitic organizational form that hinders economic growth. In this paper, we assess these perspectives. We argue that the evidence is most consistent with dual models, in which informality arises out of poverty and the informal and formal sectors are very different. It seems that informal firms have low productivity and produce low- quality products; and, consequently, they do not pose a threat to the formal firms. Economic growth comes from the formal sector, that is, from firms run by educated entrepreneurs and exhibiting much higher levels of productivity. The expansion of the formal sector leads to the decline of the informal sector in relative and eventually absolute terms. A few informal firms convert to formality, but more generally they disappear because they cannot compete with the much more-productive formal firms.","[La Porta, Rafael] Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Shleifer, Andrei] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Dartmouth College; Harvard University,"La Porta, R (通讯作者)，Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",rafael.laporta@tuck.dartmouth.edu; ashleifer@harvard.edu,,,,,,,22,515,585,3,77,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We construct a DSGE model with leverage constrained banks lending to firms and holding domestic government bonds. Bond prices reflect endogenously generated sovereign risk. This introduces a negative amplification cycle: after a credit crisis output losses increase more because higher interest rates trigger lower bond prices and subsequent losses at banks. This further tightens bank leverage constraints, and causes interest rates to rise further. Also bank recapitalizations are then much less effective. Recaps involve swaps of newly issued sovereign bonds for bank equity, the new debt increases sovereign debt discounts, leading to capital losses for the banks on their holdings of sovereign debt that (partially) offset the impact of the recapitalization. The favorable macroeconomic effects of bank recaps on the recovery after a financial crisis are correspondingly lower. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[van der Kwaak, C. G.

In a regime of high financial stress, stress shocks can have large and persistent impacts on the real side of the economy whereas in regimes of low stress, shocks can easily dissipate having no lasting effects. In order to study the macroeconomic dynamics, with alternative paths resulting from financial stress shocks, the authors introduce a macromodel with a finance-macro link which uses a multi-period decision framework of economic agents. The agents can, in a finite horizon context, borrow and accumulate assets where however the above two scenarios may occur. The model is solved through nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC).

Although such bureaucracy intermediaries are, anecdotally, linked with corruption and welfare losses, few formal analyses exist. We introduce a model in which a government license can benefit individuals. We study the net license gain when individuals get the license through the regular licensing procedure, through bribing or through intermediaries. For a given procedure, individuals using intermediaries are better off than if intermediaries and corruption had not existed. Then, we study the incentives of corrupt bureaucrats to create red tape. Bureaucrats implement more red tape and individuals are unambiguously worse off in a setting with intermediaries than with direct corruption only. Intermediaries can thus improve access to the bureaucracy, but also strengthen the incentives to create red tape a potential explanation why licensing procedures tend to be long in developing countries.

This paper investigates the effect of political connections on credit access, and the role of financial development in moderating the relationship between the two. The analysis is based on a unique dataset of manufacturing firms that covers dozens of developing and transition countries. The results show that the strength of political connections, measured by the amount of time the firm's senior managers spend with government officials, has a significant positive effect on credit access. Exploiting the cross-country dimension of the dataset, I then show that the effect of political connections is higher in countries where the banking sector is more concentrated and has higher net interest margin. Furthermore, the effect of political connections is lower in countries that have credit information sharing mechanisms. These results suggest that a competitive banking sector improves efficiency of credit allocation by reducing politically motivated lending.","Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Lashitew, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",A.A.Lashitew@rug.nl,"Lashitew, Addisu/K-7625-2019","Lashitew, Addisu/0000-0001-6405-5682",,,,,29,15,15,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2014,67,2,,,,,227,254,,10.1111/kykl.12051,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI9TG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337279300005,0

By classifying the problems that were formerly conglomerated under the name of the soft budget constraint, we show that a hard budget constraint exists for each specific problem. This leads to the realization that each of these problems originally belonged in a different analytic framework, and does not need to be related to the soft budget constraint. Finally, we illustrate how the former conclusions drawn from the soft perspective can be adjusted to form better interpretations under the original frameworks.

This article deals with the dynamic return and volatility spillovers across international energy and cereal commodity markets. It also examines the impacts of three types of OPEC news announcements on the volatility spillovers and persistence in these markets. For this purpose, we make use of the VAR-BEKK-GARCH and VAR-DCC-GARCH models for the daily spot prices of eight major commodities including WTI oil, Europe Brent oil, gasoline, heating oil, barley, corn, sorghum, and wheat. Our results provide evidence of significant linkages between these energy and cereal markets. Moreover, the OPEC news announcements are found to exert influence on the oil markets as well as on the oil-cereal relationships. Finally, we show that the persistence of volatility decreases (increases) for the crude oil and heating oil (gasoline) returns after accounting for the OPEC announcements in these multivariate GARCH models. However, the results are more mixed for the cereal markets. Overall, our results can be used to improve the risk-adjusted performance by having more diversified portfolios and also serve to hedge the oil risk more effectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Much of the global natural gas trade occurs through natural gas pipelines, which as an infrastructure is strictly specific to the transportation of natural gas. Therefore, the very structure of natural gas pipeline networks can dictate the strategic relationship among countries involved in its trade. This paper applies a Network Game Model where these pipeline networks are modeled as graphs and respective value functions, and employs the Link-based Flexible Network Allocation Rule developed by Jackson (2005) as a solution concept to measure the relative power structure among these natural gas trading countries. The paper analyzes the case of trade between Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Western Europe, and compares the results to existing analyses that employ a Cooperative Game Model in Characteristic Function Form and the Shapley Value as the solution concept. Whereas the results of the analysis conducted in the previous literature indicate that Russia's relative power was significantly stronger than other players both before and after the construction of the Nord Stream pipeline, the results provided in this paper draw a different conclusion. Ukraine's relative power was already equal to that of Russia before the Nord Stream. This may be understood as one of the underlying causes for the prolonged conflicts that occurred repeatedly in this region concerning natural gas trade. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based upon the PROWESS Database of CMIE, the efficiencies were estimated for the old and new companies and also for Indian, multinational and group companies. The estimations were made for a sample of 72 software companies, under VRS assumption, as dataset manifested large magnitude of differences owing to the presence of big and small companies in the sample. The sales revenue is taken as output variable, and employment, expenditure on computers and electronics equipments, operating expenditure, power, fuel, and water charges as the input variables. The results and analyses demonstrate that the mean overall technical efficiency of the software industry in India during 1999-2008 was low suggesting that software firms, on an average, were wasting 35% of their inputs. It was found that the number of companies operating on most productive scale size has declined during the period under reference. The results also suggest that Indian-owned companies were more efficient than the foreign-owned and group-owned companies. Contrary to the expectations, exports were not found to have exercised significant impact on the efficiency of Indian software industry. (C) 2014 Society for Policy Modeling.

We use a comprehensive set of structural indicators in order to calibrate the model to important macroeconomic ratios and levels of productivity and employment. Our results show that structural reforms yield significant economic gains in the medium and long run. The results point to the importance of product market reforms and labour market related education and tax reforms as the most promising areas of structural policy interventions.

We apply an enhanced decomposition method (Neuman and Oaxaca, 2004) to selectivity-corrected wage equations to estimate potential discrimination effects. The decomposition separates observed wage differentials into a part explained by differences in characteristics that affect productivity and the decision to work and an unexplained part potentially attributed to discrimination. In addition to the functional limitation variables used to control for the effects of disability on productivity, we add measures of physical job demands, and interaction effects between functional limitations and job demands, to the wage models to examine how estimates of potential discrimination change. The interaction terms measure the extent to which workers' physical limitations affect important job functions. Data come from the 2004 SIPP merged to measures of job demands from the Occupational Information Network (O*Net). With job demands and interactions included in the model, approximately 10% of the observed wage differential for men, and 20% for women, is potentially attributed to discrimination.

Bold trade reforms have been followed by rapid rises in international trade levels. However, despite these radical changes, we know remarkably little about how changes in trade patterns are affecting the evolution of regional inequality in the developing world. This paper addresses the link between trade openness and spatial inequality across 22 emerging countries over the period between 1990 and 2006. Our findings show that changes in international trade bring about a significant rise in within-country inequality across the developing world and that this impact is greatest in the poorest countries. This result is robust to the inclusion of a number of control variables, and to changes in the specification of the sample and in the measure used to quantify the level of regional disparities. Consequently, the increase in trade exposure across the emerging world, while possibly benefiting the countries involved in the process in aggregate terms, is generating winning and losing regions.","[Ezcurra, Roberto] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",Universidad Publica de Navarra; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",roberto.ezcurra@unavarra.es; A.Rodriguez-Pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",,,,,49,33,33,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

We utilize novel and robust measures of fiscal decentralization based on different degrees of fiscal autonomy of sub-central governments. Our results highlight the importance of both the nature of fiscal decentralization-expenditure versus revenue-and the extent to which independent spending responsibility and taxing powers are actually assigned to local governments. A higher degree of tax decentralization is associated with higher household income inequality within a country. Thus, even if fiscal decentralization could be attractive according to efficiency reasons, it may actually have undesirable consequences on the income distribution.","[Sacchi, Agnese] Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy; [Salotti, Simone] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",Roma Tre University; Oxford Brookes University,"Salotti, S (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",a.sacchi@unimercatorum.it; ssalotti@brookes.ac.uk,"Salotti, Simone/N-7916-2019","Salotti, Simone/0000-0003-1898-6683; Sacchi, Agnese/0000-0002-7754-8360",,,,,73,45,51,2,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

There is a strong substitution of permanent by temporary workers (i.e., a 10% decline in permanent employment). The effects on labor productivity and the value of firms are very small.

It also sheds light on the role of board independence in such a relation. Theory suggests that investors are more likely to discount the value of excess cash held by firms with low corporate governance. Using the valuation regression of Fama and French (1998), empirical results show that the value of excess cash holdings decreases dramatically with the separation of control and cash-flow rights of the controlling shareholder. This value discount is, however, less pronounced in firms with more independent boards (i.e., boards with more independent directors and separate chief executive officer and chair positions). Our empirical findings support the argument that excess cash contributes less to firm value when minority shareholders are more likely to be expropriated by controlling shareholders. Independent boards seem to be effective in mitigating investors' concerns about the use of excess cash.

As a result many tax havens have signed tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs). In order to comply with OECD standards tax havens are obliged to sign at least 12 TIEAs with other countries. This paper investigates how tax havens have chosen their partner countries. We ask whether they have signed TIEAs with countries to which they have strong economic links or whether they have systematically avoided doing this, so that information exchange remains ineffective. We analyse 565 TIEAs signed by tax havens in the years 2008-2011 and find that on average tax havens have signed more TIEAs with countries to which they have stronger economic links. Our analysis thus suggests that tax havens do not systematically undermine tax information exchange by signing TIEAs with irrelevant countries. However, this does not mean that they exchange information with all important partner countries.","[Bilicka, Katarzyna; Fuest, Clemens] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Bilicka, Katarzyna] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Fuest, Clemens] Zentrum Europa Wirtschaftsforsch GmbH ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Bilicka, K (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Said Business Sch, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",katarzyna.bilicka@sbs.ox.ac.uk; fuest@zew.de,,,ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,19,19,23,1,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

This model generalizes the classical rational choice model, which views choice as a consequence of utility maximization. Instead, our model sees choice as arising from psychologically constrained utility maximization, where the constraints are induced by one's initial endowment. In particular, this model produces status quo bias as a natural consequence (but not necessarily the endowment effect). A range of economic applications identify the predictive and explanatory strength of the model. In particular, we demonstrate that the status quo bias phenomenon reduces the size of the substitution effect in problems of consumption choice.","[Masatlioglu, Yusufcan] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ok, Efe A.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; New York University,"Masatlioglu, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Masatlioglu, Yusufcan/AAB-2440-2020","Masatlioglu, Yusufcan/0000-0002-9423-3272",,,,,52,46,57,2,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The optimal carbon tax should include an additional component on top of the conventional present discounted value of marginal global warming damages. This component increases with the sensitivity of the hazard to temperature or the stock of atmospheric carbon. If the hazard of a catastrophe is constant, no correction is needed of the usual Pigouvian tax. The results are applied to a tipping point resulting from an abrupt and irreversible release of greenhouse gases from the ocean floors and surface of the earth, which set in motion a positive feedback loop. Convex enough hazard functions cause overshooting of the carbon tax, but a linear hazard function gives rise to undershooting. A more convex hazard function and a high discount rate speed up adjustment. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, it fails to interpret correctly the necessary conditions for convergence. Although the neoclassical explanation of economic growth is not necessarily the correct one, it is a fact that some countries have indeed converged to others. When Thirlwall's model accounts for the possibility of convergence, it shows two main puzzling implications since it depends on income elasticities. First, a higher income elasticity to exports/imports ratio in backward countries not only implies convergence but divergence in the long run. Second, the non-price competitiveness is higher in the backward countries since they have a higher ratio. This study aims at developing a model that is able to reconcile the balance-of-payments-constraint hypothesis with convergence. Subsequently, it is applied to countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).","[Garcimartin, Carlos] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Antonio Alonso, Jose] Univ Complutense, Dept Appl Econ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Rivas, Luis] IE Univ, Segovia, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Complutense University of Madrid; IE University,"Garcimartín, C (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain.",,"; Rivas, Luis/O-3312-2015","Alonso, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-7684-9658; Rivas, Luis/0000-0001-6073-4522",,,,,42,2,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Over time, landowners in flooded counties modernized agricultural production and increased its capital intensity relative to landowners in nearby similar non-flooded counties.

At early stages of economic growth, EKC indicates the increase of pollution related to the growing use of resources. However, when a certain level of income per capita is reached, the trend reverses and at a higher stage of development, further economic growth leads to improvement of the environment. According to the researchers, this implies that the environmental impact indicator is an inverted U-shaped function of income per capita. In this paper, the cubic equation is used to empirically check the validity of the EKC relationship for European countries. The analysis is based on the survey of EU-27, Norway and Switzerland in the period of 1995-2010. The data is taken from the Eurostat database. To gain some insights into the environmental trends in each country, the article highlights the specific relationship in the country based on the level of its development. The similarities between individual countries are analysed in order to identify their basic common features.","[Lapinskiene, Giedre; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Vaitkus, Pranas] Vilnius Univ, LT-03225 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius University,"Lapinskiene, G (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",giedre.lapinskiene@dok.vgtu.lt,"/I-3713-2019; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/GVT-4155-2022; Lapinskienė, Giedrė/HNR-0508-2023","/0000-0002-9667-3730; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/0000-0002-9667-3730; Lapinskiene, Giedre/0000-0003-0179-794X; Pranas, Vaitkus/0000-0002-3992-8944",,,,,36,58,58,0,29,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This paper focuses on fiscal consolidation, a central aspect of such programmes, using the case of Ireland. It investigates the significant role of the mass media in presenting such policies to the public, a role which has so far remained unexamined. Conceiving of the Irish experience over the past few decades as a case of neoliberalisation, it uses a critical political economic conceptualisation of news organisations to consider 431 editorials and opinion articles discussing fiscal consolidation in three leading Irish newspapers between 2008 and 2012. It finds that the majority of articles present viewpoints in favour of fiscal consolidation and display a preference for spending cuts over tax hikes, which substantiates the claim that Ireland has adopted neoliberal policies to address the crisis. Only a minority of articles oppose fiscal consolidation. These mostly contest specific spending cuts but usually fail to criticise fiscal consolidation itself by calling for economic alternatives, such as Keynesian stimulus. Differences between newspapers are also discussed, highlighting their ideological cleavages.","[Mercille, Julien] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Mercille, J (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland.",jmercille@gmail.com,,,,,,,80,52,54,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Unlike previous studies in the field, we employ the PANIC procedures of Bai and Ng (2004a, b), which explicitly allow for strong forms of cross-sectional dependence and enable us to determine the source of the non-stationarity in the observed series of stock prices, i.e. whether it stems from the stochastic behavior of the common factor and/or the idiosyncratic components. Overall, there is strong evidence of non-stationarity in stock prices, which appears to be driven by a common stochastic trend. The computation of half-lives of shocks to the idiosyncratic components through impulse-response functions corroborates the findings obtained with PANIC. First, mean-reverting country-specific components suggest the existence of cross-sectional predictability of stock prices. Second, there is no evidence of time-series predictability of stock prices, since the global shock appears non-stationary in levels and exhibits an infinite half-life.","[Oto-Peralias, Daniel; Romero-Avila, Diego; Usabiaga, Carlos] Univ Pablo Olavide, Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Oto-Peralías, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo Olavide, Seville, Spain.",,"Usabiaga, Carlos/AAI-8911-2020; Romero-Ávila, Diego/K-4359-2017","Usabiaga, Carlos/0000-0002-1519-9070; Oto-Peralias, Daniel/0000-0001-8773-6835",,,,,68,0,0,0,7,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

The model by Aghion et al. (2005) is extended by allowing for governmental fiscal policy over the business cycle. The analysis shows that in an economy facing credit constraints, an increase in volatility will result in lower mean growth, and all the more the less financially developed and the more procyclical the fiscal policy is. The main implication is that in countries with lower degrees of financial development, countercyclical fiscal policies are particularly important in reducing the negative consequences of adverse aggregate shocks on firms' long-run investments. An empirical analysis is finally conducted using different groups of countries that confirm the theoretical predictions.","Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, Washington, DC USA",Inter-American Development Bank,"Rodriguez, CM (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, Washington, DC USA.",cesarr@iadb.org,,,,,,,39,2,2,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We explain this by the relatively high elite presence among migrants, dualism of Indian migration (between long-term and circular ones), but mainly by the differences in the levels of education. In India, migration has taken an overall color of increasing the nation-wide inequalities (mainly by heightening the rural-urban gap and urban disparities).","[Vakulabharanam, Vamsi; Thakurata, Saswata Guha] Univ Hyderabad, Sch Econ, Hyderabad 500046, Andhra Pradesh, India",University of Hyderabad,"Vakulabharanam, V (通讯作者)，Univ Hyderabad, Sch Econ, Hyderabad 500046, Andhra Pradesh, India.",vamsi.vakul@gmail.com,,"Guha Thakurata, Saswata/0000-0003-0967-6851",,,,,22,7,7,0,15,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The question is analyzed in the context of a housing reform that occurred in China that gave existing tenants the opportunity to purchase the homes that they had been renting from their state employers. The rights to each housing unit were granted to a particular employee, so property rights were defined at the individual level rather than the household level. The results indicate that transferring ownership rights to men increased household consumption of some male-favored goods and women's time spent on chores. Transferring ownership rights to women decreased household consumption of some male-favored goods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that the structural break nonlinearity and size nonlinearity are vital to the current account-GDP ratios of European countries in testing for the null hypothesis of a unit root. Nevertheless, the current account-GDP ratios of these countries do not exhibit the sign nonlinearity. That is, by taking account of the nonlinear trend, the threshold autoregressive and momentum threshold autoregressive models do not detect any asymmetry in the response of the current account imbalance to deviations from its long-run nonlinear trend.

We study how different entry modes affect the lending rates of foreign and domestic banks. In our model, the mode of entry determines whether a foreign bank inherits a customer base. This, in turn, affects how information is distributed between foreign and domestic banks. We show that this distribution of information about incumbent customers leads to stronger competition if foreign entry occurs through a greenfield investment. As a result, domestic bank lending rates are lower after greenfield entry.

This paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, it adopts an instrumental-variables method pioneered by Betsey Stevenson (2010) in which variation in rates of boys' athletic participation across states before the passage of Title IX is used to instrument for changes in girls' athletic participation following its passage, thereby avoiding selection bias and allowing for causal estimates. Second, it looks at the effect of participating in sports not on economic, but on social outcomes. In particular, we find that a ten percentage-point increase in state-level female sports participation generates a five to six percentage-point rise in the rate of female secularism, a five percentage-point increase in the proportion of women who are mothers, and a six percentage-point rise in the proportion of mothers who, at the time that they are interviewed, are single mothers. While our results appear to paint a picture of independence from potentially patriarchal institutions (church and marriage), further research is necessary to understand whether our results can be attributed to a single story such as this one or whether they are the products of multiple causal mechanisms.

We explore the implications of costly revisits on market equilibrium in two celebrated search models. In the Wolinsky model, some consumers search beyond the first firm. In this class of models, costly revisits do make a substantive difference and their impact can be of the same order of magnitude as the initial search cost. In the Stahl oligopoly search model where consumers do not search beyond the first firm, there remains a unique symmetric equilibrium that has firms use pricing strategies that are identical to the perfect recall case.","[Janssen, Maarten C.

This paper characterises ambiguity in the form of newly defined Choquet random walks: discrete-time binomial trees with capacities instead of exact probabilities on their branches. We describe the axiomatic basis of Choquet random walks, including dynamic consistency. We also discuss the convergence of Choquet random walks to Choquet-Brownian motion in continuous time. In contrast to previous literature, we derive tractable stochastic processes that allow for a wide range of ambiguity preferences to be represented in continuous time (including ambiguity-seeking preferences). Finally, we apply Choquet-Brownian ambiguity to a model of stationary inter-temporal portfolio choice. We find that both the mean and the variance of the underlying stochastic process are modified.

By lifting the vector variables to positive semidefinite matrix variables, we obtain semidefinite programming formulations of the robust tracking portfolio models. Numerical results are presented in tracking SSE50 of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

There are two bribe payment technologies and a Corruptor and a Receiver must agree on the value and on the technology of the bribe. The paper infers which form of payment can be used by analyzing probabilities of punishment, bargaining powers of agents, and relative efficiency of the two different technologies. By assumption, monetary payments have distinct efficiency than do non-monetary favors. If the Receiver has a sufficiently high utility for payments using a particular technology, then only bribes paid via this technology are feasible. There is also a range of intermediate cases where monetary bribery is used if and only if the relative bargaining power of the Receiver is sufficiently large compared to that of the Corruptor.

Moreover, the private optimum is insufficient from the viewpoint of social welfare and the intensity of network externalities is important in determining the extent of inefficiency.

Our evidence shows that a CEO is significantly more likely to be lucky when other CEOs in the surrounding area are not lucky. It appears that a CEO tends to practice opportunistic timing of option grants when such a practice is less prevalent and thus less noticeable in the nearby area, probably in order to avoid detection. We estimate that the marginal geographic effect on a given CEO's luck is 18.36%, which is both statistically and economically significant.

An underlying state determines payoffs from different actions. Agents decide which other agents to form a costly communication link with, incurring the associated cost. After receiving a private signal correlated with the underlying state, the agents exchange information over the induced communication network until they take an (irreversible) action. We define asymptotic learning as the fraction of agents who take the correct action, converging to 1 as a society grows large. Under truthful communication, we show that asymptotic learning occurs if (and under some additional conditions, also only if) in the induced communication network most agents are a short distance away from information hubs, which receive and distribute a large amount of information. Asymptotic learning therefore requires information to be aggregated in the hands of a few agents. We also show that while truthful communication may not always be a best response, it is an equilibrium when the communication network induces asymptotic learning. Moreover, we contrast equilibrium behavior with a socially optimal strategy profile, that is, a profile that maximizes aggregate welfare. We show that when the network induces asymptotic learning, equilibrium behavior leads to maximum aggregate welfare, but this may not be the case when asymptotic learning does not occur. We then provide a systematic investigation of what types of cost structures and associated social cliques (consisting of groups of individuals linked to each other at zero cost, such as friendship networks) ensure the emergence of communication networks that lead to asymptotic learning. Our result shows that societies with too many and sufficiently large social cliques do not induce asymptotic learning, because each social clique has sufficient information by itself, making communication with others relatively unattractive. Asymptotic learning results either if social cliques are not too large, in which case communication across cliques is encouraged, or if there exist very large cliques that act as information hubs.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bimpikis, Kostas] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ozdaglar, Asuman] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",daron@mit.edu; kostasb@stanford.edu; asuman@mit.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023",,,,,,45,50,65,3,47,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

When a firm has full bargaining power, the non-contractibility of this investment completely undermines the employee's incentives. However, the incumbent firm's inability to observe competing wage offers at the interim stage prevents it from completely expropriating the surplus, thereby creating incentives for the employee to invest. We demonstrate that commitment to a wage floor for the second period destroys the worker's incentives to acquire human capital, but makes turnover efficient. Therefore, such a commitment has value only if the return on the employee's deliberate investment in human capital acquisition is sufficiently low. When firms are privately informed about the productivity of their human capital acquisition technology, more productive firms offer higher entry wages to separate themselves from less productive firms. Furthermore, in contrast to the case of symmetric information about human capital acquisition technology, the commitment opportunity now has value for firms with higher return on investment: commitment to a wage floor acts as a substitute for raising the entry wage.","[Suvorov, Anton] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Fac Econ, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Akhmedov, Akhmed] Sberbank, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Sberbank,"Suvorov, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Fac Econ, Shabolovka 26, Moscow 119049, Russia.",a-akhmedov@yandex.ru; asuvorov@hse.ru,"Suvorov, Anton/I-4731-2015","Suvorov, Anton/0000-0003-1362-7470",,,,,31,0,0,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

In order to achieve this goal, we have utilized monthly data for the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices between January 1997 and June 2013 for the first twelve EA countries and for the EA aggregate. In the first stage, parametric and semiparametric estimations allow us to find that the inflation-RPV relationship shows a U-shaped functional profile for the majority of the countries. In the second stage, within this benchmark and using both kinds of estimations, we obtain the optimal inflation rate defined as the one that minimizes the RPV. Moreover, we test the sensitivity of our results to the time period and, for semiparametric estimation, to the bandwidth selected.

Since prehistoric times, conventional storage techniques were being used more or less all over the world. Not much attention was paid on this issue like other agricultural problems. Previous studies have shown that considerable amount of food grains spoils after harvest due to insufficient storage and processing facilities. The purpose of the study was to assess food grain crops storage techniques used by progressive farmers in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. A survey questionnaire was used as an instrument for assessing the desired research problem. Factors like demographic profiles of the respondents, training and information sources, insect pest management during grain storage period and their knowledge level were used to assess the research idea. A systematic sample of 100 progressive farmers was taken for analysis purposes. The results showed that 76% of the respondents did not have any kinds of extension advisory services at all for the latest storage techniques. The results revealed that independent variables like age, experience, training/information and insect/pest management have excellent contribution in enhancing the knowledge level of the respondents in specific areas of food grain crops storage techniques implemented by the progressive farmers. The in-service training for extension field staff must be arranged to transfer advanced knowledge for food grain crops storage to the local farmers. Government should formulate transparent agricultural policy regarding food grain crops storage in the country.","[Ashraf, Ejaz; Shurjeel, Hafiz Khurram; Aqueel, Muhammad Anjum; Majeed, Muhammad Zeeshan; Afzal, Muhammad Younis] Univ Sargodha, Univ Coll Agr, Sargodha, Pakistan",University of Sargodha; Bahauddin Zakariya University,"Ashraf, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sargodha, Univ Coll Agr, Sargodha, Pakistan.",ejazashraf60@hotmail.com; shurjeel_38@yahoo.com; Anjum_ento@uos.edu.pk; zeeshan.majeed@uos.edu.pk; younas_rana2002@yahoo.com,"AFZAL, MUHAMMAD/HNB-7152-2023; Majeed, Muhammad Zeeshan/A-9791-2019","AFZAL, MUHAMMAD/0000-0001-9530-1356; Majeed, Muhammad Zeeshan/0000-0002-3786-8589",,,,,8,0,0,0,2,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-206-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,9,16,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0OB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366474600002,0

For instance, world poverty estimates by the World Bank often distinguish between the extreme poor whose incomes are lower than $1.25 a day (in PPP terms) and the other poor with incomes between $1.25 and $2.5 a day. Existing dominance conditions can tell whether overall poverty and extreme poverty have declined in a robust manner when comparing countries at two points of time, but they cannot say anything for the contribution of the non-extreme poor to overall poverty. In the present paper we propose stochastic generalized dominance criteria to perform robust poverty ordering when the focus is placed on some interval of the poverty domain. Using generated data based on grouped data from World Bank's PovcalNet tool, the paper finally investigates whether the robust decline of extreme poverty around the world during the last decades was also accompanied by a decline of the contribution of non-extreme poverty.","Univ Auvergne, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Bresson, F (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France.",,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78350-556-2; 978-1-78350-567-8,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2014,22,,,,,,147,184,,10.1108/S1049-258520140000022004,0.0,,,38,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360561500005,0

Control sessions were also conducted in which no status distinction was introduced. In all sessions, participants subsequently played two games governed by distinct social norms: a trust game and a cheap talk game where lying was possible. In the control sessions, norm compliance was higher in same-group interactions, consistent with previous research demonstrating that normative obligations are often parochial. In treatment sessions, parochialism vanished and was replaced by noblesse oblige: members of high status groups exhibited more norm compliance in all of their interactions. Finally, in game roles not governed by an unambiguous social norm, identity had no direct impact on behavior. Considered together, the results suggest that the channel through which social identity directly impacts behavior is norm compliance and that the nature of this impact depends crucially on the relationship between involved groups.","Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, I-00187 Rome, Italy",,"Butler, JV (通讯作者)，Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, Via Sallustiana 62, I-00187 Rome, Italy.",jeff.butler@eief.it,"Butler, Jeffrey/AAF-7098-2020",,,,,,49,8,11,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Additionally, we introduce a novel modification to primary factor demands, generating more realistic labor markets in which lower-skilled jobs substitute more easily with other primary factors than higher-skilled jobs. The advantages of our approach are that we can rely on the most recent and the most disaggregate U.S. labor data available; we build upon the most recently available GTAP database; and, when applied to other economies, our approach is the initial contribution to a database of detailed labor statistics for several economies.

Moreover, this study examines the impact of intellectual capital on changes in productivity. In the first stage, this study applies the Malmquist productivity index (MPI) of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the MPI with bootstrapping approach to evaluate changes in productivity. In the second stage, this study examines the impact of intellectual capital on changes in productivity through OLS and Tobit regressions. Our MPI findings indicate that all but one sample firms experienced growth in productivity over the sample period. Moreover, the use of the MPI with bootstrapping approach provides an effective analysis of MPI estimates. Our regression analysis reveals that VAIC (TM) and its individual components have significantly positive impacts on changes in productivity. We suggest that general insurers in Malaysia should invest in intellectual capital, including to improve their managerial skills, to gain sustainable growth in productivity. Our findings corroborate the initiative carried out by the Malaysian government, which continuously emphasize the importance of IC. The findings of this study may lead to a better understanding of the relative changes in total productivity of general insurance firms. By identifying changes in efficiency and changes in technology, better management decisions can be made to achieve greater productivity. Moreover, through the bootstrap estimation, we are able to determine whether estimated increases or decreases are statistically significant. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Second, controlling the actual fiscal velocity so as not to exceed the natural one is such a macro calibration that the authorities can easily justify their pre-emptive actions as a means of avoiding a deep recession trap under globalization.","Hansung Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul 136792, South Korea",Hansung University,"Choi, YY (通讯作者)，Hansung Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul 136792, South Korea.",yychoi8@unitel.co.kr,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article assesses the relative efficiency of R&D expenditures for 26 OECD member countries and two nonmember countries. As countries differ in their national innovation systems and states of economic development and industrialization, e. g. transition economies in Eastern Europe versus Asian countries versus Anglo-Saxon countries, the measurement of R&D efficiency needs to consider differences in the technology of knowledge production.

In the absence of wealth effects and external habits, these preferences fail to generate observed inflation inertia and output persistence after a monetary policy shock. Furthermore, the data strongly rejects these preferences in favor of preferences with external habits. An alternative solution is to include habit adjusted intermediate wealth effect preferences which are able to simultaneously generate sluggish responses of the variables to a monetary policy shock and fit the data better.

Better data at the individual level, for both men and women, will facilitate much better analyses by both macroeconomists and microeconomists. While some data, especially on education and employment, are now routinely collected on individuals, other data, including on asset access and ownership, are still typically collected only at the household level. The paper argues that it is both feasible and important to collect individual-level asset data, rather than simply collecting data at the household level. At the macro level, these data are needed to understand changing patterns within the economy; at the micro-level, the data are needed to understand the economic relationships among individuals, households and communities and can help in the design of policies to promote poverty reduction, growth and development. Drawing on the data collected under the Gender Asset Gap Project, differences are demonstrated between women and men in the ownership and control of assets and in the access to specific types of capital. Periodic data on gender asset and wealth gaps tracked over time would provide insights into policies designed to reduce poverty and promote economic growth.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Doss, C (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",cheryl.doss@yale.edu,,"Doss, Cheryl/0000-0001-8292-3295",,,,,45,10,10,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Agents' wealth heterogeneity varies endogenously through time. Preferences exhibit linear risk tolerance with respect to consumption, consumption and labor are separable and the momentary utility function for leisure is isoelastic. Production possibilities are represented by J neoclassical technologies which are subject to shocks. I show that any competitive equilibrium allocation that is Pareto optimal can be supported by means of constant portfolios with only a few assets: a mutual fund of stocks, a consol and two other securities perfectly linearly correlated with aggregate labor income and the wage rate. Remarkably, this result holds in spite of the changing degree of agents' heterogeneity and wealth-varying relative risk aversion, both stemming from movements in the stock of capital.","Univ Torcuato Di Tella, RA-1010 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Universidad Torcuato Di Tella,"Espino, E (通讯作者)，Univ Torcuato Di Tella, C1428BIJ, RA-1010 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",eespino@utdt.edu,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Using the restrictions imposed by theory, we find that the model is able to explain developments in market shares reasonably well, despite the large and at times sudden changes in market shares over the sample period. Our share estimates indicate that while Spain and Portugal managed to keep a stable market share over time, Malta and especially Italy lost market share to Cyprus, Greece and Turkey. Overall, we observe that Italy and Spain have the lowest own-price elasticities, whereas Greece, Portugal, Spain and Turkey are expenditure inelastic holiday destinations. We also improve over the traditional treatment of the AIDS model in the literature by studying the stability of the estimated elasticities over time using recursive estimates. The results indicate that some elasticities are indeed time varying and highlight the potential pitfalls of assuming fixed and stable elasticities over a long period, as is customary in the tourism literature.","[Gatt, William] Cent Bank Malta, Modelling & Res Dept, VLT-1060 Valletta, Malta; [Falzon, Joseph] Univ Malta, Dept Banking & Finance, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta",University of Malta,"Gatt, W (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Malta, Modelling & Res Dept, VLT-1060 Valletta, Malta.",gattw@centralbankmalta.org,"Gatt, William/HLW-5384-2023",,,,,,19,11,11,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In contrast to the economic literature that cultivates highly stylized model representations aimed at illustrating the workings and the implications of such a feature, the model of this paper integrates two mutually reinforcing financial accelerator mechanisms within the framework of a fully-fledged core macroeconomic model. The impulse responses of such a model is in line with the ones typical of SVAR/DSGE models, though the amplitude of shocks is in most cases stronger than the ones pertaining to these kinds of models. This is due to the workings of the financial accelerators that contribute to magnify the effects of shocks to the economy. A forecast comparison undertaken between our model and an alternative macro econometric model without a financial block, suggests that financial feedback mechanisms may be forecast improving.

A regression analysis reveals that household debt growth has been significantly related to house price increases, banks' lax attitudes toward household lending, and financial institutions' favorable funding conditions. Also 70-80% of the total debt increase has been accounted for by high income or newly indebted households. The debt dynamics equation analysis shows that the rapid rise in the ratio of household debt to disposable income is attributable not only to the increase in household asset purchases but also to the dampened growth in disposable income and the reduced savings rate. The sustainability analyses indicate that Korean households' debt sustainability is unlikely to deteriorate sharply within a short period of time unless two extreme scenarios, under which house prices decline by 5% a year over the next five years, or a significantly large macroeconomic shock similar to the 1997 crisis hits the economy, would be realized.

A growing class of place-based policies attempts to address these differences through public investments and subsidies that target disadvantaged neighborhoods, cities, or regions. Place-based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities. These programs are widespread in the United States and throughout the world but have only recently been studied closely by economists. We consider the following questions: Who benefits from place-based interventions? Do the national benefits outweigh the costs? What sorts of interventions are most likely to be effective? To study these questions, we develop a simple spatial equilibrium model designed to characterize the welfare effects of place-based policies on the local and the national economy. Using this model, we critically evaluate the economic rationales for place-based policies and assess the latest evidence on their effects. We conclude with some lessons for policy and directions for future research.","[Kline, Patrick] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kline, Patrick; Moretti, Enrico] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kline, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",moretti@econ.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,129,188,239,4,107,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

At the same time the Finnish economy grew rapidly. Nevertheless, there was another coincidental trend in this period: a rapid rise in inequality. This study aims to answer to what extent labour income tax reductions between 1996 and 2008 contributed to this trend in inequality. The study also examines how much more employment was achieved owing to the labour tax reforms. To answer these questions, I build a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents. The model is calibrated to fit the Finnish economy. The study finds that the labour income tax cuts fractionally raised the Gini coefficient for net labour income. They also increased the concentration of wealth. The employment gains due to the reforms have been modest, but nevertheless significant. (C) 2013 Society for Policy Modeling.

In our model, the presence of a resale market permits tickets to be traded from low-value to high-value consumers, but it also stimulates costly efforts by consumers and brokers to obtain underpriced tickets in the primary market. We estimate that observed levels of resale increase allocative efficiency by 5% on average, but that a third of this increase is offset by increases in costly rent-seeking in the primary market and transaction costs in the resale market.","[Leslie, Phillip] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Leslie, Phillip] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Sorensen, Alan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Leslie, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,40,30,42,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In this paper we analyse the relative contribution of R&D to the efficiency (productivity) on the industry and sector level in OECD countries using industry-level panel data and the stochastic frontier production function approach. The results indicate that R&D capital productivity enhancing effect increases with the level of technology; physical capital shows the opposite effect. The distribution of efficiency across industries shows remarkably different variances, reflecting different degrees of competition and the structure of value chains. Among different external factors, the share of labour with tertiary education at the national level showed a strong positive correlation with efficiency, while for other external factors the effect varied across the industries. The findings imply that in the design of R&D policy measures the structure of the industries needs to be considered.","[Liik, Margo; Masso, Jaan; Ukrainski, Kadri] Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Masso, J (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ulikooli 18, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia.",Jaan.Masso@ut.ee,"Ukrainski, Kadri/ABA-5968-2020","Masso, Jaan/0000-0002-0466-4942","European Social Foundation through the Research and Innovation Policy Monitoring Programme; Estonian Science Foundation [8580, 8311]; Estonian Research Agency [IUT20-49]",European Social Foundation through the Research and Innovation Policy Monitoring Programme; Estonian Science Foundation; Estonian Research Agency,"This research has been supported by the European Social Foundation through the Research and Innovation Policy Monitoring Programme; the Estonian Science Foundation Grants [no. 8580 and 8311]; the Estonian Research Agency [project no, IUT20-49 'Structural Change as the Factor of Productivity Growth in the Case of Catching up Economics'].",,87,12,13,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

However, the Granger-causality test divulge that the direction of causality scamper from US equity market to the three South Asian markets. It further indicates that within the three developing equity markets the direction of causality emanates from Bombay stock market to Karachi and Colombo.

The hypothesis is based on the characteristics of domestic tax systems of Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland and Romania in which indirect tax revenues account for the majority of total budget tax revenues. Results suggest that the co-movements of the current account and the fiscal balance cannot be explained by the twin deficit theory in countries with indirect tax-oriented systems.

Based on economic literature and on such empiric analysis, the article will propose some directions for the Romanian macroeconomic policy in the short-term in the context of crisis, because the FDIs are the engine for recovery and economic growth. In Romania, empiric results have shown that monetary factors such as higher interest rates and higher inflation attracted FDIs. Fiscal factors (mainly direct taxes) seem to play a less important role, being relevant only in the long-term. So, Romania should also focus on improving the other non-financial factors that greatly influence the investment environment here (infrastructure, legal and political stability). Only then can the fiscal stimulus be effective in attracting FDIs and supporting the economic growth in the same time. The article begins with presenting some findings from the economic literature regarding taxation and FDIs, it then follows the empiric analysis for Romania and ends with conclusions and some issues for a further research.","[Radulescu, Magdalena] Univ Pitesti, Dept Finance, Fac Econ Studies, Pitesti, Romania; [Druica, Elena] Univ Bucharest, Fac Business & Adm, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti; University of Bucharest,"Radulescu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pitesti, Dept Finance, Fac Econ Studies, Pitesti, Romania.",magdalena.radulescu@upit.ro,"Radulescu, Magdalena/AEW-0205-2022; Druica, Elena/M-8323-2019","Druica, Elena/0000-0003-1063-7913; radulescu, magdalena/0000-0002-4050-8170",,,,,43,16,22,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The study employs the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator on a set of macro panel data on selected OECD countries from 1973 to 2012. The findings demonstrate a favourable impact of income, unemployment and carbon emission on happiness, while inflation and income inequality are found to hinder happiness.

Knowledge and research concerning the condition, development or transformation of sustainability has become not only the original means of the generation of socio-economic science knowledge. It is also an alternative for the analysis of especially sophisticated development problems - e.g. the problems of survival, effective change and avoidance of huge losses pertaining to such complexes as cities, countries or regions. Finding the ways of such knowledge conversion into the field of science is complex, but there is no alternative. Research of sustainable development has already become especially prevalent, and, thus, the objects of cognition should be structured, possibilities should be consolidated, and the efficiency of the use of resources must be elevated. The first challenge of sustainability research conversion into the sustainability science is a thorough mastering of the systemic research technologies, as well as the development of the principal methodology of systemic research while evolving the possibilities of civilisation survival on Earth. The objective of the research is to find an adequate quantitative measure of complex system development sustainability and investigate in detail the type of development of a small country or region that could be named as a realisation of sustainable development possibilities. The methodology of the research includes the application of an adequate portfolio model, stochastic optimisation, and systemic analysis. The conclusions obtained by the research state that development possibilities of a small country should not be evaluated only in terms of economic-ecological aspects; more components, such as politics, integration, marketing, social-demographics, creativity, religion, innovation, finance, and investment should be included, which could be logically divided into four subsystems of country universal sustainability. The research also presents the adequate composition of efficiency and reliability of the general effect pertaining to the activity of all the subsystems, as well as the optimal allocation of marginal investment unit among the four subsystems.","[Rutkauskas, Aleksandras Vytautas; Stasytyte, Viktorija; Michnevic, Edvard] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Rutkauskas, AV (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",ar@vgtu.lt; viktorija.stasytyte@vgtu.lt; edvard.michnevic@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,25,5,6,0,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The estimated contemporaneous coefficients on the energy intensity and affluence variables are positive, statistically significant and fairly similar across different estimation techniques. By comparison, the estimated contemporaneous coefficient on the urbanization variable is sensitive to the estimation technique.

The models display the intricate relationships between security levels, subjective probabilities of the occurrence of war, and potential war damages. We show that poor countries tend to perceive greater probabilities of war than their richer rivals, and that the psychological burden of insecurity is larger when the country's wealth is larger and when its preference for security is higher. We apply our models to the Israeli-Syrian arms race and show that the higher rate of growth of Israel's gross domestic product relative to that of Syria is expected to lead to an increase in Syria's perception of the likelihood of war and to a decrease in Israel's perception of such a likelihood. We also show that if Syria's regime becomes ideologically more extreme, the monetary cost of maintaining Israel's security at the level that it enjoyed prior to the change will be very high, whereas the monetary cost of maintaining Israel's welfare will be moderate.","[Shabtay, Hadas; Tishler, Asher] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Tishler, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",atishler@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,52,4,5,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The data cover the period from 2008 through 2013 in which gold prices hit an all-time high. ARFIMA-FIGARCH model provides evidence of dual long memory in spot series and a lack of long-memory property in futures returns. Anti-persistence in spot returns is indicative of an overreaction of gold prices to new information, thus disconfirming the weak form of market efficiency. The findings further provide evidence of one structural break, which is associated with correction in the gold prices during the post-global financial crisis. The analyses suggest that the long memory is true, not spurious.

This study aims to propose a specific risk/reward compensation model to highlight the characteristic of IPD. An analysis of the differences between IPD and project alliancing reveals that the compensation strategy can be determined using a cooperative and non-controversial contract in the early stages of a project because of the application of Building Information Modeling and the early stage collocation of the main participants. Therefore, this study proposes the compensation method based on cooperative game theory to determine the risk/reward sharing in the early stages of a project to incentivize the participants and align the goals of all participants. The innovation of our work is to combine risk perception and Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) in the risk/reward compensation model. It is not easy to measuring the risk borne by participants in the early project stages; thus, this study explores the problem from the perspective of risk perception. The perceived level of risk influences the utility of the participants. The research problem is formulated as an n-person bargaining problem; thus, NBS provides the optimal and fair compensation strategy. Moreover, to overcome the limitation of information loss and reflect the bounded rationality of the participants, 2-tuple linguistic representation and prospect theory are used as complementary methodologies to develop the utility function. This study provides an explicit, comprehensive, and systematic framework for risk/reward allocation practice in an IPD project, which has both theoretical and practical significance.","[Zhang, Lianying; Li, Fei] Tianjin Univ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Zhang, LY (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",tjzly126@126.com; lifeihoo@126.com,"li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023",,,,,,40,20,23,1,82,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Even though fees are restricted by legal limits in many countries, traditional models do not take these limits into account, and results could be biased; therefore, censored models (such as Tobit or CLAD) may provide a better fit. In this work, we study the determinants of management fees in Spanish equity pension funds. We find a better fit in the CLAD model, which provides unbiased and consistent estimators.

Using Swedish survey data, people's attitudes are found to be more negative to such trade than to goods trade. The differences depend on both a preference for favouring social groups to which individuals belong (the domestic population) and altruistic justice concerns for foreign workers. In small-group experiments, we find a tendency for people to adjust their evaluations of various aspects of trade to their general attitude. This tendency is stronger for those opposed to than those in favour of low-wage trade competition.

However, cost efficiency for primary schools has decreased and for secondary schools has increased marginally over the study period. The study found that social disadvantage in primary schools exerts a strong negative impact on students' achievement scores causing inefficient use of available resources.

In particular, we prove that the Musgravian transformation holds in the Hotelling model. In addition, we show that the Suits-Musgrave theorem must be revised as output in the Hotelling model remains invariant in the presence of different taxes. That is, for a given price instead of a given output, the tax revenue under demand ad valorem tax exceeds that under the corresponding unit tax as long as profit levels for both stores are positive, a very general assumption. The exception is when the two stores are located close to each other and transportation cost is zero. Only in this case, are tax revenues and price under both tax regimes the same. If both stores are symmetrically located, the superiority of the ad valorem tax holds true except when the two stores are located back to back. Finally the farther away the location of a firm from the end point is, the smaller the difference in tax revenues between demand ad valorem and unit tax will be: the effect of the Suits-Musgrave theorem weakens in the presence of location clustering.","[Cheng, Hui Wen] Ming Chuan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Yang, Chin Wei] Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Clarion, PA USA",Ming Chuan University; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Clarion University of Pennsylvania,"Cheng, HW (通讯作者)，Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Int Business, 250,Sec 5,Chung Shan N Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.",hwcheng@mail.mcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Confirming the results found by Hasbrouck and others for the stock market, signed order flow tends to exert a strong effect on prices. More interestingly, however, there is often a strong effect in the opposite direction, particularly at times of volatile trading. Price declines elicit sales and price increases elicit purchases. An examination of tick-by-tick trading on an especially volatile day confirms this finding. At least in the US Treasury market, trades and price movements appear likely to exhibit positive feedback at short horizons, particularly during periods of market stress. This suggests that the standard analytical approach to the microstructure of financial markets, which focuses on the ways in which the information possessed by informed traders becomes incorporated into market prices through order flow, should be complemented by an account of how price changes affect trading decisions.","[Cohen, Benjamin H.] Bank Int Settlements, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Shin, Hyun Song] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Bank for International Settlements (BIS); Princeton University,"Cohen, BH (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Centralbahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",ben.cohen@bis.org,,,,,,,22,6,6,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Mothers with less trust in others may decide to stay at home with their child instead of working. To do this, we sketch a simple model to show why this effect may be taking place, we measure trust using the European Social Survey and we test its influence on the choice of child care technology. To measure trust, we use the methodology proposed by Spady (Semiparametric methods for the measurement of latent attitudes and the estimation of their behavioural consequences. To measure trust, we use a recent semiparametric item response model. Compared to other measures of trust, using this technique has several advantages: it allows the aggregation of information from several questions and exploits additional information from personal and demographic characteristics. It also imposes very few parametric assumptions. The results show that trust matters for the degree of externalness of the child care technology people choose. It can therefore be a possible explanation for differences in female labor force participation across countries and across sociological groups.","[El-Attar, Mayssun] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [El-Attar, Mayssun] IZA, Bonn, Germany",McGill University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"El-Attar, M (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, 855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",mayssun.el-attarvilalta@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,51,6,6,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

This test suffers from several restrictions: it is applicable only to pairs of variables, a weighting matrix and the assumption of linearity are needed; the null hypothesis of the test is not totally clear. Given these limitations, we develop a new non-parametric test, ?(m), based on symbolic dynamics with better properties. We show that the ?(m) test can be extended to a multivariate framework, it is robust to departures from linearity, it does not need a weighting matrix and can be adapted to different specifications of the null. The test is consistent, computationally simple and with good size and power, as shown by a Monte Carlo experiment.

We next analyze the observed cross-country differences in business cycles with respect to these four identified wedges. Our results indicate that business cycles in the CEE countries do differ from those observed in the euro area, even though substantial convergence has been achieved after the eastern EU enlargement.

Allocating more labor to organizational tasks strengthens the financial relationship with financial intermediaries and helps firms to mitigate a widening in credit spread during financial difficulties. However, doing so reduces the labor allocated to production tasks and hence the measured TFP.

J,"Podhorsky, A",,,,"Podhorsky, Andrea",,,Certification programs and north-south trade,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Credence goods; International trade; Product certification,,"This paper studies how the voluntary standards established by certification programs affect consumer welfare and international trade in an open world economy. I develop a two-country model with differentiated products and imperfectly-informed consumers. Consumers in both countries value the quality of goods, but cannot discern their quality unless they are certified. Firms in each country differ in their abilities to produce quality, and the distribution of technological ability is superior in the home country. I first consider the circumstance in which the home country's government unilaterally administers a certification program. I show that the home country's terms of trade are increasing in the standard. It follows that the standard chosen by the home country is protectionist in the sense that it is greater than the standard that would be chosen by a world welfare maximizing authority. Also, the volume of trade is lower under the home country's program than if the standard were chosen by a world authority. The volume of trade and foreign welfare, however, are greater under the home country's program than if there is no certification program at all. Next, I consider the case where a certification program is administered by each country, and standards are set non-cooperatively. I show that the home and foreign country standards are strategic complements. The paper concludes with a discussion of the global inefficiencies that result from the non-cooperative setting of voluntary standards and their policy implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Consistently with the original Balassa-Samuelson model, more rapidly growing economies experienced steeper increases in their PPPs relative to official exchange rates.

We find that raising the ERA increased employment by 9.75 percentage points among affected men and by 11 percentage points among affected women. The reforms had large spillover effects on the unemployment insurance program but negligible effects on disability insurance claims. Specifically, unemployment increased by 12.5 percentage points among men and by 11.8 percentage points among women. The employment response was largest among high-wage and healthy workers, while low-wage and less healthy workers either continued to retire early via disability benefits or bridged the gap to the ERA via unemployment benefits. Taking spillover effects and additional tax revenues into account, we find that for a typical birth-year cohort a one year increase in the ERA resulted in a reduction of net government expenditures of 107 million euros for men and of 122 million euros for women.

Perverse punishment includes retaliation punishment and non-retaliation punishment, hereafter other perverse punishment. We design two treatments of contributing to a public good: anonymous punishment (AP) and public punisher ID to the punishee (PPID) treatments. Retaliation is possible in PPID, but not in AP. PPID does generate more retaliation punishments. We also find that contributions in PPID are relatively stable across different group sizes, while voluntary contributions mechanism (VCM) and AP are more sensitive to changes in group size. We explain the effectiveness of the punishment scheme by the legitimacy of a punishment. In PPID, the possibility of retaliation makes a subject deliberate more on the legitimacy of a punishment when he/she is contemplating imposing one, which leads to less perverse punishment and a higher level of cooperation in our experiment. This effect is more prominent in larger groups when targeting the punisher becomes harder without knowing the punisher's ID in AP. In particular, while the effect of whether a subject is punished on the increment of contribution is not statistically significant, the number of punishers does increase the amount of contribution significantly.","[Zheng, Xiaoting; Nie, Puyan] Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Zheng, XT (通讯作者)，Huang Pu Dao Xi 601, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zheng_xiaoting@hotmail.com,"NIE, Pu-yan/J-3547-2019","NIE, Pu-yan/0000-0002-6214-5980",,,,,34,5,6,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

To estimate the treatment effect of pegged regimes properly, we must carefully control for the self-selection problem of regime adoption because a country's exchange rate regime choice is nonrandom. To address the self-selection problem, we thus employ a variety of matching methods. We find interesting and robust evidence that (1) pegged regimes significantly decrease the likelihood of currency crises compared with floating regimes, and (2) pegged regimes with capital account liberalization significantly lower the likelihood of currency crises compared with other regimes. From the standpoint of the macroeconomic policy trilemma, we can reasonably conclude that pegged regimes with capital account liberalization are substantially less prone to speculative attacks because they can enhance greater credibility in their currencies by maintaining strict discipline for monetary and macroeconomic policies.

It uses recentered influence function (RIF) regression to link the growth incidence curve to household characteristics and to perform counterfactual decomposition a la Oaxaca-Blinder to identify sources of variation in the distribution of consumption expenditure in Cameroon in 2001-2007. We find that the sectors of employment and geography are the main drivers of the observed pattern of growth through the structural effect. The composition effect accounts for a greater proportion of the observed variation in the social impact of growth. In particular, that effect tends to reduce poverty while the structural effect tends to increase it. This conclusion is robust with respect to the choice of poverty measures and RIF regression models. An important methodological lesson emerging from this study is that linear and non-linear specifications of the RIF regression lead to qualitatively similar results.","[Essama-Nssah, B.] Univ Nottingham, World Bank Grp, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Essama-Nssah, B (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, World Bank Grp, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",essama.nssah@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In the model, individuals allocate their income to various consumption categories proportional to corresponding need deprivation states, a decision making process called matching. The model allows explaining some empirical regularities that other models have difficulties accounting for. It can, for example, reconstruct that income elasticities for food tend to decrease with rising income, and that goods that are luxuries at relatively low income levels can become necessities at higher income levels. Moreover, the paper compares the Engel curves obtained from the matching model with Engel curves obtained from a utility maximization model. While both types of Engel curves are relatively similar at high income levels, at lower income levels matching and maximization lead to very different allocations of income. The paper shows that a given amount of income redistribution leads to less additional welfare when individuals follow matching behavior than when they maximize their utility. Accordingly, to obtain a given amount of additional welfare more income redistribution is needed than a policy maker who (mistakenly) assumes that individuals rationally maximize their utility predicts.","Max Planck Inst Econ, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Lades, LK (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",lades@econ.mpg.de,,"Lades, Leonhard/0000-0002-3114-0781",,,,,47,10,10,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We estimate small open economy Bayesian DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) models with financial factors and analyze the role of these financial factors in the business cycle in the context of Korea. The results indicate that the model based on an endogenous financial accelerator and a modified monetary policy rule provides a better explanation to the data than that without the financial factors and justify the recent attention to financial factors influencing the business cycle.","[Lee, Junhee] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Int Econ & Business, Gyongsan, South Korea; [Rhee, Wooheon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Yeungnam University; Kyung Hee University,"Rhee, W (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",lee1838@ynu.ac.kr; wrhee@khu.ac.kr,"Rhee, Wooheon/AAI-4368-2020; Lee, Junhee/A-2247-2019","Lee, Junhee/0000-0003-3634-051X; Rhee, Wooheon/0000-0001-9259-160X",,,,,14,5,5,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

However, the trade effect may be only an unintended consequence of the pursuit of the domestic concerns towards which the objectives of the STE are targeted as well as the extent of the exclusive rights that it is given. These objectives may reflect concerns about domestic distortions or, where these do not exist, redistribution towards producers or consumers. To this end, identifying the domestic effects of STEs through the use of producer and consumer subsidy equivalents that complement measures of the trade distorting effect is important in gauging the overall impact of STEs. In this paper, we outline a method to measure these policy equivalences which can be readily applied to aid transparency in trade negotiations.","[MacLaren, Donald] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [McCorriston, Steve] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England",University of Melbourne; University of Exeter,"McCorriston, S (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Streatham Campus, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England.",d.maclaren@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,11,0,1,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We focus on identifying the conditions that lead to a societal norm of confinement We also show that, behind a veil of ignorance where gender is unknown, agents will choose to prohibit rather than permit confinement if it is intrinsically valueless and the parameters characterizing the society are such that the ex-post equilibrium would involve pooling.

In addition, we demonstrate that the steady state utility of a resource-good importing country may be reduced by trade, even if it specializes in the production of a non-resource good. Import tariffs and export taxes on a resource good may increase or decrease the shared stock level depending on the production patterns in a trading steady state.

Following a contractionary monetary-policy shock, stock prices fall immediately, while the response in house prices is more gradual. Regarding the systematic response in monetary policy, stock prices play a more important role than house prices.

Using the indefinitely repeated common-pool resource assignment game and a perfect stranger experimental design, this paper reports novel evidence that players who have successfully used an efficiency-enhancing turn taking strategy will teach other players in subsequent supergames to adopt this strategy. We find that subjects engage in turn taking frequently in both the Low Conflict and the High Conflict treatments. Prior experience with turn taking significantly increases turn taking in both treatments. Moreover, successful turn taking often involves fast learning, and individuals with turn taking experience are more likely to be teachers than inexperienced individuals. The comparative statics results show that teaching in such an environment also responds to incentives, since teaching is empirically more frequent in the Low Conflict treatment with higher benefits and lower costs.","[Cason, Timothy N.] Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Lau, Sau-Him Paul] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Mui, Vai-Lam] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Hong Kong; Monash University,"Cason, TN (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, Krannert Sch Management, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",cason@purdue.edu,,"Mui, Vai-Lam/0000-0001-7079-5142",,,,,31,22,23,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The reason is that wages above the market clearing level are only feasible if people work less and, therefore, fewer hours than in a competitive market.

We designed an experiment to test this result. We found that while the level of cooperation steadily declined without a reputation mechanism, with our color-coded reputation mechanism the level of cooperation steadily increased with experience. An econometric mixture model consisting of four reputation-conditioned strategies as well as a Level-0 type was fitted to the data.

In such an economy, the welfare-maximizing monetary policy attains the novel role of redistributing the traders' financial market risk among all agents in the economy. In order to do that, optimal monetary policy reacts to financial market movements; it is expansionary in bad times for the financial markets and contractionary in good ones. In our quantitative exercise, a dividend shock generates different policy responses and consumption paths among the optimal and the 2% inflation targeting policy. The latter implies large distributional welfare losses and risk sharing losses of similar magnitude with those generated by business cycle fluctuations. In addition, the optimal monetary policy does not minimize stock price volatility and implies lower inflation volatility than other commonly used policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The estimation results suggest that the hypothesis of LRSN cannot be rejected, thereby suggesting that monetary policy in South Africa cannot be used to solve the large and persistent unemployment problem in South Africa, which is understandable, since unemployment is inherently structural and is due to skills-shortage.

We study this problem in an ultimatum game with an informed proposer and an uninformed responder, where the former can send an unverifiable statement about his endowment. A simple message game with heterogenous players with respect to lying costs shows that in equilibrium liars should understate their endowment. The second part of the paper reports on an experiment testing this game. On average, 88.5% of the proposers understate the actual endowment by 20.5%. Regression analysis shows that a 1-euro gap between the actual and declared amounts prompts proposers to reduce their offer by 19 cents on average.

Accordingly, this study adopted the fuzzy AHP method to obtain the opinions of professionals on this issue. These efforts resulted in seven evaluation criteria with one, the data validity being given the highest weight, followed by method adaptability and technology development evaluability. It was concluded that the real option approach and income method are the two most applicable technology valuation methods for evaluating new materials development.

We also take into account the issue of penalty enforcement, which in turn depends on both the discretion of the court of law in voiding contractual clauses and the efficiency of the judicial system (i.e. the average length of civil trials). We test our main results on Italian public procurement data showing that the supplier's incentive to delay is greater the higher the volatility of production costs and the lower the efficiency of the judicial system. We then calibrate the model using parameters that mimic the Italian scenario on public works procurement and calculate the maximum amount that a supplier is willing to pay (per day) to postpone the delivery date and infringe the contract provisions.

It is assumed that initially both firms offer a homogeneous product, but after a stochastic waiting time they are able to implement a product innovation. Production capacities of both firms are product specific. It is shown that firms anticipate a future product innovation by under-investing (if the new product is a substitute to the established product) and higher profits, and over-investing (in case of complements) and lower profits, compared to the corresponding standard capital accumulation game. This anticipation effect is stronger in the case of R&D cooperation. Furthermore, since due to R&D cooperation firms introduce the new product at the same time, this leads to intensified competition and lower firm profits right after the new product has been introduced. In addition, we show that under R&D competition the firm that innovates first, overshoots in new-product capacity buildup in order to exploit its temporary monopoly position. Taking into account all these effects, the result is that, if the new product is neither a close substitute nor a strong complement of the established product, positive synergy effects in R&D cooperation are necessary to make it more profitable for firms than R&D competition.

Every migration attempt reduces the amount of savings available for capital accumulation. It contributes, however, to an increase in the per-capita capital stock of the source country if the migrants leave some of their capital behind or decide to return and repatriate accumulated savings. The interaction among these flows governs the evolution of the economy's capital stock and factor rewards, which in turn affects the decisions to emigrate and return migrate.

This paper compares the ability of artificial neural networks and support vector machines in predicting bank failures. Although artificial neural networks have widely been applied complex problems in business, the literature utilizing support vector machines is relatively narrow and their capability for predicting bank failures is not very familiar. In this paper, these two intelligent techniques are applied to a dataset of Turkish commercial banks. Empirical findings show that although the prediction performance of the two models can be considered as satisfactory, neural networks show slightly better predictive ability than support vector machines. In addition, different types of error from each model also indicate that neural network models are better predictors.","Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Int Trade & Finance, Afyon, Turkey",Afyon Kocatepe University,"Ecer, F (通讯作者)，Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Int Trade & Finance, Afyon, Turkey.",fecer@aku.edu.tr,"Ecer, Fatih/AAE-8455-2020","Ecer, Fatih/0000-0002-6174-3241",,,,,46,19,23,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Empirically, a variety of studies considers that FDI generate economic growth but others conclude that FDI is a source of negative effects.

The main conclusion is that the effects of FDI on economic growth depend on the domestic conditions of the host country (e.g., human capital, economic and technological conditions, degree of openness of its economy). Thus, the host countries governments have a key role in creating the conditions that allow for the leverage of the positive effects or for the reduction of the negative effects of FDI on the host country's economic growth.","[Forte, Rosa; Moura, Rui] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Forte, R (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200 Oporto, Portugal.",rforte@fep.up.pt,"Forte, Rosa/AAG-2716-2019","Forte, Rosa/0000-0002-3441-9112; Kurtishi Kastrati, Selma/0000-0002-3844-4323",,,,,80,47,63,3,66,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

However, an increase in spillovers has ambiguous effects on R&D. More precisely, we find that an increase in spillover leads to higher R&D activity under cooperation but lower R&D activity under non-cooperation. Concerning cooperation versus non-cooperation, we find that firms prefer cooperation only if trade costs are low. Consumers are better off under cooperation if spillovers are high. We find that there can be a mismatch between private and social incentives. If spillovers are low and trade costs are low then cooperation might be privately profitable but socially undesirable. On the other hand, if there are large spillovers and high trade costs then cooperation may be socially desirable but not privately profitable.","[Ghosh, Arghya; Lim, Jonathan] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Lim, J (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",jonathanlim@y7mail.com,,"Ghosh, Arghya/0000-0002-6655-5434",,,,,28,6,7,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

While there is evidence that financial incentives and search obligations are effective to increase the job prospects of older workers, recent research also stresses the importance of birth cohort effects. These cohort effects may in turn stem from higher educational attainment levels and better health conditions of future generations of older workers. This paper empirically assesses the relative importance of both explanations, using a registered data set of unemployment insurance spells between 1999 and 2008 for the Netherlands. Using a Linear Probability Model, we decompose the effects of birth cohorts, age, calendar time and two policy measures that were targeted at older unemployed workers-i.e. increased job search obligations in 2004 and shorter potential benefit durations (PBD) in 2006. We find that policy effects predominantly explain the increased job return rates of unemployed of 55 years and older from 1999 to 2008. The introduction of search requirements has increased the one-year re-employment probability of eligible older men with about 5 % point, while the reduction in PBD has caused the one-year re-employment probability of eligible men to increase with 3 % point.","[Koning, Pierre] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105,POB 80510, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Raterink, Max] Minist Social Affairs & Employment, NL-2509 LV The Hague, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Koning, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105,POB 80510, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.w.c.koning@vu.nl; mraterink@minszw.nl,,"Koning, Pierre/0000-0002-8808-9497",,,,,11,5,8,2,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2013,161,3,,,,,331,348,,10.1007/s10645-013-9208-2,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,206DG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323496800006,0

Relative to balanced budget rules, structural surplus rules significantly improve welfare. But they minimize fiscal instrument volatility rather than business cycle volatility. More aggressively countercyclical tax revenue gap rules (strong automatic stabilizers) increase welfare gains by around 50%, with only modest increases in fiscal instrument volatility.

We do find that in coherence with their policy and economic commitment to carbon reductions and environmental market-based instruments implementation, bell shapes are present only for northern EU, which leads the group of advanced countries. The other two lag behind. We show for the first time that CKC shapes are present if we net out Europe of the southern and less developed countries. This is coherent with the Kuznets paradigm. The negative side of the tale is that they characterize a bunch of few countries. Other advanced countries lag behind and are far from reaching a CKC dynamics. Heterogeneous and Bayesian estimators clearly show this, with the EU presenting turning points closely around $13?000 per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Heterogeneous panel estimates also show that for lagging countries presumed bell shapes turn into linear relationships.

To do so, we examine the first wave of light-truck offshoring to Mexico that occurred due to substantially lower post-NAFTA trade barriers and a coincident increase in US demand for light trucks. In contrast to the typical assumption, but similar to many other industries, the need for additional capacity was accommodated by investment in both the US and Mexico for the same models of light trucks. Using a new dataset that details the extent of offshoring and domestic production within models, we document sharp differences in how capacity was utilized. Specifically, within models, we find that automakers offshored varieties which tend to be older in design vintage, lower scale, and less complex to produce. In contrast, we find that varieties inshored to newer capacity in the US exhibit the opposite characteristics. This highlights the important role of vertical differentiation and the associated variation in production complexity for the sorting of production across borders. A product with a large degree of vertical differentiation may provide scope for a firm to maximize profits by inshoring the more complex varieties while offshoring the less complex versions.

Our study draws on a survey of 503 medium-sized Latvian companies. We find that most medium-sized Latvian companies are exporters (either directly or indirectly) and for a typical exporting company, export turnover constitutes more than half of its total turnover. Exporting companies tend to be larger, younger and faster growing than their non-exporting counterparts. They pay higher average wages, consistent with the notion that they have higher labour productivity or utilise more skilled labour on average. For a typical company, export activity has been stable over the past five years, with zero growth in export turnover and an average increase of one additional export destination; however, there is wide dispersion in export growth and success among exporting companies. Successful exporters tend to be larger, with higher productivity growth and greater innovativeness, proactiveness and risk taking, i.e., stronger entrepreneurial orientation. The main obstacle preventing non-exporters from commencing exporting is lack of international competitiveness. This is also the main reason why companies discontinue exporting, and should be the focus of policy aimed at promoting exporting.","[Putnins, Talis J.] Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Putnins, Talis J.] Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Stockholm School of Economics; University of Technology Sydney,"Putnins, TJ (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",talis.putnins@sseriga.edu,,"Putnins, Talis/0000-0001-5731-499X",,,,,6,7,8,0,9,EUROBALTIC CENTRES EXCELLENCE,RIGA,"RAINA BLVD 19, RIGA, LV-1586, LATVIA",1406-099X,,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Our identification strategy exploits variations in the both the spatial and ethnic intensity of fighting. We find that more intense fighting decreases generalized trust and increases ethnic identity. The effects are quantitatively large and robust to a number of control variables, alternative measures of violence, and different statistical techniques involving ethnic and spatial fixed effects and instrumental variables. Controlling for the intensity of violence during the conflict, we also document that post-conflict economic recovery is slower in ethnically fractionalized counties.

Given the trending nature of the time series employed, we further take into account the presence of structural breaks in the form of trend changes. Our empirical results show that multi-horizon causality testing does uncover crucial information with respect to the dynamic interaction among energy consumption, real GDP and capital stock, while structural breaks do exist and appear to be critical for causality inference. In regard to causality direction, we find that real GDP dominates in anticipating energy consumption in G-7 countries. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By modeling government spending and taxes as time-varying transition probability Markovian processes (TVPMS), we find that taxes significantly adjust in a nonlinear fashion to asset prices. In particular, taxes respond to housing and (to a smaller extent) to stock price changes during normal times. However, at periods characterized by high financial volatility, government taxation only counteracts stock market developments (and not the dynamics of the housing sector). As for government spending, it is neutral vis-a-vis the asset market cycles. We conclude that, correcting the fiscal balance and, notably, the revenue side for time-varying effects of asset prices provides a more accurate assessment of the fiscal stance and its sustainability.

One such a measure that resurfaced is the imposition of short-selling constraints. It is conjectured that these short-selling constraints reduce speculative trading and thereby have the potential to stabilize volatile financial markets. The purpose of the current paper is to investigate this conjecture in a standard asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs. We model short-selling constraints by imposing trading costs for selling an asset short. We find that the local stability properties of the fundamental rational expectations equilibrium do not change when trading costs for short-selling are introduced. However, when the asset is overvalued, costs for short-selling increase mispricing and price volatility. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is not so easy for practitioners to identify whether or not the observed time series are stationary. This issue is investigated by extending the numerical analysis to mean-reverting non-stationary region of the parameter space, although the proposed estimator is not theoretically designed to handle this case. The results display good finite sample properties in both cases, stationary and non-stationary. Thereby, it reveals that making a wrong decision on the stationarity of raw series does not lead to an erroneous conclusion.

This allows us to use observed purchase prices and quantities on a large basket of products to learn about individual household's willingness to pay for characteristics, while maintaining a high degree of flexibility and also avoiding the biases that arise from inappropriate aggregation.

Individuals who differ in terms of entrepreneurial ability and wealth choose between entrepreneurship and wage-earning, and the wealth classes form endogenously. Because of the general equilibrium repercussions of policies, whether to tax or subsidize entrepreneurs depends crucially on the shape of the wealth distribution. In particular, a tax on entrepreneurs used to subsidize workers can sometimes increase the average quality of entrepreneurs. Unlike the previous studies, in all of which the risk-free interest rate is exogenous, the policy works by affecting the loan supply to the banks via swapping some low-ability upper-middle-class entrepreneurs with an equal number of high- and low-ability poor-class workers.

On utility in the market and in the unpaid sphere,JOURNAL OF SOCIO-ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Labor economics; Socio-economics; Neoclassical economics,ECONOMICS; UNHAPPINESS; BUSINESS; BURNOUT; GENDER; MODELS; LABOR; JOB,The argument put forward in this paper is that distinguishing between the social and the unpaid sphere has become much more critical as far as societal analysis is concerned than the increasingly blurred distinction between labor and leisure. It proposes a new household model in this respect to provide explanations for phenomena like the high degree of unhappiness experienced by the unemployed and the prevalence of workaholism. The model illustrates that 'working' can be as much a source of utility as 'leisure activities'. The dependency of the budget situation on choices is outlined and the issue of the crowding out of activities in the unpaid sphere is formalized in the model. Policy implications such as decreased pressure on citizens to work and the introduction of a basic income are postulated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

By disaggregating the analysis across genders and three different age groups (20-34, 35-64, and 65+) and analyzing several other labor market indicators besides overall unemployment rates, the essay finds that deteriorations in labor markets is associated with hikes in suicide rates of only men and women between 35 and 64 years of age. In other words, higher group-specific unemployment rates, larger deviations of unemployment rates from their group-specific trends, and larger variance in the overall unemployment rates are all associated with higher suicide rates of adults aged 35-64, or prime working-age adults. These findings suggest that the mental wellbeing of prime working-age adults is more dependent on labor market conditions than people in other age groups. Therefore, during period when prime working-age adults are facing unfavorable labor market conditions, U.S. suicide prevention programs must especially target this group of population.

Voting agents differ in need and income opening up two conflicts: one sets families with disabled parents, who are in favor of a public long-term care program, against the ones without such parents who oppose public financing. The other sets the poor against the rich with the former preferring heavier income taxation than the latter. We show that a structure induced equilibrium always exists and that it is unique if informal care is provided in equilibrium. The equilibrium not only explains the negative association of income inequality and long-term care financing but also allows predictions about how demographic change might impact long-term care arrangements and expenses.

One system is intuitive and automatic (System 1) and the other is reflective and rational (System 2). To determine what insights this model has for stigma - such as fears of food contamination - we elicited the willingness-to-pay for two foods: a sandwich made of dog food and fat-free ice cream. We find critical evidence of a dual process decision making process in which the absence of cognitive load allows the participants to deliberate over the health benefits of either food. In addition, in the case of the sandwich, there is an emotional component in which the positive emotion of surprise can partially offset the negative emotion of disgust. This has notable implications for addressing food safety fears related to contamination as well as the food neophobia related to unfamiliar foods, processing, or preparation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

During marriage search, parents with multiple daughters reduce the reservation quality for an older daughter's groom, rushing her marriage to allow sufficient time to marry off her younger sisters. Relative to younger brothers, younger sisters increase a girl's marriage risk; relative to younger singleton sisters, younger twin sisters have the same effect. These effects intensify in marriage markets with lower sex ratios or greater parental involvement in marriage arrangements. In contrast, older sisters delay a girl's marriage. Because girls leave school when they marry and face limited earning opportunities when they reach adulthood, the number of sisters has well-being consequences over the life cycle. Younger sisters cause earlier school-leaving, lower literacy, a match to a husband with less education and a less skilled occupation, and (marginally) lower adult economic status. Data from a broader set of countries indicate that these cross-sister pressures on marriage age are common throughout the developing world, although the schooling costs vary by setting.

The novel insight is that when there is a risk-sharing motive, fundamentals drive not only individual behavior, but also select which individuals are more relevant for the likelihood of a crisis because of endogenous shifts in wealth. If attacking is relatively safe, attack behavior in the global game and trade in state-contingent assets feed back into each other. This feedback implies that multiple equilibria may exist even if signal noise becomes arbitrarily small. In addition, heterogeneity in risk-aversion within the population amplifies the influence of the state of the economy on the probability of a crisis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The model investigates the relationship between morality and temptation, the individual gains from morality, the interaction between external sanctions and moral self-punishment and the spread and strength of individually optimal moral values.

J,"Che, CM",,,,"Che, Chou Ming",,,Panel threshold analysis of Taiwan's outbound visitors,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Number of people traveling abroad; Consumer price index (CPI); Threshold effect,NUISANCE PARAMETER; HYPOTHESIS; INFERENCE; TOURISM,"The main purpose of this research is to explore the panel threshold effect of consumer prices in destination countries on the number of Taiwanese outbound visitors. It is assumed that a destination country's inflated prices contain one or more threshold values and have nonlinear relation with the number of Taiwanese people visiting that particular country, with asymmetric upper and lower boundaries. Scrutinizing 14 countries during a 14-year period (from 1998 to 2011), this study examines the panel threshold effects based on balanced panel data that comprises 196 observations. The empirical findings suggest the absence of any significant panel threshold effect, regardless of the assumed double or single threshold effect. According to an ensuing inter-segment symmetry analysis, impact factors within the range of study invariably indicated significantly positive relations, a sign that a destination country's consumer price index (CPI) has a positive linear relation with the number of Taiwanese people traveling abroad. In other words, the rising prices in destination countries do not reduce Taiwanese people's demand for traveling abroad. Instead, it reflects the improving economy as well as surging quality of life in a destination country that encourages refinement of products, perfects traveling facilities, and consequently lures quality-seeking tourists as well as Taiwanese outbound visitors. The finding gives a clear guidance that Taiwan's tourism policy shall add sophistication to services in every aspect. (C) 2013 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

During the last 50 years, China has acquired revealed comparative advantage in the export of both labour-intensive products (following its factor abundance) and sophisticated products, although the latter does not mean that there was leapfrogging. China is exceptionally well positioned (especially taking into account its income per capita) to continue learning and gaining revealed comparative advantage in the export of more sophisticated products.

We revisit these findings and document that welfare gains are substantial if capital goods are not perfect substitutes. We use a model of optimal savings where the elasticity of substitution between capital varieties is less than infinity, but more than the value that would generate endogenous growth. This production structure is consistent with empirical estimates of the actual elasticity of substitution between capital types, as well as with the relatively slow speed of convergence documented in the literature. Calibrating the model, welfare gains from financial integration are equivalent to a 9% increase in consumption for the median country, and 14% for the most capital-scarce. This rises substantially if capital's share in output increases even modestly above 0.3, and remains large if inflows of foreign capital are limited to a fraction of the existing capital stock.

My proof of identification is constructive and is based on establishing the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the system of nonlinear differential equations that describes relationships between unknown distribution functions and observable functions. The proof is conducted in two logical steps. First, I prove the existence and uniqueness of a local solution. Then I describe a method that extends this local solution to the whole support. This paper delivers other interesting results. I demonstrate how this approach can be applied to obtain identification in auctions with a stochastic number of bidders.

At the micro level, it seems realistic to assume that both dimensions play a role for individual employment outcomes, although it might be difficult to separate these two effects. Nevertheless the choice and chance dimension are seldom treated symmetrically in models that use micro data. We estimate a logistic model of the probability of being employed among married or cohabitating women that are in the labor force. Besides variables that measure individual characteristics (choice), we allow a full set of indicator variables for observation periods that represent potential effects of aggregate shocks (chance) on job probabilities. To reduce the number of redundant indicator variables automatic model selection is used, and we assess the economic interpretation of the statistically significant indicator variables with reference to a theoretical framework that allows for friction in the Norwegian labor market. In addition, we also estimate models that use female and male unemployment rates as 'sufficient' variables for the chance element in individual employment outcomes.

However, the dilemma of market efficiency still remains intractable. It is more likely that any literature review in respect of market efficiency would produce contradictory results: for a single paper producing empirical evidence supporting the market efficiency, we can perhaps find a contradictory paper which empirically establishes market inefficiency. Paradoxically, popular models in finance developed in 1970s or 1980s were based on the assumption that the market under consideration was efficient. The conventional bond or stock or option pricing models are common examples of this type. In an alternative approach, we have worked out a model which incorporates market sentiments in the domain of the standard rational model of asset pricing. Our model would be well applicable for a 'less than' efficient market and, therefore may be the useful input in investors' policies. (C) 2011 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We test the attractiveness of the CSP option by imposing a global cap on Greenhouse gases concentration equal to 535 ppm CO2-eq in 2100, with and without constraints to the expansion of nuclear power and IGCC coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS). We find that it becomes optimal to produce with CSP from 2040 and to trade CSP electricity across the Mediterranean from 2050. Therefore projects like DESERTEC seem to be premature. After 2050, CSP electricity shares become significant. CSP has a high stabilization cost option value: depending on the constraints, it ranges between 2.1% and 4.1% of discounted GDP in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), between 1.1. and 3.4 in China, between 0.2% and 1.2% in the USA, between 0.1 and 1.3% in Eastern Europe and between 0.1 and 0.4% in Western Europe. A moderate level of subsidy to invest more and earlier in CSP might increase welfare. However, large-scale deployment should occur after 2040. We also show that MENA countries have the incentive to form a cartel to sell electricity to Europe at a price higher than the marginal cost.

The four modes of FDI are distinct from each other, and each has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. While a large and growing empirical literature examines the determinants of FDI, very few studies examine the determinants of different modes of FDI. The central objective of this paper is to empirically analyze the extent to which the determinants of FDI such as firm size influences the choice of one mode of FDI over another. Our analysis follows a stylized two-stage investment process. First, we look at the probability of whether a Japanese firm is willing to undertake FDI in the US. Second, for firms that are willing to undertake FDI, we analyze which mode of FDI - i.e. M&A, joint venture, new plant or other FDI - they will undertake. The second stage is the innovation of this paper and its contribution to the FDI literature.","[Wang, Peiming] Auckland Univ Technol, Fac Business, Auckland 1020, New Zealand; [Alba, Joseph D.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Park, Donghyun] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City 1550, Philippines",Auckland University of Technology; Nanyang Technological University; Asian Development Bank,"Alba, JD (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",peiming.wang@aut.ac.nz; ajoalba@ntu.edu.sg; dpark@adb.org,"Alba, Joseph/AAH-2545-2020","Alba, Joseph Dennis/0000-0002-0916-8884",,,,,23,6,7,2,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

In this paper, we present a dynamic asset pricing model with heterogeneous sentiments and we find that the equilibrium stock price is the wealth-share-weighted average of the stock prices that would prevail in an economy with one sentiment investor only. Moreover, heterogeneous sentiments induce fluctuations in the wealth distribution, which increases stock return volatility and induces mean reversion in stock returns.

Recent developments have dampened that optimism, however, rekindling fears that Sri Lanka's tale of missed opportunities may continue. After showing remarkable resilience during decades of war and conflict, the Sri Lankan economy has failed to capitalize on the window of opportunity presented by the end of the military conflict. In the aftermath of military victory, there has been a sharp reversal of trade liberalization and a marked shift back towards nationalist-populist state-centered economic policies, reflecting the pressures of resurgent nationalism, an unprecedented concentration of political power in a small ruling group, and the influence of some powerful vested interests. Unfortunately, a return to the failed past policies of inward-oriented development strategies offers no viable solutions for the problems confronting small, capital- and resource-poor countries in today's globalized world. Sri Lanka must change both its political practices and economic policies drastically and urgently to cope with the huge development challenges facing it in an environment of global economic turbulence.","[Athukorala, Prema-Chandra] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Jayasuriya, Sisira] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",Australian National University; Monash University,"Athukorala, PC (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Prema-chandra.athukoral@anu.edu.au; Sisira.Jayasuriya@monash.edu,,,,,,,44,14,15,0,19,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

In this paper we argue that basic property rights are insufficient; whether women are able to accumulate wealth also depends upon the marital and inheritance regimes in particular contexts. Drawing upon surveys which collected individual level ownership data in Ecuador, Ghana and the state of Karnataka in India, we estimate married women's share of couple wealth and relate it to how assets are owned within marriage as well as to different inheritance regimes and practices. In Ecuador, married women own 44 %, in Ghana, 19 %, and in Karnataka, 9 % of couple wealth. Ecuador is characterized by the partial community property regime in marriage while inheritance laws provide for all children, irrespective of sex, to be treated equally, norms that are largely followed in practice. In contrast, Ghana and India are characterized by the separation of property regime which does not recognize wives' contribution to the formation of marital property, and by inheritance practices that are strongly male biased. Reforming marital and inheritance regimes must remain a top priority if gender economic equality is to be attained.","[Deere, Carmen Diana] Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Gainesville, FL 32605 USA; [Oduro, Abena D.] Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, Legon, Ghana; [Swaminathan, Hema] Indian Inst Management Bangalore, Ctr Publ Policy, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Doss, Cheryl] Yale Univ, Jackson Inst, New Haven, CT USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Ghana; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore; Yale University,"Deere, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, POB 115530, Gainesville, FL 32605 USA.",deere@ufl.edu; aoduro@ug.edu.gh; hema.swaminathan@iimb.ernet.in; cheryl.doss@yale.edu,,"Doss, Cheryl/0000-0001-8292-3295",,,,,38,82,93,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Varying the price of giving allows us to decompose social preferences into two components: the level of altruism when the price of giving is one, and the willingness to reduce aggregate payoffs to enhance equity. Changing the source of a dictator's budget impacts her decisions because it affects the weight that she places on others' payoffs. However, we find no impacts on the willingness to trade off equity and efficiency.","Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Jakiela, P (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",pjakiela@arec.umd.edu,"Jakiela, Pamela/A-9090-2015",,,,,,27,13,14,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

This paper takes a network perspective to rank sectors according to the Power-of-Pull (PoP), i.e. a sector's power to pull the overall economy. An eigenvector method is employed to assess the PoP of sectors in the USA, using input-output data from 1998 to 2010. The results support bailout to the motor vehicle sector, but argue against bailout to public infrastructure, health care and information technologies design and service sectors, and also reveal the continual decline of PoP ranking of computer and electronics manufacturing sector over time. These results confirm some but also show little support to some other economic revival policies of the Obama Administration in the USA.","Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore University of Technology & Design,"Luo, JX (通讯作者)，Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore.",luo@sutd.edu.sg,"Luo, Jianxi/AAA-8002-2021","Luo, Jianxi/0000-0001-5892-8432",,,,,51,16,19,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Should policy focus on particular places, targeting clusters of firms that are spatially concentrated? Or should it, instead, be space neutral, refusing to discriminate between different areas unless absolutely necessary? We provide an overview of the literature and identify two waves of literature that argue strongly in favour of a cluster approach. We argue that this approach rests on shaky theoretical and empirical foundations. In contrast, we suggest that more attention should be paid to the appropriate spatial scale for horizontal interventions. What can policy do to make cities work better, in ways that help firms to grow? That is, what is the appropriate role for agglomeration rather than cluster policy? Finally, we consider the possibility that some horizontal industrial policy objectives may be better served by specifically targeting particular places or from decentralized design or delivery.","[Overman, Henry] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,,m.a.nathan@lse.ac.uk; h.g.overman@lse.ac.uk,,"Overman, Henry G./0000-0002-3525-7629; Nathan, Max/0000-0002-4617-4300",ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,116,67,71,9,94,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Resilience is included through a series of ad hoc adjustments based on various formal models and expert judgment. Moreover, we have designed the methodology in a manner that overcomes the major shortcomings of the supply-driven approach. We apply the methodology to a 90-day disruption at the twin seaports of Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, which is a major port area that includes a petrochemical manufacturing complex. We find that regional gross output could decline by as much as $13billion at the port region level, but that resilience can reduce these impacts by nearly 70%.","[Rose, Adam] Univ So Calif, Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; Univ So Calif, CREATE, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Rose, A (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",adam.rose@usc.edu,,"Wei, Dan/0000-0003-0738-2286; Rose, Adam/0000-0003-3347-7684",,,,,40,94,105,5,76,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

We use a computable general equilibrium model that is built up of overlapping generations that differ by their household structure, longevity, educational attainment, and capital accumulation. Each household optimally decides over its consumption paths, work effort and retirement age according to the life-cycle theory of labor, while they face survival risk. We find that the pension reforms implemented from 2000 to 2004, although in the correct direction, are not sufficient to solve the labor market distortion caused by the Austrian pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system. Using alternative policy options, our simulations indicate that a change to a notional defined contribution system and an increase in the educational distribution of the work force would increase the incentive for later retirement ages and thereby increase labor supply and economic growth.

An essential distinction is how risk perceptions affect the willingness to pay for insurance relative to the willingness to exert risk-reducing effort. This determines both the sign of the correlation between risk and insurance coverage in equilibrium, shedding new light on a recent empirical puzzle, and the type of individuals screened by either monopolistic or competing firms. Even with perfect competition, heterogeneous risk perceptions may well strengthen the case for government intervention in insurance markets.","[Spinnewijn, Johannes] LSE, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Spinnewijn, J (通讯作者)，LSE, Dept Econ, STICERD R515, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.spinnewijn@lse.ac.uk,"Spinnewijn, Johannes/AAR-7532-2020",,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,47,32,40,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

The results, as to in which areas and how much individual countries need to improve, were not surprising. Concerning the overall efficiency scores and rankings, the most institutionally efficient countries are situated in northern Europe. The Czech Republic ranked 24th in the overall sample and 3rd among New EU Member States. The biggest necessary improvements are in the area of government effectiveness and control of corruption.

Two main advantages characterize this original framework. First, it brings together the information related to several optimum currency area criteria such as price convergence, terms of trade shocks, trade and fiscal policies going further than previous studies which are mainly based on only one criterion at a given time. Second, our study detects potential competitiveness differentials which play a key role in the debate on the optimality or not of a monetary union, as evidenced by the recent crisis in the Euro area. Relying on the recent panel cointegration techniques, cluster analyses and robustness tests, our results show that the WAEMU area is the most homogeneous area in Central and Western Africa and could be joined by Ghana. Gambia and, to a lesser extent, Sierra Leone, and that Ghana and Senegal appear to be the best reference countries for the creation of the whole West Africa monetary union. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Their functionality depends on the connectivity and sizes of different components and they face a variety of threats, from natural disasters to intelligent attacks. How should networks be defended and designed to ensure the best functionality? We develop a model to study this question. There are two players, the Designer and the Adversary. The Designer forms costly links among n given nodes and chooses to protect some of them at a cost. The Adversary then allocates resources to attack nodes. Successful attack on a node leads to its elimination. We study sub-game perfect equilibria of this game. Our main finding is that if defence is affordable and reliable, then the network is sparse and heterogeneous, and either centrally or fully protected. On the other hand, if defence is relatively costly compared to linking, then dense and homogeneous networks arise in equilibrium. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

On the basis of these premises, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of classroom peers on youth screen media consumption. More specifically, it considers the time spent watching TV, playing console games and surfing the Internet. Data are drawn from a single representative survey of secondary school students aged 14-16 in Catalonia (Spain) in 2008. Having accounted for problems of endogeneity, our analysis shows that peer consumption has a positive and statistically significant effect on an individual's console and Internet use. While the magnitude of this effect is not great in the case of the former use, peer effects are quite marked in that of Internet consumption. Moreover, gender differences are observed when media consumption is examined separately. Thus, peer effects on console use are statistically significant only for boys, while the influence of peers on an individual's Internet use is higher among boys than it is among girls.","[Escardibul, Josep-Oriol] Univ Barcelona, Dept Publ Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Escardibul, Josep-Oriol] Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Escardibul, Josep-Oriol] Interdisciplinary Grp Educ Policies GIPE, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Mora, Toni] Univ Int Catalunya, Sch Econ & Social Sci, Barcelona 08017, Spain; [Mora, Toni] Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, Barcelona 08017, Spain; [Villarroya, Anna] Univ Barcelona, Dept Publ Econ, Barcelona 08014, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC); University of Barcelona,"Escardíbul, JO (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Publ Econ, Av Diagonal 690,Tower 4,Floor 2, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",oescardibul@ub.edu; tmora@cir.uic.es; annavillarroya@ub.edu,"Villarroya, Anna/F-6466-2015; Escardíbul, Josep-Oriol/F-1545-2015; Mora, Toni/I-4358-2012","Villarroya, Anna/0000-0002-8575-5933; Mora, Toni/0000-0002-2686-5307",,,,,74,13,14,2,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Given the potential impact on native welfare, such as effects on relative wages and unemployment, there has been political mobilisation on the immigration question. The presence of a redistributive welfare state in all major immigrant host countries creates yet another margin on which immigration affects native welfare. The focus of the paper is whether a large intake of immigrants leads to a reduction in welfare state effort. It is often argued that steady increases in immigration lead to public pressure for stricter immigration controls or for less generous publicly funded social expenditures. In terms of immigrants with similar employability and claims on the public purse to natives, it is hypothesised that the impact on welfare spending is neutral. These ideas are tested using detailed data for migration to developed countries.","[Gaston, Noel] Prod Commiss Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Rajaguru, Gulasekaran] Bond Univ, Globalisat & Dev Ctr, Gold Coast, Qld 4229, Australia; [Rajaguru, Gulasekaran] Bond Univ, Sch Business, Gold Coast, Qld 4229, Australia",Bond University; Bond University,"Gaston, N (通讯作者)，Prod Commiss Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",noel.gaston@pc.gov.au,"Gulasekaran, Rajaguru/AAW-4717-2021","Gulasekaran, Rajaguru/0000-0003-2816-1749",,,,,52,2,3,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

I identify and model heterogeneity across firms and find that the profit impacts of CAFE fall almost entirely on domestic producers. The welfare analyses consider the simultaneous household decision of vehicle and miles traveled, allowing direct comparison with a gasoline tax. Finally, I consider dynamic impacts in the used car market. I find these comprise nearly half the gross welfare cost of CAFE and fall disproportionately on low-income households.

As one contestant becomes stronger, that is, values the prize more, total expenditures are known to decrease monotonically. Thus, asymmetry among contestants reduces competition and rent dissipation. Recently, this result has been shown to hold for other, non-deterministic, contest success functions as well, thereby suggesting a certain robustness. In this paper, however, the complete information assumption is shown to be crucial. I examine a tractable incomplete information model for which the complete information model is a special case. With incomplete information - regardless of how little - total expenditures in a deterministic two-player contest increase when one contestant becomes marginally stronger, starting from a symmetric contest. In fact, both contestants expend resources more aggressively; with complete information, neither of them do so. Thus, there is a discontinuity in the information structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the price behavior of commodity prices and the volatility transmission mechanism between these markets and the stock exchanges are crucial for each participant, including governments, traders, portfolio managers, consumers, and producers. For return and volatility spillover, the results show significant transmission among the S&P 500 and commodity markets. The past shocks and volatility of the S&P 500 strongly influenced the oil and gold markets. This study finds that the highest conditional correlations are between the S&P 500 and gold index and the S&P 500 and WTI index. We also analyze the optimal weights and hedge ratios for commodities/S&P 500 portfolio holdings using the estimates for each index.

This conclusion, however, is typically derived from aggregate inflation or sectoral inflation rates, not from regional inflation data. This paper studies the regional dimension of inflation targeting; that is, the consequences of inflation targeting for regional inflation persistence. Based on data for Korean cities and provinces it is shown that the adoption of inflation targeting leads: (i) to a fall in inflation persistence at the regional level; and (ii) to a reduction in the cross-regional heterogeneity in inflation persistence. A factor model lends further support to the role of the common component, and, hence, monetary policy, for regional inflation persistence.","[Tillmann, Peter] Univ Giessen, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Tillmann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, Licher Str 66, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.",peter.tillmann@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,37,7,7,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

One of such strategic behaviours regards the way of intervention on several innovation areas through different strategies. Disentangling the effect of pre-crisis adopted innovations, industrial relations quality and economic performance on such strategies may be of extreme relevance to analyse the nexus between the reactions to the challenges brought by the crisis and the capacity of the firms to proactively tackle economic downturns. The present work provides an empirical analysis on the basis of more than 500 Italian manufacturing firms located in Emilia-Romagna region. The results suggest the existence of strong relationships between pre-crisis innovative activities and the capacity to react to the challenges brought by the crisis. This happens through innovative strategies, whose contents are mainly product (technological competitiveness), process and organisation/HRM innovative dimensions (cost competitiveness/efficiency gaining). Complementary innovative activities emerge as a key factor. Industrial relations quality is also related to the strategic reaction to the crisis: more participative industrial relations support the adoption of diversified types of innovation strategies. There is, instead, no evidence of a relation between past economic performance and innovation actions in the crisis.","[Antonioli, Davide; Bianchi, Annaflavia; Mazzanti, Massimiliano; Pini, Paolo] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Econ & Management, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Bianchi, Annaflavia] Univ Urbino, Dipartimento Econ, I-61029 Urbino, PU, Italy; [Montresor, Sandro] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-40100 Bologna, Italy",University of Ferrara; University of Urbino; University of Bologna,"Antonioli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.",ntndvd@unife.it; annaflaviab@gmail.com; mzzmsm@unife.it; sandro.montresor@unibo.it; paolo.pini@economia.unife.it,"Montresor, Sandro/K-1833-2019; PINI, PAOLO/ITT-3182-2023","mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942; montresor, sandro/0000-0002-1195-901X",,,,,72,19,19,0,28,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We propose a model in which a leader helps to overcome a misalignment of followers' incentives that inhibits coordination, while adapting the organization to a changing environment. Good leadership requires vision and special personality traits such as conviction or resoluteness to enhance the credibility of mission statements and to effectively rally agents around them. Resoluteness allows leaders to overcome a time-consistency problem that arises from the fact that leaders learn about the best course of action for the organization over time. However, resoluteness also inhibits bottom-up information flow from followers. The optimal level of resoluteness depends on followers' signal quality and the corporate culture of the organization.","[Bolton, Patrick] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Brunnermeier, Markus K.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Veldkamp, Laura] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Columbia University; Princeton University; New York University,"Bolton, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,"Lotfy, Ehab A/E-3873-2017; Brunnermeier, Markus K/C-4473-2012",,,,,,39,88,113,4,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In practice, the law allows retailers to buy nuclear production from the incumbent, at a regulated access price. This mechanism works up to a ceiling of 100 terawatt hours, which represents one quarter of the incumbent's production from nuclear plants. Each retailer is assigned a share of that amount proportionally to its portfolio of clients. We contribute to the debate raised by the NOME law regarding the evolution of retail market prices. We show that a price decrease results if the ceiling is sufficiently high compared to the market share of the retailers competing with the incumbent. This pro-competitive effect is stronger when the incumbent's rivals take into account the impact of their market strategy on the redistribution rule. Finally, we find that, if the regulated price of the NOME electricity is set above the nuclear cost, the incumbent realizes a gain that may result in strategic withholding, weakening the pro-competitive effects of the law.","[Creti, Anna] U Paris Ouest, Paris, France; [Creti, Anna; Sanin, Maria-Eugenia] Ecole Polytech, F-75230 Paris, France; [Pouyet, Jerome] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Sanin, Maria-Eugenia] Univ Montpellier I, LAMETA, UMR5474, Montpellier, France; [Sanin, Maria-Eugenia] UFR Econ, F-34000 Montpellier, France",Paris School of Economics; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Sanin, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier I, LAMETA, UMR5474, Montpellier, France.",maria-eugenia.sanin@polytechnique.edu,,"Sanin, Maria-Eugenia/0000-0002-8923-0480",,,,,21,9,9,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The analysis suggests that the takeovers had a net beneficial effect for consumers, at least in price terms, as a consequence of the introduction of the acquiring firms' business models and associated yield management pricing systems.

First, if skilled individuals shy away from politics because of higher opportunities in the private sector, an increase in politicians' pay may change their mind. Second, if the re-election prospects of incumbents depend on their in-office deeds, a higher wage may foster performance. We use data on all Italian municipal governments from 1993 to 2001 and test these hypotheses in a quasi-experimental setup. In Italy, the wage of mayors depends on population size and sharply rises at different thresholds. We apply a regression discontinuity design to the only threshold that uniquely identifies a wage increase: 5,000 inhabitants. Exploiting the existence of a two-term limit, we further disentangle the composition from the incentive component of the effect of the wage on performance. Our results show that a higher wage attracts more-educated candidates, and that better-paid politicians size down the government machinery by improving efficiency. Importantly, most of this effect is driven by the selection of competent politicians, rather than by the incentive to be re-elected.","[Gagliarducci, Stefano] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; [Nannicini, Tommaso] Bocconi Univ, Mainz, Germany",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Gagliarducci, S (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.",stefano.gagliarducci@uniroma2.it; tommaso.nannicini@unibocconi.it,,"NANNICINI, TOMMASO/0000-0002-9400-7494",,,,,24,150,171,3,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The results are obtained with identification of shocks using a structural VAR model that replicates the empirical standard transmission mechanism of monetary policy that has been found in other studies on the Chilean economy. However, our evidence indicates new results. The periods of economic expansion triggers in the long run, first, increases in nonperforming loans, and then credit reductions. Besides, credit market shocks that measure the risk in the sector, non-performing loans (NPL), generate significant aggregate fluctuations in the economy. Similarly, periods of economic contraction, especially characterized by high interest rates, are followed in the medium-term by falling in the non-performing loans and then by credit booms. Finally exogenous shocks of NPLs produce marginal increases in inflation.","[Garcia, Carlos J.] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile; [Sagner T, Andres] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Universidad Alberto Hurtado; Boston University,"García, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile.",cgarcia@uahurtado.cl; asagner@bu.edu,,,,,,,69,0,0,0,7,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

We prove that any international agreement involves higher public good provisions (through higher contributions in both countries) than in the case of no-agreement. If feasible, an IA may generate losers in either country. Under an equal tax rate rule, an international agreement may or may not be reached, unlike under an equal gain rule. Turning to the election stage, depending on the type of equity rule imposed on the IA, the choice of delegates depends crucially on distributive characteristics, both between and within countries: this is due to the struggle by electorates to transfer the tax burden to the other country's taxpayers.

The estimation results imply that trade openness in the form of higher trade volumes has not been successful in generating jobs in developing countries. The overall weak, negative employment response to trade volumes may be explained by the negative output response to trade openness in these countries. Our estimates also indicate that higher trade volumes have adverse effect on industrial employment in developed countries. Moreover, while they have positive effect on employment in industry and services in developing countries, trade barriers have adverse effect on employment growth in services for developed countries. Our overall results imply that while trade barriers have relatively little adverse effects and/or in some case a positive effect on employment both in developing and developed countries, higher trade volumes have an adverse effect on industrial employment in developed economies. Thus, trade openness is not in itself a solution to the unemployment problems of developing countries and yet it has not been the prime factor to blame for the lower employment levels in developed countries.","Gebze Inst Technol, Dept Econ, TR-41400 Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey",Gebze Technical University,"Yanikkaya, H (通讯作者)，Gebze Inst Technol, Dept Econ, TR-41400 Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey.",halityanikkaya@gyte.edu.tr,"YANIKKAYA, Halit/J-3678-2019","YANIKKAYA, Halit/0000-0003-1542-0174",,,,,74,3,6,1,30,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

These chronologies are obtained using a combination of a fundamental approach and a filter approach. The resulting speculative bubble chronology is the one which provides the highest concordance between these two techniques. In addition, the authors suggest an early warning system based on three alternative approaches: A signalling approach, a logit model, and a probit model. It is shown that the latter two models allow much more accurate predictions of house price bubbles than the signalling approach. Furthermore, the predictive accuracy of the logit and probit models is high enough to make them useful in forecasting future speculative bubbles in housing market. Thus, this method can be used by the policy makers in their attempts to quickly detect house price bubbles and attenuate their devastating effects on the domestic and world economy.","[Dreger, Christian; Kholodilin, Konstantin A.] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Dreger, C (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",cdreger@diw.de; kkholodilin@diw.de,"Kholodilin, Konstantin/ABA-7108-2021; Kholodilin, Konstantin/AAI-9535-2020; Dreger, Christian/AAF-6719-2020","Kholodilin, Konstantin/0000-0001-7165-0228;",,,,,33,1,1,0,20,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 7,2013,7,,,,,,,,20138.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-8,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,185JA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321962500001,0

These changes have affected and continue to affect workplace organisation, working conditions, job creation, productivity and wages. The 35-hour working week policy represents a reduction in working time as well as a complex package that restructured French labour law and that opened up a great deal of space for social bargaining. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of working time regulation and its political roots. It discusses the studies evaluating the 35-hour working week and examines some of the basic consequences of reversing this policy since 2002.

By examining GDP dynamics we find that, over a time-span of two decades, an easy-to-perform adaptive expectations model systematically outperforms other standard predictors in terms of squared forecasting errors. This should reduce model uncertainty and thereby lead to increased homogeneity in expectations. However, data collected in surveys show that great variety in expectations persists even in this situation. Moreover, Granger tests indicate that the forecasting fitness of the best predictor can be further enhanced by the use of information provided by survey expectations. These results, based on real-time data and robust to both several predictors and nonlinearities, weaken the general validity of approaches assuming predictions based on efficient econometric models.

A two-country imperfect competition model is developed, and the interaction between a firm's R&D spending and its OFDI is examined. It is found that the relationship between a firm's OFDI and its domestic R&D is indeterminate because there is a complementary effect as well as a substitution effect induced by OFDI activity. Panel data on Taiwanese manufacturing firms from 19922005 are applied to test the validity of the theoretical results. The propensity score matching method is used to construct a comparison group without selection bias.

We present a theoretical framework which shows that a change in the mode of shipping (from air to sea) in the Ghanaian pineapple industry made it profitable for pineapple exporters to provide myopic farmers with both in-kind loans (to improve productivity) and cash loans (for consumption smoothing) despite being unable to monitor farmers or enforce repayment. The innovative theoretical result is that providing farmers with additional cash loans can enforce greater input use without compromising repayment. We provide evidence in the form of a case study documenting the dramatic rise of informal credit (through contract farming) after the switch to sea-freight between 1996 and 2001. Using this anecdote, we argue that credit arrangements can arise spontaneously, absent non-market interventions to meet market needs even in the absence of proper legal protections for creditors.

The paper has three parts. In the first and second I outline the development of economic dynamics and its applications to general equilibrium elaborated by Morishima; in the third a comparison between the prevailing idea of economic dynamics as originally put forward by Samuelson and that elaborated by Morishima is advanced and discussed.

Considering the possible effects of the region's own R&D stock as well as the spillovers produced in other regions, the paper proposes the use of an entropy-based technique to estimate these effects for a specific location. Depending on the degree of heterogeneity of the set of regions analysed, it is possible that some of these regions present characteristics that enable them to more easily convert R&D efforts (generated in the region itself or obtained from other regions by R&D spillovers) into productivity gains, whereas in other regions the effect of (direct or spillover generated) R&D activities may be irrelevant. We illustrate this idea with an empirical application for Spanish regions.","[Fernandez-Vazquez, Esteban] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Rubiera-Morollon, Fernando] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Fernandez-Vazquez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ, Campus Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",evazquez@uniovi.es; frubiera@uniovi.es,"Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/L-8372-2019","Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/0000-0001-9192-8901",,,,,42,4,4,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

Without taking its limitations and criticisms too lightly, some economists have been using this measure of self-reported satisfaction as a proxy for utility so as to contribute to a better understanding of individuals' tastes and hopefully behavior. By means of satisfaction questions we can elicit information on individual likes and dislikes over a large set of relevant issues, such as income, working status and job amenities, the risk of becoming unemployed, inflation, and health status. This information can be used to evaluate existing ideas from a new perspective, understand individual behavior, evaluate and design public policies, study poverty and inequality, and develop a preference based valuation method. In this article I first critically assess the pros and cons of using satisfaction variables, and then discuss its main applications.","Inst Anal Econ IAE CSIC, Barcelona 08193, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Ferrer-i-Carbonell, A (通讯作者)，Inst Anal Econ IAE CSIC, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",ada.ferrer@iae.csic.es,,"Ferrer-i-Carbonell, Ada/0000-0001-8086-5941",,,,,140,46,51,4,79,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

In this paper, we investigate the stochastic electricity-intensity convergence across the Chinese provinces. Unlike previous work, this paper highlights the relevance of the level of technology of each province and takes into account the economic geography through the examination of club convergence. We perform several unit root tests that introduce structural breaks, nonlinearities and time variation, with the aim to capture the economic transformation of the Chinese economy. Results indicate that the majority of the Chinese regions have converged according to the unit-root tests in time-series analysis, indicating that technological differences diminish over time. However, this convergence pattern occurs within groups of regions, according with club convergence test. Indeed, we find a dominant club and others smaller clubs that few regions belong. However, it is observed that there are regions that still diverge. These findings support our argument that special policy attention is required for those regions displaying divergence.

I find that during the Greenspan era stock markets played a role in US monetary policy. The Fed lowered interest rates when stock prices fell, but did not raise interest rates in response to rising stock prices. This asymmetry put a downward pressure on interest rates. For the ECB, the exchange rate to the dollar played a role in monetary policy decisions. While I do not find evidence of asymmetric monetary policy with respect to the stock market, the ECB may be argued to have indirectly followed the asymmetric US monetary policy via the exchange rate channel until 2006, the period until which the dollar depreciated heavily against the euro. With asset markets putting a downward pressure on interest rates, it is likely that the Fed and ECB contributed to recent boom-and-bust cycles by providing low-cost liquidity to flourishing markets.

Using gasoline price data at the state level over a period of more than two decades, we find strong support for the view that the law of one price holds in regional markets, as more than 80% of bivariate price differentials turn out to be stationary. Furthermore, we uncover evidence that the speed at which prices converge to the long-run equilibrium depends upon the distance between states. Asymmetries are also present in this relationship. Our findings suggest that the more similar are states with respect to taxation, gas stations and refining capacity, the faster is the speed of adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium.

Using the theoretical model, we develop and estimate a structural empirical model that incorporates heterogeneity in productivity, transport costs, and other costs using Chilean plant-level data for a set of manufacturing industries. The estimated model is consistent with many key features of the data regarding productivity, exporting, and importing. We perform a variety of counterfactual experiments to assess quantitatively the positive and normative effects of barriers to trade in import and export markets. These experiments suggest that there are substantial gains in aggregate productivity and welfare due to trade. Furthermore, because of import and export complementarities, policies which inhibit the importation of foreign intermediates can have a large adverse effect on the exportation of final goods.

First, we rely on an asset pricing model to empirically determine the effect of carbon price risks on firm-specific cost of capital for a sample of 20 European utility stocks during the period 2005-2010. Second, we employ a discounted cash flow framework to simulate carbon-adjusted equity values for three selected utilities and their investment strategies from 2009 to 2020. We show that company-specific carbon risks are asymmetrically distributed to a few utility firms: While for the great majority of power producers carbon price movements are not a relevant risk factor, we find that utilities with an extremely high-emitting fuel mix bear significant risk premiums for carbon which translate to higher cost of capital and a loss of equity value. In contrast, we find no evidence that low-emitting utilities benefit from reduced capital costs. We further reveal that, in addition to the firm's fuel mix, permit allocation rules and replacement investment decisions in terms of fuel technology choice are the driving forces behind the carbon exposure of the utilities. The carbon-related loss of equity value is substantially reduced by implementing an investment strategy directed towards a carbon-free generation mix. The derogations from full permit auctioning in Eastern European member states provide insurance against carbon risks of utilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This stands in contrast to countries in the eurozone, where the central bank does not normally purchase sovereign debt. While these claims now seem to be accepted by some economists, neo-chartalists have also made a number of controversial claims, including that the government spends simply by crediting a private-sector-bank account at the central bank; that the government does need to borrow to deficit-spend; and that taxes do not finance government expenditures. This paper shows that these surprising statements do have some logic, once one assumes the consolidation of the government sector and the central bank into a unique entity, the state. The paper further argues, however, that these paradoxical claims end up being counter-productive since consolidation is counter-factual.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Lavoie, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,,,,,,87,58,66,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

However, on closer examination this appears a harsh judgement. Many of Keynes's statistics come directly from two Treasury memoranda, one dated 1916, the other 1918. Keynes's original handwritten manuscript survives in the King's College archives at Cambridge, in which sections of these memoranda are ocut and pasted' directly into the manuscript.

We derive closed-form solutions of contract values for the franchisor and franchisee. We also calculate the expected value of the guaranteed profit, which is reflected in the franchise fee. Corresponding numerical analysis is then conducted for different scenarios with respect to expected profit, the level of guaranteed profits, and profit volatilities. These results show that the contract values for both franchisor and franchisees are high if the franchise is lucrative. Higher guaranteed profit increases the value of franchisees while it decreases that of the franchisor, and the influence magnitude grows in a more volatile business environment. However, if the gross profits are stably high, then guaranteed profit is unlikely exercised and hence has less impact on the contract values of either party. Based on these findings, implications and suggestions are given. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For the robustness, we implement the multiscale analysis on dynamic changes of time-varying Hurst exponents by applying the rolling window method based on DFA. Our results reveal that APGARCH model with the superior forecasting ability captures the long memory property better than other GARCH-class models for different time scale interval. Interestingly, the time-varying Hurst exponents of the sudden jumps for the conditional volatility calculated by the DFA method using the APGARCH model are smaller than that of the actual volatility series, which indicates that APGARCH model may underestimate the long memory property in the Chinese stock market. Our evidences provide new perspectives for the financial market forecasting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, in urban China, unemployment coexists with a conflicting phenomenon, shortage of workers in firms. In this study, we employ a novel approach to tackle this issue, search and matching theory, the empirical study of which has not drawn much attention in China. Our multiple model consisted of job-worker matching, job creation and destruction, rural-urban immigration and on-the-job search, and unemployment changes in China. We used non-linear estimation and the three-stage least squares analysis in this study. We found that matching efficiency declined greatly during the 1996-2008 period. The econometric model and simulation results indicated four key factors that led to changes in China's unemployment level: matching efficiency, job destruction, productivity growth, and job-search services. Finally, by using our econometric model, we identified the reasons for the shifts in the Beveridge curve. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis of dependencies between mean rates of return of prices on the steam coal market and volatility spillover was conducted using weekly data from the period 04.012002 to 30.12.2011. The prices of the world's largest exporters and importers on the Pacific and Atlantic markets were chosen to analyse the dependencies. The methodology was based on the tests from Cheung and Ng (1996) and Hong (2001), which allow for the analysis of Granger causality both in mean and in variance. The analyses indicate that the dependence between participants is not the same. The strongest links were observed between the pairs of participants from the same market (that is, either the Atlantic market or the Pacific market), and the price of Australian coal turned out to be the most important factor in shaping other prices on the Pacific market. On the Atlantic market, the coal prices in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) ports and the Richards Bay port had the greatest influence on coal prices and were the Granger cause of prices in the Pacific region.

In this market, new market rules, energy policy towards fuel diversification and introduction of flex-fuel engines have determined fuel competition among gasoline, ethanol and compressed natural gas. Using a dynamic panel data model, demand equations for these three fuels are econometrically estimated to obtain consumer adjustment coefficients, price, cross-price and income elasticities in the short and long-run. In addition, the effect of the introduction of flex-fuel engines in the market and the rationality of consumers towards efficiency constraints of the engines were tested. Apart from considerable competition, results show that the dynamics of the Brazilian fuel market revolves around ethanol instead of gasoline. While demands for gasoline and natural gas are inelastic to price, demand for ethanol is elastic in Brazil. Furthermore, after the introduction of the flex-fuel technology the sensitivity of consumers to fuel prices changed, and ethanol consumers take efficiency constrains into account when ethanol prices reach the threshold of 70% of gasoline prices.

A uniform, debt-financed tax cut has a positive present-value multiplier on consumption, stemming from intertemporal substitution by the savers, who hold the public debt.","Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; Univ Bocconi, Mainz, Germany; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bilbiie, FO (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",florin.bilbiie@parisschoolofeconomics.eu,,,,,,,28,26,32,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

To investigate this, we ran a management field experiment on large Indian textile firms. We provided free consulting on management practices to randomly chosen treatment plants and compared their performance to a set of control plants. We find that adopting these management practices raised productivity by 17% in the first year through improved quality and efficiency and reduced inventory, and within three years led to the opening of more production plants. Why had the firms not adopted these profitable practices previously? Our results suggest that informational barriers were the primary factor explaining this lack of adoption. Also, because reallocation across firms appeared to be constrained by limits on managerial time, competition had not forced badly managed firms to exit.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; World Bank, Washington, DC USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; The World Bank,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019",,"ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0846194] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,55,537,686,8,148,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The paper discusses how the measurement infrastructure which includes institutions conducting metrological research and standard setting organization reduces transactions costs, especially in markets where differences in product characteristics are important. The theoretical analysis focuses on the public good characteristics of the measurement infrastructure, considering how the infrastructure impacts upon trade in a model based upon product differentiation under monopolistic competition. In the econometric analysis, indicators of the strength of the infrastructure within the EU, both across industries and across countries, suggest that measurement activities are important in determining the extent of bi-lateral EU intra-industry trade. Despite many common elements in the measurement infrastructure across the EU, there is also some evidence of differential access to the infrastructure among EU members.","[Choudhary, M.

Our study fills this void using state-level repeated cross section data from the Medicaid State Drug Utilization (SDU) database of fee-for-service Medicaid claims for prescription drugs, and individual-level panel data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) which is a nationally representative survey that contains information on medication use across two years. We find that the withdrawal of Vioxx had both positive and negative effects for specific substitute drugs in its own class (COX-2s), and that it led to an overall increase in the usage of both its most direct competitor class (NSAIDs) and in a class of older similar therapy (Analgesics). We argue these shifts in drug usage represent what could be viewed as an appropriate response to the events. However, aggregate use of drugs in the COX-2 and related classes declined overall, suggesting that some consumers may have over-reacted to the withdrawal events in ways that lessened the health benefits they could receive from this family of drugs. These findings about medication utilization changes in response to negative information are highly relevant for policy design and for determining thresholds for regulatory interventions.

In recent decades, the U.S. dollar has played this role. The dollar acts as a vehicle currency in the sense that agents in nondollar economies will generally engage in currency trade indirectly using the U.S. dollar instead of using direct bilateral trade among their own currencies. A vehicle currency is desirable when there are transactions costs of exchange. This article constructs a dynamic general equilibrium model of a vehicle currency. We explore the nature of the efficiency gains arising from a vehicle currency and show how it depends on the total number of currencies in existence, the size of the vehicle currency economy, and the monetary policy followed by the vehicle currencys government. We find that there can be significant welfare gains to a vehicle currency in a system of many independent currencies. But these gains are asymmetrically weighted toward the residents of the vehicle currency country. The survival of a vehicle currency places natural limits on the monetary policy of the vehicle currency country.","[Devereux, Michael B.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Toronto,"Devereux, MB (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, 997-1873 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",devm@interchange.ubc.ca,,,,,,,27,36,43,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,,,INT ECON REV,Int.

The paper sheds light on the role of the ownership structures of firms and its effect on investment behavior via the presence of private benefits of control, financial and soft budget constraints. We find a negative impact of government ownership on investment and evidence for soft budget constraints. Foreign ownership is associated with financial constraints. Firms with management ownership do not appear to suffer from financial constraints. These and other findings demonstrate a significant role for private benefits of control consistent with the presented investment model that allows for private benefits of control and financial and soft budget constraints.

In this paper we develop a new perspective on the establishment of the monopoly of violence. We build a model to explain the incentive of central states to eliminate nonstate armed actors (paramilitaries) in a democracy. The model is premised on the idea that paramilitaries may choose to and can influence elections. Since paramilitaries have preferences over policies, this reduces the incentives of the politicians they favor to eliminate them. We then investigate these ideas using data from Colombia between 1991 and 2006. We first present regression and case study evidence supporting our postulate that paramilitary groups can have significant effects on elections for the legislature and the executive. Next, we show that the evidence is also broadly consistent with the implication of the model that paramilitaries tend to persist to the extent that they deliver votes to candidates for the executive whose preferences are close to theirs and that this effect is larger in areas where the presidential candidate would have otherwise not done as well. Finally, we use roll-call votes to illustrate a possible quid pro quo between the executive and paramilitaries in Colombia.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Robinson, James A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Santos, Rafael J.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University; Yale University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",daron@mit.edu; jrobinson@gov.harvard.edu; rafael.santosvillagran@yale.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023",,,,,,48,172,218,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

In this paper, we compare: (1) the relative effectiveness of risk management systems based on the original and revised frameworks in controlling tail risk; and (2) the relative adequacy of these frameworks in setting minimum capital requirements. Our main findings are as follows. First, both systems allow the selection of portfolios with substantive tail risk, but one based on the revised framework tends to be less effective in controlling tail risk. Second, the minimum capital requirements set by the revised framework are much less likely to be wiped out by trading losses than those set by the original framework. Hence, on balance, the revised framework improves upon the original framework. We also suggest further improvements for consideration by bank regulators. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The findings indicate that consumers who have been closely associated with the goods or who fully intend to purchase the goods are highly likely to understand any (alleged) deceptive advertising. Therefore, advertising regulations should protect marginal consumers from deceptive advertising rather than the actual or potential purchasers. The findings therefore corroborate the inducing requirement of the rules for misleading representation presently applied in Japan and other countries.","[Arai, Koki] Japan Fair Trade Commiss, Tokyo, Japan; [Arai, Koki] Competit Policy Res Ctr, Tokyo, Japan",,"Arai, K (通讯作者)，Japan Fair Trade Commiss, Tokyo, Japan.",koki.arai@nifty.ne.jp,"Arai, Koki/AFO-7968-2022",,,,,,8,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

For each generalized best reply correspondence, we define a generalized best reply dynamics as a differential inclusion based on it. We call a face of the set of mixed strategy profiles a minimally asymptotically stable face (MASF) if it is asymptotically stable under some such dynamics and no subface of it is asymptotically stable under any such dynamics. The set of such correspondences (and dynamics) is endowed with the partial order of pointwise set inclusion and, under a mild condition on the normal form of the game at hand, forms a complete lattice with meets based on pointwise intersections. The refined best reply correspondence is then defined as the smallest element of the set of all generalized best reply correspondences. We find that every persistent retract (Kalai and Samet 1984) contains a MASF. Furthermore, persistent retracts are minimal CURB (closed under rational behavior) sets (Basu and Weibull 1991) based on the refined best reply correspondence.

Recent research suggests that social norms also play an important role. From a point of view of a mechanism designer (a principal, a government, and a bank), responsiveness of an agent to the social norms is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it provides the designer with extra instruments, while on the other it puts restrictions on how these new and the more conventional instruments can be used. The main objective of this paper is to investigate this trade-off and study how it shapes different contracts observed in the real world. We consider a model in which agent's cost of cheating is triggered by the principal's show of trust. We call such behavior a norm of honesty and trust and show that it drives incentives to be either low powerful or high powerful, eliminating contracts with medium powerful incentives.","[Basov, Suren; Bhatti, M.

Empirical analysis using bank-level data from the recent crisis provides support to our theoretical findings. Specifically, banks with a higher share of foreign deposits and assets and a lower foreign equity share were intervened at a more fragile state, reflecting the distorted incentives of national regulators.

The goal of the paper is to investigate a problem whether the regulation of tax and social system induces discouragement of low-income individuals to work. The low-income single individual faces a decision where he decides upon active persistence on the labour market or to rely on social benefits. The social system of the Czech Republic guarantees the individual a minimum wage when he decides to take a full-time job. In the case of inactivity the system guarantees him the social benefit. The fiscal authority should take measures to set up the interaction of the tax and social systems in order to motivate individuals to find work. The Marginal effective tax rate for employed people METR(EP) methodology was selected as a research method to investigate this phenomena. The investigated case is the low-income single individual and his (de)motivation to actively participate on the labour market. The paper deals with analysis of annual changes that occurred in the tax and social policy since 2008. The unemployment of investigated low-income group of people is increasing. This analysis is focused on a question whether is the unemployment supported by wrong regulation of the tax and social system interaction. Findings from the paper suggest that under tax and social system regulation of the Czech Republic in the case of the low-income individual finding and having a job is financially disadvantageous.,"[Berani, Vlastimil; Franek, Jiri] Tech Univ Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Vysoka Skola Banska, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Berani, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Vysoka Skola Banska, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",vlastimil.beran@vsb.cz; jiri.franek@vsb.cz,"Franek, Jiri/P-5689-2017","Franek, Jiri/0000-0001-9705-3042",,,,,20,1,1,0,5,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-248-3095-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,14,22,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393737200002,0

The marginal value of an additional weekly prayer session for individuals already at the national mean is estimated to be $6550 per annum (2004 dollars). Praying at the frequency of the national mean of 8.1 prayer sessions weekly is valued at $53 055 (2004 dollars) per annum. This is larger than the median household income in the US in 2004: $44 684.

Employing a variety of specifications, we find that the performance of college draft choices is no better than those of high school picks and argue that this is consistent with Hayek's (1944) work on the economics of information and his emphasis on the importance of localized knowledge. Additionally, we utilize data on the first three rounds of the MLB draft from 1965 to 2010 to test whether Lewis' book had any impact on teams' draft strategies.

We focus on the error-correction mechanism among co-integrated time series to detect the directional link(s) of causality. Clear-cut results emerge: bi-directional causality exists in the long-run dynamics, but it is the long-run dynamics of visits to museums and monuments that mainly adjust to tourism variables (arrivals, overnights, average stays). In the short run, there are some causal effects going from the cultural sites' attendance to tourism dynamics.

We control for three mechanisms through which these decisions might affect children's outcomes: direct monetary benefits, parental time invested in the child, and nonpecuniary benefits from in-kind transfer programs such as Medicaid. We employ a correction function approach and control for state-fixed effects to address the endogenous nature of welfare participation and employment decisions. Our estimates suggest that although each additional quarter of either mother's employment or welfare use results in only a small increase in a child's standardized math test score, the total effects after several quarters are sizable. We allow mothers' decisions to have varying effects on attainment by children's observed innate ability and by the intensity of welfare use and employment. A child who has the mean level of observed innate ability with a mother who simultaneously worked and used welfare in all 20 quarters after childbirth experiences an 8.25 standardized-point increase in standardized scores. The positive impact is more pronounced for the more disadvantaged children, who tend to be born to mothers with low Armed Forces Qualification Test scores, or have lower birth weights. We also examine the effects using timing of employment and welfare use, as well as children's maturity and gender.

Given the set of the twelve initial member States, the euro zone peripheral countries (Portugal, Greece, and Spain) have in common the fact that they are recent democracies. Independently from other valid approaches to this question, the specific contribution of this paper is to focus on the role played by institutional and political variables in the behavior of fiscal variables. We show that the behavior of these variables is indeed statistically different from the one observed for the other euro zone countries, which are mature democracies.

This paper studies how special tax regimes shape the organizational form choice. Although the full effects depend on the way that firm-level special tax regimes are designed, special regimes generally tend to favor pass-through firms over non-pass-through firms. The tonnage tax, a tax incentive for international shipping firms available in many countries worldwide, is examined to understand these effects. Employing European firm- and country-level data, the impact of the tonnage tax on organizational form choice is studied empirically. The results are consistent with the theoretical model. Shipping firms are less likely to incorporate if the tonnage tax is also available for firms that have adopted pass-through organizational forms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we depart from the existing literature by studying a dynamic model in which the government may choose to impose nonlinear taxes (or subsidies) on both labour income and education expenditures. Our main result is that optimal education policy in our model is progressive. Specifically, if the government can commit to its future tax policy, it is optimal for high-skill individuals to face a zero marginal tax rate on their education expenditures, while that for low-skill individuals is negative. If the government cannot commit, the optimal marginal tax rate on education expenditures by high-skill individuals is positive, while that for low-skill individuals remains negative. Optimal education policy is therefore more progressive when the government cannot commit.","[Guo, Jang-Ting] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Krause, Alan] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of York - UK,"Guo, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",guojt@ucr.edu; alan.krause@york.ac.uk,"Guo, Jang-Ting/AAY-8365-2021","Guo, Jang-Ting/0000-0001-9948-9691",,,,,37,13,13,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

But how could we know if a university education is going to provide necessary competence in sustainable development? A model being developed to measure university sustainability is the Assessment Instrument of Sustainability in Higher Education (AISHE). Using the logic of self-assessment and based on the Triple Bottom Line this model deals with operations, education, research, interaction with society and core values with a so called identity module. The model makes an operationalization of sustainable development and its structure should be usable for constructing a quick assessment system similar to those of many business excellence models. Finding out the level of university sustainability is clearly not very easy for presumptive students. Furthermore, we can assume that since being sustainable is politically correct there is a risk of sustainability washing of information provided. Current university ranking systems do not seem to correspond well with how universities are working with sustainable development. The research question is if the AISHE-model could be converted into a credible quick assessment tool by relying on information provided by the university web-site. For this to work the university needs to have a culture that promotes transparency. With the rapid development of information technology it could be expected that more and more countries will have the conditions for using web-sites for providing the necessary information. Swedish university web-sites are used for testing the model. Sweden has a high level of transparency and is therefore thought to form a suitable example.

Our research demonstrates that analyses that ignore the quality effects associated with expanded airline networks generate incorrect findings and thus should not form the basis for policy decisions regarding airline transactions. Appropriately incorporating quality effects into quality-adjusted fares reverses the conclusion that hub airports yield lower consumer welfare due to generally higher fares than other airports. From the perspective of consumer welfare in this industry, to evaluate potential airline mergers, alliances, slot swaps or other transactions, one should not focus solely on the effect of concentration on nominal fares, rather, one should account for the welfare-enhancing effects of larger airline networks.","[Rubinfeld, Daniel L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Israel, Mark; Keating, Bryan] Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC USA; [Willig, Bobby] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Princeton University,"Rubinfeld, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Boalt Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",drubinfeld@law.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,39,10,13,1,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

We assess whether information about the interaction partner helps eliminate the imperfect equilibrium. Our treatments involve three information enhancing mechanisms: repetition and two kinds of individual signals: messages from partner or observation of his past choices. Repetition-based learning increases the frequencies of the most efficient outcome and the most costly strategic mismatch. Moreover, it is superseded by individual signals. Like previous empirical studies, we find that signals provide a screening of partners' intentions that reduces the frequency of coordination failures. Unlike these studies, we find that the transmission of information between partners, either via messages or observation, does not suffice to significantly increase the overall efficiency of outcomes. This happens mostly because information does not restrain the choice of the dominated action by senders.","[Jacquemet, Nicolas] Univ Lorraine, BETA, Nancy, France; [Jacquemet, Nicolas; Zylbersztejn, Adam] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Universite de Lorraine; Paris School of Economics,"Jacquemet, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, BETA, Nancy, France.",Nicolas.Jacquemet@univ-paris1.fr; zylbersztejn@gmail.com,"Jacquemet, Nicolas/F-4736-2010; Zylbersztejn, Adam/G-8370-2017","Jacquemet, Nicolas/0000-0002-5056-9225; Zylbersztejn, Adam/0000-0001-6987-3190",,,,,32,1,1,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Using intraday data over the period December 2004 to March 2009, we find significant time-varying dependence between the UK and French stock returns, which alter according to the state of the US market. Indeed, not only does the opening of the US market itself significantly affect the UK stock dependency, but such linkages also seem to be closely dependent on bearish or bullish US market trends. Interestingly, the estimation of a two-regime Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) model indicates that the bearish US trends are a source of minor linkage (lower regime), whereas the bullish US trends involve higher interdependency (upper regime). This finding is particularly interesting as following the US trend expectations enables us to better forecast future European stock prices and to calculate the level of their potential contagion effects.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry Val dEssonne, Evry, France; [Jawadi, Fredj; Ben Ameur, Hachmi] Amiens Sch Management, Amiens, France; [Louhichi, Wael] CNRS, IGR, IAE Rennes, CREM Rennes,UMR 6211, Rennes, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry Val dEssonne, Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,,"JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,13,3,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

One issue with HPV vaccination is how it impacts on demand for screening. This study examines changes in women's screening preferences following these two interventions, using a novel approach to policy evaluation based on repeated discrete choice experiments. The study extends our previous analysis of attitudes to screening by taking advantage of the timing of the choice experiments to examine the impact of the two policy changes on determinants of screening. We find that, unexpectedly, willingness to screen is generally lower post-interventions. The reason for this trend appears to be related to HPV vaccination. We also find that interventions have minor impacts on how women value screening attributes. Our approach allows us to examine the impact of provider behaviour. A simulation demonstrates that under certain conditions, participation rates can be increased by 40% to 50% if health providers actively encourage women to undertake a cervical screening test.","[Johar, Meliyanni] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Study Choice, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Fiebig, Denzil G.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Haas, Marion; Viney, Rosalie] Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Johar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Study Choice, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",meliyanni.johar@uts.edu.au,"Haas, Marion Ruth/H-2732-2017; Fiebig, Denzil/A-9479-2011","Fiebig, Denzil/0000-0002-3707-1940; Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635",,,,,31,4,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We employ a switching regime framework using two estimation strategies: First, we follow Caner and Hansen's (2004) threshold approach. Under this procedure we estimate, using the Taylor empirical rules, the threshold values. Second, to infer the monetary policy preferences and have the best interpretation of the parameters, we use these threshold values to estimate the specification of asymmetric policy reaction function following Favero and Rovelli's (2003) approach. The results reveal that the Canadian monetary authorities showed asymmetric preferences; hence its reaction function can be better modeled as a nonlinear model. The results also imply that the monetary authorities' preferences have changed between different subperiods and different regimes. In particular, the parameter associated with the implicit target of inflation has been reduced significantly. We find strong statistical support for this decline, a result that is consistent with previous findings by Favero and Rovelli (2003) for the case of US and Rodriguez (2008) for Canada. The main contribution of this paper is to make out the presence of nonlinearities and asymmetries in the Canadian reaction function and to be able to interpret the parameters associated with the preferences of the central bank This provides empirically interesting extension to Rodriguez (2008).

That debate received additional fodder in 2010 with passage in the US of the Durbin Amendment, which targets debit card interchange fees. I assess the Durbin Amendment, testing the interchange fee cap it imposes against the tourist test proposed in the theoretical literature. I first calculate merchant incremental payment processing costs across payment instruments. While I find that debit card bank fees are higher than bank fees for other instruments, a comparison of other incremental costs softens that conclusion. With the cost estimates in hand, I then compare the interchange fee suggested by the tourist test with that set by the Durbin Amendment. The empirical assessment of the tourist test highlights the importance of the instrument whose costs are avoided - whether cash or check is used dramatically alters the test and indicates that an optimal one-size-fits-all interchange fee cap will be difficult to achieve.","Charles River Associates Inc, Chicago, IL 60606 USA",Charles River Associates,"Layne-Farrar, A (通讯作者)，Charles River Associates Inc, 1 South Wacker,Ste 3400, Chicago, IL 60606 USA.",alayne-farrar@crai.com,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

First, we find evidence that Korean households hold a larger proportion of their wealth in human capital instead of financial wealth, compared to households in other countries. Potentially, this finding appears consistent with Koreans' enthusiasm for human development through education despite low government funding. Another important finding is that only financial wealth fluctuations contain a large portion of temporary components. Hence, financial wealth is mainly responsible for adjustments to restore the long-run relationship between consumption, financial wealth and labor income during the examined period. Third, and perhaps most interestingly, this paper finds that before the 1997 Asian financial crisis, households in Korea had difficulty smoothing their consumption over time. This finding may be at least partly attributable to households' limited access to bank loans and their low level of financial wealth accumulation prior to the crisis. In contrast, we find little evidence that households' consumption behavior has changed during the recent global financial crisis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using a firm-level data set based on the Taiwanese innovation survey (in accordance with CIS 3) conducted in 2003, we are able to compare the R&D activities in this newly-industrialized country with other developed countries. Additionally, we apply a two-step procedure to reduce the endogeneity problem caused by the firms' choices of strategies to obtain consistent estimators, which can be regarded as a combined method of adoption and productivity approaches. We show that the results of the estimation for R&D complementarities may be biased upwards or downwards if we do not include selection equations in the empirical models, thereby giving rise to endogeneity problems. Our empirical results generally support the existence of R&D complementarities, while the strength of complementary effects may vary across different measures of innovation output. Moreover, our finding suggests that the complementary relationship between external and cooperative R&D is fairly robust to various model specifications.","[Lin, Eric S.] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Hsiao, Yi-Chi] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Strategy & Management, Taipei 10055, Taiwan; [Lin, Hui-lin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10055, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University,"Lin, ES (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",slin@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,"HSIAO, YI-CHI/0000-0001-8221-937X",,,,,34,10,11,0,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Applying a methodology of quality control helps organizations create effective management of their information. The method of quality information control depends on all those aspects. The importance of the organization should be given to dispose of an optimum amount of information in the required level of quality and especially to share this information. The quality of information is the key to the success of the project's management; this also applies in many other areas. Understanding the mechanics of the control of information management and its class is essential, this is an experience that distinguishes successful information managers. With the increasing dependence of organizations on the quality of management, information and operational decisions patches IQ are no longer an equivalent way. Organizations must learn to recognize potential signs of the possible development of patches in order to devise solutions before problems arise. This, however, requires knowledge of information processing and the understanding of why these processes were carried out as they should be, or why they were unfulfilled. Organizations that deal with warning signs of IQ problems provide a smooth path for their customers a higher quality of information. A framework for data quality assessment should not only evaluate, but also plan, analyse and solve problems related to the quality of data for a proactive management. The role of the quality management project is to ensure that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was created and to start addressing them. Many projects end in failure, mainly because the project team concentrated their attention only to the written specification of the major products in development, and forget about other needs and expectations that participants attach to the project. It follows that it is equally important to put emphasis on the quality just as much as the scope of the project together with the time and costs required for its implementation. In the article I have described the results of my research as well as the plans for further research, the results of which should be the proposal of methodology for evaluation of quality of information in project management.","[Mala, Jana] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Mat Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Ruskova, Dagmar] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Mat Sci & Technol, Dept Languages, Bratislava, Slovakia",Slovak University of Technology Bratislava; Slovak University of Technology Bratislava,"Malá, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Mat Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",jana.mala@stuba.sk; lubica.cerna@stuba.sk; dagmar.ruskova@stuba.sk,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,532,538,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000061,0

Despite Sub-Saharan African countries achieving sterling growth in the last 15 years, the corresponding reduction in poverty has been minor with the absolute number of people living in poverty remaining high. The three papers published in this supplement attempt to revisit the growth, inequality and poverty nexus to bring out new insights into their linkages. The first paper focuses on the interrelationship linking growth, inequality and poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa. The second paper looks at growth and poverty reduction in Africa in the last two decades: evidence from an AERC growthpoverty project and beyond, while the third paper is sustaining high economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa: knowledge and the structure of the economy. Some of the main findings of the papers are as follows: first, a combination of initial endemic poverty, high inequality and low growth is a major challenge to achieving poverty reduction as well as overall socio-economic development in Africa; second, there has been some progress in poverty reduction in the last decade in Africa but at different rates in different countries; third, sustainable economic growth can be achieved through transforming the structure of the economies in African countries so as to meet the targets of Millennium Development Goals, of which poverty reduction is one.","AERC, Nairobi, Kenya",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"Manda, DK (通讯作者)，AERC, Nairobi, Kenya.",damiano.manda@aercafrica.org,,,,,,,11,3,3,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Typically, these implicit contracts would include both upward sloping earning profiles and mandatory retirement. In this article, we empirically test the prediction that workers with firm-specific skills are restrained in their options to continue working. Therefore, they are more likely to retire at common mandatory retirement dates than those with general skills. Using the US National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, we find that workers who participated in firm-specific training in their early careers do indeed retire earlier than those with general skills. The results show that compulsory retirement plans force these older workers to retire when they reach the common mandatory retirement age of 65. The results presented in this article are highly relevant for public policies in European and other industrialized countries that aim to increase labour force participation of the elderly. As our study demonstrates, the effectiveness of institutional arrangements to postpone retirement will also depend on training policies of employers and the type of skills workers acquired in the past.","[Montizaan, R.; Corvers, F.; de Grip, A.] Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Montizaan, R.; Corvers, F.; de Grip, A.] Maastricht Univ, Labor Market ROA, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Montizaan, R.; de Grip, A.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Corvers, F.; de Grip, A.] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Tilburg University,"Montizaan, R (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ, POB 616,Tongersestr 53, Maastricht, Netherlands.",r.montizaan@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"De Grip, Andries/A-6021-2009; Cörvers, Frank/AAW-8640-2020; Cörvers, Frank/AAS-8525-2020","Cörvers, Frank/0000-0003-3099-1725; Cörvers, Frank/0000-0003-3099-1725",,,,,20,2,2,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We also investigate whether education (general awareness) helps lower IMR directly or helps improve effectiveness of health-aid in reducing IMR. In addition, the study investigates whether various disaggregated components of health-aid (for example, aid that goes for infectious disease control or nutrition) help lower IMR. We find that although adult education (awareness) always lowers IMR, the overall effect of health-aid remains insignificant. Our conclusion is robust to various disaggregated components of health-aid as well. We also check if health-aid has improved prenatal care for expecting mothers but our conclusion regarding the overall ineffectiveness of aid remains unchanged. Interestingly, we find that total health-aid as well as nutrition aid may lower IMR only after education exceeds a threshold level - a new angle that has not been explicitly explored before. We also find interesting role of education in making the aid more effective for prenatal care. Our semiparametric nonlinear estimation strategy helps us unravel certain interesting thresholds and facts which cannot be captured in a linear parametric estimation framework.","[Mukherjee, Debasri] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Kizhakethalackal, Elsy Thomas] Bowling Green State Univ, Firelands Coll, Dept Appl Sci, Huron, OH 44839 USA",Western Michigan University; University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University,"Mukherjee, D (通讯作者)，Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 5426 Friedman Hall, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",debasri.mukherjee@wmich.edu,,,,,,,33,19,20,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To identify different volatilities in the exchange rate, we employ a threshold regression model. In other words, we define exchange rate volatility as a threshold variable. By using monthly data from Japan, we estimate a threshold parameter and calculate its confidence interval by following Hansen (2000). The results substantiate that the degree of exchange rate pass-through to the aggregated corporate goods price index is higher and more gradually adjusted in a higher exchange rate volatility regime. Furthermore, such asymmetric relationships are clearly found in three disaggregated corporate goods prices: petroleum and coal products, nonferrous metals, and chemicals and related products.

The magnitudes of these effects compare in size with many active labour market programs targeted at low-income young adults. This article extends the literature by examining these relationships in such a group. Somewhat surprisingly the data indicate that just as in the greater population young drinkers have more favourable labour market outcomes than nondrinkers. However, when a fixed-effects approach is used to identify causal impacts there is no evidence that drinking has a positive impact on labour market outcomes and some evidence for negative returns to drinking. The smoking penalty is estimated to be much smaller among this group and not statistically significant. Finally, estimates suggest that the observed correlations between consumption and labour market outcomes are biased by unobserved characteristics of the individual as well as unobservables that change over time that are likely causing the treatment decision.","Univ Calif Merced, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA 95343 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced,"Neumann, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Merced, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, 5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",tneumann@ucmerced.edu,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Many authors claim that financial markets and investments desperately need innovations. Socially responsible investment is one of such innovations, which has recently attracted great interest The basic idea of socially responsible investment investing only into the companies which fulfill some normative criteria - is actually nothing new, but is has been rapidly growing during the last decade. This paper is concentrated on the performance of such investments. According to the traditional portfolio theory, the SRI should perform worse or at best the same as the conventional Indices. Nevertheless, there are also opinions proclaiming the superiority of the SRI. These opinions are based on the idea that the socially responsible behavior is a sign of the well-managed company, which Is therefore supposed to keep its performance In the future more likely than the 'irresponsible enterprises. Many researches have been conducted to solve this controversy. First part of this paper therefore contains brief overview of the methodology and results of these studies. These researches are not up to date enough, though. Because of the huge change of economic situation caused by the global crisis, in our opinion it is necessary to make new analysis of the performance of the SRI under the current conditions. In this paper we analyzed the risk-adjusted return of the SRI stock market indices in comparison with the standard ones. Obtained results are consistent with most of the previous studies, I. e. no statistically significant difference between the SRI and conventional investments was found.","[Polivka, Martin; Pesik, Jiri] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,polivkam@kem.zcu.cz; pesikj@kem.zcu.cz,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,467,476,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300048,0

The Balassa-Samuelson model based on frictionless goods markets predicts that a rise in the sectoral productivity ratio by 1% raises the relative price by 1% while government spending changes leave the relative price unaffected. Using panel cointegration and unit root tests applied to a panel of fifteen OECD economies, our empirical evidence does not support these implications. We find that a rise in relative productivity by 1% raises the relative price of nontradables by only 0.70% and that an increase in government spending by 1% of GDP drives up the relative price by around 1%.. This paper shows that these items of evidence can be successfully explained by a two-sector open economy model in which variations in the composition of demand for nontradables give rise to endogenous changes in the markups.","[Restout, Romain] Univ Lorraine, BETA, Lorraine, France; [Restout, Romain] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium",Universite de Lorraine; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Restout, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, BETA, Lorraine, France.",romain.restout@univ-lorraine.fr,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,9,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

We consider progressive capital income tax schedules taking a simple two-bracket form with an exemption bracket at the bottom and a single marginal tax rate above a time varying exemption threshold. Individuals are taxed until their wealth is reduced down to the exemption threshold. The fraction of individuals subject to capital income taxation vanishes to zero in the long-run in analogy to the zero long-run capital tax result of Chamley and Judd with optimal linear taxes. However, in contrast to linear taxation, optimal nonlinear capital taxation can have a drastic impact on the long-run wealth distribution. When the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is not too large and the top tail of the initial wealth distribution is infinite and thick enough, the optimal exemption threshold converges to a finite limit. As a result, the optimal tax system drives all the large fortunes down a finite level and produces a truncated long-run wealth distribution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, this definition is valid only if the catching-up process between the two countries is already over. If we take into account catching-up dynamics, then poorest countries should obtain a faster growth than developed countries. Thus, income gaps should integrate decreasing time trends. We formalise this hypothesis theoretically using a stochastic neoclassical growth model with heterogeneous technology. We then apply this model to the issue of per-capita GDP catching-up of eight MENA countries towards the level of income in Europe. We approximate the nonlinear deterministic trend by a linear function with breaks and apply panel unit root tests with breaks. The analysis reveals firstly that the periods of divergence outnumber the periods of convergence. Secondly, since the year 2000 all countries but Syria have been converging toward the European per-capita income level. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The Stochastic Production Frontier (SPF) and the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) based on Malmquist Productivity Indices (MPI) have been used to test the spillovers effects of FDI on technical efficiency. The empirical results from the SPF show that foreign firms are more efficient than domestic competitors, and the presence of the former increases the inefficiency of the latter.

We provide evidence that foreign expansion in China decreases worker employment security at parent companies, particularly for low-skilled workers. Employment adjustments through employer-to-employer transitions are found to be highly associated with wage losses, with the strongest wage effects for low-skilled workers who shift employment between industries.

Interest rates have a negative influence on the future gold prices and a positive influence on the future crude oil prices. In the long run, a relationship exists whereby interest rates influence the US dollar, which in turn influences international crude oil prices. When the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) lowers interest rates to boost the economy, market expectations for oil demand change and, as a result, crude oil prices fluctuate. In addition, there is a price transmission relationship from interest rates to gold prices. A reduction in interest rates influences investor expectations with respect to depreciation of the dollar. Investors then move their capital to the gold market for capital preservation or speculation. Finally, international gold and crude oil prices have feedback effects on interest rates. This paper infers that crude oil prices increasing to a certain level trigger inflation, at which juncture the Fed may tighten monetary policies to downturn the bloom economy. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Baseline scenarios prepared by participating teams in the Asia Modeling Exercise are used to generate a comprehensive assessment of the key drivers of CO2 emissions for the next several decades, especially for China and India. We find a very wide range of projected emissions paths across the models and identify per capita income and energy intensity as the two major factors responsible for the variation. While the range of assumptions for growth in the former is roughly consistent with historical experience in other Asian economies, models foresee faster reductions in the latter with respect to those observed in neighboring countries at similar stages of economic development. On the other hand, there is a considerable agreement on the evolution of the energy technology mix, which is assumed to continue to be dominated by fossil fuels in the foreseeable future.

New legislation on property, specifically housing, was adopted in the 1990s. These legislative texts institute private property, joint tenancy, easements and other institutions of private law, but they are open to interpretation. This legislation has gradually become consistent through a usage that depends on older practices related to housing. The Russian experience during the last decade of the 20th century illustrates how the new legislation has become the law of the land by moving beyond the context of its initial proclamation into the field of application, where facts and literal rules, together, are put to the test of reality. Vanished Soviet institutions, such as building superintendents, have been used to alleviate the impact both of the failure of current reforms and of the absence of structures capable of guaranteeing the collective dimension of privatized buildings. Since 2000, local authorities in Moscow have, for financial reasons, pushed toward privatizaing collective real estate and establishing joint tenancy; but they have difficulty giving up housing policy in dealings with the city's inhabitants. This article focuses on changes during the period from the start of privatization till the adoption of the new housing code.","Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France",Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV),"Chaigneau, A (通讯作者)，Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France.",aurorechaigneau@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,6,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

This paper develops a positive model of the respective roles of state and Federal governments that can rationalize this observation. Redistribution by states creates positive horizontal fiscal externalities to other states due to migration, but negative vertical fiscal externalities to the national government due to changes in reported taxable income. We forecast that states will engage in at least some redistribution, though to a lesser degree the greater are mobility relative to taxable income elasticities. The Federal government can then choose the degree of Federal redistribution to assure that the net externalities are zero. Given such policies, we then estimate the welfare weights and migration elasticities for different income groups that would generate the effective net tax schedules observed in the U.S. The parameter estimates are broadly plausible, suggesting that the model can help explain the division of responsibilities for redistribution between state and Federal governments.

Using quarterly data on manufacturing inflation from 1982 to 2007, we find that the real money gap is a significant predictor of inflation in India. Our results show that this variable is a better predictor of future inflation at quarterly horizon than the deviation of broad money growth from its target for the whole sample period. We also document a break in the overall predictability of inflation in the last quarter of 1995.

It discusses the effects on energy supply mix, local pollutant emissions, energy security and energy system costs of CO2 emission reduction targets in the country by using an energy system model based on the MARKAL framework. The study considers three cases of CO2 emission reduction targets and analyzes their benefits during the study period as compared to the reference scenario. The first two cases consist of a 20% cutback (Scenario ERT20) and 40% cutback (Scenario ERT40) (of CO2 emission in the reference scenario). The third case considers a 40% cutback of CO2 emission with the share of electric mass transport (EMT) in the land transport service demand increased to 30% (as compared to 20% in the reference scenario). The study shows that an implementation of Scenario ERT40 would increase the cumulative electricity generation (mainly from hydropower) by 16.5% (794 TWh), reduce the cumulative consumption of imported fuels by 42% (24,400 PJ) and increase the total energy system cost by 1.6% during 2005 to 2100 as compared to the reference scenario. Besides, there would be a reduction in the emission of local pollutants and generation of additional employment in the country. With the share of EMT increased to 30%, there would be a further reduction in local pollutant emissions, an improvement in energy security and a decrease in the energy system cost compared to that in Scenario ERT40.

It develops a neo-Schumpeterian growth model predicting that the impact of liberalization on economic performance is positive on average, but more advanced firms benefit more. These predictions are tested using Mexican plant-level data confirming that, under NAFTA, the liberalization spurred productivity growth on average. However, the empirical analysis goes beyond estimating the average effect of liberalization and shows that more advanced firms benefited disproportionately more from the liberalization. Focusing on the mechanisms explaining these results, the paper shows that the results are not just driven by an increase in input usage and investments, but rather by innovative and managerial efforts as they are significantly stronger in those sectors where the scope for innovative activities is larger.

Based on a simple model where three asymmetric countries compete for FDI inflows, we demonstrate that PTA formation provides a strategic advantage to a small member country of PTA in competing for FDI inflows not only with respect to a non-member country but with a large member country when the integrated market size is large enough. In addition, it is shown that it might be an out-of-equilibrium path strategy for a non-member small economy to exert efforts to induce FDI inflows, because the excessive subsidies to induce FDI inflows might outweigh the gains from the FDI inflows due to strategic disadvantage in tax competition after PTA formation. These findings explain why small economies are mainly driven by the expected economic benefits including FDI inflows from joining PTA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The youth share and business cycle fluctuations were high during the 1970s. Then, as the population aged, output volatility declined. I develop an overlapping generations model featuring search frictions and productivity shocks, in which the age distribution affects cyclical volatility through two channels. First, employment for younger workers fluctuates more, creating a composition effect. Second, inexperienced workers produce less, so firms decide how many jobs to create based on the age distribution. Both this endogenous response by firms and the composition effect increase aggregate volatility when the youth share is high. The model can replicate a large portion of the Great Moderation in GDP volatility, suggesting an important role for demographics.

The analysis shows that discounting results in life-cycle costs decreasing as recycling is delayed. However the costs to store spent fuel closely counter the effect of discounting when an intergenerational discount rate is used. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Recktenwald, G.

This prospect arises because of differences between theoretical and empirical representations of firm productivity. Instead of marginal productivity, we examine in both models the theoretical equivalent of empirically observable productivity (value-added per employee). Given the presence of fixed export costs or heterogeneous mark-ups and trade costs, the observable productivity of exporters in proximity to the export-indifferent firm turns out to be lower than that of non-exporters; that is, the productivity distributions overlap. The paper reviews empirical literature that reports non-positive exporter productivity premia in firm-level data and discusses implications for empirical research on exporter performance, including learning and the role of non-parametric regressions (stochastic dominance, quantile regressions), fixed costs, and productivity distributions.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS; TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; ENERGY; MODELS; SYSTEM; COMPETITIVENESS,"This study proposes a new use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment, paying attention to a methodological bias (i.e., different methods produce different results). DEA is analytically classified into radial and non-radial approaches. The radial approach determines the level of unified (operational and environmental) efficiency by measuring an inefficiency score. The score indicates the distance of a projection from an observed performance to an efficiency frontier. In contrast, the non-radial approach determines the level of unified efficiency by measuring a total amount of slacks because each slack indicates inefficiency. To avoid the methodological bias, this study considers the use of radial and non-radial approaches. In this study, we consider a production process where all organizations produce not only desirable (good) but also undesirable (bad) outputs as a result of their business operations. To unify the two types of outputs, this study discusses the concept of disposability, which is separated into natural and managerial disposability. The natural disposability indicates negative adaptation to a regulation change on undesirable outputs. In contrast, the managerial disposability indicates corporate strategy by which a firm considers the regulation change as a new business opportunity. A firm attempts to improve its unified efficiency by utilizing new environmental technology and/or new management. This type of strategy indicates positive adaptation to the regulation change. Under the two disposability concepts, this study discusses how to measure RTS (Returns to Scale) under natural disposability and DTS (Damages to Scale: corresponding to RTS on undesirable outputs) under managerial disposability. The two scale measures are analytically discussed by the proposed radial and non-radial approaches with SCSCs or without SCSCs, where SCSCs indicate strong complementary slackness conditions. An illustrative example on U.S. fossil fuel power plants indicates a policy implication that they need to introduce new technology for environmental protection. This study also discusses a necessity of examining a methodological bias in energy studies. Empirical findings identified in this study document the practicality of the proposed approaches to measure RTS/DTS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A reform increased women's normal retirement age (NRA) in two steps from age 62 to age 63 first and then to age 64. At the same time retirement at the previous NRA became possible at a benefit discount. Since the reform affected specific birth cohorts we can identify causal effects. We find strong and robust behavioral effects of changes in financial retirement incentives. A permanent reduction of retirement benefits by 3.4% induces a decline in the age-specific annual retirement probability by over 50%. The response to changes in financial retirement benefits varies with educational background: those with low education respond most strongly to an increase in the price of leisure.

This paper shows that the lack of empirical evidence is consistent with theory if countries are in transition to FDI openness. Anticipated welfare gains lead to temporary declines in domestic investment and employment. Also, growth measures miss some intangible FDI, which is expensed from company profits. The reconciliation of theory and evidence is accomplished with a multicountry dynamic general equilibrium model parameterized with data from a sample of 104 countries during 1980-2005. Although no systematic benefits of FDI openness are found, the model demonstrates that the eventual gains in growth and welfare can be huge, especially for small countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Firstly, it is more convenient for transactors and, secondly, it limits the production costs of denominations incurred by the central bank. Exploiting production cost data for the U.S. currency system in 2010, we show using simulations that efficient payments actually increase the annual production costs of the Federal Reserve by $156 million. As a consequence, we raise a larger issue for central banks which consists in issuing an efficient denominational mix that is more convenient for transactors and that reduces the production costs of denominations.

These limitations are all related to the underlying theories of institutional change in which power- and legitimacy-based explanations are confusedly combined. Both authors develop a normative perspective in which legitimacy becomes the main concern. We argue that this perspective leads to contradictions in their respective approaches, and provides no or only partial insights into the conditions of the emergence and regulation of environmental conflicts. We finally highlight the conceptual adjustments (inspired from classical Marxism and regulation theory) that, in our view, are needed to deal more adequately with these issues.","[Douai, Ali] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Montalban, Matthieu] Univ Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite de Bordeaux,"Douai, A (通讯作者)，CNRS, UMR 7321, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein,Bat 2, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",ali.douai@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,,,,,,45,9,9,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The viability approach makes it possible to characterize all the economic trajectories sustaining a given, not necessarily maximal, utility level. In this paper, we exhibit the strong links between maximin and viability: we show that the value function of the maximin problem can be obtained in the viability framework, and that the maximin path is a particular viable path. This result allows us to extend the recommendations of the maximin approach beyond optimality, to characterize the sustainability of economic trajectories which differ from the maximin path. Attention is especially paid to non-negative net investment at maximin accounting prices, which is shown to be necessary to maintain the productive capacity of the economy, whether the development path is optimal or not.

Neither the agent's effort nor the realizations of his signals is observable. First, we assume that the agent has no private information at the time of contracting. Under the optimal mechanism, the agent is rewarded only when his messages are consistent with the state. The payments that the agent receives when he correctly announces the good state increase over time. We then characterize the optimal mechanisms when the agent has superior information about the state at the outset of the relationship. The principal prefers to offer different contracts if and only if the agent types are sufficiently diverse.

Using a comprehensive linked employer-employee database from Brazil for the universe of formal firms during the period 1995-2001, we are able to identify an employee spinoff either when the director/manager moved from a parent in the same industry or when one-quarter of the employees shifted from a common parent. Depending on definition, employee spinoffs account for between one-sixth and one-third of the new firms in Brazil's private sector during this period. Regardless of definition, size at entry is larger for employee spinoffs than for new firms without parents but smaller than for diversification ventures of existing firms. Similarly, survival rates for employee spinoffs are higher than for new firms without parents and comparable to those for diversification ventures of existing firms. These results suggest that we can think of some part of a firm's productivity and riskiness as embodied in the firm's employees and portable. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

By the middle of 2011, reserves had reached $1.6 trillion, more than 10 percent of US GDP, an order of magnitude for commercial bank cash holdings that is without precedent. The key factor allowing banks to accumulate huge cash hoards was that the Federal Reserve had pushed the federal funds rate to near zero by the end of 2008, and held it there through 2011 and beyond. Over this same period, the non-corporate business sector obtained zero net credit. This overall pattern represents the most recent variant of reaching a 'liquidity trap' and trying to 'push on a string.' Under such circumstances, conventional central bank open-market operations are greatly weakened as an expansionary policy tool. This paper examines the experience of the liquidity trap in the United States since the Great Recession began and considers policy approaches for escaping the trap. I provide a critical review of various proposals for escaping liquidity traps, including raising the inflation target, depreciating the currency, and targeting long-term interest rates directly. I also propose two key innovative policies, an excess reserve tax for commercial banks and a major expansion in the federal loan guarantee program for smaller businesses.","[Pollin, Robert] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pollin, Robert] Univ Massachusetts, Polit Econ Res Inst PERI, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Pollin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",pollin@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,25,7,7,0,8,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

It also investigates the own- and cross-market impacts for the lagged grain trading volume and the open interest in the energy and grain markets. According to the results, the conventional view, for which the impacts are from oil to gasoline to ethanol to grains in the energy-grain nexus, does not hold well in the long run because the oil price is influenced by gasoline, soybeans and oil. Moreover, gasoline is preceded by only the oil price, and ethanol is not foreshadowed by any of the prices. However, in the short run, a two-way feedback in both directions exists in all markets. The grain trading volume effect across oil and gasoline is more pronounced in the short-run than in the long-run, satisfying both the overconfidence/disposition and the new information hypotheses across markets. The results for the ethanol open interest show that money flows out of this market in both the short- and long-run, but no results suggest across market inflows or outflows to the other grain markets.

AM is precisely defined and distinguished from Rational Choice Marxism (RCM). The different substantive implications of the two approaches are discussed: according to RCM, the role of Marxism in the social sciences is exhausted, whereas AM has reconstructed a set of propositions that aim to provide the foundations of a distinctive approach in social theory. The methodological debate around and within AM is analysed and the shortcomings of methodological individualism and rational choice theory are stressed, raising doubts on the claim that RCM is the only scientific approach to Marx's theory. Yet, wholesale rejections on a priori methodological or exegetical grounds are questioned. A focused, immanent critique of RCM is developed, which emphasizes the lack of an adequate analysis of structural constraints and endogenous preferences in RCM models. It is argued that the analysis of endogenous preferences and structural constraints is consistent with an anti-reductionist AM approach and it may provide the outline of a fertile, distinctive research programme in explanatory social theory that builds on the core of Marxism identified by AM.","Queen Mary Univ London, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Veneziani, R (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, London, England.",,,,,,,,149,9,10,31,122,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

Previous studies have discussed the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. but little attention has been paid to the existence of a nonlinear relationship between these two variables. We argue that there exists a threshold effect between the two variables: different levels of economic growth bear different impacts on oil CO2 emissions. Our empirical results do not support the EKC hypothesis. Additionally, the results of short-term analyses of static and dynamic panel threshold estimations suggest the efficacy of a double-threshold (three-regime) model. In the low economic growth regime, economic growth negatively affects oil CO2 emissions growth; in the medium economic growth regime, however, economic growth positively impacts oil CO2 emissions growth; and in the high economic growth regime, the impact of economic growth is insignificant.

Using regional data from the EU-15 countries over 21 years, we find that this is the case. We further investigate whether the abolishment of border checks through the Schengen agreement or the introduction of the Euro improved our measure of labor market integration across borders, and do not find evidence in favor. Last, we investigate the role of languages, and potentially cultures, as obstacles to labor market integration. We find that indeed language borders play a larger role than country borders in explaining the lack of labor market integration across borders. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Senders - the first-movers - can keep an endowment of SEK 30, or give fractions or all to an unknown receiver. Donations are multiplied by five before reaching receivers, who may, or may not, send back part or the entire received amount. Half of the receivers are given information that the sender has the opportunity to exact revenge, while the remaining are not given this information. Results differ from Fehr and Gachter (2000), in the sense that the share of endowments sent in the first stage is around two thirds, compared to less than one third in Fehr and Gachter. Furthermore, they find a very strong effect of punishment while we find almost no effect. An efficiency frontier is defined and results show that that only 25% of the outcomes reach this frontier due to lack of trust. If senders were confident that receivers would return at least 20% of the donated amount, it is optimal to donate the whole endowment. Only about one-fifth returned of the receivers returned less than this, so for the most part the lack of trust is unwarranted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, a worker may comply with the terms of a relational contract that demands high effort even when performance is not enforceable by a third party. But can relational contracts motivate high effort when workers can easily find alternative jobs? We examine how competition for labor affects the emergence of relational contracts and their effectiveness in overcoming moral hazard in the labor market. We show that effective relational contracts do emerge in a market with excess demand for labor. Long-term relationships turn out to be less frequent when there is excess demand for labor than they are in a market characterized by exogenous unemployment. However, stronger competition for labor does not impair labor market efficiency: higher wages induced by competition lead to higher effort out of concerns for reciprocity.","[Brown, Martin] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Falk, Armin] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Fehr, Ernst] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of St Gallen; University of Bonn; University of Zurich,"Brown, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.",martin.brown@unisg.ch; armin.falk@uni-bonn.de; ernst.fehr@econ.uzh.ch,,,,,,,36,25,26,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

This study builds on previous research that distinguishes an influencer effect of reviews from a predictor effect. By empirically separating consumers' and reviewers' perceptions of movie quality through an auxiliary regression approach (and thus effectively controls for consumers' quality perceptions), this study advances the discussion by investigating whether and how isolated reviewer quality perceptions are associated with box office results. The authors empirically test a non-linear effect of reviewers' quality perceptions on box office returns, including a comprehensive investigation of the moderating forces of this relationship, using regression and simple slope analyses. Data from all 1,370 narrative films released in the United States between 1998 and 2006 reveal that though the short-term box office generally is not influenced by isolated reviewer quality perceptions, a non-linear relationship exists between reviews and long-term box office returns, such that films rated highly by reviewers are more strongly influenced than those that are not. In terms of moderators, the authors find evidence for several arthouse and mainstream characteristics to moderate the relationship between isolated reviewer quality perceptions and box office results.","[Hennig-Thurau, Thorsten; Marchand, Andre; Hiller, Barbara] Univ Munster, Mkt Ctr Muenster, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Hennig-Thurau, Thorsten] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Fac Management, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",University of Munster; City University London,"Hennig-Thurau, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Mkt Ctr Muenster, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",thorsten@hennig-thurau.de; mail@andre-marchand.de; bamahi@web.de,"Marchand, Andre/GQP-4419-2022","Marchand, Andre/0000-0002-2531-9881",,,,,59,35,38,1,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Using nationally representative micro data on household consumption expenditures, we find that disadvantaged caste groups such as Other Backward Castes spend 8 percent more on visible consumption than Brahmin and High Caste groups while social groups such as Muslims spend 14 percent less, after controlling for differences in permanent income, household assets and household demographic composition. The differences across social groups are significant and robust and these differences persist within different sub populations. We find that the higher spending of OBC households on visible consumption is diverted from education spending, while Muslim households divert spending from visible consumption and education towards greater food spending. Additionally, we find that these consumption patterns can be partly explained as a result of the status signaling nature of the consumption items.

J,"Passarella, M",,,,"Passarella, Marco",,,A simplified stock-flow consistent dynamic model of the systemic financial fragility in the 'New Capitalism',JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financial instability; Stock-flow consistency; Capital-asset inflation,MINSKY; GROWTH,"In the last few years, many financial analysts and heterodox economists (but even some 'dissenters' among orthodox economists) have referred to the contribution of Hyman P. Minsky as a fundamental reading for understanding the current crisis. However, it is well known that the traditional formulation of Minsky's 'financial instability hypothesis' raises a number of theoretical issues. Furthermore, Minsky's analysis of capitalism must be updated on the basis of the deep changes which, during the last three decades, have concerned the world economy. In order to address these theoretical and empirical issues, the paper, first, introduces the reader to the 'mechanics' of the financial instability theory, according to the formulation of the traditional Minskian literature (Section 2). Second, it shows that Minsky's theory, in this formulation, cannot be regarded as a general theory of the business cycle (Section 3). Third, the paper attempts to supply a consistent, although simplified, updating of Minsky's theory by cross-breeding it with inputs coming from the 'New Cambridge' theories and the current 'formal Minskian literature'. The aim of this is to analyse the impact of both capital-asset inflation and consumer credit on the financial 'soundness' of the business sector (Sections 4-7). Some concluding remarks are provided in the last part of the paper (Section 8). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While the overall standard of living has improved, economic growth has also resulted in an increase in income inequality. Rising income inequality can increase social tensions that can impede further economic growth. By making use of firm level panel data, this paper focuses on the impact of increased market competition and trade liberalisation on skilled-unskilled wage inequality in China's manufacturing sector. A theoretical model is used to argue that trade liberalisation and market competition can affect skilled-unskilled wage inequality. Based on this result, an econometric model is specified. The empirical analysis presented in this paper shows that increased trade liberalisation has contributed to an increase in skilled-unskilled wage inequality in China's manufacturing sector.

The self-selection problem is solved by keeping track of the distribution of migration incentives over time. This econometric treatment has important consequences for the estimation of structural parameters such as migration costs. For US interstate migration, we obtain a cost estimate of roughly two-thirds of an average annual household income. We also show that the treatment of income persistence has important consequences for comparative statics of the model as well as microeconomic age patterns of migration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We find that magnitudes of both the long-term changes in the terms of trade and the responses of income growth rates vary considerably across these three countries. We then develop a model that links a change in the terms of trade to a change in income through the degree of sectoral reallocation of labor. Using this model, we analyze whether specific fiscal and trade policy responses cushion or amplify the impact of terms of trade on income. In a calibrated version of the model, we demonstrate that the degree with which an economy reallocates its labor across sectors is not necessarily a good indicator of its vulnerability to changes in its terms of trade.","Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Iscan, TB (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada.",Talan.Iscan@Dal.Ca,"Iscan, Talan B/HSG-2878-2023","Iscan, Talan B/0000-0003-0600-2026",,,,,18,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

On this basis we estimate a dynamic system of macro-labour equations to evaluate the slope of the PC and explain the evolution of inflation and unemployment in the USA from 1970 to 2006. Because our empirical methodology relies heavily on impulse response functions, it represents a synthesis of the traditional structural modelling and (structural) vector autoregressions. We find that the PC is downward-sloping with a slope of -3.58 in the long run. Furthermore, during the stagflating 1970s, the productivity slowdown contributed substantially to the increases in both unemployment and inflation, whereas the monetary expansion was quite ineffective and led mainly to higher inflation. Finally, the monetary expansion and productivity speedup of the roaring 1990s were both responsible for the significant lowering of the unemployment rate.","[Karanassou, Marika; Sala, Hector] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England; [Karanassou, Marika] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Sala, Hector] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Sala, Hector] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Karanassou, M (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",M.Karanassou@qmul.ac.uk,"Sala, Hector/K-6370-2017","Sala, Hector/0000-0002-3043-2790",,,,,49,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Traditional growth theory assumes population growth to be exponential, but this is not a realistic assumption (see Brida and Accinelli, 2007). We model exogenous population change by a generic function of population size. We show that a unique non-trivial equilibrium exists and the economy converges towards it along a saddle path, independently of population dynamics. What is affected by the type of population dynamics is the dimension of the stable manifold, which can be one or two, and when the equilibrium is reached, which can happen in finite time or asymptotically. Moreover, we show that the choice of the utilitarian criterion will be irrelevant on the equilibrium of the model, if the steady state growth rate of population is null, as in the case of logistic population growth. Then, we show that a closed-form solution for the transitional dynamics of the economy (both in the case population dynamics is deterministic and stochastic) can be found for a certain parameter restriction.

I augment those models with the importance of interacting with customers and communicating complex information within firms and use these characteristics to predict the location of production. Goods and services requiring direct communication with consumers are more likely to be produced in the destination market. Activities requiring complex within firm communication are more likely to occur at the multinational's headquarters for export, especially when the destination market has weak institutions.

However, countries that restrict their coal consumption will likely expand their coal exports to foreign markets with fewer restrictions on consumption. The adjustment in international trade will mitigate the impact on coal industry employment but will also reverse some of the reduction in global emissions. This paper quantifies the impact of restrictions on coal consumption in the United States and several other large countries on global coal consumption, trade, and industry employment. The impact calculations are based on an econometric model of the international coal market. The parameters of the model are fitted to panel data on coal consumption and production in 53 countries.

We present a dynamic programming model to determine the optimal stockpiling and drawdown strategies for China's SPR under various scenarios, focusing on minimizing the total cost of reserves. In contrast to previous research, the oil price given in our model is exogenous on a monthly instead of annual basis, with a view to more realistic simulation of optimal strategies each year. Our model results show that in the case where stockpiling affects oil prices, a given SPR size will be achieved earlier than when stockpiling does not affect oil prices. In different emergency conditions, the optimal stockpiling and drawdown strategies of China's SPR are very different. When an emergency occurs, the shock of stockpiling on the oil price per barrel could range $0.49-$6.35, while the impact of drawdown on the oil price per barrel could range -$6.22 to -$0.48.

The validity of the separation proposition is shown to depend crucially on whether or not the availability of off-farm job opportunities is limited.

It explains how the money market rate is transmitted to the retail interest rates both in the long run and short run, and tests the symmetric and asymmetric interest rate pass-through using the error-correction model (ECM) and the adjusted ECM-exponential generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ECM-EGARCH) (1,1)-M methodology. This permitted the examination of the impact of interest rate volatility, along with the leverage effect. An incomplete pass-through is found in the short run. From the entire sample period, a symmetric adjustment is found in the deposit rate, which had upward rigidity adjustment, while an asymmetric adjustment is found in the lending rate, with a downward rigidity adjustment. All the adjustments supported the collusive pricing arrangements.

In 2008 Russia introduced a development strategy to limit its dependence on natural resources. However, the government relied heavily on this income for the planned modernization programme. The falling price of oil in 20089 led to a tightened government budget constraint. This situation induced Russia towards wider use of more traditional instruments of trade policy (such as tariff policy) as well as an import substitution strategy, the creation of the Customs Union, and a pause in the WTO accession process. Russia has been found by the Global Trade Alert (GTA) initiative to be one of the main users of protectionist policies since November 2008.

A survey of the voluminous literature on decentralization suggests that the question of the links between decentralization and macroeconomic stability has been relatively scantily analyzed. Even though there is still a lot of room for analysis as far as the effects of decentralization on other aspects of the economy are concerned, we believe that it is in this area that a more thorough analyses are mostly called for. Through this paper, we will try to shed more light on the issue notably by looking at other dimension of macroeconomic stability than the ones usually employed in previous studies as well as by examining other factors that might accentuate or diminish the effects of decentralization on macroeconomic stability. Our results found that decentralization appears to lead to a decrease in inflation rate. However, we do not find any correlation between decentralization with the level of fiscal deficit. Our results also show that the impact of decentralization on inflation is conditional on the level of perceived corruption and political institutions.","[Jalil, Ahmed Zafarullah Abdul; Harun, Mukaramah; Mat, Siti Hadijah Che] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Sintok 06010, Kedah, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Jalil, AZA (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Sintok 06010, Kedah, Malaysia.",zafar@uum.edu.my,"harun, mukaramah/AAZ-3583-2021","harun, mukaramah/0000-0003-1625-7719",,,,,23,4,4,1,14,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The inverse relation is most obvious in housing where inventories build in low-demand markets and shrink in high-demand markets. This is a puzzle. Symmetry of information among buyers and sellers would seem to imply that sellers would change their reservation value by the amount that buyers change their offers. Because there is heterogeneity among buyers in the valuation of a given house, sellers set prices strategically. When demand falls, sellers rationally lower their prices, but not by enough to keep the probability of sale constant. As a result, inventories grow.","[Lazear, Edward P.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lazear, Edward P.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Lazear, EP (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, 518 Mem Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lazear@stanford.edu,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,6,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The conventional univariate and panel unit root tests indicate that the hysteresis hypothesis cannot be rejected for most of the regions in Australia. To further confirm if the hysteresis finding in unemployment and labour force participation results from not considering structural breaks. We employ a panel stationarity test recently developed by Carrion-i-Silvestre . (2005), which considers multiple structural breaks and cross-sectional dependence. The test results lend support for unemployment hysteresis and participation regime-wise stationarity. Accordingly, the findings imply that a temporary shock may have permanent effects on the unemployment rate but not on labour force participation in Australia and thus call for policies aimed at improving the adjustment mechanism in unemployment.","[Liu, De-Chih; Lin, Pei-Chien] Tamkang Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Sun, Chin-Hwa] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",Tamkang University; National Taiwan Ocean University,"Liu, DC (通讯作者)，151 Ying Chuan Rd Tamsui, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan.",steveliu@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,50,4,4,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Demand-reducing sabotage limits the return the rival anticipates from its cost management activities, and thereby inhibits those activities. The resulting higher costs for the rival increase the VIP's profit in settings where sabotage would not be profitable if the rival could not manage its operating costs. To limit sabotage by the VIP, the rival may find it profitable to intentionally diminish its ability to reduce its production costs.

Just like overly optimistic financial markets, the persistence of inaccurate scientific paradigms and cultural beliefs can also generate financial crises. For example, the debt toward nature that our capitalist culture continues to obscure is likely to be a case of Ponzi finance.

However, the empirical basis of this research relies to a large extent on experiments that do not provide anonymity between experimenter and subject. It has been argued that this lack of experimenter-subject anonymity may create selfish incentives to engage in seemingly other-regarding behavior. If this were the case, these experiments would overestimate the importance of social preferences. Previous studies provide mixed results and methodological differences within and across studies make it difficult to isolate the impact of experimenter-subject anonymity. In this paper we use a novel procedure that allows us to examine the impact of the exact same ceteris-paribus variation in anonymity on behavior in three of the most commonly used games in the social preference literature. We find that the introduction of experimenter-subject anonymity has no significant effect in any of the three games. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These variations occur both across countries and also over time within countries, with little current understanding of the implications of such changes for spatially and temporally consistent measurement of household consumption and poverty. A field experiment in Tanzania tests eight alternative methods of measuring household consumption, finding significant differences between consumption reported by the benchmark personal diary and other diary and recall formats. Under-reporting is particularly apparent for illiterate households and for urban respondents completing household diaries; recall modules measure lower consumption than a personal diary, with larger gaps among poorer households and for households with more adult members. Variations in reporting accuracy by household characteristics are also discussed and differences in measured poverty as a result of survey design are explored. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

By focusing on the choices of a benevolent social planner we find that, if the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption is sufficiently high, the ratio of consumption to private physical capital converges towards zero when time goes to infinity. Depending on the form of the underlying aggregate production function and on whether, for given production function, technological progress equals zero or a positive constant, our model may or may not yield an asymptotically balanced growth path (ABGP) equilibrium. When there is no exogenous technological progress, an equilibrium where population size, the ratio of government spending to aggregate income and the ratio of consumption to private physical capital are all constant does exist and the equilibrium is a saddle point. In case of positive technological progress numerical simulations show that the model still exhibits an ABGP equilibrium. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that PAPI data contain a large number of errors, which can be avoided in CAPI. Error counts are not randomly distributed across the sample, but are correlated with household characteristics, potentially introducing sample bias if dubious observations need to be dropped. We demonstrate a tendency for the spread of total measured consumption to be higher on paper compared to CAPI, translating into significantly higher measured inequality. Investigating further the nature of PAPI's measurement error for consumption, we fail to reject the hypothesis that it is classical: it attenuates the coefficient on consumption when used as explanatory variable and we find no evidence of bias when consumption is used as dependent variable. Finally, CAPI and PAPI are compared in terms of interview length, costs and respondents' perceptions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Much debate exists on whether this relationship is causal arising from either wealth effects or via borrowing constraints. This paper uses a unique survey question on consumer responses to house price falls to explain the relationship between house price movements and consumer spending among households in the United Kingdom. 30% of households report they would cut back consumption as a direct response to house price falls. Households who reported they were borrowing constrained were much more likely to report they would cut consumption. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the economic modelling using Fiji's Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2002/03 dataset to examine the economic and social factors crucial for poverty reduction. Two hypotheses are tested: first, we estimate the monetary effects of education at the aggregate and disaggregated returns to education (primary, secondary, tertiary levels) and by income quartiles, and second, test the non-monetary education and health factors as channels of impact promulgated as effects against poverty prevalence. The monetary results indicate that all income quartile households (i.e. lowest to highest) benefit from additional skills obtained through formal education. While those at the lowest income quartile in particular benefit the most from formal education, however it cannot sustainably prevent people with only primary education from falling into poverty. The results for non-monetary models show that education has a positive and significant influence on the tendency of the people to engage in health prevention activities and in acquiring good housing facilities.

Evidence can either take the form of hard information or, more generally, have differential but nonprohibitive costs in different states. In such environments, social choice functions that are not Maskin-monotonic can be implemented. We formulate a more general property, evidence monotonicity, and show that this is a necessary condition for implementation. Evidence monotonicity is also sufficient for implementation in economic environments. In some settings, such as when agents have small preferences for honesty, any social choice function is evidence-monotonic. Additional characterizations are obtained for hard evidence.

It is found that aspiration income is a positive function of actual income and reference income, and that subjective well-being is raised by actual income but lowered by aspiration income.

Inventory holdings are motivated as a means to generate sales for demand-constrained firms. We derive various representations of the New Keynesian Phillips curve with inventories and show that one of these specifications is observationally equivalent to the standard model with respect to the behavior of inflation when the model's cross-equation restrictions are imposed. However, the driving variable in the New Keynesian Phillips curve - real marginal cost - is unobservable and has to be proxied by, for instance, real unit labor cost. An alternative approach is to impute marginal cost by using the model's optimality conditions. We show that the stock-sales ratio is linked to marginal cost. We also estimate these various specifications of the New Keynesian Phillips curve using GMM. We find that the predictive power of the inventory-specification at best approaches that of the standard model, but does not improve upon it. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, the agents' non-additive beliefs about the economy's dividend payment process are modeled as neo-additive capacities so that the agents' decision behavior emphasizes the best, respectively worst, possible economic scenarios. In contrast to existing models of Lucas-type economies with ambiguity averse agents (Epstein and Wang, 1994), which ensure dynamic consistency through heavy restrictions on admissible ambiguity attitudes, my approach gives up dynamic consistency to the effect that quite general ambiguity attitudes become admissible. As the main formal result I establish the existence of a unique stationary equilibrium price function for this CEU Lucas economy. As the main economic insight I obtain that a representative agent who is rather preoccupied with the worst case scenario gives rise to a lower risk-free rate and a higher equity premium than predicted by the original expected utility Lucas economy. This difference is the greater the more surprising the economic information is that the agent receives. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In our analysis, we employ both metric (correlation dimension and Lyapunov exponents) and topological (recurrence plots) diagnostic tools for chaotic dynamics. We find that the underlying system for crude oil spot prices (i) is of high dimensionality (no stabilization of the correlation dimension), (ii) does not exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and (iii) is not characterized by the recurrence property. Thus, the empirical evidence suggests that stochastic rather than deterministic rules are present in the system dynamics of the crude oil spot market.

Two aspects of the Hungry Steppe project are examined: the discursive shift which enabled to reframe the steppe as arable land, and the changes in resettlement policies for populating the newly reclaimed areas. The paper concludes that despite the manifold criticism voiced towards the concept of high modernism, it proves nevertheless productive in explaining the big discursive shifts related to post-Stalinist large-scale Soviet irrigation schemes such as the Hungry Steppe project.

First, we find that the loss frame communicates the expectation that achieving the bonus is the default and that our subjects comply with this expectation.

Clearly, the firm's choice impacts upon social welfare in the host country. Therefore, the government of the host country is likely to set contract enforceability for inducing the multinational firm (MNF) to choose a desirable mode of entry. The paper takes into account two different cases. In the first case, the host country does not have an incumbent that can compete with the MNF, and in the second case, it has one incumbent that can compete. The paper shows that the government's choice of contract enforceability is crucially dependent upon the domestic market structure and the domestic capacity to absorb the advanced technology of the MNF.

We find the welfare maximising level of fiscal feedback to be small. We show for the first time a clear discontinuity in the behaviour of monetary policy and welfare either side of this optimal level. As fiscal feedback increases, optimal monetary policy becomes less active because fiscal feedback tends to deflate inflationary shocks. If fiscal feedback falls below some critical value, monetary policy becomes strongly passive and this leads to a sharp deterioration in welfare.","[Kirsanova, Tatiana] Univ Exeter, Sch Business & Econ, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England; Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Exeter; University of Oxford,"Kirsanova, T (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business & Econ, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",t.kirsanova@exeter.ac.uk,,"Kirsanova, Tatiana/0000-0002-1470-4311",ESRC [ES/G006873/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G006873/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,29,23,27,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

Regulations prohibit international diversification, and this paper aims to quantify the extent of the potential harms, if any, caused by this constraint. To improve the robustness of the findings, we use two distinct methodologies. These include traditional mean-variance analysis from modern portfolio theory, and Monte Carlo simulations bootstrapped from the historical data that estimate the distribution of wealth accumulated at retirement from the contributions of a hypothetical worker. Both methods produce qualitatively and quantitatively similar results: workers with risk aversion varying from aggressive to conservative will be better served by allowing international diversification. The results are particularly persuasive for the second approach. The EPF fund managers will likely behave fairly conservatively toward risk, which suggests that around half of the fund assets should be invested abroad.","[Pfau, Wade] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Pfau, W (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",wpfau@grips.ac.jp,"Kumara, Ajantha Sisira/AAA-9987-2021","Sisira Kumara, Ajantha/0000-0001-5077-4248",,,,,20,0,1,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

The Structural Vector Autoregression (VAR) method is employed to assess the nature of macroeconomic disturbances among the East Asian countries, as a preliminary guide in identifying potential candidates for forming an Optimum Currency Area (OCA). In comparison with European countries, East Asia has less symmetric underlying structural shocks but the speed of adjustment to shocks is much faster. The empirical results suggest that there exists a scope among some small sub-regions, comprising mainly of ASEAN countries, for potential monetary integration. The finding of an increased symmetry of shocks among countries after the Asian Financial crisis indicates that the regional policy-coordinating effort after the crisis has put the region on the right track if monetary union is a desired goal.

We will call these tail events in the sense that they are way out of the tail of a probability distribution. I consider the question of the implications of tail events for economic policy and climate-change economics. This issue has been analyzed by Martin Weitzman who proposed a Dismal Theorem. The general idea is that, under limited conditions concerning the structure of uncertainty and risk aversion, society has an indefinitely large expected loss from high-consequence, low-probability events. Under such conditions, standard economic tools such as cost-benefit analysis cannot be applied. The present study is intended to put the Dismal Theorem in context and examine the range of its relevance, with an application to catastrophic climate change. I conclude that tail events are sometimes of extreme importance, and we must be extremely careful to include them in situations of deep uncertainty.

The paper shows that where a national currency is used as an international medium of exchange, the international money is non-neutral. In particular, an increase in the supply of the international money leads to a transfer of real resources to the international money-issuing country from its trading partner. It also induces an expansion of the nontradable sector in the international money-issuing country, and an expansion of the tradable sector in its trading partner. The real impact of a monetary shock is greater under a fixed exchange rate system than under a flexible exchange rate system.","[Cheng, Wenli] Monash Univ, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Zhang, Dingsheng] Wuhan Univ, IAS, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Dingsheng] Wuhan Univ, EMS, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Dingsheng] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China",Monash University; Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Cheng, WL (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Caulfield Campus, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",wenli.cheng@monash.edu; dingsheng.zhang@gmail.com,,"Cheng, Wenli/0000-0002-9788-8717",,,,,10,1,1,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Behind the conflict is the impatience axiom introduced by T. Koopmans to describe choices over time. The conflict is resolved here by introducing a new concept, sustainable markets. These differ from Arrow-Debreu markets in that traders have sustainable preferences and no bounds on short sales. Sustainable preferences are sensitive to the basic needs of the present without sacrificing the needs of future generations and embody the essence of sustainable development (Chichilnisky in Soc Choice Welf 13(2):231-257, 1996a; Res Energy Econ 73(4):467-491, 1996b). Theorems 1 and 2 show that limited arbitrage is a necessary and sufficient condition describing diversity and ensuring the existence of a sustainable market equilibrium where the invisible hand delivers sustainable as well as efficient solutions (Chichilnisky in Econ Theory 95:79-108, 1995; Chichilnisky and Heal in Econ Theory 12:163-176, 1998). In sustainable markets prices have a new role: they reflect both the value of instantaneous consumption and the value of the long-run future. The latter are connected to the independence of the axiom of choice at the foundations of mathematics (Godel 1940).","[Chichilnisky, Graciela] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Chichilnisky, Graciela] Columbia Univ, Dept Math Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Chichilnisky, Graciela] CCRM, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Chichilnisky, G (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 335 Riverside Dr, New York, NY 10027 USA.",chichilnisky@columbia.edu,,,,,,,30,3,4,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In this paper, using a World Bank data set of manufacturing firms in China, we find that poorer contracting institutions cause firms to be more vertically integrated.

The market of poetry is made of large-scale and reputed publishers and a wide range of smaller firms, which serve as testing grounds for new authors and innovation. How can the movement of an a priori narrow-appeal literary genre from small publishing houses to large-scale firms be explained? It is argued that if the status of firms is remarkably stable, artists may move from small publishers to large-scale ones. Statistical evidence is used to illustrate this passage, shedding a new light on the structure of cultural markets and the role of reputation in organizing commercial circuits.

We formulate a model of voting and participation behavior integrating instrumental and expressive motivations. The model is estimated using data drawn from a survey carried out after a vote in Switzerland in 2000 on a popular initiative proposing to implement immigration restrictions. The model enables us to recover estimates of participation costs and preferences towards immigration and analyze how these preferences are translated into actual voting outcomes. The results reveal a substantial gap (participation bias) between attitudes towards immigration in the general population (43% favorable to restrictions) and the outcome of the vote (26%).

Controversy has arisen about how to ensure that the markets clear on the basis of offers that have been determined to be competitive. Specifically, the issue is what institution and function is best situated to provide the initial critical determination about whether a participant's offer is competitive. Despite recent clarification of FERC policies on the market monitoring function, the roles of market administrators and market monitors are a potential source of confusion and counterproductive institutional conflict. The FERC should refine and clarify its policy in this area by according exclusive responsibility to institutional, independent market monitors to monitor participants' conduct and the potential for the exercise of market power through ex ante review of cost-based offers used in market power mitigation, subject to review by FERC.","[Mayes, Jeffrey; Haas, Howard; Bowring, Joseph] Monitoring Analyt LLC, Eagleville, PA USA",,"Bowring, J (通讯作者)，Monitoring Analyt LLC, Eagleville, PA USA.",Joseph.Bowring@monitoringanalytics.com,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.
