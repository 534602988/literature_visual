We analyse this data by means of various multinomial and conditional logit models in order to identify the major determinants of the location choices of these inward investments. Having controlled for the various characteristics of inward investing firms, the projects and the regions, our results suggest that existing regional specialization is the single most important determining feature of where inward FDI locates. In addition, London is seen to benefit primarily by the immigration of new investments, the majority of which are related to service sector activities.","[Dimitropoulou, Dimitra] Bank Greece, Econ Res Dept, Athens 10250, Greece; [McCann, Philip] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Burke, Simon P.] Univ Reading, Sch Econ, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England",European Central Bank; Bank of Greece; University of Groningen; University of Reading,"McCann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, Fac Spatial Sci, Postbus 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",p.mccann@rug.nl,"McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654",,,,,13,21,21,2,121,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Various UHI polices with both distortionary and nondistortionary financing methods are compared to address the trade-off between risk reduction and tax distortion, as well as the corresponding welfare implications. We use a dynamic equilibrium model with endogenous insurance choice and labor supply decisions to perform quantitative analysis. The results suggest that the UHI expenditure coverage rate is too high in most OECD countries when the distortion effect is considered. We find a clear crowding-out effect on asset holdings. Implications for private health insurance (PHI) purchases when UHI is introduced depend on the pricing and the design of coverage.

We assess, in a model-free manner, subjects' belief dynamics in a two-armed bandit learning experiment. A novel feature of our approach is to supplement the choice and reward data with subjects' eye movements during the experiment to pin down estimates of subjects' beliefs. Estimates show that subjects are more reluctant to update down following unsuccessful choices, than update up following successful choices. The profits from following the estimated learning and decision rules are smaller (by about 25% of average earnings by subjects in this experiment) than what would be obtained from a fully-rational Bayesian learning model, but comparable to the profits from alternative non-Bayesian learning models, including reinforcement learning and a simple win-stay choice heuristic.

The WTO applies a detailed and legalistic approach to accession, due to its accumulation of policy coverage over the years and the enforcement powers of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. In WTO accession cases, WTO incumbent members appear to have a superior bargaining position. At the same time, applicant countries appear to differ in their capability or willingness to gather information and institute the many reforms required to conclude the accession negotiation. Based on the record of completed and ongoing accession negotiations, the present study uses an endurance model to identify the factors that determine the probability of an applicant's joining in a given month. In addition to the number of completed accessions, World Bank indexes of government effectiveness have a particularly strong influence on the duration of the accession process. In view of the difficult cases remaining in order to complete universal WTO membership, the authors propose a broader approach to WTO membership and more flexibility in accession requirements.","[Jones, Kent; Gai, Yunwei] Babson Coll, Babson Pk, MA 02457 USA",Babson College,"Jones, K (通讯作者)，Babson Coll, Babson Pk, MA 02457 USA.",kjones@babson.edu; ygai@babson.edu,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

At the same time, the general public hears a variety of stories about the crisis, and especially stories about the debt crisis in Greece. This paper deals with the economic significance of stories, in particular with the importance of the Greek morality tale. Stories are powerful in influencing public psychology, and they can affect the economy through fluctuations in confidence and animal spirits. The paper considers the development of the Greek story through a web of related stories, fables, parables, and myths. It argues that the story dramatically distorts the reality of the debt crisis in the Eurozone and poses a threat to the global economy through its adverse effects on confidence and animal spirits. It concludes that Europe needs not only a new policy direction, but also a new narrative about the debt crisis.","[Kitromilides, Yiannis] Univ Greenwich, London SE18 6PF, England; [Kitromilides, Yiannis] Univ Westminster, London W1R 8AL, England; [Kitromilides, Yiannis] Middlesex Univ, London N17 8HR, England; [Kitromilides, Yiannis] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of Greenwich; University of Westminster; Middlesex University; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Kitromilides, Y (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Univ, Ctr Int Business & Sustainabil, London, England.",,,,,,,,31,12,12,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

It presents a case that the current economic crisis is a particular type of crisis of over-investment, called an asset bubble induced over-investment crisis. It explains what is meant by that type of crisis and presents empirical evidence for the period since 1979 that supports this interpretation of the crisis. It argues that the forces that led to the current crisis cannot be seen in the behavior of the rate of profit.

Our findings show that the contribution of income sources to inequality is different between the provinces with different extents of inequality. We find that in the coastal provinces, the contribution of wage income to inequality is decreasing, while the contribution of business and property income is increasing and getting more important; in contrast, in the western provinces, the role of wage income is larger than the other provinces, while the role of business and property income is smaller and remains unchanged. Our empirical results also suggest that the provinces with higher share of business and property income have high income inequality. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of political connections on corporate M&As is mainly realized via government intervention in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The paper also investigates the impact of political connections on M&A performance, demonstrating a significantly negative impact when SOEs are involved but a significantly positive impact when non-SOEs are involved.

Several projects have been launched that contribute to expand the resources available for basic education in Burkina Faso. However, education systems in the different administrative regions of Burkina Faso may not all be equally able to use the resources they receive to generate significant results. This study uses the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method to assess the efficiency with which basic education is provided throughout the 45 provinces of Burkina Faso. Overall, our results reveal that resources are not used optimally for the provision of basic education in the provinces of Burkina Faso. In order to explain inefficiency scores, we also use the Simar and Wilson (2007) procedure. We find that households' living situation can explain efficiency in primary education provision.

In the end these trade-offs determine the effectiveness of policy with respect to the material situation of families and employment of their parents. We analyse several kinds of trade-offs involved using a careful selection of potential changes to the system of financial support for families with children. We focus on: 1) the trade-off between redistribution of income to poorer households and improving work incentives, 2) the trade-off between improving work incentives for first and for second earners in couples, 3) the trade-off between improving work incentives for those facing strong and weak incentives in the baseline system. The exercise is conducted on data from Poland, a country characterized by high levels of child poverty, low female employment and one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe. We demonstrate the complexity of potential consequences of family support policy and stress the need for well-defined policy goals and careful analysis ahead of any reform.","[Myck, Michal] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Kurowska, Anna] Univ Warsaw, Inst Social Policy, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Warsaw,,mmyck@cenea.org.pl; a.kurowska@uw.edu.pl; mkundera@cenea.org.pl,"Kurowska, Anna/R-9932-2019; Myck, Michal/ABA-7136-2021","Kurowska, Anna/0000-0002-3578-4517; Myck, Michal/0000-0002-9894-838X",,,,,44,1,1,1,15,EUROBALTIC CENTRES EXCELLENCE,RIGA,"RAINA BLVD 19, RIGA, LV-1586, LATVIA",1406-099X,,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

These charts depict a multilevel managerial hierarchy of authority within the organization typified, in the simplest case, by a pyramid. Many economic and business researchers attribute formality to a desire for greater efficiency, although I do not take this position in the present paper. Instead, I agree with researchers who connect formality with organizational legitimacy. I further argue that personal interests are at work in bigness and formalization. Top managers are motivated by desire for power and prestige. Formality furthers these objectives by rigidly fixing relations and ranks within the organization. Widespread belief in efficiency and legitimacy converge with personal motives to encourage and entrench formality. Corporate size and structure are seen as having deleterious effects on employees and society at large. But they also have some negative impacts on those at the top.","Indiana State Univ, Scott Coll Business, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA",Indiana State University,"Redmond, W (通讯作者)，Indiana State Univ, Scott Coll Business, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",,,,,,,,64,1,2,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The general production boundary in SNA 1993 is defined by using this criterion. They considered that the property of delegability was the key to the concept of economic production. That is, an activity is called production in an economic sense if it can be delegated to another economic unit. The author calls due attention to the fact that the SNA includes another criterion, which he tentatively calls World 1 criterion meaning that an activity is called economic production only when it is a physical process, where the term World 1 is due to Karl Popper. It is claimed that this criterion can generate a more appropriate general production boundary for the SNA if it is used with role-exchangeability criterion, another new criterion.","[Sakuma, Itsuo] Senshu Univ, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan",,"Sakuma, I (通讯作者)，Senshu Univ, Sch Econ, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashimita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan.",sakuma@isc.senshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Empirical estimation is performed on the elicited-belief data from two experiments (Nyarko and Schotter, 2002; Rutstrom and Wilcox, 2009) using repeated games with a unique, albeit significantly different, stage mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. Model comparisons are performed by cross-validation both within and between these two datasets, and using data from completely unrelated non-strategic tasks. Subjects' beliefs are best described by 2-period pattern detection. Parameter estimates exhibited considerable instability across the two belief-elicitation datasets, and surprisingly, using median values from a wide variety of unrelated studies led to better predictions.

The incentives for diversification for any given degree of privatization will fall when the private and public firms are allowed to move sequentially rather than simultaneously. The presence of the public firm also introduces a new source of asymmetry in the incentives for cross-border mergers: a reduction in the degree of privatization at home will dampen the potential gains from a take-over of a home firm by a foreign firm but magnify the potential gains from a take-over of a foreign firm by a home firm.","[Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Chakrabarti, Avik] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Coll Letters & Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Marjit, Sugata] Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata 700094, W Bengal, India",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Beladi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, Dept Econ, 1 UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",hamid.beladi@utsa.edu; chakra@uwm.edu; smarjit@hotmail.com,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We show that West German households who had social ties to East Germany in 1989 experienced a persistent rise in their personal incomes after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Moreover, the presence of these households significantly affects economic performance at the regional level: it increases the returns to entrepreneurial activity, the share of households who become entrepreneurs, and the likelihood that firms based within a given West German region invest in East Germany. As a result, West German regions that (for idiosyncratic reasons) have a high concentration of households with social ties to the East exhibit substantially higher growth in income per capita in the early 1990s. A one standard deviation rise in the share of households with social ties to East Germany in 1989 is associated with a 4.7 percentage point rise in income per capita over six years.

It uses a quasi-experimental design to analyze a unique dataset based on Papel Passado, a Brazilian government land-titling program affecting over 85,000 families. The causal role of legal ownership is isolated by comparing two geographically close and demographically similar communities in Osasco, a town of 650,000 people in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, where some residential units were allocated property titles and others were not. Survey data were collected from households in both types of units before and after the granting of land titles, with neither type knowing ex ante whether it would receive land titles. The multinomial probit technique was applied and the results show that land title ownership increases by 13 points the probability of a household qualifying for a happier group. Furthermore, it decreases 21 points the probability of belonging to the lower level group. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, the Phillips curve is flattening in many countries. These facts indicate that the output gap fluctuations associated with inflation persistence in one country influence other countries and suggest that the central bank consider the effect of inflation persistence on the real economy in an open economy framework. The objective of this paper is to explore optimal monetary policy in a two-country economy with inflation persistence. To consider the case in which inflation persistence is present in both countries, we assume that a fraction of firms that change their prices follows the rule-of-thumb pricing rule. In this case, the new Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) in each country becomes flatter as the fraction of firms employing the rule-of-thumb pricing rule increases in both countries. Our results show gains from commitment in a two-country economy with inflation persistence. This paper addresses that the presence of a severe deflationary bias is the main source of the large gain from a commitment policy in a two-country economy with inflation persistence.

This study is the first to show, with rigorous empirical evidence, that compulsory voting laws are effective in reducing the skill/socioeconomic gap in political participation.

We find that technology shocks are responsible for significant changes in the output volatility throughout the total sample period while the volatility of labor input is largely attributed to nontechnology shocks. The driving force behind these results is the negative correlation between labor input and productivity, which holds significantly and persistently over the postwar period. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, some employers extend health insurance benefits to their retirees, and individuals who are eligible for such retiree health benefits need not wait until age 65 to retire with group health coverage. We investigate the impact of retiree health insurance on early retirement using employee-level data from 54 diverse firms that are clients of Towers Watson, a leading benefits consulting firm. We find that retiree health coverage has its strongest effects at ages 62 through 64. Coverage that includes an employer contribution is associated with a 6.3 percentage point (36.2%) increase in the probability of turnover at age 62, a 7.7 percentage point (48.8%) increase in the probability of turnover at age 63, and a 5.5 percentage point (38.0%) increase in the probability of turnover at age 64.

Firms can post wage offers in the regular job market, alternatively they can save on advertising costs and rely on word-of-mouth communication. Wages are then negotiated ex-post between the firm and the applicant, so the model can generate wage premiums or penalties depending on the parameter of bargaining power. Moreover, this paper shows that the traditional Hosios (1990) condition continues to hold in an economy with family contacts but it fails to provide efficiency in the economy with weak ties. There are two reasons for the inefficiency. First, workers bargaining over wages do not internalize the positive external effect on their contacts, originating from a higher probability of finding a job. This network externality puts an upward pressure on wages so the market tightness in the referral market is distorted downwards. Second, weak ties do not act in full interest of the unemployed worker so their search intensity is inefficiently low. Finally, this paper shows that a combination of a hiring subsidy and a referral bonus can decentralize the efficient allocation in the economy with weak ties. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze product differentiation and find that Hotelling's Principle of Minimum Differentiation comes closer to holding in the presence of congestion costs. The greater are congestion costs, the less differentiated products can be in (locationally symmetric) equilibrium. In fact, minimum differentiation comes arbitrarily close to holding depending on the magnitude of these costs relative to transportation costs. Intuitively, greater congestion effects stabilize competition at closer quarters, eliminating aggressive pricing equilibria. Thus, negative network externalities can play a significant role in product differentiation.

Empirical studies about households in the U.S. reveal that the housing profile increases monotonically until age mid-60s and then flattens out. The model is realistically calibrated and solved numerically under different habit strength parameters. For all values of the parameter, our model produces lower reduction of housing for the elderly compared to the standard model which does not include habit formation. The amount of reduction in housing in the old ages and the level of housing decrease significantly as habit strength increases. The person becomes more attached to his house with a higher habit strength. Considering intolerance towards housing reductions, one consumes a lower amount of housing in the young ages to be able to maintain it in the old ages. These results suggest that in addition to the transaction costs in house trading, habit formation in housing also has a merit in explaining the preservation of housing for elderly people. Our model improves on the literature by investigating the effects of a habit formation behind household allocations and by reducing the role of transaction costs in solving the housing puzzle of the elderly. It contributes to the literature by using a new model with a deep habit preference form and housing. Our model should be preferred to the existing ones since it provides a richer and more real framework for modeling households. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical literature rarely isolates the effect of specificity because exogenous changes, due to land reforms, either simultaneously change both control and specificity or exclusively change control. We investigate the effect of specificity in the context of the 1992 Salinas land reforms in Mexico, which constitutionally changed individual control rights for all communal landholders but reserved changes to specificity for a subsequent voluntary land certification program. We are able to address selection into the program by taking advantage of the peculiarities in the certification process. Using agricultural production data from before and after the reform, we demonstrate that land certification significantly increases agricultural investments but only for investments directly affected by the changes in control. We explain the results using a simple model that shows how specificity can better coordinate landholders' beliefs about the implementation of changes in control. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Default risk is determined endogenously and depends on the incentives for repayment. The economy can borrow using tradable-denominated nonindexed bonds or bonds whose return is indexed to the domestic price index, which are used as proxies for foreign currency and domestic currency debt, respectively. The model predicts that foreign currency debt leads to lower default risk for high output levels and domestic currency debt reduces the default risk for low output levels. Although the effect of debt denomination on default risk changes with the output level, the default rate of the economy and average interest rates decline as domestic currency borrowing increases.

We suggest a process of specialization to explain these facts. Windfall revenue induces labor to move from the (traded) manufacturing to the (non-traded) non-manufacturing sector. A self-selection of workers takes place. Only those most skilled in manufacturing sector work remain in manufacturing. Workers that move to non-manufacturing however, will be less skilled at non-manufacturing sector work than those who were already employed there. Resource-induced structural transformation thus results in higher productivity in manufacturing and lower productivity in non-manufacturing. We construct and calibrate a two-sector, open economy model of self-selection and show that exogenous cross-country variation in natural resource endowments is large enough to explain the direction and magnitude of sectoral employment and productivity differences between resource-rich and resource-poor regions. The model implies that low aggregate productivity found in some resource-rich countries is not caused by a resource-induced decline of a relatively productive manufacturing sector. Rather, the higher manufacturing productivity in those countries is a consequence of manufacturing's smaller size. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We use very large samples on a wide variety of measures of child well-being that are also linked to long histories of parent earnings from administrative records. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the use of longer time averages of parent earnings leads to substantially higher estimated associations compared to using only a single year of parent earnings. Using 7-year time averages of parent earnings, we show, for example, that a doubling of parent earnings is associated with a reduced probability of a teenager reporting being in poor health by close to 50% and a decrease in the likelihood of a child repeating a grade by 39%. We also examine how the associations vary by the timing of when parental earnings are received during childhood. We find suggestive evidence that parental earnings received during the child's school-going years (ages 6 to 17) are more strongly associated with college enrollment and children's future earnings as adults than parent earnings received earlier or later in the child's life.

We perform a simulation study to test the efficiency of these estimators and to compare with the approach proposed by Hog (1999). Moreover, we apply our estimation procedure to some sample series of Chinese coal spot prices in real life situations. These results support the use of fractional mean-reversion processes in modeling Chinese coal prices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find that as the period grows longer, indeterminacy occurs less often.

One important difference between many lab and field experiments is how the endowment is obtained. By conducting a dictator game experiment, we investigate the influences of windfall and earned endowment on behavior in the laboratory and in the field. We find subjects donate more in both environments if the endowment is a windfall gain. However, although the experimental design was intended to control for all effects other than environment, there are significant differences in behavior between the lab and the field for both windfall and earned endowment. This points to the importance of discussing the context when interpreting both laboratory and field experiment results as well as when conducting replication studies.","[Carlsson, Fredrik; Martinsson, Peter] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [He, Haoran] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; Beijing Normal University,"He, HR (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",fredrik.carlsson@economics.gu.se; haoran.he@bnu.edu.cn; peter.martinsson@economics.gu.se,"Martinsson, Peter/JAD-2096-2023; Carlsson, Fredrik/E-3734-2010","Carlsson, Fredrik/0000-0003-4789-8009; Martinsson, Peter/0000-0002-1146-9248",,,,,38,58,63,2,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

European governments themselves tend to underestimate Europe's responsibility for the crisis and seem to prefer to manage the symptoms of the crisis rather than pursue a real recovery from it. This paper argues that the enforced policies are far from achieving an appropriate economic solution for the Eurozone. Moreover, it suggests that, although the European domestic debt situation is very close to the American one, their most recent evolutions and their main causes differ. If the growth of the American debt can partly be explained by macroeconomics imbalances, the causes of the growth of the European domestic debt must be found in a change in the behavior of financial sector agents. The conclusion advocates for a more radical European policy to solve the debt bubble.","[Cayla, David] Univ Angers, Angers, France",Universite d'Angers,"Cayla, D (通讯作者)，Univ Angers, Angers, France.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The analysis suggests that a woman's financial satisfaction decreases with cohabitation as opposed to marriage due perhaps to the lack of income pooling of cohabiters. The paper however finds substantial heterogeneity among married couples; the difference between marriage and cohabitation is not only a result of the legal protection obtained by the marriage contract but is better explained by the level of relationship investment in marriage in terms of its duration. The systematic comparison of the three institutional frameworks points out that Denmark, as the country where marriage and cohabitation are most equated by law, is surprisingly the country where the relative difference between marriage and cohabitation for a woman's financial satisfaction is the greatest. No relative variation in results is observed between Great Britain and France. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Data indicate that industry advertising spending decreased sharply immediately following the ban but recovered and actually exceeded the preban level within five years. A dynamic oligopoly model of advertising is developed to incorporate two potential explanations. The estimated model fully accounts for the puzzling trend, with 74% of the postban advertising spending increase explained by industry dynamics, and 26% explained by learning.

We explore the implications of different degrees of relationship-specificity when there are two parties, A and B, who can make investments in physical capital (instead of human capital). If relationship-specificity is exogenously given, it turns out that joint asset ownership can be optimal only if the degree of relationship-specificity is sufficiently small. If relationship-specificity can be freely chosen and if party A's investments are more productive, then the parties deliberately choose a strictly positive level of relationship-specificity and they always agree on sole ownership by party A.

I show that there can be a U-shape dependence of the outside ownership concentration on the quality of shareholder protection. This result is in line with the recent empirical evidence questioning the traditional law-and-finance view. In my model, a lower cost of private benefit extraction makes outside monitoring less desirable for an entrepreneur, thereby calling for a smaller outside blockholder's share. However, a low blockholder's share may provoke collusion between the entrepreneur and the blockholder, which hampers raising funds from dispersed shareholders. This trade-off yields the described U-shape relationship.

This core both holds and routes significant amounts of the world's financial funds considering the needs of their respective countries. On the other hand, peripheral countries with persistent current account deficits have to manage with the surplus funds of core countries or, worse, during times of financial turbulences be obliged to feed the core with their capital or absorb the excess funds of the core. In most cases, this dilemma creates an asymmetrical relationship between these two groups of countries. As financial crises mostly emerge in core countries, due to lack of domestic funding, they necessarily spread to the periphery as well. Thus, the Tobin Tax frequently gains popularity as a protective measure in the periphery. This study intends to redefine financial crises with their asymmetrical and endogenous aspects as well as to draw attention to the internal imbalances of peripheral countries.",,,,,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,9,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The dominant way of thinking until recently was that commons situations invariably result in the tragedy of overuse, requiring either privatization (when possible) or top-down regulation. Based on a worldwide database of CPR groups, Ostrom proposed a set of principles that broadly captured the essential aspects of the institutional arrangements that succeeded, as contrasted to groups whose efforts failed. These principles can be generalized in two respects: first, by showing how they follow from foundational evolutionary principles; and second, by showing how they apply to a wider range of groups. The generality of the core design principles enables them to be used as a practical guide for improving the efficacy of many kinds of groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate this question using sudden, policy-induced wage variation in which the Government of Ghana restructured the pay scale for health workers employed by the government. We find that a 10% increase in wages decreases annual attrition from the public payroll by 1.0 percentage point (from a mean of 8 percentage points) among 20-35 year-old workers from professions that tend to migrate. As a result, the ten-year survival probability for these health workers increases from 0.43 to 0.49. The effects are concentrated among these young workers, and we do not detect effects for older workers or among categories of workers that do not tend to migrate. Given that Ghana was a major source of skilled health professional migrants during this period and that our attrition measure correlates strongly with aggregate migration, we interpret these results as evidence that wage increases in Ghana improved retention mainly through reducing international migration.

The model is used to assess the macroeconomic effects of the orthodox policy (fiscal austerity) implemented by policy makers to cope with the foreign debt crisis of Latin America in the 1980s. Such policy involved high costs in terms of welfare, job and output losses to no avail, since the regions financial fragility remained largely unresolved, in the end resulting in the so-called lost decade. The main policy insight of Domars and Pasinettis analysis, we argue, posits a pro-growth expansionary policy as the most efficient strategy to abate and bring d to a sustainable path.

We demonstrate that an increase in market size induces a deeper division of labor among these teams which leads to an increase in firm productivity. The paper can be thought of as a formalization of Smith's (1776) famous theorem that the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market.

Using firm-level and linked worker-firm data, we apply a standardised methodology for three developed (Germany, Portugal, UK) and two emerging economies (Brazil, Indonesia). We find that wage effects are larger in developing countries, and that for each country the largest effect on wages comes from workers who move from domestic to foreign firms. Employment growth after foreign takeover is concentrated in high-skill jobs. In contrast to widespread fears, there is no evidence that wage gains come at the expense of greater job insecurity: separation rates actually fall slightly after takeover. We conclude that the positive effect of foreign ownership on wages is not primarily driven by its impact on incumbent wages, but by its impact on the creation of high-wage jobs.

Employing various measures of cultural differences, I find that only differences related to the degree of individualism in society and the extent to which inequality in the distribution of power is tolerated are strong and statistically significant predictors of the observed differences in institutional quality. This finding is robust to the inclusion of various other determinants of institutional differences across countries discussed in the literature and it holds for a variety of measures of institutional quality. Moreover, the strong link between these two cultural dimensions and the quality of institutions is also confirmed in instrumental variables regressions where a novel instruments for culture based on a weighted average of the cultural attitudes present in neighboring countries is employed.

In total, 10 different model structures are adopted, and this paper thus conducts a comprehensive investigation on the ARMA-GARCH based time series forecasting of electricity prices. Multiple statistical measures are employed to evaluate the modeling sufficiency and predication accuracy of the ARMA-GARCH( -M) methods. The results show that the ARMA-GARCH-M models are in general an effective tool for modeling and forecasting the mean and volatility of electricity prices, while ARMA-SGARCH-M models are simple and robust and the ARMA-GJRGARCH-M model is very competitive. In addition, we observe that hourly electricity prices exhibit apparent daily, weekly and monthly periodicities, and have the nonlinear and asymmetric time-varying volatility together with an inverse leverage effect.

However, in a large market, or in a medium market size with less efficient R&D technology, the innovating firm does not share information with its rival. In equilibrium whether information sharing occurs or not, merger is always formed. We find that the social welfare may be higher under incomplete information regime.

This article attempts to answer the question what the direction and strength of this possible impact is, examining the relationship between corporate investment and inflation on the sample of 21 OECD countries in the years 1960-2005. The obtained negative relationship, statistically and economically significant, proves robust to changes in the specification of the estimated equation, estimators, frequency of variables used in the study and analysed period. Moreover, the obtained results suggest a nonlinear character of this relationship: the marginal effect on corporate investment is higher at inflation rates between 3 and 5.5 per cent. These results suggest that the impact of inflation on corporate investment dynamics may be the source of the nonlinear nature of the relationship between GDP growth and inflation identified in previous empirical studies. Finally, taking into account the direct impact of inflation on investment, variables approximating the cost of capital utilisation prove to be statistically insignificant determinants of corporate investment.","[Cizkowicz, Piotr] Warsaw Sch Econ, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland; [Rzonca, Andrzej] Natl Bank Poland, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Cizkowicz, P (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",pcizko@sgh.waw.pl; andrzej.rzonca@nbp.pl,,,,,,,101,0,0,3,22,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 17,2013,7.0,,,,,,,,201316.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-16,0.0,,,39,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,185JN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321963900001,0

The analysis is performed using Spanish firm-level data. We define a framework where the relative magnitudes of alternative, but not exclusive, sources of technical change are simultaneously estimated. Our main finding is that the average total factor productivity (TFP) growth is fully explained by embodied technical progress (i.e., either new capital goods or human capital). Our results contradict the existence of a positive contribution of economy wide neutral technological progress in determining average TFP growth. They also leave little room for large, unpriced effects external to the firm, both at the aggregate and at the industry level.

There may exist multiple equilibria, each of which entails analysts sending the most informative messages possible. Beyond the regular equilibrium involving an overweighing of the public information, multiplicity introduces inverted equilibria where public information is negatively correlated with the return.

A dynamic economic model will distil Scitovsky's proposal, which has not yet been integrated into conventional economics. It will show that people's dissatisfaction may be due to their excess of demand for 'comfort', which essentially requires consumption goods, and to their failure to adequately develop 'leisure skill', which is necessary to enjoy 'creative activities' during leisure time. Since comfort includes comparing consumption with that of others, Scitovsky also strengthened the conventional solution of the paradox. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We consider rules currently adopted in Europe for storage allocation, and discuss efficient rationing mechanisms as based on the value of storage, when other flexibility inputs are partially available. We initially analyze productive efficiency issues, without explicitly considering vertical restraints. We then assume imperfect competition in the downstream market for gas supplies, given the availability of storage capacity upstream, and analyze strategic behavior in a two-stage model. In this framework we compare regulated storage tariffs - coupled with a centralized rationing mechanism - with storage auctions. Finally, we consider the allocation of storage that arises from welfare maximization by a benevolent social planner. We find that it is usually optimal to maximize the amount of storage capacity allocated to new entrants in liberalized gas markets. Storage auctions deviate from the optimal mechanism, but still afford greater efficiency than do rules that allocate storage capacity independently of its value.

Wavelet energy additive decomposition was analyzed to investigate which scales capture the most energy (volatility), whereas a wavelet cross-correlation estimator was used to analyze comovement and lead/lag relationship between stock markets' return dynamics on a scale-by-scale basis. The main findings of the paper are as follows. First, major financial market crises had a significant impact on return volatility of investigated stock markets. Among them, the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 had the greatest and the most durable impact. Second, the lowest scale (associated with stock markets' return dynamics over a 2-4 days horizon) and the second lowest scale (associated with stock markets' return dynamics over 4-8 days horizon) MODWT (maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform) decompositions of stock markets' returns captured the greatest share (together about 70-80%) of indices' returns volatility. Third, comovement between stock market returns is a scale-dependent phenomenon. Fourth, a strong comovement between stock market returns of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom exists at all scales, while the Austrian stock market is less correlated with the three biggest stock markets in Europe. Fifth, the dynamics of stock market returns seems to be well time-synchronized at daily (raw returns) and the lowest scale (scale) return decomposition as most of the return innovations are transmitted between stock markets intraday. Sixth, at the highest investigated scale (associated with stock markets' return dynamics over a 64-128 days horizon), significant leads and lags between dynamics of stock markets' returns were detected. The time-synchronization of the stock markets' return dynamics for investments of 64 to 128 days horizon is less perfect than for investments of shorter investment horizons.","Univ Maribor, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,53,51,53,2,28,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In this paper, I develop and estimate a structural model that explains the demand side behavior in the market for prescription drugs. I then use the estimated parameters of the model to compute the impact on consumer welfare that results from changes in demand for cholesterol-reducing drugs due to increased expenditure in DTCA. The results of the policy analysis indicate increased levels of consumer welfare due to presence of DTCA in comparison to the absence of DTCA. The results also support the argument that DTCA helps bring under-diagnosed patients to the physicians' offices. Furthermore, the results of the estimation support the informative role of DTCA on the decision to seek care, and both informative and persuasive roles of physician advertising on the choice of the drug.

Our results suggest that consumer purchases are affected by information costs. Implemented low calorie and no trans fat labels increase sales. In contrast, implemented low fat labels decrease sales, suggesting that consumer response is also influenced by consumers' taste perceptions.

Focusing more on utilization rather than protection of IPs for human society, it argues that the linkages from protection of knowledge to innovation incentives should be given more priority at the later stage of economic development when developing countries reach a certain level of technological capabilities. Despite the loose or open linkage between IP protection and economic growth, strong IP enforcement can still seriously decrease the catching-up probability of latecomer firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The lawsuits by patent trolls may be more damaging because cross-licensing or patent pooling strategy is not available at all as a settlement option. Thus, latecomer firms are facing heavier challenges than before, especially the SMEs with limited financial and human resources.

Even a small amount of uncertainty will in a large electorate eliminate many of counterintuitive results that arise when voting probabilities are known. In particular, a campaign that can affect the voting probabilities of a fraction of the electorate should maximize the expected difference between its candidate's and the opposing candidate's share of the fraction's potential vote. When a campaign can target only finitely many voters, maximization of the same objective function remains optimal if a convergence condition is satisfied. When voting probabilities are certain, this convergence condition obtains only at knife-edge combinations of parameters, but when voting probabilities are uncertain the condition is necessarily satisfied.

Using a variety of data sources, this study will employ panel co-integration methods, including the FMOLS and PDOLS estimators, to understand the long-run relationship between the top 1 per cent income share and a number of explanatory variables. Our analysis finds that economic openness, the size and ideology of government, the development of financial markets, top marginal tax rates, technological progress and the strength of unions are all important determinants of top income shares.

Community colleges are often promoted as the first step toward the ultimate goal of a four-year degree. However, community colleges have extremely poor degree completion rates. There is evidence suggesting better results for their private, two-year counterparts - particularly for certificate completion. We will focus on occupational colleges - rivate accredited colleges that offer career preparation in occupational fields like health care, business, information technology, and others. These institutions challenge many of our preconceptions about college. They are less wedded to college traditions, which raises some interesting questions: Do private colleges offering certificates or AA degrees use different procedures? Should community colleges consider some of these procedures to reduce student difficulties and improve their completion rates? For many community college students, earning a more likely, quick sub-BA credential - perhaps followed by a four-year degree in the future - will be preferable to the relatively unlikely pathway from a community college program directly to a four-year BA. In sum, this paper suggests that nontraditional colleges and nontraditional credentials (certificates and AA degrees) deserve much closer attention from researchers, policymakers, and students.","[Rosenbaum, James E.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Rosenbaum, Janet] Suny Downstate Med Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA",Northwestern University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center,"Rosenbaum, JE (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",j-rosenbaum@northwestern.edu; janetrosenbaum@downstate.edu,"Rosenbaum, Janet/K-4521-2019","Rosenbaum, Janet/0000-0001-9796-513X; Rosenbaum, James/0000-0001-5703-631X",,,,,52,8,27,0,11,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Among demand response programmes, real-time pricing schemes for small consumers are believed to have significant potential for peak-shaving and load-shifting, thus relieving the power system while reducing costs and risk for energy retailers. This paper proposes a game theoretical model accounting for the Stackelberg relationship between retailers (leaders) and consumers (followers) in a dynamic price environment. Both players in the game solve an economic optimisation problem subject to stochasticity in prices, weather-related variables and must-serve load. The model allows the determination of the dynamic price-signal delivering maximum retailer profit, and the optimal load pattern for consumers under this pricing. The bilevel programme is reformulated as a single-level MILP, which can be solved using commercial off-the-shelf optimisation software. In an illustrative example, we simulate and compare the dynamic pricing scheme with fixed and time-of-use pricing. We find that the dynamic pricing scheme is the most effective in achieving load-shifting, thus reducing retailer costs for energy procurement and regulation in the wholesale market. Additionally, the redistribution of the saved costs between retailers and consumers is investigated, showing that real-time pricing is less convenient than fixed and time-of-use price for consumers. This implies that careful design of the retail market is needed. Finally, we carry out a sensitivity analysis to analyse the effect of different levels of consumer flexibility. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our empirical results indicate, across a variety of estimation methods and specifications, that a one percentage point increase in the VAT rate leads to roughly a one percent reduction in the level of aggregate consumption in the short run and to a somewhat larger reduction in the long run.","[Alm, James] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [El-Ganainy, Asmaa] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC USA",Tulane University; International Monetary Fund,"Alm, J (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 6823 St Charles Ave,208 Tilton Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",jalm@tulane.edu; aelganainy@imf.org,,,,,,,67,29,37,3,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Moreover, we find that many measures of corporatism, which we define in the wider sense as institutions that hamper with the allocation of the factors of production and the distribution of income in a capitalist economy, are negatively correlated across countries with job satisfaction. Thus job satisfaction is positively correlated across countries with measures of the protection of property rights and negatively correlated with the volume of regulations of credit markets, labor markets and businesses, in addition to barriers to entrepreneurship, corruption and lack of access to capital. In contrast, measures of capitalism, such as the number of listed companies and market capitalization, are positively correlated with job satisfaction.

We examine several issues related to firm-specific and overall exposure, including an evaluation of the efficacy of adopting a hard-peg on such exposure. Our sample consists of 158 listed firms and spans the 16 year period, 1990-2005. A multivariate model using four bilateral exchange rates is used to determine firm level exposure while panel data analysis using a random-effects Generalized Least Squares (GLS) model is used to determine system-wide or aggregate sample exposure. We find a total 71% of our sample firms to have significant exchange rate exposure, a rate substantially higher than that reported for most countries, especially developed ones. The US$ is by far the single most important source of exposure with 63% of sample firms exposed to it. The sign of the beta coefficient for three of the four currencies are negative, implying that our sample firms are largely net importers in these currencies. We find exposure to be time variant and dependent on the sector within which a firm operates. Interestingly, the panel data analysis which measures aggregate exposure, shows the US$ to be a significant source of exposure even with the adoption of the hard peg. The change in policy regime to a fixed peg following the crisis appears to have had no impact at either firm-level exposure or overall system-wide exposure.","[Bacha, Obiyathulla Ismath] Lorong Univ A, Dept Finance & Accounting, INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Mohamad, Azhar; Zain, Sharifah Raihan Syed Mohd; Rasid, Mohd Eskandar Shah Mohd] Int Islamic Univ, Dept Finance, KENMS, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",INCEIF; Lorong Universiti A; International Islamic University Malaysia,"Bacha, OI (通讯作者)，Lorong Univ A, Dept Finance & Accounting, INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",obiya@inceif.org,"Bacha, Obiyathulla/AAF-9083-2021; Mohamad, Azhar/D-8591-2017","Mohamad, Azhar/0000-0002-1075-598X; Shah, Mohamed/0000-0002-3528-4432",,,,,13,15,15,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Most papers use indeed a static specification and impose the same lag structure across all explanatory variables. This, by construction, prevents from specifically timing the crisis signals sent by the leading indicators. The objective here is to fill this gap by considering a set of dynamic discrete choice models. The first contribution is to identify how early in advance each explanatory variable sends a warning signal. Some indicators are found to signal a crisis in the very short run while others signal a crisis at more distant horizons. The second contribution is to show that state dependence matters, albeit mostly in the short run. The results have important implications for crisis prevention in terms of the timeliness and usefulness of the envisaged policy response.","Banque France, Int Macroecon Div, F-75001 Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Bussière, M (通讯作者)，Banque France, Int Macroecon Div, 31 Rue Croix des Petits Champ, F-75001 Paris, France.",matthieu.bussiere@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,32,16,18,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While studying the price behaviour of inflation-linked (real) bonds beside nominal bonds in the major fixed-income markets, we observe that the Real Bond Yields (RBY) and the yield differentials, the Breakeven Inflation Rates (BEIR), have the propensity to be positively correlated between each other across the various countries, yet are pushed into a negative correlation relationship due to market-related price distortions. As long as those distortions are local, the net result is near-zero correlation within countries; when they become global, as in the heat of the current crisis, the correlations turn negative worldwide.

This is why, when assessing the effect that a new technology or industry policy may have on the national economy, companies and policy-makers need to consider dynamic structural changes affecting the IT industry. One of the most popular existing methods for economic impact analysis is based on a traditional input-output table, and is conducted over a period between the current time and a given time in the future. In this study, we compare the accuracy of RAS and Cross Entropy (CE), the two most widely employed methods for updating input-output (IO) tables, by applying them to Korean IT industries. The main results of this study are the following. In terms of the accuracy of input coefficient estimates, we have found that both the RAS and CE methods have a tendency to overestimate or underestimate them. When the Korean industry was first divided into fourteen sectors, and the RAS and CE methods were applied to each of the fourteen industries, it was difficult to discern a consistent trend for the two methods concerning their accuracy in estimation of input coefficients. Secondly, when used to update an IO table in which the IT industry is subdivided into IT equipment and services, neither the CE nor RAS method proved distinctly superior to the other. Third, in light of the above two findings, we concluded that updating IO tables is best done through a hybrid method combining the CE and RAS methods. This paper proposes a procedure consisting of two steps: IO tables are first updated using the two methods, which are once again updated by employing the OLS average approach through the use of optimal weights.","[Cho, Byung-Sun] Elect & Telecommun Res Inst, Taejon 305350, South Korea; [Cho, Sang Sup; Lee, Jungmann] Hoseo Univ, Cheonan, Chungnam Provin, South Korea",Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute - Korea (ETRI); Hoseo University,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Hoseo Univ, Anseodong 268, Cheonan, Chungnam Provin, South Korea.",mann@hoseo.edu,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

For this reason, many countries preparing for a FTA with China, including the EU, express concerns about the domestic industry downfall, in particular, that of the labor-intensive such as agriculture industry. This study empirically assesses the impact of the China-Korea FTA on the industrial competitiveness and labor market of both countries. An econometric analysis was conducted on the impact of the China-Korea FTA, and the Fuzzy-Delphi analysis was performed on a panel of experts in order to complement the quantitative analysis. Further, the Fuzzy Decision-Making method was primarily used in the opinion survey. The method takes into consideration the uncertainties in the judgment of the panel of experts in the Delphi-Survey, which predicts the qualitative effect of the China-Korea FTA. Overall, our results reveal that the China-Korea FTA would have a positive impact on the industrial competitiveness or employment situation of China and Korea. If the Korea-China FTA is concluded, Korea will have the upper hand in the automobile, auto parts, and textile and clothing industries in terms of industrial production. However, there exits an underlying possibility that a production increase may not lead to effective job creation as production facilities may relocate to China where there is a relatively lower labor cost. Industries found to be in a weaker position based on the conclusion of the Korea-China FTA were agriculture, forestry, & fishery, mining, wooden furniture and processed foods; such industries were found to unlikely see the creation of jobs. This study also suggests negotiation strategies which can ensure a win-win for both parties. Further, it also discusses various institutional improvements for industries or workers impacted by the trade adjustment, which is required to maximize the effect of the China-Korea FTA.","[Cho, Joonmo; Rhee, Hae-Chun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Woo, Kwangho] Sungkyunkwan Univ, HRD Ctr, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Myeongnyun 3 Ga, Seoul, South Korea.",trustcho@skku.edu; wookh1@gmail.com; rheehc@skku.edu,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,39,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The importance of that problem follows from many practical applications as well as from its computational complexity, therefore the use of optimization techniques seems to be relatively complicated, and nowadays many researchers turn their attention to applications of alternative computational techniques that are inspired by evolutionary biology.

We consider both a Cournot and a Bertrand supergame with discounting, with collusion being supported by either grim trigger strategies or stick-and-carrot optimal punishments. We show that, irrespective of firms' choice variable, and under both punishment schemes, increased reliance on ad valorem taxation makes it easier for firms to sustain a collusive agreement. Contrary to the conventional wisdom according to which ad valorem taxation should be preferred on welfare grounds, we find that welfare under specific taxation might be higher than welfare under ad valorem taxation. The main conclusion of our analysis is that traditional welfare results on the comparison between ad valorem and specific taxation based on static models do not necessarily survive in a dynamic setting where the possibility of collusion among firms is taken into account. In response to an increase in the ad valorem tax rate, sufficiently patient firms might find it rational to form an implicit cartel, which would not have existed otherwise. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The most important feature brought about by labor market frictions is the connection between the interest rate and the unemployment rate. Exogenous shocks (such as aging) leading to lower interest rates also imply lower equilibrium unemployment rates, because lower capital costs stimulate labor demand and induce firms to advertise more vacancies. These effects may be reinforced by increases in the participation rate of older workers, induced by the higher wage rates and the larger probability of finding a job. These results imply that neglecting labor market frictions and employment rate dynamics may seriously bias the evaluation of pension reforms when they have an impact on the equilibrium interest rate.

We measure TFP growth using real gross value added as output and capital input, labour input and a stock input index based on the major fish stocks. In developed neighbouring countries, we expect rapid diffusion of fishing technology innovations contributing to productivity convergence. In addition, innovations in the public regulation and the industrial organization may also have influenced productivity growth during the period. We find that Iceland had the highest annual TFP growth. Accounting for stock changes, it amounts to 3%, while the corresponding figures for Sweden and Norway are 2.8% and 0.8%, respectively.

We explore potentially distorting factors, but find little evidence. Applying Koszegi and Rabin's (2006) theory where workers have both income and hours targets could explain our result.

Very nice applications can be found in areas that rely on modeling via stochastic processes, such as finance. However, since financial quantities as opposed to natural processes depend on human activity, their modeling is often very challenging. Many scholars therefor suggest to specify some parts of financial models by means of fuzzy set theory. Many financial problems, such as pricing and hedging of specific financial derivatives, are too complex to be solved analytically even in a crisp case, it can be efficient to apply (Quasi) Monte Carlo simulation. In this contribution a recent knowledge of fuzzy numbers and their approximation Is utilized In order to suggest fuzzy-MC simulation to option price modeling in terms of fuzzy-random variables. In particular, we suggest three distinct fuzzy-random processes as an alternative to a standard crisp model. Application possibilities are shown on illustrative examples assuming a plain vanilla European put option under Brownian motion with fuzzy parameter (volatility), Brownian motion with fuzzy subordinator and Brownian motion with fuzzyfied subordinator. in each case the model result into a whole set of prices - thus, since we assume one of the input data as LU fuzzy number, we get the price in terms of the LU fuzzy number as well. The payoff function of analyzed put option can be obviously replaced by more complex payoff structure.","[Holcapek, Michal; Tichy, Tomas] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,michal.holcapek@vsb.cz; tomas.tichy@vsb.cz,"Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020; Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Holcapek, Michal/AAV-9459-2021","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330;",,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,204,211,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300021,0

Multiple Nash equilibria are hard to find computationally accounting for spare prior literature discussion. Existing numerical literature on tariff games either assumes uniqueness or uses restrictive functional forms that guarantees this is the case. Here, we show for pure exchange Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) two country models with tariffs both how the introduction of a tariff can generate multiple competitive equilibria and related examples of widely separated multiple Nash equilibria. These typically occur when substitution elasticities are low, although implied import demand elasticities can still be high if the shares of trade in consumption are small. The implication seems to be that as one moves away from the constant elasticity excess demands (offer curve) formulations used in the optimal tariff literature to explicit structural models of international trade, multiplicity of Nash equilibria may well be present.","[Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Huang, Hui] Univ Regina, Fac Business Adm, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Whalley, John] Natl Bur Econ Res NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhang, Shunming] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Regina; Renmin University of China,"Whalley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",jwhalley@uwo.ca,,,,,,,16,1,3,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Using mutual fund data at the fund and individual levels during July 2001 to October 2008, we find that the disposition effect varies across market states. Our results suggest that investors redeem their mutual fund units more under a bear market than a bull market when they have extreme capital losses. When investors have moderate capital gains, they are less active in redeeming their mutual fund units under a bull market relative to a bear market. Under a neutral market, investors actively redeem mutual fund units in both winner and loser mutual funds except when they have extreme capital losses. Thus, disposition effect is not uniform; it varies by market condition. In addition, the disposition effect phenomenon also exists for Taiwan mutual fund investors as well.

When a firm increases cost-reducing R&D investment in a given product, its rivals will modify their entire R&D portfolios by reducing R&D investments in that particular product and increasing R&D investments in other competing products. Our analysis demonstrates that R&D portfolios will be more specialized when firms face greater competition, which will be the case if products become closer substitutes, a monopolist begins to face competition from a rival firm, or firms compete on price rather than quantity. R&D cooperation allows firms to internalize the negative externalities of their R&D investments in two ways: by reducing such investments across all products and by increasingly focusing their R&D portfolios on different products. Firms may completely shut down a subset of their R&D projects under R&D cooperation if the products concerned are sufficiently close substitutes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Escherichia coli and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)). The results support complex, nonlinear dynamic behavioural responses to perceived consumption harms. Consistent with previous research, the perceived negative long-run health effect from cholesterol caused consumers to transition their consumption behaviour from a higher to a lower level while retaining a persistent seasonal pattern. In contrast, responses to food safety information (i.e. E. coli or BSE) about beef derived from phase space reconstruction demonstrated temporary deviations from stable consumption patterns.","[McCullough, M.

Because the amount of federal money allocated to a community to combat homelessness may depend on unobserved characteristics of that community, I estimate a fixed-effects model that estimates the effect of new federal homeless funding on chronic homelessness.

By using these results the aim is to further examine a possible indicator for leveraging the efficiency of intellectual capital in a developing economy as a lesson. In order to perform this investigation, intellectual capital and shareholder value are quantified with, respectively, value added per employee and share price value per employee. These measurements are gathered from 17 Zimbabwean listed companies, divided into five industry sectors, that is, services, manufacturing, agriculture, mining and information technology, and tested statistically in order to find a relationship. This means, according to the researcher's propositions on the return on intellectual capital, that there also is a correlation between intellectual capital and shareholder value growth. In order to provide an indicator for improving companies' intellectual capital, a statistical examination concerning the relationship between the Intellectual Capital Multiplier (IC Multiplier) and value added is also performed. This examination shows that there is a strong correlation between the IC Multiplier and value added, value added can to a degree of 84 percent be predicted by the IC Multiplier, and that working with the ratio between structural and human capital is an excellent method for companies in developing economies to increase their intellectual capital. In conclusion it can be said that most companies in this investigation show moderately low values regarding the IC Multiplier, leading to an erosion of the companies' human capital. In order to become more stable and lower the degree of risk, these companies must improve their IC Multiplier. What this study demonstrates is that an improvement of the IC Multiplier also will have an extensive effect on the company's shareholder value growth.","Solusi Univ, Bulilimamangwe, Zimbabwe",,"Ngwenya, B (通讯作者)，Solusi Univ, Bulilimamangwe, Zimbabwe.",ngwenyab@solusi.ac.zw,"Ngwenya, Bongani/AAB-4107-2021","Ngwenya, Bongani/0000-0002-6852-1449",,,,,18,0,0,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,303,313,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000035,0

This question has hardly been investigated by social scientists in Poland. The aim of this article is to present a critical and in-depth review of the foreign literature on bequest behaviour, and to advance propositions for subsequent research. The up-to-date state of the art knowledge leads us to the hypothesis that bequests are left accidentally. Possible approaches to testing the hypothesis are discussed with a particular focus on how informative the making of a will and the subjective probability to bequeath might be. We conclude that the up-to-date attempts to answer why people bequeath and whether people want to bequeath remain unsuccessful. Further research should include a study on the prevalence of inheritances accompanied with a will; intertemporal analysis linking bequest behaviour and will-making with the subjective probability to bequeath; and finally the development of the theoretical model accounting for bequest behaviour yielding testable claims.","Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Populat Econ, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Nicinska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Populat Econ, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland.",,"Nicińska, Anna/ABA-8084-2020","Nicińska, Anna/0000-0002-8299-3530",,,,,85,0,0,0,9,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We evaluate and compare their effects on time until job entry, stability of employment, and earnings. Further, we examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects according to the timing of training during unemployment as well as across different subgroups of participants. We find that participating in short-term training reduces the remaining time in unemployment and moderately increases job stability. Long-term training programs initially prolong the remaining time in unemployment, but once the scheduled program end is reached participants exit to employment at a much faster rate than without training. In addition, they benefit from substantially more stable employment spells and higher earnings. Overall, long-term training programs are well effective in supporting the occupational advancement of very heterogeneous groups of participants, including those with generally weak labor market prospects. However, from a fiscal perspective only the low-cost short-term training schemes are cost efficient in the short run.","[Osikominu, Aderonke] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Osikominu, Aderonke] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; [Osikominu, Aderonke] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Osikominu, Aderonke] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Zurich; University of Freiburg; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Osikominu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,60,29,33,3,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Alternative specifications of happiness model that incorporate adaption, comparison incomes and other relevant variables are estimated using the panel data from the five waves (2001-2005) of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) surveys. The statistical tests provide no support for the adaptation effect on happiness. However, we find strong support for the theory of social comparison as an explanation for the happiness paradox. An increase in peer group income hurts the poor more than the rich, suggesting that a redistribution of income is likely to enhance the overall wellbeing of society.

Therefore, the impact of pressure of domestic aggregate demand and external equilibrium on the evolution of fixed capital productivity during a period of time should be emphasized. The respective model is applied to the case of Romania. At the end of the paper, having in view Romania's experience during two decades (1990-2010), arguments are presented to reinforce the thesis of R.

Given the innovative nature of pharmaceutical drugs and their impact on health care expenditure there is a surprisingly small literature devoted to this topic. Some information flow mechanisms have been examined individually in the literature, but very few have captured the simultaneous impact of these mechanisms on up-take and diffusion. This article uses the up-take of statins as an example. Diffusion of this therapeutical group is expressed as a function of four specific informational channels: self-experience, consumption externalities, scientific evidence and marketing. In addition to this, the influence of economic factors is tested to examine whether they have any role in drug diffusion. Prescription data from over 130 General Practitioners (GP) practices in the UK during 1991-2004 are used to test the econometric specification applying dynamic panel data methods. Results suggest individual self-experience and clinical evidence are major factors promoting diffusion, while there is an inverse relationship with GP practice size and diffusion. Having controlled for these factors financial incentives and marketing appear to play little role.","[Serra-Sastre, Victoria] City Univ London, Dept Econ, London EC1V 0HB, England; [McGuire, Alistair] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, London WC2A 2AE, England",City University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Serra-Sastre, V (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Econ, London EC1V 0HB, England.",v.serra-sastre@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,5,7,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main argument for selecting this area of interest is the impact of the prolonged economic downturn which transformed radically the educational system. The research methodology includes three different phases, with unique research instruments: two questionnaires dedicated to beneficiaries and academic staff in higher education. The first stage is focusing on a theoretical underpinning of the latest literature in the area of research. The next action is to create a questionnaire, considering both the literature review results and other studies from European countries where the tertiary educational system is similar to the Romanian one. Finally, the last part is dedicated to analyze and validate econometrically by using inferential statistical analysis for evaluating the initial research hypothesis.

We use infant mortality as a health status indicator and find a significant and positive link between infant mortality and income inequality using cross-national data for 93 countries. Holding constant the income of each of the three poorest quintiles of a country's population, we find that an increase in the income of the upper 20% of the income distribution is associated with higher, not the lower infant mortality. Our results are robust and not just caused by the concave relationship between income and health. The estimates imply a decrease in infant mortality by 1.5% for a one percentage point decrease in the income share of the richest quintile. The overall results are sensitive to public policy: public health care expenditure, educational outcomes, and access to basic sanitation and safe water can explain the inequality-health relationship. Thus, our findings support the hypothesis of public disinvestment in human capital in countries with high income inequality. However, we are not able to determine whether public policy is a confounder or mediator of the relationship between income distribution and health. Relative deprivation caused by the income distance between an individual and the individual's reference group is another possible explanation for a direct effect from income inequality to health.","[Waldmann, Robert J.] Univ Rome, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Tacke, Tilman] McKinsey Corp, San Francisco, CA USA",Sapienza University Rome,"Waldmann, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Rome, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",robert.waldmann@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,9,9,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Further, we find that there always exists the problem of excessive entry under public leadership regardless of the degree of foreign ownership.

Quarterly data is used for the period 1981/82 to 2007/08. The results of GMM estimates indicate that there are ten broad pathways through which trade openness policy has an indirect effect on growth. Trade openness policy positively affects growth through its impact on physical capital, human capital, foreign investment, inflation, real exchange rate, foreign debt, corruption and foreign exchange market distortions, while it negatively affects growth through government consumption and democracy. The results also indicate that the positive effects outweigh the negative ones, thereby delivering the overall positive effect of trade openness policy on output growth.

The objective of the study is to examine the inter-temporal link between growth and poverty in Pakistan, over the next 25 years period i.e., from the years 2011 to 2035. The generalized version of variance decomposition and impulse response analysis is operated in this study to test the temporal causality among poverty measures (i.e., head count ratio, poverty gap and squared poverty gap), growth measures (i.e., average household income, industry value added and agriculture value added) and income inequality to see if the growth of income and poverty measures contains considerable information to predict each other, on the sectoral level of Pakistan i.e., rural, urban and national level. The results of variance decomposition analysis show that shock to household counts initially accounts for a considerable portion of the forecast error variance of average household income in all rural, urban and at national level respectively. Household counts have the highest impact on average income in Pakistan (approximately 93.2%), followed by urban region (approximately 90.5% in average) and the lowest in rural areas (approximately 82.3%) both in short- and long-run. Impulse response analysis demonstrates that growth, poverty measures and income inequality are so strongly knitted to one another that any positive shock to any one of them would be beneficial on the one hand and may be harmful on the other hand. The vicious cycle of poverty can only be scratched by giving consistent positive shocks to growth and negative shocks to income inequality. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These concerns are real and important. However, emphasizing these concerns implicitly suggests that unless these issues are taken into account, nuclear power would otherwise be cost effective compared to other forms of electricity generation. This implication is unwarranted. Throughout the history of nuclear power, a key challenge has been the high cost of construction for nuclear plants. Construction costs are high enough that it becomes difficult to make an economic argument for nuclear even before incorporating these external factors. This is particularly true in countries like the United States where recent technological advances have dramatically increased the availability of natural gas. The chairman of one of the largest US nuclear companies recently said that his company would not break ground on a new nuclear plant until the price of natural gas was more than double today's level and carbon emissions cost $25 per ton. This comment summarizes the current economics of nuclear power pretty well. Yes, there is a certain confluence of factors that could make nuclear power a viable economic option.

In this setting we investigate the issue of whether to allow the monopolist to diversify into the unregulated segment by owning a competitive firm. Under asymmetric cost information, if goods are substitutes a diversified monopolist, which exaggerates its costs in the regulated segment to charge a higher regulated price, stimulates the demand for the competitive affiliate. This strengthens the firm's incentive to inflate costs, since doing so generates a positive informational spillover to its profits in the competitive segment. Consequently, a regime of separation, which prevents the firm from operating in the competitive segment, is welfare-enhancing. Conversely, with complements, cost exaggeration in the regulated monopoly reduces the demand and harms profits in the competitive segment, and allowing the monopolist to diversify into the competitive segment therefore generates countervailing incentives, which weaken the firm's interest in cost manipulation and improve social welfare.","Humboldt Univ, Inst Econ Theory 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Fiocco, R (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Econ Theory 1, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",raffaele.fiocco@staff.hu-berlin.de,"Fiocco, Raffaele/AAE-1027-2020","Fiocco, Raffaele/0000-0002-8078-3222",,,,,38,3,3,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We introduce a novel method of secondary energy based mitigation shares, which allows us to quantify the economic mitigation potential of technologies in different regions and final energy carriers. The 2005 share of Asia in global CO2 emissions amounts to 38%, and is projected to grow to 53% under business-as-usual until the end of the century. Asia also holds a large fraction of the global mitigation potential. A broad portfolio of technologies is deployed in the climate policy scenarios. We find that biomass in combination with CCS, other renewables, and end-use efficiency each make up a large fraction of the global mitigation potential, followed by nuclear and fossil CCS. We find considerable differences in decarbonization patterns across the final energy types electricity, heat and transport fuels. Regional differences in technology use are a function of differences in resource endowments, and structural differences in energy end use. Under climate policy, a substantial mitigation potential of non-biomass renewables emerges for China and other developing countries of Asia (OAS). Asia also accounts for the dominant share of the global mitigation potential of nuclear energy. In view of the substantial near term investments into new energy infrastructure in China and India, early adoption of climate policy prevents lock-in into carbon intensive infrastructure and thus leads to a much higher long-term mitigation potential.

Where fewer than 2 percent of workers were being paid a minimum wage at the outset of this sample period, more than 8 percent of adult workers and 60 percent of teenage workers were receiving hourly earnings close to the minimum wage by the end of this period. These policy changes provide a unique opportunity to estimate the effects of the minimum wage on poverty. Although minimum wage workers are more likely to live in the poorest households, they are relatively widely dispersed throughout the income distribution. This is particularly true of teenage minimum wage workers. Furthermore, low-income households often do not contain any working members. We estimate that a 10 percent increase in minimum wages, even without a loss in employment or hours of work, would lower the relative poverty rate by less than one-tenth of a percentage point.","[Maloney, Tim] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Maloney, T (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",tim.maloney@aut.ac.nz,,"Pacheco, Gail/0000-0001-9988-0092",,,,,22,8,8,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We address this question by analyzing the impact of international migration flows from Albania, where migration is a massive and male-dominated phenomenon. We find that the labour supply of men and women responds differently to current and past migration. Controlling for the potential endogeneity of migration, estimates show that having a migrant abroad decreases female paid labour supply while increasing unpaid work. On the other hand, women with past family migration experience are significantly more likely to engage in self-employment and less likely to supply unpaid work. The same relationships do not hold for men. These results suggest that while left-behind women in Albania may take on the extra burden associated with the migration of male family members, they gain employment opportunities upon their return.

In this study we incorporate variable capital utilization into a neoclassical growth model, calculate total factor productivity taking into account capital utilization, and simulate the aggregate output and capital-output ratio. We found that although our total factor productivity growth rate in the 1990s is consistent with empirical studies, our simulation can explain the observed data. This result indicates the importance of capital utilization rates as a source of propagation during Japan's depression.(C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the standard New Keynesian framework prescribes that zero inflation is the optimal long-run target. In this paper, we show that when the baseline New Keynesian model is extended to allow for rule-of-thumb behavior by price setters, the optimality of zero long-run inflation ceases, and the monetary authority commits to a positive inflation target. The optimality of positive long-run inflation turns on the fact that the aggregate-supply relation does not imply an equivalence, up to first-order and regardless of policy, between the welfare-relevant measure of inflation and the discounted sequence of future output gaps.

For them the provision of employment-dependent UI creates an additional benefit from work: future UI eligibility. This paper explores the overall and distributional effects of providing unemployment compensation under partial coverage. I extend a standard search model to accommodate eligible and non-eligible workers, where eligibility status is determined by previous separation history. While the effect of unemployment benefits on unemployment duration and post unemployment wages is theoretically ambiguous, a calibration of the model to the U.S. economy shows that unemployment benefits raise the unemployment rate. In addition I show that wage gaps and unemployment duration differentials between the eligible and non-eligible exist and are larger when layoffs are high. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that churning does not necessarily reduce the return that a representative investor expects ex-ante from delegating trade to a manager. As uninformed managers churn, the level of noise in the market increases and informed managers generate higher returns than in the absence of churning. When fundamental volatility is relatively low, uninformed managers trade less aggressively and the high returns expected from informed managers more than compensate the losses expected from uninformed managers. While career concerns generally lead to an increase in trade volume, the pattern of churning that we highlight also implies that both the volume of uninformed trade and the aggregate volume of trade are positively related to the level of asset riskiness.

We parameterized the effect of selected internal (e.g. coal-fire presence), external (e.g. price and renewable energy mandates) and location (e.g. biomass availability, infrastructure) variables on the likelihood of using biomass in cofiring with coal by building a two-stage econometric model. The first stage controlled for factors driving the spatial location of coal power plants and the second stage concentrated on factors influencing cofiring. The empirical model was applied in the Northeast quadrant of the U.S. where the unit of observation was an individual county. Results of our model stress the significant effect of existing flexible coal feeding systems that permit the incorporation of biomass. transportation infrastructure and biomass availability (woody biomass in particular in the form of residues from the wood products industry). State-level renewable energy portfolio standards showed no statistically significant effect on the adoption of cofiring biomass with coal.

In other words, the proposed method allows us to examine whether agglomeration of mobile factors emerges from a uniform distribution and to analytically trace the evolution of spatial agglomeration patterns (i.e., bifurcations from various polycentric patterns as well as a uniform pattern) that these models exhibit when the values of some structural parameters change steadily. Applying the proposed method to a multi-regional CP model, we uncover a number of previously unknown properties of the CP model, and notably, the occurrence of spatial period doubling bifurcation in the CP model is proved.

These models are designed to be used on a monthly basis by integrating monthly economic information through bridge models, thus allowing for the economic interpretation of the data. We do also forecast German GDP by dynamic factor models. The combination of these two approaches allows selecting economically relevant explanatory variables among a large data set of hard and soft data. In addition, a rolling forecast study is carried out to assess the forecasting performance of the estimated models. To this end, publication lags are taken into account in order to run pseudo out-of-sample forecasts.

Much of this deforestation is driven by illegal logging. We use novel satellite data that tracks annual deforestation across eight years of Indonesian institutional change to examine how local officials' incentives affect deforestation. Increases in the number of political jurisdictions lead to increased deforestation and lower timber prices, consistent with Cournot competition between jurisdictions. Illegal logging and local oil and gas rents are short-run substitutes, but this effect disappears over time with political turnover. The results illustrate how local officials' incentives affect deforestation and show how standard economic theories can explain illegal behavior.","[Burgess, Robin] London Sch Econ, London, England; Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; World Bank, Washington, DC USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); The World Bank,"Burgess, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,"Hansen, Matthew C/ABE-7226-2020; potapov, peter/AAE-7388-2019","potapov, peter/0000-0003-3977-0021; /0000-0003-1918-4631",,,,,43,212,256,6,124,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

As previously documented, heterogeneity between different groups of trading firms is substantial. Taking into account intra-firm trade in addition to exporting and importing yields new insights into the productivity advantage previously established for exporting firms. The results presented here show that this premium accrues only to exporters that also import and to exporters that also engage in intra-firm trade, but not to firms that export only. Using simultaneous quantile regressions, the paper illustrates that heterogeneity within different groups of trading firm is equally large.

In recent years, even before the latest economic crisis, the emphasis in overlapping the gap in the quality of financial reporting was put on developing a model of internal audit functioning. Even besides the undoubtedly positive effect resulting from developing various models of internal control, sometimes catastrophic consequences of fraud were not avoided. International standards and code of ethics represent some of the instruments for the securing of independence and objectivity of auditors and professional accountants in regards to management demands. The objective of conducted interdisciplinary research was to point out the important role of personality traits and morality in acknowledgement of ethic principles by management, auditors and professional accountants in organization of corporate financial business operation, implementation of the systems of internal control and evaluating their functionality. This paper presents the results of personality trait research, evaluated by the questionnaire Big five plus two and of the morality of management, auditors and accountants from 15 companies (public, joint stock, limited liability, middle and big companies, and auditing houses). The research was conducted on the sample of 95 respondents (of both sexes, aged between 25 and 60). The results of this research have shown that ethics and morality in education of managers, auditors and accountants have a key role in acknowledging ethics principles in the course of performing their regular business and professional activities. Based on the conducted research, introducing an adequate education on basic concepts of ethics and professional code of ethics in high schools and higher education of managers, auditors and accountants is suggested, all leading to the goal of securing an unhindered implementation of the mentioned code of ethics within the model of corporate governance, as a key factor in the process of business decision making.","[Nerandzic, Branislav; Perovic, Veselin] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Zivkov, Emil] Petroleum Ind Serbia, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Nerandzic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",branen@uns.ac.rs; vesa@uns.ac.rs; emil.zivkov@nis.rs,,,,,,,13,4,4,0,63,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

When an upstream IP monopoly increases the number of licenses, it enhances product variety, adding to consumer value, but it also intensifies downstream competition, and thus dissipates profits. As a result, the upstream IP monopoly may want to provide too many or too few licenses relative to what maximizes consumer surplus or social welfare. With multiple IP owners, royalty stacking increases aggregate licensing fees and thus tends to limit the number of licensees, which can also reduce downstream prices for consumers.

Differences in energy efficiency across countries are modeled as a stochastic function of explanatory variables and I estimate the model using the cross-section of time-averaged data, so that no structure is imposed on technological change over time. Energy efficiency is measured using a new energy distance function approach. The country using the least energy per unit output, given its mix of outputs and inputs, defines the global production frontier. A country's relative energy efficiency is given by its distance from the frontier-the ratio of its actual energy use to the minimum required energy use, ceteris paribus. Energy efficiency is higher in countries with, inter alia, higher total factor productivity, undervalued currencies, and smaller fossil fuel reserves and it converges over time across countries. Globally, technological change was the most important factor counteracting the energy-use and carbon-emissions increasing effects of economic growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Operational risk events are rare and data is hard to collect This leads to very small data samples. Besides, a large number of empirical researches show that the distributions of operational losses are often skewed with fat tails. To address these issues, this paper puts forward a loss distribution approach (LDA) based on bootstrap sampling and piecewise-defined severity distribution (BS-PSD-LDA). The approach divides data samples into two distinct parts (high-frequency low-severity losses and low-frequency high-severity losses), and fits the two parts by lognormal distribution and Generalized Pareto distribution respectively. Using hand-collected samples of 426 operational losses in Chinese commercial banks during 1994-2010, we estimate the magnitude of operational losses using the BS-PSD-LDA method. We show that our method provides a better fit than the traditional parametric methods. Besides, the method using historical simulation of nonparametric method seems to offer a good fit to the sample as well. However, we believe that the BS-PSD-LDA approach offers improvement from the perspective of satisfying risk control requirement of the regulatory authority and ensuring the efficiency of funds' utilization.

Using methods developed by Stockman [Journal of Economic Theory 145 (2010), 1060-1085], we extend Zhang's analysis to prove that endogenous tariffs and endogenous labor income taxes are also equivalent in generating global indeterminacy (chaotic equilibria) under a balanced-budget rule. More precisely, we show that the existence of Euler equation branching in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a steady state can imply topological chaos in the sense of Devaney. In addition, Euler equation branching occurs regardless of the local uniqueness of the equilibrium around the steady state.","[Zhang, Yan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Econ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yan] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Econ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, 535 FaHuaZhen Rd, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China.",zhangyan77@sjtu.edu.cn,"Chen, Yan/AAK-6021-2020; Chen, yan/AAS-7870-2020","Chen, Yan/0000-0003-3429-904X; Chen, yan/0000-0002-7801-7203",,,,,16,3,3,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We use data from the auditing of Brazil's local governments to construct objective measures of corruption involving educational block grants transferred from the central government to municipalities. Using variation in the incidence of corruption across municipalities and controlling for student, school, and municipal characteristics, we find a significant negative association between corruption and the school performance of primary school students. Students residing in municipalities where corruption in education was detected score 0.35 standard deviations less on standardized tests, and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates. Using a rich dataset of school infrastructure and teacher and principal questionnaires, we also find that school inputs such as computer labs, teaching supplies, and teacher training are reduced in the presence of corruption. Overall, our findings suggest that in environments where basic schooling resources are lacking, money does matter for student achievement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we extend the general framework on incomplete enforcement of policy instruments to reflect the particularities of credit-based mechanisms. The main focus of the analysis is to determine the regulator's optimal spot-check frequency given plausible assumptions of incomplete enforcement under asymmetric information on reduction costs and heterogeneous verifiability of projects. We find that, depending on the actual abatement cost and penalty schemes, optimal monitoring for credit-based systems is often discontinuous and significantly differs from the one to be applied for cap-and-trade schemes or environmental taxes.

We examine the effect on investment of one suggested approach to reducing market power, contracting longer term. We construct a stylized model of an energy-only market where two firms, each specializing in one technology, invest in a first stage, contract part of their production in the second stage and sell the rest in the spot market in the third stage. We compare this model to one of an energy-only market having two stages, investment and a spot market. We find cases where the contracts change neither capacity nor peak prices, where the foreclosing effect of one player blocking the other from contracts markets increases investments and reduces prices, and where the opportunity to foreclose the market can incentivize one firm to lower its investment and increase its pricing power to the detriment of consumers. The model relies on the simplest possible assumptions of imperfect competition (subgame perfect equilibria with Cournot agents). We illustrate the different outcomes in a numerical example with two load steps (peak and off-peak) where we change one parameter, the height of the off-peak time segment. We find cases with increased and decreased capacity as well as no change in capacity. Since there is no general characterization of the consequences of contracts in this simple example, there can be no characterization in more complicated models that contain the market structures included here, and regulators or competition authorities cannot rely on contracts to induce sufficient capacity expansion by reducing market power. One other market mechanism that has been proposed to induce investment, a capacity auction with predetermined capacity requirements, is a potential alternative to limit market power that deserves further exploration to determine the extent to which it can provide an adequate incentive to invest in the presence of market power.","[Smeers, Yves] Catholic Univ Louvain, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Murphy, Frederic] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Universite Catholique Louvain; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Smeers, Y (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",fabienne.henry@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,20,5,6,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

While imprisonment for debt no doubt elicited some repayment by benefactors of the debtor, we argue that its primary function was to deter default in the first place by giving borrowers an incentive to disclose hidden assets. Because of its cost, however, imprisonment was destined to be replaced by more efficient ways of preventing borrowers from sheltering assets. Empirical analysis of state laws banning imprisonment for debt provides some support for this argument. In particular, the results suggest that states in which the publishing industry developed sooner (thus facilitating the flow of information) were more likely to enact early bans on imprisonment for debt.

In particular, we investigate how training, technology adoption, finance channels and exporting behavior affect SMEs' performance by examining the determinants of the profit per worker. Using a rich and up to date firm-level dataset, we find evidence that SMEs can improve performance by importing more foreign materials inputs and by utilizing foreign technologies from technologically advanced economies. This effect of technology spillover is particularly important for smaller enterprises in developing countries because in-house innovation is expensive. We further find that both informal finance sources and formal finance channels do not enhance the performance of smaller enterprises in financing daily operations and interestingly, informal channels hamper a firm's performance. There is no evidence for the effect of on-the-job training on firm performance. The exporting behavior of firms measured by the percentage of exports has no significant impact on firm performance.","[Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Polit Sci, TR-34732 Istanbul, Turkey; [Marco, Lau Chi Keung] Zirve Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Demir, Ender] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Adv Sch Econ, Venice, Italy",Istanbul Medeniyet University; Zirve University; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Bilgin, MH (通讯作者)，Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Polit Sci, D-100 Karayolu, TR-34732 Istanbul, Turkey.",mhbilgin@medeniyet.edu.tr; marco.lau@zirve.edu.tr; demir.ender@unive.it,"Demir, Ender/J-8808-2017; Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin/K-6487-2017; DJEFLAT, Abdelkader/AAV-2737-2020; Lau, Chi Keung/T-7850-2019","Demir, Ender/0000-0003-4034-269X; Lau, Chi Keung/0000-0002-2430-5592; Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin/0000-0002-9897-9792; Lau, chi keung/0000-0003-2488-1589",,,,,67,12,13,1,69,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Central and Eastern European and Baltic countries, which opted for fast and deep reforms including transformation of their business environments, rapidly narrowed the productivity gap with advanced economies. In contrast, in countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which embarked on reforms later and with less depth, the productivity gap remains large. Whereas the literature has focused mainly on empirical studies, this paper develops a dynamic search model of firm start-ups that reflects these trends. The model shows that an enabling business climate contributes to start-ups of highly productive firms at an earlier stage of transition, underscoring the importance of early reforms.

They also provide insight into the reasons for the housing crisis that initiated the current financial malaise. We find that homebuyers were generally well informed, and that their short-run expectations if anything underreacted to the year-to-year change in actual home prices. More of the root causes of the housing bubble can be seen in their long-term (10-year) home price expectations, which reached abnormally high levels relative to mortgage rates at the peak of the boom and have declined sharply since. The downward turning point, around 2005, of the long boom that preceded the crisis was associated with changing public understanding of speculative bubbles.","[Case, Karl E.] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA; [Shiller, Robert J.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Thompson, Anne K.] McGraw Hill Construct, Bedford, MA USA",Wellesley College; Yale University,"Case, KE (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA.",,,,,,,,24,99,109,0,40,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We consider a regional market in which a measure that has an incumbent release part of its gas to a marketer complements a program of investment in transport capacity dedicated to imports by the marketer, at a regulated transport charge, of competitively-priced gas. First, we examine the case where transport capacity is regulated while gas release is not, i.e., the volume of gas released is determined by the incumbent. We then analyze the effect of the artificial duopoly created by the regulator when the latter regulates both gas release and transport capacity. Finally, using information on the French industry, we calibrate the basic demand and cost elements of the model and perform some simulations of these two scenarios. Besides allowing us to analyze the economic properties of these scenarios, a policy implication that comes out of the empirical analysis is that, when combined with network expansion investments, gas-release measures applied under regulatory control are indeed effective short-term policies for promoting gas-to-gas competition.

While only Estonia has as of yet joined the common currency, Latvia and Lithuania maintain currency pegs in preparation for membership. But although the Eurozone's pull is unmistakable, it is possible that the Nordic countries on the Baltic Sea-with which the Baltics have enjoyed economic ties for centuries-might also have an important influence on the region's exchange markets. In particular, currency crises might more easily spread through the Baltic Sea region than to and from the Eurozone. This study investigates this relationship by generating indices of Exchange Market Pressure (EMP) for the three Baltic countries, Denmark, Sweden, and the Eurozone, before testing for contagion using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methods. Granger causality tests and impulse-response functions show that pressure on the Scandinavian currency markets, as well as stock price declines, lead to increased Baltic EMP more than do events in the Eurozone.","NE Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60625 USA",,"Hegerty, SW (通讯作者)，NE Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 N St Louis Ave, Chicago, IL 60625 USA.",S-Hegerty@neiu.edu,"Hegerty, Scott/AAF-5659-2020","Hegerty, Scott William/0000-0002-0999-561X",,,,,21,4,4,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Information about plumbers in Maryland reveals that in treating the Census number of black plumbers as licensed black plumbers-as Law and Marks implicitly do-they overstate the actual number by 4700 percent. It is therefore unsurprising that they do not find plumbing licensing to have negatively impacted blacks. The paper suffers from several other problems, as well, including: Law and Marks lump certification in with licensing; there is a sample selection bias in their method for including an occupation in the study; several of their findings are based on extremely low participation by blacks and women; they treat women as the minority in the field of nursing. Because of these and other problems, including the results of falsification tests, we judge their conclusions to be highly doubtful.","[Klein, Daniel B.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Powell, Benjamin] Suffolk Univ, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Vorotnikov, Evgeny S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",George Mason University; Suffolk University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Klein, DB (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",dklein@gmu.edu; benjaminwpowell@gmail.com; evvmail@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,4,4,0,6,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

The latter, now a part of European Union agricultural and rural policies, is intended to develop local initiatives in territorial development. Its application supposes that local stakeholders will enter into networks of cooperation for designing and implementing development projects. In the countryside of former East Germany, this process involves a mechanism of institutional transfers that require a genuine learning effort on the part of local populations. This case study borrows methods from the structuralist sociology to analyze how these networks of cooperation operate under the Leader Program. It is hypothesized that these systems of local action are part of a game involving logics of both institutional transfers and the geographical context, which post-Communism has marked.","Univ Perpignan, Dept Geog & Amenagement, UMR CNRS ART Dev 5281, F-66025 Perpignan, France",CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier,"Lacquement, G (通讯作者)，Univ Perpignan, Dept Geog & Amenagement, UMR CNRS ART Dev 5281, F-66025 Perpignan, France.",lacqueme@univ-perp.fr,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,20,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Prior to OPEC conferences, there is usually rampant speculation about which decision concerning world oil production levels (no change, increase, or cut) will be announced. The purpose of our investigation is to assess the impact of OPEC announcements on expectation and volatility of daily oil price changes (returns). We modify dummy variables indicating the day of an OPEC announcement to reflect a certain pattern of impact on return expectation and volatility. A combination of regression and GARCH models can then differentiate between pre- and post-announcement effects, and distinguish between the three kinds of OPEC decisions. We find evidence for a post-announcement effect on expectation, which is negative in the case of a cut decision and positive in case of an increase or maintain decision, while there is a positive pre-announcement effect on volatility, which is strongest in the case of a cut decision.

Both types of complication can be captured by a habits model, in which past consumption enters into an agent's current utility function. If the agent is forward-looking, or 'rational', then habits imply his consumption of the habit-forming good will be sensitive to his expectation of future market conditions, in particular future prices. This sensitivity implies, in turn, that traditional measures of price elasticity will underproject consumers' responsiveness to policy interventions. This paper examines the implications of rational habits on gasoline demand. Using a simple model encompassing myopic and rational habits, I demonstrate that an agent with rational habits will respond to anticipated future price changes and react more strongly to permanent than to temporary price changes, with this distinction increasing in the strength of the habit. I then estimate several habits models using panel data on U.S. states for the years 1989 through 2008. My preferred specification yields evidence of rational habits, and moreover I find consumers to be twice as responsive to tax-driven price changes as to market-driven price changes. Taxes and other policies that operate through the gasoline price are a more powerful policy instrument than traditional price elasticity would lead us to believe. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Because of ambiguous results in the literature, various econometrics methods are employed: univariate tests (URTs: ADF, PP, KPSS, DF-GLS), robust URTs including nonlinear URTs (Kapetanios and Sollis' and Bierens' test) and tests allowing for (multiple) structural breaks (Perron, Lee and Strazicich). The euro currency pairs (bilateral) of 10 European transition countries covering the period 1995:1-2011:1 are utilized. Our results for conventional linear (such as ADF or PP test) do not provide a crystal-clear answer, more robust URTs at least partially do, once the source of nonlinearities has been controlled for (structural changes, non-zero adjustment costs). Nonlinear tests with structural breaks provide more convincing evidence in favour of the PPP hypothesis including asymmetrical effects of exchange rate adjustments.","Univ Econ, Dept Monetary Theory & Policy, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zdárek, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Monetary Theory & Policy, W Churchill Sq 3, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",zdarekv@vse.cz,,,,,,,39,5,5,0,10,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Evidence suggests that despite this increase in labour supply, the wage paid to female clerical workers increased over the period and that the ratio of female clerical wages to male manufacturing wages was roughly constant. These labour market facts can be accounted for in a dynamic general equilibrium model in which an exogenous increase in human capital induces an increase in demand for skilled clerical workers. While induced technological change that favours skilled workers may account for the observed increase in female real wages, explaining the stagnate relative weekly wages paid to female clerical workers requires a framework that includes organizational change.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Adshade, M (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",marina.adshade@ubc.ca,,,,,,,21,3,5,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

In general, acquisitions can be associated with synergy gains, internalization advantages, and higher market power. Acquisitions, however, may also give rise to agency problems as well as new integration and organizational costs, leading to an ambiguous overall impact on the performance of acquirers. Based on a sample of more than 600 acquirers we show that both domestic and international acquisitions tend to reduce the performance of acquirers compared to non-acquiring firms. Examining how different deal, firm and industry level characteristics moderate the value destroying effects of acquisitions, our results suggest that Russian acquirers suffer from the inability to leverage value due to low M&A experience and capability, especially when making international acquisitions.

Finally, we also collect evidence from additional sessions in which the same options correspond to binary lotteries, in which subjects may win the high or the low prize with equal probability, but their decisions do not affect other participants. We frame subjects' decisions within the realm of a simple mean-variance utility maximization problem, in which the parameter associated to the variance is interpreted, depending on the treatment, as a measure of pure risk aversion, pure inequality aversion, or some combination of the two.

The model is analysed by means of numerical simulations and systemic risk modelling, where local interaction of units is captured and analysed by the bilateral provision of liquidity among units.

The major findings are twofold. First, growing social security spending has had detrimental effects on all of the private sector variables under consideration suggesting the existence of sizable inefficiencies. Second, these inefficiencies persist despite the successive reforms that took place over the last two decades. These results highlight the need for structural reforms of the pay-as-you-go system thereby addressing the sources of these inefficiencies, regardless of whether or not the system is financially sustainable. Furthermore, any reforms designed to address sustainability concerns cannot ignore these inefficiencies or risk making them even worse and thereby hindering the quest for sustainability itself.","[Pereira, Alfredo M.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Andraz, Jorge M.] Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Faro, Portugal; [Andraz, Jorge M.] Univ Evora, CEFAGE EU Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, Evora, Portugal",William & Mary; Universidade do Algarve; University of Evora,"Pereira, AM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",ampere@wm.edu; jandraz@ualg.pt,"Andraz, Jorge/B-5858-2009","Andraz, Jorge/0000-0001-9209-3344; Pereira, Alfredo Marvao/0000-0003-1381-0937",Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/ECO/64595/2006] Funding Source: FCT,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),,,41,1,3,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,,,PORT ECON J,Port.

This paper examines whether competition and innovation have a direct effect on labor productivity growth in EU goods-producing industries separated by three different industry types. The results show that the effect of R&D on labor productivity growth is not equal across industries, but rather depends on the innovation activities of sectors. The same is true for competition and labor productivity growth. The empirical evidence indicates that in unleveled industries (i.e. industries characterized by technologically unequal firms) like Specialized Goods Suppliers and Science-Based Innovators strong labor productivity growth originates with decreased competition and increased R&D, thereby supporting Schumpeterian arguments. The findings suggest Schumpeterian effects in Supplier-Dominated Goods-Producing Industries, but reveal decreasing labor productivity growth in these sectors when competition is strongly restricted.","Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Strobel, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",strobel@ifo.de,,,,,,,57,5,5,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2012,39.0,3,,,,,293,325,,10.1007/s10663-011-9169-0,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309994200002,0

We then calibrate the model for the US and explore quantitatively the revenue effects from capital taxation. We take adjustment dynamics after a tax change explicitly into account and compare with steady-state effects. We find, among other results, a self-financing degree of corporate tax cuts of about 70-90% and a very flat Latter curve for all capital taxes as well as for tax depreciation allowances. Results are strongest for the tax on capital gains. The model predicts for the US that total tax revenue increases by about 0.3-1.2% after abolishment of the tax. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal oil acquisition sizes in 2008-2020 under different scenarios are estimated. The effects of oil price, risks and elasticity value on inventory size are further investigated. It is found that the optimal stockpile acquisition strategies are mainly determined by oil price and total inventory costs. While oil supply disruption is not considered, China's optimal stockpile acquisition rate increases from 19.2 to 52 million barrels from 2008 to 2020. If an oil supply disruption occurs, the oil acquisition rate will be reduced significantly. However, it may not be a good strategy to interrupt oil reserve activities in order to minimize the total costs for the entire planning period. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For the same reason, different conditions may be equivalent for functions defined on some domains, while not in other cases. Understanding the role of domains is therefore a crucial issue in mechanism design. We illustrate this point by analyzing the role of two conditions, monotonicity and reshuffling invariance, that are always necessary, but not always sufficient for strategy-proofness. We identify domains, that we call intertwined, ensuring the equivalence between these two conditions and that of strategy-proofness for whatever functions are defined on them. We prove that some important domains are intertwined: those of single-peaked preferences, both with public and private goods, and also those arising in simple models of house allocation. We also discuss the relationship between our conditions on functions and domains with others considered in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, recently it is considered to be a multidimensional one. A useful tool for such analysis is to view deprivation as a degree providing a quantitative expression to its intensity for individuals. Such fuzzy conceptualisation has been widely adopted in poverty and deprivation research. This paper aims to further develop and refine this strand of research. First, we re-examine two aspects introduced by the use of fuzzy measures, as opposed to conventional poor/non-poor dichotomous measures, namely the choice of membership functions and the rules to manipulate, resulting fuzzy sets. Secondly, we propose fuzzy monetary and non-monetary measures with the membership functions of poor and non-poor. An application based on individual well-being data from Tunisian households in 1990 is presented to illustrate use of one of the proposed concept. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The limited reserves and negative environmental impacts associated with fossil fuel consumption make the renewable energy sources considerable alternatives in case environmental externalities are taken into consideration. Pricing models for renewable energy alternatives are commonly based on the same fundamentals as the fossil fuels, but this approach neglects some of the characteristics that are unique to renewable energy alternatives. In order to develop more accurate pricing models these unique variables which are mostly considered as market externalities need to be integrated in the current forms of pricing models. The originality of this work is its ability to combine social, technical, environmental and economic aspects using analytic network process in order to provide a more holistic point of view on factors impacting renewable energy pricing through a comparison of two case studies. United States (U.S.) and Turkey are the two cases analyzed in this paper. U.S. represents a developed economy whereas Turkey represents a developing economy. It is expected that the results of this work would be helpful for further research in understanding the dynamics behind pricing mechanism of the renewable sources in different environments. For instance, fundamental differences in relative importance of pricing factors between two case countries have been identified as different levels of enforcement through laws and regulations, impact of geographic characteristics on site selection and job opportunities created through new investments.

This paper quantitatively investigates the macroeconomic and welfare implications of relaxing borrowing constraints using a model with preferences featuring temptation and self-control. The model can capture two contrasting views: the positive view, which links increased indebtedness to financial innovation and thus better consumption smoothing, and the negative view, which is associated with consumers' overborrowing. I find that the latter is sizable: the calibrated model implies a social welfare loss equivalent to a 0.4 percent decrease in per-period consumption from the relaxed borrowing constraint consistent with the observed increase in indebtedness. The welfare implication is strikingly different from the standard model without temptation, which implies a welfare gain of 0.7 percent, even though the two models are observationally similar. Although both models imply welfare gains from a tighter borrowing limit than in 2000s, the optimal borrowing limit is tighter according to the temptation model, as a tighter borrowing limit helps consumers avoiding overborrowing.","Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Res Dept, Philadelphia, PA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Nakajima, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Res Dept, Philadelphia, PA USA.",makoto.nakajima@phil.frb.org,,,,,,,32,16,18,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

In this article, I extract and analyze the factors and key supply chains involved in changes in CO2 emissions associated with Japan's overall demand from 1990 to 2000 using the Structural Path Decomposition (SPD) method applied to the 1990-1995-2000 linked Japanese environmental input-output tables at the four-digit commodity classification level. The results reveal that the volume of CO2 emissions increased as a result of changes in the input structure of the electricity of the services sector, such as electricity -> amusement and recreation facilities -> household demand, electricity -> retail trade -> household demand and electricity -> public administration (local) -> local government demand, indicating increasing dependence of services on energy input. I also find that the final demand shift changed CO2 emissions, for example the rise in demand for integrated circuits in exports has contributed to increasing CO2 emissions generated from electricity, the fall in demand for frozen fish and shellfish in household demand has contributed to decreasing CO2 emissions from marine fisheries.

The present study proposes a new perspective to address the issue in the case of China's forward exchange rate market. Following the framework of Clarida and Taylor (1997), the term structures of exchange rates in the domestic forward and the non-deliverable forward markets are constructed and then applied to predict future spot exchange rates based on a vector equilibrium correction model. By comparing the forecast accuracy on the basis of the root mean square error and the mean absolute error, it is shown that dynamic out-of-sample forecasts of the domestic forward market are superior to those of the non-deliverable forward market, suggesting that domestic investors are better informed than foreign investors. The result has several important policy implications, especially for exchange rate determination.","[Wang, Xi; Yang, Jiaohui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Yang, JH (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lnswx@mail.sysu.edu.cn; jiaohui58@163.com,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2012,20.0,4,,,,,74,91,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01296.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,981VY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307001700005,0

Immigration is shown to have a negative impact on international relative prices. A 10% increase in the share of immigrant workers in total employment decreases the prices of final products by as much as 3%. Our results suggest that the tendency of this factor of production to relocate to relatively expensive high-wage countries exerts downward pressure on prices of tradeables and non-tradeables there relative to other locations. The effect of immigration on prices is more evident for goods consumed by immigrants as compared to goods produced by immigrants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The Destination manager has to choose how to allocate limited resources (capital and land) between either second homes or hotels. This conflict stems from the assumption of agents who have different linear preferences with respect to the allocation of limited resources. As a solution to this policy problem the authors consider three different policies: no intervention (laissez faire), taxation and temporary de-taxation policy. Comparing these different policies, they show that a compromise solution (internal solution), which results from the de-taxation policy, may be preferred by both agents over the clash of interests outcomes (corner solutions). Thus, the authors show that in a framework of conflict between agents a compromise solution may be preferable to both the absence of public intervention and the imposition of a tax by a public policy maker who has the discretionary power to regulate conflicts.","[Candela, Guido] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy",University of Bologna,"Candela, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy.",guido.candela@unibo.it,"Mussoni, Maurizio/AAJ-7553-2020","Mussoni, Maurizio/0000-0003-3932-6588; castellani, massimiliano/0000-0002-5814-5902",,,,,27,1,1,0,6,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 20,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201223.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-23,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,963TY,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305648700001,0

We construct a general equilibrium industry-dynamics model and quantitatively evaluate it using the cross-country data on entry costs and firing costs. Entry costs lower overall productivity in an economy by keeping low-productivity establishments in operation and making the establishment size inefficiently large. Firing costs lower productivity by reducing the reallocation of labor from low-productivity establishments to high-productivity establishments. The linear regression of the data on the model prediction accounts for 27% of the cross-sectional variation in total factor productivity. Moving the level of entry costs and firing costs from the U.S. level to that of the average of low income countries (countries with a Gross National Income below 2% of the U.S. level) reduces TFP by 27% in the model without capital, and by 34% in the model with capital and capital adjustment costs.","[Boedo, Hernan J.

The model includes limited access to international capital markets, limited participation by residents in the domestic financial system and limited labour mobility across sectors, features that are pervasive in these countries. Relative to developed countries, oil windfalls are likely to have larger aggregate demand pressures. A policy of fiscal smoothingassociated with a sovereign wealth fundcan help achieve macroeconomic stability and improve welfare. On the other hand, accumulation of reserves in response to the windfallwithout fiscal backingcan crowd out the private sector and reduce welfare.

The amount of risk taken for the group is generally lower than in the case where subjects decide for themselves only, indicating a cautious shift.

The intermittent nature of renewables, such as wind and solar, necessarily imposes complex trade-offs for regulatory objectives, such as resource adequacy (and system reliability) versus reductions in green house gas emissions. We develop a highly stylized model of investments in order to derive insights regarding the workings of regulatory incentives for increased renewable energy. We first show that incentives are indeed needed when there are significant economies of scale in the form of learning by doing or alternatively, when there is excess capacity in conventional technology due to legacy investments. We analyze two different regulatory schemes (feed-in tariffs and renewable portafolio standards) aimed at increasing investment in renewable capacity. We show that neither scheme is capable of inducing the socially optimal level of investment in renewable capacity. A single feed-in tariff fails to induce optimal investment as a feed-in tariff exceeding marginal costs of conventional technology incentivizes over-development of the most attractive sites which preempts investment in less attractive, yet socially valuable sites. A renewable portfolio standard that promotes increased investment in renewable technology induces under-investment in the conventional technology. These results suggest that a clinical regulatory design, that is, one that promotes the right amount of renewable capacity without affecting conventional capacity is a challenging proposition.","[Garcia, Alfredo; Barrera, Jorge] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Manuel Alzate, Juan] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia",University of Virginia; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Garcia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",agarcia@virginia.edu,,"Garcia, Alfredo/0000-0002-2761-7479; Barrera, Jorge/0000-0001-6775-7751",,,,,19,29,34,1,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In order to illuminate dynamics between monetary policy, asset prices and consumption, we use the structural vector autoregression method. The findings support the view that a loosening of China's monetary policy does indeed lead to higher asset prices. Furthermore, a positive shock to residential prices increases household consumption, while the role of stock prices seems to be small from the households' point of view. Finally, we test the existence of the wealth channel more formally to find out whether those changes in asset prices that are caused by monetary policy are significant enough to increase consumption. In summary, the wealth channel remains weak but there are some signs of it via residential prices.

Using survey data on debt management strategies, this paper studies whether the probability that a country has a formal debt management strategy, publishes the strategy document, and uses quantitative benchmarks to formulate its debt management strategy is affected by democratic accountability, institutional quality, past debt crises/defaults, official development assistance, and participation in debt management programs. We find that countries located in Latin America and the Caribbean are less likely to have developed a debt management strategy and, if they have, are less likely to publish it. In contrast, countries located in the Middle East and North Africa are less likely to use quantitative benchmarks in the formulation of their debt management strategies. A country is more likely to have developed a debt management strategy if it has the experience of a past debt crisis, but not of repeated debt crises. Institutional quality and democratic accountability could significantly contribute to the emergence of more transparent and accountable debt management strategies in developing countries.

Accompanying this policy change, concerns over competitiveness of energy intensive, trade exposed sectors as well as over limited environmental effectiveness via the channel of carbon leakage, have regained prominence. In this paper, we thus explore the impacts of potential EU policies to counter losses in international competitiveness and carbon leakage from the perspective of Austria. Based on numerical simulations with a computable general equilibrium model, we evaluate three policy options: an input subsidy for carbon allowances (thus reflecting the planned partially free allocation mechanism in the third EU ETS phase), a subsidy for domestic production, and an export rebate based on sectoral CO2 costs. Our results show that each policy has the potential to support domestic production in exposed sectors relative to a full auctioning scenario and thus increase competitiveness. However, none is imperatively effective at reducing Austria's net carbon emissions: while the carbon trade balance is improved and hence leakage declines, the tradability of emission permits within the EU ETS allows CO2 emissions from Austria's ETS output to increase. A cost benefit analysis indicates that the two policies promoting domestic output and exports are more cost effective than the CO2 input subsidy.","[Bednar-Friedl, Birgit; Kulmer, Veronika; Schinko, Thomas] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Bednar-Friedl, Birgit; Kulmer, Veronika; Schinko, Thomas] Graz Univ, Dept Econ, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Schinko, T (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Leechgasse 25, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",thomas.schinko@uni-graz.at,"Bednar-Friedl, Birgit/F-3257-2016","Bednar-Friedl, Birgit/0000-0002-8348-4615; Kulmer, Veronika/0000-0003-1339-3440",,,,,56,7,7,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2012,39.0,2,,,SI,,233,260,,10.1007/s10663-012-9186-7,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309994100005,0

We show that the length of the recall period had a large impact on reported morbidity, doctor visits; time spent sick; whether at least one day of work/school was lost due to sickness and; the reported use of self-medication. The effects are more pronounced among the poor than the rich. In one example, differential recall effects across income groups reverse the sign of the gradient between doctor visits and per-capita expenditures such that the poor use health care providers more than the rich in the weekly recall surveys but less in monthly recall surveys.

An infectious disease with SIS dynamics affects the labor force and the infected individuals are too ill to work. The susceptible (healthy) individuals choose how much labor to supply so that the effective labor supply comprises of the proportion of healthy individuals (extensive margin) and their labor supply (intensive margin). The epidemiology of disease transmission is modeled explicitly and the global dynamics of the economic variables is studied. Depending on how infectious the disease is, the disease may be eradicated or become endemic. If the disease is infectious enough, cycles and chaos emerge in the economy. A leading example illustrates the model: we show how the system dynamics change as the parameters vary and how the intensive margin responds to changes in the extensive margin due to the spread of diseases. We show how the fluctuations can be stabilized via disease control methods.","[Goenka, Aditya] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Liu, Lin] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",National University of Singapore; University of Rochester,"Goenka, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, AS2,Level 6,1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",goenka@nus.edu.sg; linliu@rochester.edu,"Goenka, Aditya/AAI-5557-2020","Liu, Lin/0000-0002-8222-7625",,,,,35,45,46,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This study explores the practical import of this concept within a specific market context: namely, a double-auction market for wholesale electric power that operates over a transmission grid with spatially located buyers and sellers. Each profit-seeking seller is a learning agent that attempts to adjust its daily supply offers to its best advantage. The sellers are co-learners in the sense that their supply offer adjustments are in response to past market outcomes that reflect the past supply offer choices of all sellers. Attention is focused on the emergence of co-learning patterns, that is, global market patterns that arise and persist over time as a result of seller co-learning. Examples of co-learning patterns include correlated seller supply offer behaviors and correlated seller net earnings outcomes. Heat maps are used to display and interpret co-learning pattern findings. One key finding is that co-learning strongly matters in this auction market environment. Sellers that behave as Code-Sunder budget-constrained zero-intelligence agents, randomly selecting their supply offers subject only to a break-even constraint, tend to realize substantially lower net earnings than sellers that tacitly co-learn to correlate their supply offers for market power advantages.

This paper attempts to analyse how, in open economies in which the export and import now/GDP ratio is very high, independence between the GDP and the exchange rate is not a plausible assumption, so the traditional version of the Marshall-Lerner condition is not sustained. The analytical model attempts to explain the potential impact of currency devaluation on the balance of trade, breaking down the total effect according to the degree of simultaneity among export and import flows. We use the Maximum Likelihood cointegration procedure to study the long-run equilibrium of exports and imports.

Additionally, the truncated-regression is employed to discuss whether or not the corporate governance would affect the performance of BHCs. The empirical results present the trade-off relationship with CAMEL indicators in the Tier1-Efficient BHCs. Moreover, it has been found that there are negative impacts on BHC's performance from board size, outside directors, the average age of directors and CEO/Chairman duality, while there are positive impacts from the number of committee and Big-4 auditors. The results further prove that corporate governance is important for the operating performance of BHCs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Considering a world made of good and bad suppliers, we show that the trust game admits a unique evolutionarily stable strategy: buyers may trust strangers if it is not too risky to do so.

This paper tests empirically for the relevance of three aspects of the attitude transmission process highlighted in this theoretical literature: (1) transmission of attitudes from parents to children; (2) an impact of prevailing attitudes in the local environment on child attitudes; and (3) positive assortative mating of parents, which enhances the ability of a parent to pass on his or her attitudes to the child. We focus on two fundamentally important attitudes, willingness to take risks and willingness to trust others. We find empirical support for all three aspects, providing an empirical underpinning for the literature. An investigation of underlying mechanisms shows that socialization is important in the transmission process. Various parental characteristics and aspects of family structure are found to strengthen the socialization process, with implications for modeling the socialization production function and for policies focused on affecting children's non-cognitive skills. The paper also provides evidence that the transmission of risk and trust attitudes affects a wide variety of child outcomes, implying a potentially large total effect on children's economic situation.","[Dohmen, Thomas] Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Falk, Armin] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Huffman, David] Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Sunde, Uwe] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland",Maastricht University; University of Bonn; Swarthmore College; University of St Gallen,"Dohmen, T (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",,,"Dohmen, Thomas/0000-0002-9321-0319",,,,,55,419,466,8,163,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

This cushioning of disposable income leads to a demand stabilization of up to 30% in the EU and up to 20% in the US. There is large heterogeneity within the EU.

Consumption, income and wealth are cointegrated in their common components. The impact of house prices exceeds the effect arising from equity wealth. The long run vector is broadly in line with the life cycle permanent income hypothesis, if house prices are allowed to enter the relationship. At the idiosyncratic level, a long run equilibrium is detected between consumption and income, i.e. the wealth variable can be excluded. The income elasticity in the idiosyncratic relationship is significantly less than unity. Hence, the presence of wealth effects in consumption equations arises from the international integration of asset markets and points to the relevance of risk sharing activities of agents. Without sufficient opportunities, an increase in national saving rates would be expected, leading to a lower path of private consumption expenditures.","[Dreger, Christian] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Reimers, Hans-Eggert] Hsch Wismar, D-23952 Wismar, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Dreger, C (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",cdreger@diw.de; hans-eggert.reimers@hs-wismar.de,"Dreger, Christian/AAF-6719-2020",,,,,,41,5,6,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

We model a countervailing force. Restricting one's choices to the most easily comparable options is a psychologically well-attested heuristic. Consumers who use this heuristic favour firms that follow common conventions about tariff structures. Because a common standard promotes price competition, a firm's use of it signals that it offers value for money, validating the heuristic. This allows an equilibrium in which firms use common standards and set competitive prices.","[Gaudeul, Alexia] Univ Jena, GSBC, D-6900 Jena, Germany; [Sugden, Robert] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Sugden, Robert] Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Gaudeul, A (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, GSBC, D-6900 Jena, Germany.",,"Sugden, Robert/B-1153-2012; Gaudeul, Alexia/B-7556-2015","Gaudeul, Alexia/0000-0003-3397-4234; Sugden, Robert/0000-0002-3401-3139",,,,,26,11,13,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2012,79.0,314,,,,,209,225,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2011.00895.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,914WC,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301982500001,0

When labor adjustment takes place solely at the extensive margin, forecast-based policy that meets the Taylor principle is likely to induce indeterminacy and E-instability, regardless of whether it is strictly or flexibly inflation targeting. When labor adjustment takes place at both the extensive and intensive margins, the strictly inflation-forecast targeting policy remains likely to induce indeterminacy, but it generates a unique E-stable fundamental REE as long as the Taylor principle is satisfied. Therefore, the presence of search and matching frictions changes the determinacy properties of a strictly inflation-forecast targeting policy, and alters its E-stability properties when only an extensive margin is present but not when labor adjustment takes place at both margins.

A key feature of the data is the availability of objective measures of literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills, along with a rich array of personal and job-related characteristics. The mean return to an additional year of education is estimated to be 6.2 per cent, almost one-third of which may be attributed to the acquisition of cognitive skills. Controlling for cognitive skills in the earnings equation has a small effect on the estimated return to labour market experience, while accounting for approximately half of the negative wage gap for immigrants from NESBs. The return to cognitive skills is uniform across quantiles of the conditional hourly earnings distribution. There is strong evidence of credentialism in the returns to education in Australia. A significant component of the sheepskin effects in the returns to education is attributable to the higher cognitive skills associated with the completion of a credential.","Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Barrett, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",garry.barrett@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,36,12,13,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

The empirical evidence clearly shows that, for all of the REIT returns, the overall variance of the transitory component is significantly smaller than the corresponding variance for the permanent component.

On the other hand, the arrival of unions in the workplace may 'shock' the management into adopting more systematic rather than ad hoc management practices and that such innovative workplace practices may enhance an organization's ability to introduce new products and/or new processes. Further, the 'voice face' of unions argues that the independent 'questioning' of the management deliberations by the unions can also lead to better, more creative and, hence, more productive solutions.

It first examines general relationships between biodiversity and economic development before showing how biodiversity influences ecosystem services. Second, future scenarios and challenges for biodiversity and development are examined, given projections for further changes in global population, economic growth, and consumption. Third, the relationship between biodiversity protection and incomes is investigated. Two specific policies, protected areas and bioprospecting, are reviewed with respect to their impacts on the welfare of the resource-dependent poor. In conclusion, improvements in policy design and implementation could help minimize the possibility of earth's sixth mass extinction event, at least within a few generations, while ensuring that the poor are not made worse off as a result of policy implementation.","[Palmer, Charles; Di Falco, Salvatore] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Palmer, C (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",c.palmer1@lse.ac.uk; s.difalco@lse.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,94,25,29,3,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Short-run dynamics show a bi-directional feedback relationship between energy consumption and exports, output and exports and output and imports. There is evidence of a one way short-run relationship from energy consumption to imports. In the long-run there is evidence of a causal relationship between trade (exports or imports) and energy consumption. These results have implications for energy policy and environmental policy. One important implication of these results is that environmental policies designed to reduce energy use will reduce trade. This puts environmental policy aimed at reducing energy consumption at odds with trade policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In both cases, we find applications of some sort of classical practical reason approach to social order. The former tends to be centered on the idea of justice, the latter on democracy. The major difference is that law tends to be instrumental for institutionalists, while for Proudhon, the law is based on morals and is an expression of justice. Thus, institutionalism accepts public law as a mechanism of allocation and sees the state as an important factor in the enforcement of rights. On the contrary, Proudhon opposed any form of political control and based his revolution on social law.","Univ Padua, Dept Econ, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Solari, S (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",,,,,,,,43,2,2,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In particular, the reinsurance premium is assumed to be calculated via the variance principle instead of the expected value principle. Our objective is to maximize the expectation of the discounted dividend payments minus the discounted costs of capital injection. This optimization problem is studied in four cases depending on whether capital injection is allowed and whether there exist restrictions on dividend policies. In all cases, closed-form expressions for the value function and optimal dividend and reinsurance policies are obtained. From the results, we see that the optimal dividend distribution policy is of threshold type with a constant barrier, and that the optimal ceded proportion of risk exponentially decreases with the initial surplus and remains constant when the initial surplus exceeds the dividend barrier. Furthermore, we show that the optimization problem without capital injection is the limiting case of the one with capital injection when the proportional transaction cost goes to infinity.

Second, how can we explain these patterns of behavior? Third, how can we use these insights to control evasion?

We find that overall, for a given total prize sum, a single large prize generates higher contributions to the public good than three smaller prizes. As predicted by the theory, a single prize provides a more effective incentive for high-income individuals.

We show that firms endogenously form a number of distinguishable industries as accumulated knowledge induces them to agglomerate in the technology space. Knowledge accumulation in existing industries reduces production costs, but, as the diminishing returns from learning sets in, some firms start to adopt previously unexplored technologies so that their new goods fit consumers' unsatisfied wants and attract large demand. Thus, sporadic emergence of new industries generates growth cycles, where both the timing and the new technology to be adopted are endogenously determined. New industries based on new technology reduce the rate of per capita GDP growth in the initial phase, but nonetheless are indispensable for sustained economic growth in the long run.

We first identify the fundamental property of conflict technology which the two commonly used contest success functions, the difference and ratio forms, share. Using this property, named the constant elasticity of augmentation, we construct a new class of contest success functions, hence generalizing the two forms. We provide axiomatic and probabilistic characterizations of the new contest success function. Then, adopting the new contest success function, we study how the elasticity of augmentation affects the trade-off between guns and butter, and countries' international policy to settle or wage a war.

However studies of the impact of immigration have failed to find any significant effect on the wages of native-born workers in the UK. This is potentially puzzling since there is evidence that changes in the supply of educated natives have had significant effects on their wages. Using a pooled time series of British cross-sectional micro data on male wages and employment from the mid-1970s to the mid-2000s, this paper offers one possible resolution to this puzzle, namely that in the UK natives and foreign born workers are imperfect substitutes. We show that immigration has primarily reduced the wages of immigrantsand in particular of university educated immigrantswith little discernable effect on the wages of the native-born.","[Manacorda, Marco] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England; [Manning, Alan] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Wadsworth, Jonathan] Univ London, Royal Holloway Coll, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Manacorda, M (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, London, England.",m.manacorda@lse.ac.uk; a.manning@lse.ac.uk; j.wadsworth@rhul.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,38,226,253,1,68,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

In the first step we use labor demand functions to estimate the elasticity of substitution across different groups of workers. Second, we use the underlying production structure and the estimated elasticities to calculate the total wage effects of immigration in the long run. We emphasize that a production function framework is needed to combine own-group effects with cross-group effects in order to obtain the total wage effects for each native group. In order to obtain a parsimonious representation of elasticities that can be estimated with available data, we adopt alternative nested-CES models and let the data select the preferred specification. New to this paper is the estimate of the substitutability between natives and immigrants of similar education and experience levels. In the data-preferred model, there is a small but significant degree of imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants which, when combined with the other estimated elasticities, implies that in the period from 1990 to 2006 immigration had a small effect on the wages of native workers with no high school degree (between 0.6% and +1.7%). It also had a small positive effect on average native wages (+0.6%) and a substantial negative effect (-6.7%) on wages of previous immigrants in the long run.","[Ottaviano, Gianmarco I.

Campaign spending limits are purported to restrict the incumbent's ability to exploit his fundraising advantage. In contrast to conventional wisdom, a ceiling increases the incumbent's probability of victory regardless of the candidates' relative fundraising abilities as long as the challenger is not more effective in campaign spending. If the challenger is more effective in campaign spending, ceilings have a non-monotonic effect when the incumbent enjoys a mild initial voter disposition advantage: A moderate ceiling decreases the incumbent's probability of victory but further restricting the limit favors the incumbent. Irrespective of incumbency status, the marginal benefit to quality decreases with a more restrictive cap. In an open-seat contest, a more restrictive limit improves the electoral prospects of the superior quality candidate. Stricter ceilings may lead to the unintended consequence of increased expected spending. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It starts from the Allingham and Sandmo (J. Public Econ. 1:323-338, 1972) modeling of the tax evasion decision as a choice under uncertainty based on expected utility maximization and risk aversion. It goes on to discuss alternative specifications of the taxpayer's preferences with particular regard to the explanation of the extensive margin, i.e. the decision on whether or not to engage in tax evasion. It extends the model to the case of variable labor supply with work in both official and black labor markets. It then considers the application of the theory to taxes on wealth and income from capital, indirect tax evasion, and smuggling. It also includes a consideration of general equilibrium effects and of the problems that evasion causes for the theory of optimal income and commodity taxes. It concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of tax evasion for economic policy in the welfare state.","Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Sandmo, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",agnar.sandmo@nhh.no,,,,,,,41,25,28,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We find evidence that asset price volatility affects the volatility of fiscal policy stance in a positive and significant way. The effect comes primarily through residential property and equity price volatility on government revenue and spending. Increased volatility in commercial property prices is associated with increased variability of government revenue. Output growth volatility is the dominant determinant of revenue and primary balance variability, whereas bad budgetary conditions and the size of the public sector are the most significant determinants of spending variability. Trade openness leads to greater variability of government spending, revenue and primary balance to GDP ratios.","Bank Greece, Econ Res Dept, Athens 10250, Greece",European Central Bank; Bank of Greece,"Tagkalakis, A (通讯作者)，Bank Greece, Econ Res Dept, 21 El Venizelos Av, Athens 10250, Greece.",atagkalakis@bankofgreece.gr,"Tagkalakis, Athanasios/AFV-8927-2022; Tagkalakis, Athanasios/JPX-7959-2023","Tagkalakis, Athanasios/0000-0003-4787-7363;",,,,,42,2,2,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2012,39.0,1,,,,,123,156,,10.1007/s10663-011-9167-2,0.0,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309994000007,0

Workers who show commitment to their organizations are less likely to leave and might be more likely to score high on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Organizational commitment in the hospitality sector is the psychological affection and affiliation of an employee to a hotel in which he/she works. Committed and satisfied employees always focus on qualitative work to enhance customer satisfaction, profitability and growth. Hotel employers should also reciprocate the demand of their employees.

The low-income country chooses whether to enforce an International Patent Regime (strict IPR) or not (weak IPR), and the high-income country chooses whether to allow parallel imports (PI) of on-patent drugs or market-based discrimination (MBD). We show that, for a moderately high imitation cost, both (strict IPR, PI) and (weak IPR, MBD) emerge as the subgame prfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) policy choices. For relatively smaller imitation costs, (weak IPR, MBD) is the unique SPNE policy choice. The welfare properties reveal that although innovation may be higher at the (strict IPR, PI) policy regime, the market coverage and national welfare of the low-income country, and the total welfare are all lower.

Our empirical studies of these extreme events rely on long-term data now covering 28 countries for consumption and 40 for GDP. A baseline model calibrated with observed peak-to-trough disaster sizes accords with the average equity premium with a reasonable coefficient of relative risk aversion. High stock-price volatility can be explained by incorporating time-varying long-run growth rates and disaster probabilities. Business-cycle models with shocks to disaster probability have implications for the cyclical behavior of asset returns and corporate leverage, and international versions may explain the uncovered-interest-parity puzzle. Richer models of disaster dynamics allow for transitions between normalcy and disaster, bring in postcrisis recoveries, and use the full time series on consumption. Potential future research includes applications to long-term economic growth and environmental economics, and the use of stock-index options prices and other variables to gauge time-varying disaster probabilities.","[Barro, Robert J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ursua, Jose F.] Goldman Sachs, Global Investment Res, New York, NY 10282 USA",Harvard University,"Barro, RJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rbarro@harvard.edu; jose.ursua@gs.com,,,,,,,52,59,68,0,28,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4604-1,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The proposed indicators are grouped according to the criteria of four aspects of the concept (environmental, economical, social and spatial). It was decided to offer only the sample indicators, which can measure both internal sustainable development policy in company and its external dimension. The proposals of sustainable indicators presented in this paper represent only a small part of the tools which serve to measure the degree of implementation of sustainable development policy in real estate development company's strategy. It is suggested to asses the level of implementation of sustainable development concept by comparing relevant indicators of company with those achieved in a sector leader company. The main value of this paper is a practical, not just general, set of indicators proposed which can be used to measure the value added for a company and its competitive advantage.

The results of the empirical tests on a panel of emerging countries suggest that bank based financial systems are associated with crises slightly more expensive, whereas the relationship between the bond markets and the crises' costs is fragile. Moreover, financial systems where bond markets play an important role are associated with a higher growth of the production, and this, independently of the presence or not of crises. The consideration of the combined effect of financial liberalization and institutional framework on the bond markets development shows the importance of the direction of the financial liberalization. We join in this case one of the most significant aspects of the sequencing theorized by McKinnon (1973). Finally, an effective prudential regulation tends to reduce significantly the probability of occurrence of banking crises.","Univ Tunis, Dept Econ & Methodes Quantitat, Inst Super Gest, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis,"Boukhatem, J (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis, Dept Econ & Methodes Quantitat, Inst Super Gest, Tunis, Tunisia.",jboukhatem@yahoo.com,,,,,,,47,3,3,0,13,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,5,,,,,625,646,,10.2298/PAN1205625B,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,068XA,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313398300006,0

For checking the causal relationship between economic development and human capital formation, pair-wise Granger causality test is used for time series data (1972 to 2009). The results of the cointegration show that the variables are cointegrated. They have long-run stable equilibrium relationship. The results of the causality test show a bidirectional causal relationship between economic development and human capital formation.","[Chani, Muhammad Irfan] Natl Coll Business Adm & Econ NCBA&E, Lahore 54600, Pakistan; [Hassan, Mahboob Ul] Univ Cent Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan; [Shahid, Muhammad] Govt Punjab, Dept Hlth, Sheikhupura, Pakistan",University of Central Punjab,"Chani, MI (通讯作者)，Natl Coll Business Adm & Econ NCBA&E, 40-E-I,Gulberg 3, Lahore 54600, Pakistan.",,"Chani, Muhammad Irfan/AHD-7685-2022; Chani, Muhammad Irfan/GLU-5388-2022","Chani, Muhammad Irfan/0000-0002-5728-8215",,,,,24,1,1,0,8,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

The resulting quadratic relationship between emissions and income are partly due to the structural change of energy supply in Taiwan, with the introduction of nuclear energy in 1980 to 1986. This relationship is quite unique and different from the N-shaped relationships in some developed countries (de Bruyn and Opschoor, 1997; Friedl and Getzner, 2003). The CO2 emissions in Taiwan increase with the increasing imports of raw materials for economic activities and the increasing use of electricity. There is no evidence that the substantial increase of Taiwan's service sector contributed to slowing its CO2 emissions.","Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 11116, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University,"Chen, WJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, 55 Hwa Kang Rd, Taipei 11116, Taiwan.",cwj@faculty.pccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,41,5,5,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We argue that previous studies, however, have not paid sufficient attention to the distinction between constraint and incentive effects and that these operate quite differently for hard and soft fixes. Using annual data for 31 emerging and 32 developing countries during 1990-2003, our analysis implies that hard fixes should have much stronger discipline effects on money growth and inflation and our empirical study supports their prediction. Our theoretical analysis suggests that neither hard nor soft fixes are likely to provide strong discipline over fiscal policy and this is confirmed by our empirical analysis as well.","[Chiu, Eric M.

Estimating the empirical growth model gives results that show variation across the sub-groups, with the general picture of significant negative short-run effect and insignificant long-run effect of military burden on per capita GDP growth, not consistent across the different income groups. In addition, breaking down the SSA group into those involved in conflict and those that are not, provides some further intriguing findings that suggest the value of further work on the impact of conflict on growth.","[Dunne, John Paul] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Dunne, John Paul] Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of Cape Town; University of West England,"Dunne, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",John.Dunne@uct.ac.za,"Dunne, John Paul/K-9455-2019","Dunne, John Paul/0000-0001-6150-7663",,,,,19,18,18,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The focus is on the transition over time during the period 1991 to 1999. This period covers both upturns and downturns of the business cycle, providing a unique opportunity to consider the importance of the timing of graduation. The results show that the risk of unemployment and the unemployment duration have varied considerably with the business cycle, both within and between cohorts. For example, the field of education is of more importance for the outcomes during recessions. Further, the relative risk of unemployment has decreased over time for individuals with the highest degree of education whereas the unemployment duration has increased, indicating that the selection into unemployment for this group may have changed over time.

The two most important causes were the rise, 1904-37, of about 30% in real wages on the one hand and the reduction of one-third in the number of people in the average household over the same period. Between them, these two changes imply a near doubling of the income per capita of an average household supported by a worker on the average wage. We conclude with a discussion of deeper causes.","[Gazeley, Ian] Univ Sussex, Dept Hist, Brighton BN1 9QN, E Sussex, England; [Newell, Andrew] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Gazeley, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Hist, Brighton BN1 9QN, E Sussex, England.",a.t.newell@sussex.ac.uk,,"Gazeley, Ian/0000-0002-4277-1001",ESRC [ES/H000666/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H000666/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,52,6,8,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The Open Skies agreement between USA and the EU, in effect since 2008, is currently the highest existing form of intercontinental air transport liberalization and is widely considered to be a vital breakthrough in the 60-year old fight to normalize the industry and subject it to the competitive powers of the market. Positive impacts of the Agreement have been largely outbalanced by the adverse effects of the global economic crisis the number of North Atlantic passengers decreased by 1,8 million (7.3 per cent) from 2007 to 2009. Using linear regression models we come to the conclusion that had the Open Skies agreement not been signed, the decrease would have been by 3 million annual passengers more dramatic. As a result we claim that liberalization of air transportation has positive impact on the volume of traffic even in the times of crisis.","Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Medzinarodnych Vztahov, Katedra Medzinarodnych Ekonomickych Vztahov & Hos, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Grancay, M (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Medzinarodnych Vztahov, Katedra Medzinarodnych Ekonomickych Vztahov & Hos, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-B, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia.",Martin_grancay@yahoo.com,"Grancay, Martin/N-9889-2014","Grancay, Martin/0000-0002-7006-147X",,,,,15,1,1,0,9,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Reciprocal countries reward fair behavior (positive reciprocity), but retaliate against countries behaving unfairly (negative reciprocity). We demonstrate that reciprocal countries that have moderate expectations from each other with respect to their national abatement strategies can support a greater degree of environmental cooperation than self-interested ones. However, when only very high abatement standards are deemed fair, then reciprocity could have a detrimental effect on international environmental cooperation. Our model therefore provides a novel perspective on the role of expectations in environmental negotiations.","[Hadjiyiannis, Costas] Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Iris, Doruk; Tabakis, Chrysostomos] Univ Nova Lisboa, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal",University of Cyprus; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Hadjiyiannis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.",hadjiyiannis.costas@ucy.ac.cy; dorukiris@novasbe.pt; ctabakis@fe.unl.pt,"Doruk, Iris/AAD-2442-2019; Hadjiyiannis, Costas/R-7959-2017","Doruk, Iris/0000-0001-6829-5691; Hadjiyiannis, Costas/0000-0002-6660-7871",,,,,36,9,9,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The estimated demand elasticities were then incorporated into the measurement of Hicksian compensating variation to analyse the consumer welfare effects of price changes in food and energy.

Based on broad existing theoretical and empirical knowledge, we constructed measures for this research derived from existing literature. The hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling. The analyzed sample consisted of 199 Czech respondents. The results confirm effect of CE on buying behavior as well as national identity influence on CE. In the Czech context, CE significantly and positively influenced domestic purchase behavior. Alternatively, there was only a marginal influence of CE supported its negative effect on foreign purchase behavior. Cosmopolitanism did not affect CE in the Czech context. Therefore, the research findings suggest a prevalent influence of CE on buying behavior under conditions of economic crisis. The paper concentrates on ignored area that was very hard hit by economic crisis in Central and Eastern Europe. The findings provide useful information to marketing specialists in designing their marketing strategies for local made-in communication campaigns. In addition, implications for retailers to evaluate their merchandise assortment portfolio are implied from the findings. We build on the positive influence of CE on buying behavior of domestic products versus foreign, and infer preference for freshness and quality of goods. This suggest implications for public policy implications related to local job creation and employment, especially within the area of small local producers, self-employment, development of local agriculture, as well as countryside maintenance. This issue seems to gain more importance and attention given the nature of the global economic crisis for consumers, producers, retailers and government.

This process is illustrated by data on the rapid entry of MNEs into the motor vehicles sector of the Czech Republic, which occurred before the recent crisis. This article analyses the behaviour and interactions of two types of companies: national firms and MNEs, which operate in all sectors of the economy. We aim to understand the performance of each type by conducting a detailed analysis of firms' costs and how they are affected by the arrival of MNEs. A computable general equilibrium model is used to calibrate the contrasting cost structures of both national firms and MNEs across the different sectors (based on real data from the OECD and the Czech National Bank). Thus a general equilibrium perspective is used to provide quantitative estimates of the evolution of factor costs (i.e. the cost of labour and capital), intermediate costs (i.e. the cost of both imported and domestic products used for further processing in production), production and prices for both types of firms. Interestingly, we obtain evidence on different patterns of adjustment related to firms' ownership (i.e. between national firms and MNEs). In addition, our methodology allows us to assess the impact on GDP and welfare resulting from the process of industry restructuring at the microeconomic level.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Latorre, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",cmlatorre@estad.ucm.es,"Latorre, Maria C./AAF-9316-2022; Latorre, Maria C./AFK-2004-2022","Latorre, Maria C./0000-0001-8741-1897; Latorre, Maria C./0000-0001-8741-1897",,,,,32,9,9,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24.0,4,,,,,441,463,,10.1080/14631377.2012.729304,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,029HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310485500002,0

Specifically, the model generates differences in the growth pattern primarily by modifying the underlying parameters that govern the evolution of economy-wide technological competence or dynamic R&D productivity. The technological divide arises at the threshold level of technological knowledge, which is largely affected by the quality of socio-technological infrastructure. Government policies aimed at enhancing the quality of socio-technological infrastructure can help countries escape from the technology divide trap by lowering the knowledge threshold. While the model preserves the spirit of the R&D-based endogenous growth model in the sense of its policy effects and the endogenous evolution of technological competence, the model does not need to reach the scale effect directly, where an increase in the size of an economy generates more rapid growth.","Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, KAIST Business Sch, Seoul 130722, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Lee, CY (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, KAIST Business Sch, 87 Hoegiro, Seoul 130722, South Korea.",drcylee@business.kaist.ac.kr,"Lee, Chang-Yang/C-1629-2011",,,,,,80,7,7,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We consider a game between an enforcement authority (enforcer) and an offender in which either the enforcer or the offender may act as a Stackelberg leader. The enforcer must choose whether to move first by committing to an enforcement strategy-thereby directly affecting the level of non-compliance; or rather let the offender make the first move-thereby calibrating the level of enforcement to the actual level of non-compliance. We show that the value of commitment to the enforcer depends on each player's responsiveness to a change in the other player's strategy choice.

Moreover, between 2008 and 2009H1, the investment decisions of financial institutions together with the fact that non-financial institutions were unwilling or unable to increase their financial liabilities led to estimated declines in all GDP multipliers.

The findings are as follows: i) as yet, there are no fully integrated national energy markets in China, as more than one convergence cluster is identified for all four fuels; ii) some regional energy markets can be regarded as 'quite mature,' as evidenced by the existence of some highly concentrated convergence clusters connected geographically; iii) some regional markets remain in a 'state of transition,' as witnessed by convergence clusters that are scattered geographically and that are growing in membership; iv) it seems that there is more regional-based integration for coal and electricity than for gasoline and diesel, as more convergent clusters were identified for coal and electricity than for gasoline and diesel; and v) overall.

We find that trade promotion actions favor an increase of exports along the extensive margin, in particular, in terms of destination countries, in the case of firms that are already selling differentiated goods. However, these actions do not seem to encourage exporter to start exporting these goods.

We pursue our target developing an agent-based model in which the social network of interactions is specified as a knowledge resource, and knowledge integration is seen as the process by which the resource can be applied to innovation. The results of the simulation exercises show that the initial architecture of acquaintance networks is a crucial factor for innovation. Innovating has proven to be more than simply equating endowments of initial skills with firm performance. In fact, the performance of the system showed high sensitivity to the arrangement of the firm's initial location in the social network. Moreover, the way in which acquaintance networks were mobilized emerged as a key determinant of innovation patterns. The model presented here is a relatively theoretical, stylized model and we employ it to draw some general, albeit preliminary conclusions, while illustrating some of the theory relevant to the issues discussed. It is argued that the model might serve the purpose of setting an agenda for further research along this line of investigation-that is, knowledge integration patterns and firms partnerships formation.","[Morone, Piergiuseppe] Univ Foggia, I-71100 Foggia, Italy; [Taylor, Richard] Stockholm Environm Inst Oxford Off, Oxford OX2 7DL, England",University of Foggia,"Morone, P (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, DSEMS Largo Papa Giovanni Paolo 2, I-71100 Foggia, Italy.",p.morone@gmail.com; richardtaylor.sei@googlemail.com,,"Taylor, Richard/0000-0002-3915-2920; Morone, Piergiuseppe/0000-0002-3240-7089",,,,,16,6,7,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

It focuses on the unitary model assuming that all family members have the same utility function. The analysis investigates the difference in a husband's and wife's labour supply between the household that determines the wife to be the main decision-maker and the household that selects a different decision-making system under the control of individual and household characteristics. The estimation employs a treatment effects model to consider the selectivity bias caused by unmeasured characteristics. Results show that the household with the wife as the main decision-maker increases the husband's working hours by 15% and decreases the wife's working hours by 59%, compared to the household that selects a different decision-making system. This implies that the unitary model is rejected. Additionally, the husband's wage rate, the husband's and wife's health status, and their gambling addiction determine the household decision-making system such as the variables that determine the reservation utility of not being married. The effect of the decision-making system on the labour supply and that of the determinant factors on the decision-making system are consistent with the implications obtained from Nash bargaining models and collective models.","Toyama Univ, Fac Econ, Toyama 9308555, Japan",University of Toyama,"Morozumi, R (通讯作者)，Toyama Univ, Fac Econ, Gofuku 3190, Toyama 9308555, Japan.",rmoro@dc4.so-net.ne.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21330048, 21730189] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,20,3,4,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Excess returns or risk premiums are then driven by a country-specific or idiosyncratic stochastic factor on top of the common factor which has a time-varying idiosyncratic impact on the premiums. With this model we investigate the financial integration of government bond markets over time through two channels. First, we allow for gradual convergence from the full ICAPM with impediments to the standard model through the vanishing of the idiosyncratic factors. Second, we allow for gradual equalization of the country-specific impacts of the common factor. State space methods are used to estimate the model with weekly government bond risk premiums for Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands over the period 1995-2009. Our results suggest, first, that the idiosyncratic factors were almost eliminated by 2006 in all countries but Italy but then reappeared due to the financial crisis that started in 2007. Second, the country-specific exposures to the common international risk factor have converged across countries, with no setback during the crisis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The preferred econometric specification in these studies is the two-limit Tobit model, which can accommodate the fractional nature of the dependent variable. However, it is restrictive, because it assumes that the same data generating process determines both whether households participate in the stock market and the fraction of wealth invested in stocks. This article demonstrates that, in this setting, a two-part version of the fractional response model of Papke and Wooldridge (1996) constitutes an attractive alternative to Tobit by comparing the performance of the two models using data on portfolio choices of Australian households. We find that (1) the Tobit model is rejected by our data in favour of a two-part specification; and (2) marginal effects of covariates on the share of risky assets conditional on participation estimated from Tobit are confounded by the effects of these covariates on the participation decision.","[Stavrunova, Olena] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Finance & Econ, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Yerokhin, Oleg] Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Wollongong,"Stavrunova, O (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Finance & Econ, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",olena.stavrunova@uts.edu.au,,"Stavrunova, Olena/0000-0001-9568-3753; Yerokhin, Oleg/0000-0003-1497-3156",,,,,15,6,7,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Investigating competitive advantage from the viewpoint of rent seeking seems to be a special instance of the convergence of management sciences and economics at microeconomic level. The concept of economic rent may serve as a key which helps to systematise different views about firm's competitive advantage. Such an approach seems to be particularly useful in the context of advantage building in company networks. The article analyses the most representative conceptions of building competitive advantage of the enterprise, with special attention paid to the nature of the rent sought. The author presents the concepts of strategising and economising in advantage building. In the former case, she refers to industrial economics, Porter's theory, the positioning school and strategic conflict theory. Another group of conceptions is based on the resource approach. By analysing the phenomena of relationism and network, the article demonstrates that, at present, economic rents are syncretic in nature, covering a number of component rents which refer to traditional methods of creating economic rent. A basic problem is their appropriate integration as well as the right proportion of competition- and cooperation-oriented behaviour adopted by enterprises.","Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, Katedra Zarzadzania Strategicznego, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Swiatowiec-Szczepanska, J (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, Katedra Zarzadzania Strategicznego, Poznan, Poland.",justyna.swiatowiec-szczepanska@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,47,1,1,1,13,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2012,,2,,,,,203,226,,,,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,930IU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303133900003,0

They are also known for superior patents, trade secrets, brand names, management techniques and marketing strategies. The provision of incentives (i.e., tax incentives and/or subsidies) and the adoption of FDI-stimulating policies stem from the expectations that FDI brings enormous benefits such as the transfer of new technology. Numerous empirical studies have demonstrated FDI has a positive impact on economic growth of the host countries. However, it should be noted that the distribution of FDI across countries is not uniform with some countries receive more FDI than the others. This observation raises the question of whether it is possible to identify a set of policies that might enhance the attractiveness of host countries as destinations for MNCs. In the investigation of factors that influence FDI flows, existing studies have mainly focussed on the traditional factors such as market size, trade openness, infrastructure and human capital. The role of other factors such as the quality of institution in the host country was largely ignored. Institution can be defined as the humanly devised constraints or rules of the game that structure political, economic, and social interaction. Institutions provide the incentive structure of an economy. Specifically, it affects security of property rights, prevalence of corruption, distorted or extractive policies, and thereby affects the incentive to invest in human and physical capital, and hence economic growth. The role of institutional quality in the development process has been extensively examined and economists have reached a consensus on the importance of good domestic institutions in explaining cross-country differences in both growth rates and income per capita. Following recent literature that emphasize on the importance of institution, this paper examines whether domestic institutional quality has any important role in attracting FDI. Instead of investigating the direct effect of institution on growth, this paper focuses on the indirect effect that institution may bring via FDI inflows. Arguably, countries with better institutional quality should be able to attract more investment because it improves productivity prospect, reduces the cost of doing business and uncertainty. In order to test the hypothesis, data from 77 countries over the period of 1981-2005 is utilised. Methodologically, this paper uses a system generalised method-of-moment panel estimator to address some of the weaknesses encountered in the previous literature on FDI-institution link. Specifically, this estimator is able to formally address biases induced by the inclusion of lagged dependent variable, country-specific effects and endogeneity problem. There are several important conclusions emerging from this analysis. First, institution appears to be important determinant of FDI inflows. This finding is a line with the view that improvements in the quality of domestic institution will reduce the cost of doing business, reduce uncertainty, and improve productivity prospect. This will eventually lead to more investments. Second, FDI is also seeking human capital and trade openness. The availability of quality workforce in the host countries is an important pre-condition for the successful operations of MNCs as they need people who are able to understand and work with new technology. Trade openness is important because most FDI is export oriented in nature such that MNC will invest in countries that pursue trade-promotion policies. In addition, MNCs investment decision also depends on the amount of existing FDI invested in the countries. This is consistent with the view that the success of MNCs in the host countries is an important signal for further investments by MNCs. Finally, FDI is not influenced by market size and infrastructure quality. This is not surprising and in fact consistent with recent literature. Importantly, the finding on the important role played by domestic institution in attracting FDI is robust and is not driven by outlier observations, or problems caused by weak instruments and simultaneity bias.","[Tun, Yin-Li; Azman-Saini, W.

J,"Ubius, U; Alas, R",,,,"Ubius, Ulle; Alas, Ruth",,,The Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility on the Innovation Climate,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,innovation; corporate social responsibility; gender; age; education,FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; BUSINESS; ATTITUDES; MANAGERS; CONTEXT; WORK,"Research was supported by ETF grant 7537 The purpose of this paper is to investigate connections between innovation climate and corporate social responsibility (CSR). The survey was conducted in Estonian, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Slovakian, Czech, Finnish and German electric-electronic machine, retail store and machine-building enterprises. The Schumpeterian definition (Shumpeter, 1934) of innovation states that the commercialization of all new combinations is based upon the application of any of the following: new materials and components, the introduction of new processes, the opening of new markets, and the introduction of new organizational forms. According to Janszen (2000) when a change in technology is involved it is termed an invention and when the business world is involved, it is an innovation (Janszen, 2000). Different organizations have different definitions about CSR, but there is similar ground between them (Ubius & Alas 2009; Tafel-Viia & Alas 2009). Today leaders face a challenge in order to apply societal ethical standards to responsible business practice (Morimoto et al., 2005) during changes triggered by changing environment (Alas 2008; Alas et al 2009a; Alas et al 2009b; Alas et al 2010; Sepper & Alas 2008) and taking place in different cultures (Alas & Edwards 2011; Alas et al 2011). Corporate social responsibility is regarded as a crucially important issue in management nowadays (Cornelius et al., 2008; Humphreys & Brown, 2008). The previous research study's findings of no significant differences by the entrepreneur's gender in venture innovation/risk situation, in strategies employed, and in satisfaction with performance support other recent research studies (Sonfield & Lussier, 1997). Recent evidences showed that the relationship between organizational commitment and discretionary measures of corporate social orientation is stronger for women than for men (Peterson, 2004) and that corporate charitable behavior, which is considered to be discretionary (Carroll, 1979) is viewed more favorably by women than men (Roberts, 1993). Linear regression analysis was done in order to analyze connections between innovation climate and corporate social responsibility. Data about three different age groups, two different genders and two different education levels were compared by means of the T-test and ANOVA-test. The total number of respondents was 6094. The results of an empirical study show that corporate social responsibility predicts innovation climate but it depends on the employees` gender, age and education level. From this study corporate social responsibility predicts innovation climate among younger and middle age groups. One facet of corporate social responsibility - the firm performance concerning social issues predicts innovation climate among older age group. Corporate social responsibility predicts also innovation climate among men. Corporate social responsibility predicts innovation climate among respondents with high level of education. One facet of corporate social responsibility - the firm performance concerning social issues predicts innovation climate among respondents with low level of education. Both facets of corporate social responsibility and innovation climate were rated higher among women and lower among men. Both facets of corporate social responsibility and innovation climate were rated higher among younger age group and lower among middle and older age group. There weren't big differences among respondents with low and high levels of education according to the two facets of corporate social responsibility - the firm performance concerning social issues and the firm respects the interests of agents and innovation climate.","[Ubius, Ulle; Alas, Ruth] Estonian Business Sch, EE-10143 Tallinn, Estonia",Estonian Business School,"Ubius, U (通讯作者)，Estonian Business Sch, Lauteri 3, EE-10143 Tallinn, Estonia.",ylle.ybius@ebs.ee; ruth.alas@ebs.ee,"Saraiva, Dora/JJD-1722-2023",,,,,,46,19,28,5,187,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, we find that the properties that move subjects toward equilibrium in Chen's mechanism typically generate sizeable taxes and subsidies when not in equilibrium, and correspondingly large budget surpluses and deficits, which typically far outweigh the surplus created by providing the public good.

In addition, oil price and exchange-rate returns have been shown to be skewed and leptokurtic, and to exhibit an asymmetric or tail dependence structure. Therefore, this study proposes dynamic copula-based GARCH models to explore the dependence structure between the oil price and the US dollar exchange rate. More importantly, an asset-allocation strategy is implemented to evaluate economic value and confirm the efficiency of the copula-based GARCH models. In terms of out-of-sample forecasting performance, a dynamic strategy based on the CGARCH model with the Student-t copula exhibits greater economic benefits than static and other dynamic strategies. In addition, the positive feedback trading activities are statistically significant within the oil market, but this information does not enhance the economic benefits from the perspective of an asset-allocation decision. Finally, a more risk-averse investor generates a higher fee for switching from a static strategy to a dynamic strategy based on copula-based GARCH models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is based on a rich dataset of international coal prices: in particular, we combine data on steam coal prices with freight rates, covering the period December 2001 until August 2009 at weekly frequency. We then test whether the demand and supply side components of steam coal trade are consistently integrated with one another. In addition, export and import prices as well as freight rates for individual trading routes, across regions and globally are combined. We find evidence of significant yet incomplete integration. We also find heterogeneous short-term dynamics of individual markets. Furthermore, we examine whether logistics enter coal price dynamics through transportation costs, which are mainly determined by oil prices. Our results suggest that this is generally not the case.

Formally, the proportion of foreign and domestic contents could be identified by calculating the vertical specialization share using non-competitive input-output tables. Applying such a method to the Chinese case, however, would result in a big measurement bias because China has a large share of processing exports, which utilize a disproportionately high percentage of imported intermediates. This paper, by directly employing 2008 trade data for which imported intermediates in both processing and non-processing trade could be identified by means of various trade patterns, provides a simplified way to estimate the share of foreign/domestic value-added included in industry-level manufactured exports. This paper finds that the vertical specialization share of China's processing exports was about 56 percent in 2008, compared to about 10 percent for ordinary exports. It also finds that the sectors that experienced fast expansion of processing exports have a much higher share of foreign contents. Since processing exports account for about half of Chinese exports, the prevailing trade statistics, which focus on gross values rather than the value-added of exports and imports, has obviously overstated the bilateral trade imbalances, especially between China and the USA.","[Zhang, Jun; Tang, Dongbo] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Yubo] Shanghai Univ, Dept Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Shanghai University,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",junzh_2000@fudan.edu.cn; chaliccgod@163.com; zhanyubo@shu.edu.cn,,,,,,,31,8,9,1,54,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2012,20.0,1,,,SI,,27,48,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01271.x,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,899RZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300835100002,0

Finally, we document a behavioral Other People's Money effect in the lab, where portfolio managers tend to invest the funds of their investors in a more risky manner than their Own Money, even when it is not in either the investors' or the managers' interest to do so.","[Agranov, Marina] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Bisin, Alberto; Schotter, Andrew] NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA",California Institute of Technology; New York University,"Agranov, M (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",magranov@hss.caltech.edu,,,,,,,25,23,24,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

However, there has been relatively little research undertaken on the possible impact of CSA on later-life economic outcomes. Here, we explore whether older people who report having experienced CSA have weaker labour force attachment and lower incomes compared to other people. We use data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) which is a nationally-representative survey of people aged 50 and over. We find that male victims of CSA are almost three times more likely to be out of the labour force due to sickness and disability. They also have significantly lower incomes and are more likely to live alone. These effects remain even when we control for childhood economic circumstances, other adverse childhood events, current mental health difficulties and negative health behaviours. We do not find any effects for female victims. Among the policy implications are the need to be more aware of the complex effects of CSA when designing labour market activation strategies such as training for the unemployed.

According to many researchers, the oil price pass-through to domestic prices has been decreasing recently. We estimate a recursive VAR model on rolling windows to evaluate the changes in the pass-through of oil prices to domestic prices. For the period 1990-2012, we identify an increasing trend in the pass-through of oil prices to domestic prices in Turkey. The increasing pass-through may be attributed to the changes in relative prices: As oil becomes more important in the overall cost structure, firms become more responsive to its price. The results also suggest that the impact of oil prices on producer prices is almost two times higher than the impact on consumer prices. Moreover, the gap between the oil price pass-through to producer prices and the pass-through to consumer prices increased during this period. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical findings from the dynamic ordinary least squares and autoregressive distributed lag regressions indicate that there are positive effects of the domestic income on imports. Second, contrary to theory but in line with previous studies, we obtain negative coefficients for the real effective exchange rate a real appreciation in the Renminbi (RMB) would reduce import demand. Third, the period of the great global recession is negatively associated with the import demand in China. Fourth, the perception of tail risk negatively affects demand for the aggregated imports and five of six groups for the disaggregated imports. Fifth, the exchange rate reform had a positive impact on the aggregated imports, but our estimations report mixed results for the disaggregated imports.

Such behavior is often considered to challenge the relevance of subgame perfectness as an equilibrium selection criterion, since weakly dominated strategies are actually used. We report on new experiments investigating whether inequality in payoffs between players, maintained in most lab implementations of this game, drives such behavior. Our data clearly show that the failure to maximize personal payoffs, as well as the fear that others might act this way, do not stem from inequality aversion.

In the presence of emission tax, two types of licensing contracts, royalty and fixed-fee, are examined to analyze market equilibrium and to compare their welfare consequences. We show that an eco-innovator provides a non-exclusive license under a royalty contract while it might exclude polluting firms under the fixed-fee licensing contract. However, when mixed licensing contract where royalty and fixed-fee contracts are combined together is available, we show that eco-innovator provides non-exclusive license. We also show that, compared to royalty licensing, exclusive fixed-fee contract will increase the welfare but its welfare effect depends on the level of emission tax. Finally, we derive the optimal emission tax and show that an appropriate emission tax combined with non-exclusion policy or profit-cap regulation can increase the welfare.","[Kim, Seung-Leul] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Postdoctor Program BK21, Kwangju, South Korea; [Lee, Sang-Ho] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Kwangju, South Korea",Chonnam National University; Chonnam National University,"Kim, SL (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Postdoctor Program BK21, 77 Yongbong Rd, Kwangju, South Korea.",slkim@jun.ac.kr; sangho@jun.ac.kr,"Lee, Sang-Ho/E-7848-2017","Lee, Sang-Ho/0000-0002-0283-5998",,,,,47,22,22,0,11,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

This paper presents a two-country general equilibrium model in which nonfundamental uncertainty (sunspots) in part drives stochastic fluctuations in the exchange rate in a class of rational expectation equilibria. In the model, a combination of financial frictions-incomplete asset markets and a proportional transaction cost associated with trading foreign-currency-denominated bonds-breaks the tight link between exchange rates and fundamentals. Moreover, the model generates a negative Backus-Smith correlation between relative consumption and the real exchange rate, because relative prices, acting as a source of shocks as opposed to shock absorbers, directly affect relative output and generate a large wealth effect on relative consumption. Using a random walk as an example of sunspot shocks, the volatility of exchange rates relative to that of output and consumption is found to be large in the presence of nontradable goods and distribution services.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Li, N (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",nanli1@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,3,4,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We show that a budget allocation of less than half a percent of national gross domestic product (GDP) can ensure that no elderly citizen suffers from poverty in Singapore.

The first mover's advantage in project choice leads to an equilibrium quite different from that in previous studies. Specifically, we show that in equilibrium, the investment time and the option value are between those in a duopoly with one project and a monopoly with one project. Moreover, we show that a high correlation between project values, unlike in a monopoly with two projects, plays a positive role in mitigating preemptive competition.

S., natural gas pipeline transport has undergone a wave of deregulatory actions over the past several decades. The underlying motive has been the presumption that removing regulatory frictions would facilitate spot price arbitrage, helping to integrate prices across geographic locations and improve efficiency. Yet certain frictions, specifically the effect of congestion on transportation costs, inhibit positive deregulatory impacts on efficiency. With the increase in domestic production and consumption of natural gas over the coming decades, upward pressure on the demand for transport will likely result in an increased occurrence of persistently congested pipeline routes. In this paper we explore the relationship between congestion and spot prices using a simple network model, paying particular attention to the influence of storage. We find that as congestion between two hubs increases, the scarcity value of transmission capacity rises, driving a wedge between spot prices. We empirically quantify this effect over a specific pipeline route in the Rocky Mountain region that closely resembles our structural design. Although our results paint a stark picture of the impact that congestion can have on efficiency, we also find evidence that the availability of storage mitigates the price effects of congestion through the intertemporal substitution of transmission services.","[Oliver, Matthew E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Mason, Charles F.; Finnoff, David] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Mason, Charles F.] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Wyoming; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Oliver, ME (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",matthew.oliver@econ.gatech.edu,"Mason, Charles/H-9162-2019","Mason, Charles/0000-0002-9846-0173; Finnoff, David/0000-0003-0775-9733",,,,,42,26,32,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

This paper reviews the broader institutional design problem regarding the effectiveness of the central bank in practice and confirms the need for rules and boundaries. The framework proposed for improving the Fed incorporates key elements that have already been adopted in the European Union. The case of ELA provision by the ECB and the Central Bank of Cyprus to Marfin-Laiki Bank during the crisis, however, suggests that the existence of rules and boundaries may not be enough to limit harmful discretion. During a crisis, novel interpretations of the legal authority of the central bank may be introduced to create a grey area that might be exploited to justify harmful discretionary decisions even in the presence of rules and boundaries. This raises the question how to ensure that rules and boundaries are respected in practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This policy aims at providing a job to anybody willing to work and to pay a living wage. Over the past fifteen years, this idea has been subject to greater scrutiny and this paper contributes to that literature by estimating the gross cost of implementing a job-guarantee policy (JG). In order to calculate this cost, the paper uses the data available from the 1930s work programs. These work programs provide some interesting insights because enough data are available to determine the cost of JG under widely different rates of unemployment. The paper shows that JG would have been quite expensive during the early part of the 1930s when the unemployment rate was at 20 percent or more. Once unemployment receded to a usual level, the gross cost of JG would have been low.","[Tymoigne, Eric] Lewis & Clark Coll, Portland, OR 97219 USA",,"Tymoigne, E (通讯作者)，Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Econ, MSC 40,0615 SW Palatine Hill Rd, Portland, OR 97219 USA.",etymoigne@lclark.edu,,,,,,,43,2,2,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

In this paper, we estimate and compare poverty incidence rates in China using four nationally representative surveys: the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) of 2010, the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) of 2010, the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) of 2011, and the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) of 2007. Using both international and official domestic poverty standards, we show that poverty rates at the national, rural, and urban levels based on the CFPS, CGSS, and the CHFS are all much higher than the official estimates and those based on the CHIP.

We provide a framework for studying economic problems in which family behavior is essential. Our key innovation is the inclusion of imperfectly altruistic agents in an otherwise standard consumption-savings problem with exogenous income risk. This gives rise to altruistic transfers and strategic behavior in the consumption-savings decision. We study the Markov-perfect equilibrium that arises from the limit of equilibria in a sequence of finite games. The equilibrium's transfer patterns are empirically plausible. Furthermore, agents overconsume relative to the social optimum. In contrast to two-period models, both the richer and the poorer players overconsume long before transfers actually occur. The poorer agent also faces incentives to engage in excessive risk-taking because losses from a gamble are absorbed by both while gains are enjoyed alone.","[Barczyk, Daniel] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Barczyk, Daniel] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; Universite de Montreal,"Barczyk, D (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",daniel.barczyk@mcgill.ca; matthias.kredler@uc3m.es,"Kredler, Matthias/Y-5982-2018","Kredler, Matthias/0000-0001-6479-0708",,,,,34,9,15,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

If leader's optimization problem has an interior solution, the leader enters at the optimal threshold of a monopolist; otherwise, the leader enters earlier than the monopolist. If the demand admits positive jumps, then the optimal entry threshold of the leader can be lower than the monopolist's threshold even if the solution is interior; simultaneous entry can happen either as an equilibrium or a coordination failure; the high cost firm can become the leader.

Each agent does not know what the available options are and can choose an option only after observing another agent who has already chosen that option. In addition, the agents' preferences over the two options are correlated. An agent can either imitate an observed agent or wait until he meets two agents who made different choices, in which case he can compare their choices and choose accordingly. A novel feature of the model is that agents observe not only the choices made by others, but also some information about the process that led them to those choices. We study two cases: In the first, an agent notes whether the observed agent imitated others or whether he actually compared the available alternatives. In the second, an agent notes whether the observed agent's decision was hasty or not. It is shown that in equilibrium the probability of making a mistake is higher in the second case and that the existence of these nonstandard neuro observations systematically biases the equilibrium distribution of choices.","[Eliaz, Kfir; Rubinstein, Ariel] Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Berglas Sch Econ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Eliaz, Kfir] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Rubinstein, Ariel] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",Tel Aviv University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; New York University,"Eliaz, K (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Berglas Sch Econ, POB 39040, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",kfire@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,9,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Explanations such as differences in college preparedness and credit constraints have been advanced. An alternative explanation could be differences in information sets between poor and rich, for example, about career opportunities, translating into different expected returns to college. Poor people might expect low returns and thus decide not to attend or they might face high (unobserved) costs that prevent them from attending despite high expected returns. I use data on people's subjective expectations of returns to address this identification problem. I find that poor individuals require higher expected returns to be induced to attend college than individuals from rich families. Testing predictions of a model of college attendance shows that poor individuals are particularly responsive to changes in direct costs, which is consistent with them being credit constrained. Performing counterfactual policy experiments, I find that a sizeable fraction of poor individuals would change their decision in response to a reduction in direct costs and that these individuals at the margin have expected returns that are as high or higher than the individuals already attending college.","[Kaufmann, Katja Maria] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy; [Kaufmann, Katja Maria] Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Kaufmann, KM (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy.",katja.kaufmann@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,54,37,47,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

In this paper we study a key determinant of the answer to the question: lobbying by firms. Estimating a binary choice model of firm behavior, we find significant evidence for the idea that barriers to entry induce persistence in lobbying. The existence of these costs is further confirmed in studying how firms responded to a particular policy change: the expiration of legislation relating to the H-1B visa. Due to its influence on firm behavior, we argue that this persistence fundamentally changes the environment in which legislation is made.","[Kerr, William R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Rock Ctr 212, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Kerr, William R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lincoln, William F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Paul H Nitze Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Mishra, Prachi] Int Monetary Fund, Monetary & Capital Markets Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Johns Hopkins University; International Monetary Fund,"Kerr, WR (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Rock Ctr 212, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",wkerr@hbs.edu; wlin-coln@jhu.edu; pmishra@imf.org,,,,,,,91,74,98,2,24,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

Confronting remarks by Milton Friedman and Gary Becker, we are using an evolutionary setting to investigate the endogenous choice of the proper objective of business firms and the influence of product differentiation on the long run survival of firms which pursue non-profit motives. We find that firms which consider a combination of profit and consumer welfare can indeed have larger market shares and profits than their profit-maximizing rivals. One insight is that it might pay off for shareholders to consider stakeholder welfare, but that the level of social concern should not be too high. Based on a strategy's profitability, we consider asynchronous evolutionary updating with firms selecting Nash quantities or choosing best replies to the expected market quantity. Here we observe that the consumers' willingness to pay a price premium for products is crucial for the long run survival of socially concerned firms. Depending on the degrees of product differentiation and social concern, long run outcomes consist either of both types of firms or only one type of firm. If the firms' propensity to switch between a social or a profit-maximizing strategy is sufficiently large, steady states are unstable and even complicated dynamics can occur. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The parametric results of the size distribution analysis reject Zipf's law for all sample sizes and also show the Zipf exponent systematically declines as the sample size increases. The growth process analysis confirms Gibrat's law and yields a local Zipf exponent of one for cities with a normalized population less than 0.53%, which includes about 95% of the total observations. The deviations from Zipf's law occur at the extreme upper tail and are likely a result of restricted mobility of population across countries. However, given that Gibrat's law holds, we can expect the size distribution to converge to Zipf's law with a decline in the barriers to immigration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main novelty of this research is the distinction between tied and untied aid in a multi-donor gravity model of trade and the comparison between trade and aid policies in this setting. We find an average positive effect of bilateral aid on exports, which varies over time and across donors and which appears to depend on the extent to which donors tied aid to exports. The effect does appear to have decreased substantially over the period studied and it is even not statistically significant in the 2000s, which could suggest that the recommendations given by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) concerning the untying of aid and aid allocation have been followed by the donors and led to declining impacts on their exports. Interestingly, these decreasing aid-elasticities are accompanied by increasing coefficients of the regional trade agreement variable, which is positive and statistically significant after 1994. Finally, we find that the strength of the relationship between exports and bilateral aid is correlated with the extent to which aid is tied and partially related to the sectoral allocation of aid.","[Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada; Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Gottingen, Ibero Amer Inst Econ Res, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Nowak-Lehmann, Felicitas] Univ Gottingen, D Ibero Amer Inst Econ Res, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Nowak-Lehmann, Felicitas] Univ Gottingen, Ctr European Governance & Econ Dev Res, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Parra, M.

Through superior empirical analysis and correct model specification, our findings overturn much of the existing literature on the effectiveness of capital injections into the banking sector in Japan and the United States. We show that the TARP program did not achieve the stated policy objective of stimulating bank lending. On the contrary, we find evidence that recipient banks grew assets significantly slower, particularly heavily risk-weighted assets such as loans. These findings are robust to various empirical specifications, including two-stage least squares estimation using instrumental variables, difference-indifference techniques and generalized method of moments. These techniques control for pre-existing trends in loan growth while addressing potential endogeneity bias. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Industries are exposed to aggregate and industry-specific productivity shocks. Firms in each industry set value-maximizing state-contingent markups, taking as given the behavior of all other industries. When consumers are risk-averse, industry markups are countercyclical with regards to the industry-specific component, but may be procyclical with regards to the aggregate shock. The general equilibrium dispersion of markups implied by the optimization of heterogeneous industries creates misallocation of labor across industries. The misallocation, in turn, generates aggregate welfare losses state-by-state that feed back into the industry problem via a representative agent's marginal utility of aggregate consumption. Misallocation dynamics may transmit industry-specific shocks, or amplify small aggregate shocks, and so lead to aggregate fluctuations through these feedback effects. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In the finite estate case, the agents have homogeneous preferences per estate, which may differ across estates. In the more general infinite estate problem, players have arbitrary preferences over an interval of real numbers each of which is regarded as an estate. A strategic estate game is formulated in which each agent distributes his legal entitlement over the estates, resulting in individual claims per estate: each estate is then divided according to some allocation rule. The paper focuses on existence and on computational aspects of Nash equilibria in finite and infinite estate games, with some focus on the proportional allocation rule. For this rule, it also studies Pareto optimality and envy-freeness of equilibrium allocations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Inspired by this perspective, we propose a new algorithm which iteratively reruns DA after removing students who have been matched with underdemanded schools, together with their assignments. While this algorithm is outcome equivalent to Kesten's EADAM, it is more accessible to practitioners due to its computational simplicity and transparency on consenting incentives.

The package, implemented with tremendous credit expansion in 2009 and 2010, is both effective and efficient in facilitating the financing of firms' working capital, but has weaker effects on the financing of investments. Long-term capital allocation is not efficient in that it goes to firms that idiosyncratically invested heavily before the financial crisis but not to those that are in need of capital for investment determined by industry features. Specifically, state-owned companies are privileged in long-term financing but significantly underperform non-state-owned ones.","[Li, Zhiguo] Fudan Univ, Dept Ind Econ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaorong] Fudan Univ, Dept Finance, Sch Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University,"Zhang, XR (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Dept Finance, Sch Management, Room 214,Siyuan Bldg,670 Guoshun Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",xrzhang@fudan.edu.cn,,,,,,,14,6,7,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

In a country like Italy where parental support is the main source of funds supporting college enrollment, we show that parents' risk aversion (elicited by surveys on lottery tolerance) has a significant negative effect on children's college enrollment. This negative effect is robust when we model non-response and introduce measures of liquidity constraints. With the help of a formal model, we interpret this evidence as suggestive that risk averse parents react to the uncertainty of future labour prospects of their children, whose ability is not fully observable. We show that parental risk aversion may contribute to explain the persistence of differences in the odds of attaining a college degree between children of parents with equal educational attainments.

Empirical results show that the (negative) weak stock-bond returns dependence has increased significantly for seven countries after the crisis, except for Italy. However, both VaR and ES have increased for all eight countries. Before the crisis, the minimum portfolio VaR and ES were achieved at an interior solution only for the US, the UK, Australia, Canada and Italy. After the crisis, the corner solution was found for all eight countries. Evidence of flight to quality and safety first investor behaviour was strong after the global financial crisis. The semiparametric t-copula adequately forecasts the outer-sample VaR.

Economies of scale in grain growing created a farmer elite and many landless labourers. In the pastoral northwest, in contrast, family farms dominated, with few hired labourers and modest income disparities. Did this geography driven difference in social structure influence educational outcomes in England 1810-45? Using new micro-level data we show that this geographically driven inequality is not a strong predictor of regional literacy rates. We conclude that regional literacy differences seem to have been influenced more by culture. In particular, areas in northern England with more exposure to the highly literate Scottish society seem to have acquired a higher demand for education, independent of local inequality.

Due to capital indivisibility, the capacity choice is made from a finite grid and there are economies of scale. In the simplest version of the model with a single production technique, the equilibrium turns out to depend on the ratio between the level of total output at the long-run competitive equilibrium and the firm's minimum efficient scale: if that ratio is sufficiently large (the market is sufficiently 'large'), then the competitive price emerges at a subgame-perfect equilibrium of the capacity and price game; if not, then the firms randomize in prices on the equilibrium path. The role of the market size for the competitive outcome is shown to be even more important if there are several available production techniques.","[De Francesco, Massimo A.] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"De Francesco, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Piazza San Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",defrancesco@unisi.it,"De Francesco, Massimo A./AHI-0651-2022","DE FRANCESCO, Massimo Alfiero/0000-0003-4469-1889",,,,,21,0,0,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

I focus on two long established topics and two that have surged in the last decade. Interest in immigrant and assimilation and in the labour market effects of immigration has been kept going by methodological debates and by the diffusion of empirical work from the United States to the wider world. More recently, the difficult politics of immigration policy has fuelled the research agenda and has given rise to a new literature on the forces that drive immigration policy and on the assessment of its effects. Important also is the growth of interest in the causes and consequences of emigration from developing countries. Most notable has been the revival of interest in the brain drain and the wider consequences of the expanding emigrant diaspora. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, this bias is also being studied in household finance research and is considered to underlie and reinforce investor overconfidence. To date, however, the existence of self-attribution bias amongst individual investors is not directly empirically tested. That is, it remains unclear whether good (vs. bad) returns indeed make investors believe more (vs. less) strongly that skills drive their performance. Using a unique combination of survey data and matching trading records of a sample of clients from a large discount brokerage firm, we find that (1) the higher the returns in a previous period are, the more investors agree with a statement claiming that their recent performance accurately reflects their investment skills (and vice versa); and (2) while individual returns relate to more agreement, market returns have no such effect.

Birth timing and its response to various policies has been studied by economists in several papers. However, pregnancy timing - i.e. the timing of conception - and its response to policy announcements has not been examined. This paper makes use of a 21-month lag between announcing California's introduction of the first paid parental leave program in the United States and its scheduled implementation to evaluate whether women timed their pregnancies in order to be eligible for the expected benefit. Using natality data, documenting all births in the United States, a difference-in-differences approach compares California births to births in states outside of California before the program's introduction and in 2004, the year California introduced paid parental leave. The results show that the distribution of California births in 2004 significantly shifted from the first half of the year to the second half of the year, immediately after the program's implementation. While the effect is present for all population segments of new mothers, it is largest for disadvantaged mothers - with lower education levels, of Hispanic origin, younger, and not married. These results shed light on the population segments most affected by the introduction of paid parental leave and on the equitable nature of paid parental leave policies.","[Lichtman-Sadot, Shirlee] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Lichtman-Sadot, S (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",shirlees@bgu.ac.il,,"Lichtman-Sadot, Shirlee/0000-0001-5830-3678",,,,,34,9,17,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Modelling at this level fails to capture the variation in mortality within country and potentially leads to a mis-specification of mortality forecasts for a subset of the population. This can have detrimental effects for pricing and reserving in the actuarial context. In this paper we consider mortality rates at a regional level and analyse the variation in those rates. We consider whether variation in mortality rates within a country can be explained using local economic and social variables. Using Northern Ireland data on mortality and measures of deprivation we identify the variables explaining mortality variation. We create a population polarisation variable and find that this variable is significant in explaining some of the variation in mortality rates. Further, we consider whether spatial and non-spatial models have a part to play in explaining mortality differentials. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When calibrated to match the increase in U.S. trade between 1990 and 2010, the model suggests that (1) output increases immediately after a trade shock and converges quickly to the steady state; (2) labor market institutions likely play a larger role in the adjustment process than specific human capital; (3) the short run distributional effects are small if the labor market is flexible, even in the presence of specific human capital.

These cycles are driven by three political economy frictions: policymakers are non-benevolent, they cannot commit to policies, and they have private information about the tightness of the government budget and rents. Our first main result is that, in the most favorable equilibrium to the households, distortions to production emerge and never disappear even in the long run. This result is driven by the interaction of limited commitment and private information on the side of the policymaker, since in the absence of either friction, there are no long run distortions to production. Our second result is that, if the variance of private information is sufficiently large, there is equilibrium turnover in the long run so that political cycles never disappear. Finally, our model produces a long run distribution of taxes, distortions, and turnover, where these all respond persistently to temporary economic shocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We show that the depletion rate equals the difference between the price elasticity of China's resource import demand times the world interest rate and growth in China's resource import demand. Results indicate that: the temporary increase in China's demand associated with stockpiling resources raises the level of resources extracted for export to China, but does not affect the rate at which resources are depleted over time; the growth in China's demand for resource imports and exponential rise in prices during the contemporary resources boom reduces the rate at which resources should be depleted over time; the depletion rate picks up towards the end of the boom as the growth in China's demand is set to slow.

Green structural change is analysed here through a model with a progressive manufacturing sector and a stagnant service sector. The latter represents an increasingly demanded class of services characterised by high intensity of labour, low productivity growth and reduced impact on resources. A stock of public capital enhances productivity growth in the manufacturing sector, whose output negatively affects an environmental asset entering households' welfare function. Along the balanced growth path a substitution process between dirty consumption and the open-access asset takes place, leading to a stagnation in welfare despite the positive growth rate. Structural change towards green service occurs along the transition to the BGP any time the public-to-private capital ratio is above its long-run level, and is associated with a decrease in consumption growth, a reduction in working hours and a decline in the environmental degradation rate. A numerical example illustrates that the overall positive effect on households' welfare can be positive. Finally, it is shown how infrastructure policies can have non-trivial consequences on long-run growth, welfare and environmental sustainability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although scarcity and its consequences for market economies are key aspects of mainstream economics, they have been insufficiently analyzed because the emphasis is only on natural scarcity. The mafia phenomenon reveals that scarcity can also be institutionally created. This type of scarcity encourages the process of market collectivization and empowers those generating it. The mafia's legal activities establish a system of waiting lines and monitored access to goods.

Stochastically stable R&D networks exhibit the dominant group architecture, and, contrary to the existing literature, generically unique predictions about the size of the dominant group can be obtained. This size decreases monotonically with respect to the cost of link formation and there exists a lower bound on the size of the dominant group for non-empty networks. Stochastically stable networks are always inefficient and an increase in linking costs has a non-monotone effect on average industry profits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These studies focus on changes in weather realizations over time within a given spatial area and demonstrate impacts on agricultural output, industrial output, labor productivity, energy demand, health, conflict, and economic growth, among other outcomes. By harnessing exogenous variation over time within a given spatial unit, these studies help credibly identify (i) the breadth of channels linking weather and the economy, (ii) heterogeneous treatment effects across different types of locations, and (iii) nonlinear effects of weather variables. This paper reviews the new literature with two purposes. First, we summarize recent work, providing a guide to its methodologies, datasets, and findings.

After estimating the volatility process without assuming any specific form of its behavior, we find the volatility to be long-term dependent with the Hurst exponent on a verge of stationarity and nonstationarity. To overcome such complication, we utilize the detrended cross-correlation and the detrending moving-average cross-correlation coefficients and we find the standard leverage effect for both crude oils and heating oil. For natural gas, we find the inverse leverage effect Additionally, we report that the strength of the leverage effects is scale-dependent. Finally, we also show that none of the effects between returns and volatility is detected as the long-term cross-correlated one. These findings can be further utilized to enhance forecasting models and mainly in the risk management and portfolio diversification. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V.

The model allows us to assess a policy proposal put forth in the literature: that an incremental value pricing rule should define Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) patent licensing within Standard Setting Organizations as it replicates the ex ante efficient competition outcome. We find that when patented technologies must be weighed on numerous factors, and not simply one-dimensional cost-savings, there is unlikely to be a single incremental value that can be agreed upon by all relevant parties. Furthermore, ex ante competition fails to select the efficient technologies by penalizing the more versatile ones. These results cast some doubt on the usefulness of the incremental value as a precise benchmark for FRAND. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Research findings indicate that the PRC's urbanization is incomplete: its level of urbanization lags behind its industrialization and development status, and while there are too many small cities, the large cities are not large enough. This is mainly because of the institutional constraints exerted by the Hukou and land systems on labor mobility, which have led to segregation, efficiency loss, distortion in the urban system and adverse impacts on equity, as discussed in this study. Major policy recommendations are offered for removing the distortions and steering the PRC's urbanization onto an efficient and equitable path.","[Lu, Ming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ming] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wan, Guanghua] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Fudan University; Asian Development Bank,"Wan, GH (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines.",gwan@adb.org,,,,,,,76,43,44,1,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

These attempts are flawed by a failure to distinguish between working class unproductive labor and the unproductive labor attributable to managers-plus-capitalists.

The availability of green technologies both lowers social costs in the transition to a green growth path and helps achieve a satisfactory rate of material progress under that path.

Economists' traditional scepticism on industrial policy is grounded instead on pragmatic considerations having to do with the difficulty of achieving well-targeted and effective interventions in practice. While these objections deserve serious attention, I argue that they are not insurmountable. A key objective of this paper is to show how the practice of industrial policy can be improved by designing institutional frameworks that counter both informational and political risks.","Inst Adv Study, Sch Social Sci, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Institute for Advanced Study - USA,"Rodrik, D (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Study, Sch Social Sci, Olden Lane, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",drodrik@ias.edu,,,,,,,37,225,240,17,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Berkowitz et al.

Yet, history shows that institutional transfers are possible: Why have some countries been more successful than others in importing foreign institutions? The paper introduces a framework for the analysis of the transplant effect, which is based on institutional economics.

Our empirical findings show that the permanent impact on potential TFP varies across countries from -3.9 points to -1.3 points in Q2 2012. When these losses are incorporated, TFP gaps develop closely in line with capacity utilization rates (CUR).

Africa is particularly vulnerable because it is among the hottest places on the Earth and therefore any further warming will likely have adverse socioeconomic consequences; and most of the economies in this region rely mainly on natural resources and rain-fed agriculture, which are very sensitive to climate change and variability. This article investigates the impacts of climate change on African agriculture and discusses the policy implications for managing these impacts. The modelling results show that Africa will experience the largest impacts from climate change in terms of decline in economic growth and welfare losses. The disaggregated results show that Southern Africa will be the hardest hit region, followed by the Rest of sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and East Africa, in that order. There is therefore need for concerted efforts at adaptation, which should include introduction of temperature-sensitive varieties, diversification of production systems and livelihoods, shift to sustainable agricultural intensification, shift to irrigation agriculture, addressing institutional challenges such as poor physical and social infrastructure, market imperfections, lack of access to credit, and lack of crop insurance, etc. In the long run, emphasis should be placed on diversifying away from agriculture to industry and services.","Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Asafu-Adjaye, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",j.asafuadjaye@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,56,17,17,7,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Compared to the unregulated outcome, both profits and social welfare would increase if firms could commit to producing a higher quality. An MQS restricts the firms' quality choice and leads to less differentiated goods. This fuels competition and may therefore deter entry. A certification policy, which awards firms with a certificate if the quality of their products exceeds some threshold, does not restrict the firms' quality choice. In contrast to an MQS, certification may lead to more differentiated goods and higher profits. We find that firms are willing to comply with an ambitious certification standard if the share of informed consumers is small. In that case, certification is more effective from a welfare perspective than a minimum quality standard because it is less detrimental to entry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Then, we evaluate the effects of corruption using a semi-parametric technique that produces a robust inference for an unknown serial correlation between efficiency scores. In order to test the robustness of our results, the parametric stochastic frontier approach has also been employed.

We also examine the effect of public expenditures on the income of workers in the cultural sector. Using 2002 to 2010 data from the Monthly Employment Survey (PME) and administrative records from Finance of Brazil (FINBRA), we estimate a probit model and a wage equation. In our model, we estimate wages as a function of: (1) sociodemographic characteristics of workers, (2) a variable for informal jobs, (3) the number of working hours, (4) a variable for the worker having another job, (5) per capita expenditures on culture interacted with a dummy for artistic cultural workers, (6) interactive binary variables involving place of residence and artistic cultural workers and (7) the predicted probability obtained by the probit model. This probability is estimated based on the likelihood of working in a creative activity, considering both workers from the cultural sector and other workers, controlled by: (1) sociodemographic characteristics of workers, (2) characteristics of their jobs, (3) dummies for the metropolitan regions and (4) willingness of creative workers to work additional hours interacted with the number of hours worked. Our results show that workers in the cultural sector are likely to work longer hours when compared to workers in other sectors. For our wage equation, the results suggest that women earn relatively less than men and blacks earn less than whites. Furthermore, earnings increase with age and the level of education. Formal workers obtain higher earnings when compared to informal ones. Finally, an increase in the per capita public expenditure on the cultural sector raises the income of workers in artistic cultural occupations.","[Machado, Ana Flavia; Rabelo, Alexandre; Moreira, Arthur Gomes] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Cedeplar, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Machado, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Cedeplar, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",anaflaviatavaresmachado@gmail.com; alexandremrabelo@gmail.com; arthurgm@cedeplar.ufmg.br,,"Machado, Ana Flavia/0000-0001-8573-7906",,,,,24,5,8,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

In a simple tractable two-period model, households can default partially, at a finite punishment cost, and competitive intermediaries price loans of different sizes separately. This environment yields only partial insurance. The default-based pricing of debt makes it too costly for the borrower to achieve full insurance, and there is too little trade in securities. This framework is in contrast to existing literature. Unlike the literature with default, there are no restrictions on the set of state contingent securities that are issued. Unlike the literature on lack of commitment, limited trade arises without need of debt constraints that rule default out. Compared with the latter, the present approach appears to imply more consumption inequality. An extended model with an infinite horizon, idiosyncratic risk and more realistic assumptions is used to demonstrate the general validity of this approach and its main implications.","[Mateos-Planas, Xavier] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Seccia, Giulio] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Southampton,"Mateos-Planas, X (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England.",x.mateos-planas@qmul.ac.uk,,,ESRC [RES-000-22-1149] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-1149] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,6,6,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The interactions between the two markets are modeled in the following way: the aggregate demand depends, among other variables, also on the stock market price, while the fundamental value used by speculators in their decisional process depends on the real sector economic conditions. In our model we introduce a parameter that represents the degree of interaction. With the aid of analytical and numerical tools we show that an increasing degree of interaction between markets tends to locally stabilize the system. This stabilization occurs via a sequence of period-halving bifurcations. Globally, we find that the stabilization process implies multistability, i.e., the coexistence of different kinds of attractors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using product level export data, it is shown that the average export unit value of a product shipped from the USA or Korea increases with distance and decreases with destination market's size. However, within-product average unit values for products exported from China and India decrease with distance and increase with market size. To interpret these different spatial patterns of unit values across exporting countries, model of quality heterogeneity is developed in which firms differ in their workers' skill level and higher-skilled workers show greater productivity in performing tasks that improve product quality. The model predicts that in relatively skill-abundant countries, exporting firms specialize in high-quality products using relatively cheap skilled labor, whereas, in relatively skill-scarce countries, firms that produce lower-quality products are more competitive.","Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80306 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Whang, U (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80306 USA.",un.whang@colorado.edu,,,,,,,21,5,5,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In a survey with an experimental design conducted in Germany, tax planning was found to increase the fair tax rate by approximately 4 percentage points. The fair tax rate is determined by not only the size of the bequest, the relationship of the heir to the bequeather, and the type of bequest, but also by the perceived intentions of the bequeather. The preferred interpretation of the result is that families with pro-social motives should be taxed less than those without pro-social motives. The analysis described in this paper finds support in optimal tax theory. To this end, a simple model was developed that shows that taxation should not prevent individuals with joy-of-giving motives from contributing substantially more to the social good than individuals who do not share these motives.

A panel threshold regression was used to capture the nonlinear effects that cigarette prices on smoking prevalence at the three national income levels endogenously determined by estimation. Our findings supported the evidence that joining the WHO FCTC would have a positive effect on reducing cross-country smoking prevalence, especially among countries with low- and medium-income levels.

The model accounts for two seemingly contradictory relationships reported in recent empirical studies-a positive relationship between competition and industry-level productivity growth, and an inverted-U relationship between competition and firm-level innovation. Notwithstanding the positive relationship between competition and growth, I find antitrust policy reduces industry-level growth.

Also, unlike takeoffs prior to the 1990s, developing economies in recent takeoffs experienced an improvement in economic policies, with lower post-takeoff debt and inflation; more competitive real exchange rates; and stronger structural reforms and institutions. These conditions have tended to be associated in the literature as conducive to sustaining strong growth. We also find that the chances of starting a takeoff in the 2000s was triple that before the 1990s, with domestic conditions accounting for most of the increase. Thus, if developing economies improve their economic policies and sustain them forward, they are more likely to jumpstart takeoffs and avoid the reversals in economic fortunes that affected many developing economies in the past.

Mainly responsible for this development is the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, EEG). This paper considers redistributive implications of the EEG for different electricity consumers. Using time-series regression analysis, we show that electricity generation by wind and PV has reduced spot market prices considerably by 6 (sic)/MWh in 2010 rising to 10 (sic)/MWh in 2012. We use these results to build a near-term forecasting tool for merit order effects, projected to reach 14-16 (sic)/MWh in 2016. On the other hand, the costs of the EEG are passed forward to consumers in the form of a surcharge. Our findings highlight significant redistributive transfers under the current design of the EEG. In particular, some energy-intensive industries are benefiting from lower wholesale electricity prices whilst being largely exempted from contributing to the costs of the scheme. We also highlight implications of our results for other areas for reform of the EEG, such as adequate remuneration mechanisms that ensure efficient operation and investment decisions are made under the scheme. More generally, these findings suggest that policy makers need to integrate distributional assessments into policy design and implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a particularly simple model of OTJS, we show that the increased search of employed workers during expansions induces firms to open more vacancies, but also crowds out unemployed workers in the job search, resulting in an ambiguous overall effect on unemployment volatility. We show analytically and numerically that the difference between the employer's share of the match surplus with an employed versus an unemployed job seeker determines the degree to which OTJS increases unemployment volatility. We use this result to re-consider some related papers of OTJS and explain the amplification of volatility they obtain.

The predictions of our theoretical model are tested using a panel of data on natural disaster events at the country-year level, for the period 1979-2007.

Each period the policymaker determines whether to impose a high barrier to entry, and the special interest groups try to influence the policymaker's decision. Entry is accompanied by creative destruction-when many new firms enter, old firms are more likely to be driven out of the market. Therefore the current incumbents (industry leaders) tend to lobby for a higher entry barrier and potential entrants (industry followers) are likely to lobby for a freer environment for entry. We analyze both static and dynamic versions of the model to examine what kind of environment supports a policy that blocks entry. In the dynamic model, the economy can exhibit various different dynamics. In particular, multiple steady states may arise in equilibrium. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Secondly, the efficiency difference reduces the firm size difference, the price difference and the price dispersion.

Despite their biological origins, the various variants of GD aim at redefining these principles in a way that is supposed to abstract from any domain-specific particulars. We argue that in order to qualify as an adequate meta-theoretical framework for evolutionary economics, GD should not only inspire and guide positive theory development in evolutionary economics, but also be able to support viable practical policy implications. Examining its potential to do so, however, leads us to the conclusion that in its specific deductive variant proposed by Hodgson & Knudsen (HKGD), it risks systematically misguiding evolutionary policy advice.

In recent years, the financial crisis has significantly affected the banking systems of the transition countries. Hence, the efficiency is of major importance for the stability of the banks. Regarding the determinants of efficiency, we find evidence that banks that follow a more cautious strategy, characterized by lower risk appetite and average expectations on profitability, have higher cost efficiency. We also find that traditional deposit-taking and loan-making still remain the most efficient activity of the banks. Additionally, the results showed that a higher Gross Domestic Product growth rate implies an increase in the inefficiency level, indicating an unsustainable bank management behaviour, which in periods of economic growth adopts policies that can generate inefficiency in order to gain market share and to obtain higher bonuses. Country cost efficiency results show significant differences. The banking systems in transition countries in South Eastern Asia appear to have a higher cost efficiency level. Also, the effects of the financial crisis were less significant in this region.","[Spulbar, C.; Nitoi, M.] Univ Craiova, Dept Finance, RO-200585 Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Spulbar, C (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Dept Finance, RO-200585 Craiova, Romania.",cristi.spulbar@feaa.ucv.ro,"Niţoi, Mihai/I-2913-2016; Spulbar, Cristi Marcel/AAL-1451-2020","Spulbar, Cristi Marcel/0000-0002-3909-9496; Nitoi, Mihai/0000-0001-7151-0612",,,,,39,5,7,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

At the most, some regulatory changes on capital and reserves of the banks could be required. However, to understand what really happens during financial crises and the changes in overall economic activity that they produce, a post-Keynesian institutionalist theoretical approach is essential. This paper discusses how several of the changes in funding relationships, driven by financial crises since 1980s, have cleared the way for money manager capitalism. The political and institutional diversity in Latin America allows one to observe not only the trajectory of change, but also its forms. These countries have made different choices regarding economic stabilization and financial regulation, with moderately different results in the distribution of income, wages, and employment. In turn, widespread difficulties to slow or abolish policies of austerity show the depth of the institutional changes that restrict monetary and fiscal policies in the context of financialization. I conclude that financial crises have changed the foundations of social organization.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Correa, E (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",,,,,,,,13,6,6,0,11,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Furthermore, the ANN technology allows the use of multiple variables in both the input and output layers. This capability is very important for economic growth calculations because economic development is often a function of many influential variables. Herein, a forecasting system of economic growth with related application has been proposed, based on ANN.

We find that parental health consciousness, household sanitation conditions and nutrition intake are the channels through which family income affects child health. After controlling for these transmission channels, the gradient strengthens with child age until the age of 17. We find that children from poorer families in China are not only more likely to experience several types of chronic illnesses, but also less likely to address effectively some health conditions.

Using microdata on the full distribution of both formal and informal sector manufacturing firms in India, Indonesia, and Mexico, we document three facts. First, while there are a very large number of small firms, there is no missing middle in the sense of a bimodal distribution: mid-sized firms are missing, but large firms are missing too, and the fraction of firms of a given size is smoothly declining in firm size. Second, we show that the distribution of average products of capital and labor is unimodal, and that large firms, not small firms, have higher average products. This is inconsistent with many models explaining the missing middle in which small firms with high returns are constrained from expanding. Third, we examine regulatory and tax notches in India, Indonesia, and Mexico of the sort often thought to discourage firm growth and find no economically meaningful bunching of firms near the notch points. We show that existing beliefs about the missing middle are largely due to arbitrary transformations that were made to the data in previous studies.","[Hsieh, Chang-Tai] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Olken, Benjamin A.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of Chicago; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Hsieh, CT (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",chsieh@chicagobooth.edu; bolken@mit.edu,,/0000-0003-1918-4631,,,,,30,110,139,0,17,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In the model agents receive heterogeneous utility from pure and impure altruism (Andreoni, 1989) that permits warm glow to vary between monetary donations and volunteering, thus allowing preferences for impure altruism to rationalize inefficient allocation decisions. We define a measure of the price of impure altruism as the additional proportion of income contributed by a donor to give in the dimension that maximizes her utility, holding the overall charitable contribution constant. To test the predictions of the model we ran an experiment in which we varied within-subjects the costs and benefits of monetary and volunteer donations. We also varied between-subjects the emphasis on either the donation value to the charity (pure altruism) or the contribution of the donor (impure warm-glow altruism). Consistent with the model's predictions, the experiment shows that framing the donation decision from a pure perspective increases the efficiency of donation choices, the substitutability of donations between money and time, and crowding out. Nonetheless, while greater impurity results in a more inefficient allocation of resources, empirically we find that it increases overall charitable donations. We discuss the implications of our experimental results for both theory and policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Instead, parametric models are usually applied for such estimation. Parametric models, however, have difficulty in accurately approximating every part of income/expenditure distributions. This paper proposes two types of C-1-class shape-preserving interpolation methods. One is a piecewise rational polynomial interpolation (proposed independently by Stineman and Delbourgo) that enables consistent interpolation of the concentration curves for income/expenditure components, attaining approximately the same accuracy as that of the existing methods when applied to decile-grouped data or to more detailed aggregation. Another is a Hybrid interpolation that employs pieces of curves derived from parametric models on end intervals. Empirical comparisons show that the Hybrid interpolation (with the assistance of parametric models for class-boundary estimation) outperforms the existing methods even when applied to quintile-grouped data without class boundaries.","[Okamoto, Masato] Minist Internal Affairs & Commun, Stat Bur, Tokyo 1628668, Japan",,"Okamoto, M (通讯作者)，Minist Internal Affairs & Commun, Stat Bur, Shinjuku Ku, 19-1 Wakamatsu Cho, Tokyo 1628668, Japan.",mokamoto2@soumu.go.jp,,"Okamoto, Masato/0000-0003-1652-7061",,,,,36,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This level is finite for an individual whose donation is always dictated by some altruism or concern for charity. We show that if all individuals have finite free-riding levels, then the crowding-out is complete in a large economy.

This paper suggests a replacement for OZ, with the essential difference that 'defense' rather than being aggregated into their single public good is disaggregated into more realistic categories of self-insurance and self-protection. Because allocative behavior in public good groups is essentially driven by income effects, we concentrate on these, which become complex and conflicted, giving much greater scope for goods-inferiority. The analysis is followed by numerical simulations, which conform to actual experienced allocations in NATO much better than the conventional 'exploitation' model.","[Ihori, Toshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Dept Econ, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Mcguire, Martin] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Nakagawa, Shintaro] Shimonoseki City Univ, Fac Econ, Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Ihori, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Dept Econ, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",ihori@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Nakagawa, Shintaro/GXV-5529-2022","Nakagawa, Shintaro/0000-0002-8567-8165","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330075, 26285054] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,28,2,2,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The simplest version of that problem can be formulated in a two consumer exchange economy with fixed total resources. The existence of a transfer problem at some equilibrium is known to be equivalent to instability in the case of two goods. This characterization is extended to an arbitrary number of goods by showing that a transfer problem exists at a (regular) equilibrium if and only if this equilibrium has an index value equal to -1. Samuelson's conjecture that there is no transfer problem at tatonnement stable equilibria is therefore true for any number of goods.,"[Balasko, Yves] PUC Rio de Janeiro, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Balasko, Yves] Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro; University of York - UK,"Balasko, Y (通讯作者)，PUC Rio de Janeiro, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",yves@balasko.com,,"balasko, yves/0000-0001-7693-8124",,,,,12,5,5,1,6,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

For each industry, we differentiate between broad offshoring and intra-industry offshoring activities. We conduct a difference-in-difference analysis using the IPR reform years proposed in Branstetter et al. (2006, Quarterly Journal of Economics). We find that following IPR reform, neither broad nor intra-industry offshoring intensities change for the typical US industry at conventional levels of significance. However, high-tech (patent-sensitive) industries substantially expand their intra-industry offshoring activities, whereas low-tech (patent-insensitive) industries do not change their intra-industry offshoring activities in a statistically significant way. In addition, high-tech industries increase their broad offshoring relative to low-tech industries, but the effects are smaller and less robust than those estimated for intra-industry offshoring.

Only about half of the postdocs sees strong incentives for academic research, but there is quite a strong confidence to succeed in an academic career. Furthermore, postdocs who attended a PhD program show better career prospects and higher research incentives compared to others. Academic career prospects and motivation are strongest for assistant professors. Apart from this small group, however, postdocs report only a small impact of the university reforms of the last decade. Female postdocs show significantly higher research incentives but otherwise we find little gender differences.

This deteriorates social welfare because of inequality aversion, as expressed by decreasing marginal utility of consumption. The social discount rate can be interpreted as the minimum rate of return that is necessary to compensate for the increased inequality generated by the investment. For an intuitive precautionary argument, this growth effect is reduced if growth is uncertain. To complete the picture, if the investment raises the collective risk, this discount rate should also contain a risk premium. Recent developments (Weitzman 1998, 2001, 2013; Gollier 2008; Arrow et al. 2013) converge toward recommending using a smaller discount rate for safe assets maturing later. In this paper, I show that this recommendation applied to the risk-free rate relies on the assumption that shocks on the growth rate of consumption exhibit some degree of persistence. I also show that this implies in parallel an increasing term structure for the risk premium. Globally, the risk-adjusted discount rate will have a decreasing term structure only if the asset's beta is small enough.","Manufacture Tabacs, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,,Christian.gollier@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,11,17,18,1,18,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Imperfect performance measurement always lowers profit under multitasking, but may increase profit under specialization.

The model allows blocks of parameters to change at endogenously estimated points of time. Contrary to the Lucas critique, there are large changes at certain points of time in the parameters associated with monetary policy that do not correspond to changes in reduced-form parameters for inflation or the unemployment rate. However, the structure of the U.S. economy has evolved considerably over the postwar period, with an apparent reduction in the late 1980s in the impact of monetary policy shocks on inflation, though not on the unemployment rate. Related, we find changes in the Phillips curve tradeoff between inflation and cyclical unemployment (measured as the deviation from the time-varying steady-state unemployment rate implied by the model) in the 1970s and especially since the mid-1990s.

Starting from the assumption that childbearing decisions also depend on uncertainty about future employment, income, and wealth, we empirically assess how fertility intentions are affected by job instability, which may severely compromise the employment stability of workers, and economic disadvantages in terms of household income and wealth, which may imply insufficient means to deal with potential adverse future events, thereby generating in the household feelings of anxiety and economic insecurity. We show that the instability of women's work status (i.e., the holding of occasional and precarious jobs) significantly discourages the decision to attempt having a first child. Low levels of household wealth significantly and positively influence the decision to postpone attempting a first child. The chances of further childbirth are significantly and negatively influenced by household income insecurity.","[Modena, Francesca] Bank Italy, Econ Res Unit, Trento Branch, Rome, Italy; [Rondinelli, Concetta] Bank Italy, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Rome, Italy; [Sabatini, Fabio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Sabatini, Fabio] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Lab Comparat Social Res, Moscow, Russia",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Sapienza University Rome; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Sabatini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Fac Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",fabio.sabatini@uniroma1.it,,"Sabatini, Fabio/0000-0002-1228-3322; Modena, Francesca/0000-0002-2226-7764",,,,,112,53,55,6,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In particular, research has not differentiated between legitimate power and the presumption of expert knowledge, what we call authority to and authority in. In this paper we report on the results of a series of lab experiments designed to distinguish the effects of the two sources of authority on contributions to a public project. The results suggest that authority to and authority in interact in ways not heretofore understood. Penalizing non-social behavior without expert explanation does not increase voluntary contributions, nor does expert explanation without the threat of penalty, but together they induce more contributions than any other combination of policies. We interpret these findings to indicate that the reaction to an authority depends on whether that authority is perceived to be legitimate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We confirm that winner stocks behave differently from loser stocks in that the return reversal phenomenon is pervasive within past winner stocks only while past loser stocks tend to show weak return continuance. The arbitrage strategy can earn significantly positive contrarian profits, especially for small firms and illiquid stocks. The anomaly varies across different industries and is also sensitive to the market movement.

Laboratory studies are used to identify seeming inconsistencies with micro-economic theory on the level of individuals. Since economics is a social science, this article proposes that the next crucial step consists in shifting the focus to the macro-level. It examines the process through which behavioral anomalies are aggregated to a societal outcome. Since individuals are reactive when they interact with others and face institutional constraints, the aggregation process may lead to different outcomes than what has been observed in individual-level studies: the respective anomalies may disappear, or they may become stronger on the macro-level. The discussion demonstrates that there are a great number of aspects to be analyzed.

This article addresses this question by focusing on the local garment industry in Thailand. Thailand's garment industry became fully integrated into international production networks in the 1980s, and was once among the main drivers of its manufacturing-based export growth. However, with rising wages and labor shortages, there is strong need to upgrade and shift from labor-intensive assembly to higher value-added functions. In contrast to the export-oriented sector, the local garment markets are primarily served by small informal garment suppliers. Nevertheless, some of the suppliers undertake functions that are typically more knowledge intensive, including designing and marketing. In this context, this paper discusses what implications this local-based industry has in overcoming possible middle-income traps, and suggests that domestic oriented policies could play key roles.","[Goto, Kenta] Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, Osaka, Japan; [Endo, Tamaki] Saitama Univ, Fac Econ, Saitama 3388570, Japan",Kansai University; Saitama University,"Goto, K (通讯作者)，Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, Osaka, Japan.",gotoken@kansai-u.ac.jp,"Goto, Kenta/B-1670-2017","Goto, Kenta/0000-0002-5825-1924","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21530281, 23730227] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,26,5,6,3,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The econometric analysis shows that industrial agglomeration, as a share of the national output, contributes to TFP growth through frontier technology and technical efficiency; industrial agglomeration, as a share of the local economy, enhances technical efficiency but is not conducive to technological progress. Spatial density of urban employment negatively affects the growth of technical efficiency and TFP. Overall, the differences in agglomeration economies explain more than one-half of the differences in TFP growth across China's cities. The results are stable in three sub-periods. Important policy implications are derived from the empirical findings. Smaller cities should develop an industrial base that passes a critical mass. Larger cities should continue to direct new development and relocate existing firms to planned, less congested industrial districts. Provincial and sub-provincial level cities should specialize and diversify in advanced producer services and headquarters economies, rather than manufacturing.","[Ke, Shanzi] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yufeng] Ping Bank, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Ke, SZ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",shanzike@hnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,46,24,25,0,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

These findings challenge the widely accepted claim of decreasing between-country inequality.","[Bosmans, Kristof] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Decancq, Koen] Univ Antwerp, Katholieke Univ Leuven, Antwerp, Belgium; [Decancq, Koen] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium; [Decoster, Andre] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium",Maastricht University; KU Leuven; University of Antwerp; Universite Catholique Louvain; KU Leuven,"Bosmans, K (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",,"Decancq, Koen/AAD-4756-2022; Decoster, André/S-9719-2017","Decoster, André/0000-0002-0521-8610; Bosmans, Kristof/0000-0003-3056-1610; Decancq, Koen/0000-0002-5822-845X",,,,,53,26,26,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2014,81.0,322,,,,,276,292,,10.1111/ecca.12059,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AC5ZH,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332599000006,0

To do so, we consider a dynamic general equilibrium model with tradable sectors of different factor intensities, which allows for substitution between intertemporal trade (current account adjustment) and intra-temporal trade (goods trade). An economy's response to a shock generally involves a combination of a change in the composition of goods trade and a change in the current account. Flexible factor markets reduce the need for the current account to adjust. On the other hand, the more rigid the factor markets, the larger the size of current account adjustment relative to the volume of goods trade, and the slower the speed of adjustment of the current account towards its long-run equilibrium. We present empirical evidence consistent with the theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The paradox of credibility is the new dilemma posed to central banking in the effort to conciliate monetary policy and banking regulation under inflation targeting regimes. Thus, the present work aims to: (i) analyze the impact of central bank actions and the macroeconomic environment on the risk perception of banks, and; (ii) analyze the influence of this risk perception of banks on the credit spread, considering both the credit channel and the risk-taking channel. Based on an econometric analysis, the work provides evidence about: (i) the paradox of credibility and the risk-taking channel; (ii) the influence of monetary policies on the risk perception of banks and, as a consequence, on the credit spread; (iii) the procyclical nature of banks in relation to economic activity, and; (iv) the adherence of the countercyclical indicator (called credit gap) proposed in Basel III for the Brazilian case.

Classifying occupations according to their median wage in 1993, we analyze their employment growth until 2010, which is highest both in the top and in the bottom of the distribution, and lowest in the middle. Low-paid personnel services arise as the main factor responsible for the increase in the proportion of employment at the bottom of the wage distribution. We argue that population aging can explain the increased demand for personal services and thus the rise of employment in low-paid positions. Our argument goes as follows: goods and personal services are complementary for seniors. The decrease in the relative price of goods, induced by the progressive replacement of labor input in routine tasks by machines, is then associated with an increased demand for personal services if the proportion of seniors is increasing. We thus complement the existing literature on employment polarization by showing that demographic trends also play first order role. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By definition, informal care is unpaid. It remains a puzzle why so many adult children give freely of their time. Transfers of time to the older generation may be balanced by financial transfers going to the younger generation. This leads to the question of whether informal care and inter-vivos transfers are causally related. We analyze data from the 1999 and 2003 waves of National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women. We examine whether the elderly parents give more inter-vivos monetary transfers to adult children who provide informal care, by examining both the extensive and intensive margins of financial transfers and of informal care. We find statistically significant results that a child who provides informal care is more likely to receive inter-vivos transfers than a sibling who does not. If a child does provide care, there is no statistically significant effect on the amount of the transfer.","[Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Nicholas, Lauren H.; Huang, Sean Sheng-Hsiu] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Norton, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, 1415 Washington Hts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ecnorton@umich.edu; lnichola@umich.edu; shenghsi@umich.edu,", Edward/AAQ-1719-2021",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631; Nicholas, Lauren/0000-0003-0759-2849",NIA NIH HHS [K01 AG041763] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041028] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,20,27,30,2,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Avoiding the use of a 100% depreciation rate for generating public and private capital stock series that is applied in some related studies, this study estimates these series by using disaggregate data of various investment assets and applying their individual depreciation rates, as calculated by Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000). The results show that, first, (per capita) output, private capital stock, and public capital stock cointegrated in the sample period. Second, the contribution of private capital to output is 50% higher than that of public capital. Third, in the presence of significant and sizeable public capital spillover effects, growth in Taiwan is strictly endogenous. Finally, the dynamic model with a cointegration equation helps in studying some sensible short-run properties of the model and bi-directional effects among variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Key drivers of indexation are the funding ratio, inflation and real wage growth. The type of pension fund and the interest rate exposure are also statistically significant, although the latter effect is nonlinear. The asset allocation has no significant effect on the level of provided indexation as this is already captured by the funding ratio. We also examine the relation between policy ladders and the actual level of provided indexation. This study finds that a policy ladder with an upper limit equal to a 100 % real funding ratio is able to predict the actual level of indexation more accurately than a ladder with an upper limit based on a pension fund's required nominal funding ratio. The latter tends to overestimate the actual level of indexation.","[Broeders, Dirk; Rijsbergen, David] De Nederlandsche Bank DNB, Strategy Dept, Supervisory Policy Div, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hilbers, Paul] Nyenrode Business Univ, Breukelen, Netherlands; [Hilbers, Paul] De Nederlandsche Bank DNB, Supervisory Policy Div, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Shen, Ningli] Dagong Global Credit Rating Co, Beijing, Peoples R China",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; Nyenrode Business University; European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV,"Broeders, D (通讯作者)，De Nederlandsche Bank DNB, Strategy Dept, Supervisory Policy Div, POB 98, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",dirk.broeders@dnb.nl,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2014,162.0,1,,,,,41,70,,10.1007/s10645-014-9223-y,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AD0YU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332961500003,0

Proponents of this approach suggest that shareholders can legitimately be considered the owners of a firm because they hold shares. This approach, though attractive, is legally incorrect. Legal scholars have noted that a corporation cannot legally belong to shareholders or other stakeholders; no one owns the firm (and a corporation). The question of firm ownership masks the following crucial issue: Who should govern the firm? In this article, after returning to the theoretical debate on firm ownership and explaining why a firm cannot be owned, we shall analyze power as the core of firm governance. This approach is a potentially relevant and accurate way to address the problems of specific human investment, collective creation and productive (consummate) cooperation in modern firms.","[Chassagnon, Virgile] Catholic Univ Lyon, ESDES Sch Management, Lyon, France; [Chassagnon, Virgile] GREDEG, Nice, France; [Chassagnon, Virgile; Hollandts, Xavier] IFGE, Lyon, France; [Hollandts, Xavier] France Business Sch, Paris, France; [Hollandts, Xavier] CRCGM, Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Chassagnon, V (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Lyon, ESDES Sch Management, Lyon, France.",vchassagnon@univ-catholyon.fr; xavier.hollandts@france-bs.com,,,,,,,97,20,23,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

High-frequency event studies show that the introduction of unconventional monetary policy in the winter of 2008-09 had a strong, beneficial impact on banks and, especially, on life insurance companies. I interpret the positive effects on life insurers as evidence that expansionary policy helped to recapitalize the sector by raising the value of legacy assets. Expansionary policy had small positive or neutral effects on banks and life insurers during the period 2010-13. The interaction of low nominal interest rates and administrative costs forced money market funds to waive fees, producing a possible incentive to reach for yield to reduce waivers. I show that money market funds with higher costs did reach for higher returns in 2009-11, but not thereafter. Some private defined-benefit pension funds increased their risk taking beginning in 2009, but again such behavior largely dissipated by 2012. In sum, unconventional monetary policy helped to stabilize some sectors and provoked modest additional risk taking in others. I do not find evidence that riskiness of the financial institutions studied fomented a trade-off between expansionary policy and financial stability at the end of 2013.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Chodorow-Reich, G (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,48,74,92,1,29,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

This paper argues that those facts can be related to a long-run feature of the economy - namely, its institutional quality (IQL). The paper presents evidence that supports the link between an index of IQL (law and order, government stability, investment profile, etc.), and (i) the cyclicality of monetary policy, and (ii) the volatilities of output and the nominal interest rate. In a DSGE model, foreign investors that choose a portfolio of direct investment and lending to domestic agents, face a probability of partial confiscation which works as a proxy that captures IQL. The economy is hit by external shocks to demand for home goods and productivity shocks while its central bank seeks to stabilize inflation and output. In the long run, a lower IQL tends to discourage external liabilities. If there is a positive external demand shock, we observe an increase in output and real appreciation. The latter operates through two opposite channels. First, it directly increases the opportunity cost of leisure generating incentives to expand labor supply. Second, it reduces the real value of the debt denominated in foreign currency which stimulates consumption but contracts the labor supply. If the IQL is low, the economy attracts fewer loans for domestic consumers and shows a lower debt-to-consumption ratio in the steady state. This implies that the reduction of the real value of the debt caused by the real appreciation is smaller. Given this low wealth effect, the real appreciation leads to an expansion of the labor supply. Wages drop and inflation diminishes. The central bank reacts by cutting its policy rate to stabilize inflation and generates a negative comovement between output and the nominal interest rate (procyclical policy). As a corollary, negative correlations between policy rates and output are not necessarily an indicator of destabilizing polices even in the presence of demand shocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Over 19462009, countries with public debt/GDP ratios above 90% averaged 2.2% real annual GDP growth, not 0.1% as published. The published results for (i) median GDP growth rates for the 19462009 period and (ii) mean and median GDP growth figures over 17902009 are all distorted by similar methodological errors, although the magnitudes of the distortions are somewhat smaller than with the mean figures for 19462009. Contrary to Reinhart and Rogoffs broader contentions, both mean and median GDP growth when public debt levels exceed 90% of GDP are not dramatically different from when the public debt/GDP ratios are lower. The relationship between public debt and GDP growth varies significantly by period and country.

Locus of control is a psychological concept reflecting individuals' beliefs about the extent to which life's outcomes are determined by one's own behavior. Our primary goal is to estimate alternative models that are indicative of the various pathways that potentially link locus of control to healthy habits. We find that individuals with an internal locus of control are more likely to eat well and exercise regularly. This link remains once controls are included for individuals' future orientation and the value they place on their health. Men with an internal locus of control seem to expect higher health returns to their investments in diet and exercise. In contrast, women with an internal locus of control appear to adopt healthy habits because they derive greater satisfaction from those activities than women with external control tendencies.

A multi-item question on the willingness to take risk, a very short form of the DOSPERT scale (Weber et al., 2002) and a series of lottery tasks are compared with respect to the quality of the answers and the predictive validity of the derived risk measures. The quality of the collected data appears to be high. All the measures are informative about individual's attitudes while item nonresponse is mostly unproblematic. The measures however differ in their predictive power, with the lottery-based measures exhibiting only weak predictive validity. When the scope of the assessment is to predict behaviour, domain specific risk measures seem to be more appropriate. Embedding a short DOSPERT scale in general surveys appears to be very promising for empirical applications in social sciences that use survey-based risk measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The results suggest that multiple endogenous growth paths can exist in connection with various levels of financial development. due to the reciprocal externality between financial and real sectors. According to multiplicity, the growth effects of shocks on the technology of intermediation are opposite, depending on the balanced growth path. Furthermore, transitional dynamics is examined, and reveals that the high equilibrium is a saddle path, while the low-growth is locally stable. Therefore, the model presents local and global indeterminacy.

We find that our approximation has a higher power to detect U-shaped breaks and to smooth breaks than the linear method if the true data-generating process of the deficit-GDP ratio convergence is, in fact, a stationary non-linear process. The results show that the stationarity for fiscal policy varies across different regions and that the deficit-GDP ratio of half of the regions is stationary. The results related to the budget structural balance and the fiscal deficit indicate no expansion in the Eastern and Central regions. We find that China's provinces in these two regions meet the stability theory of fiscal policy in the current stage of development. The deficit-GDP ratio is not stationary in the Western and Northeastern regions.

The first concerns the system employed by Singapore, an economy similar in several ways to Hong Kong's, whereby the exchange rate is adjusted periodically in activist response to inflation and output developments. The second concerns a generalization, one that calls for adjustments of a weighted average of exchange rate and interest rate instruments, so designed to be effective whether the economy is, or is not, in a liquidity-trap situation. Finally, the third topic concerns political-economy aspects of policy, which tend to incline against the use of the activist systems.","[McCallum, Bennett T.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [McCallum, Bennett T.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"McCallum, BT (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",bmccallum@cmu.edu,,,,,,,58,5,5,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

For instance, in the case of import tariffs, the tax base is the product of quantity and unit value, both reported to, and during an audit assessed by, the custom authority. Import tariffs are particularly interesting as custom receipts represent an important share of government revenues in many developing countries and there has recently been a surge in empirical studies showing how evasion in this field is a pervasive phenomenon. I show that, with a multiplicative tax base, when the fiscal authority has an imperfect detection technology a greater declaration in one dimension actually increases the fine when evasion in the other dimension is detected. Therefore, there is an additional incentive for the taxpayer to underdeclare and a multiplicative tax base is subject to more evasion, compared to a tax base that can be assessed directly. As a result, fiscal revenues decrease with the dimensionality of the tax base. Also, voluntary compliance and fiscal revenues may be higher when the importer is required to declare only the total value of imports instead of quantity and unit value separately. This paper provides an argument in favour of uniform or specific tariffs and a reason for why a flat tax may improve compliance.","[Tonin, Mirco] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Tonin, Mirco] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Tonin, Mirco] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Southampton; Central European University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Tonin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England.",m.tonin@soton.ac.uk,"Tonin, Mirco/H-3697-2019","Tonin, Mirco/0000-0003-4831-9347",,,,,31,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The key finding concerns the importance of gender, with opportunity effects in criminal activity detected when considering female, but not male, unemployment. Further examination shows findings to support theories associated with victimization' and worsening socio-economic conditions, rather than those emphasizing latchkey care' effects and an absence of guardianship.

The model is extensively researched in the academia and frequently used in business world since its development half a century ago. Its popularity comes from the simplification it provides for the complex process of asset pricing by making the assumption that only one single factor affects stock returns. But, as this is an unrealistic assumption, the validity of the model in its standard (unconditional) form is repeatedly rejected by empirical tests. Pettengill et al., (1995) developed an alternative conditional CAPM approach where the standard model is improved by taking bull and bear market conditions into consideration. According to this model, there is a positive (negative) risk-return relationship during up (down) market periods. Using this reasoning, Pettengill et al., (1995) tested up and down market periods separately and reached highly significant results that support CAPM. In this study, both the unconditional and conditional versions of CAPM are tested in the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) for the period of nine years from 2003 to 2011. The test period is divided into four sub-periods. The unconditional CAPM is rejected for the sample period. A result of the conditional test shows that there is a statistically significant conditional relationship during some sub-periods. However, since the risk-return relationship in up and down markets is not symmetric, this conditional relationship does not indicate a positive risk-return tradeoff. Thus, CAPM may not be a useful asset pricing model for the ISE.","[Bilgin, Rumeysa; Basti, Eyup] Fatih Univ, TR-34500 Istanbul, Turkey",Fatih University,"Bilgin, R (通讯作者)，Fatih Univ, TR-34500 Istanbul, Turkey.",rumeysa_bil@yahoo.com; ebasti@fatih.edu.tr,"Bilgin, Rümeysa/AAH-5924-2020","Bilgin, Rümeysa/0000-0002-5919-0035",,,,,27,3,5,0,25,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This new data set shows that the ultimate cause of the accumulation of public debt of Italy lies in the extraordinary fiscal imbalance of the Southern regions. The new data allow us to test empirically a simple Common Pool model, augmented by a variable measuring the political influence of each macro region in the Government, to verify the existence of a geographically dispersed interests issue for the Italian case. Our measure of political influence turns out to significantly explain the regions' deficits also when controlling for population and income gaps. In addition, using a J-test approach, we find that including the predictions of the Common Pool Pork Barrel regional model into a general model of the Italian national deficit turns out to greatly increase its explanatory power.

On the other hand, we find little evidence that bargaining lowers the return on investment.

We hypothesize that the absence of consensus in the empirical literature on the CSR-financial performance relationship may be explained by the existence of synergies (complementarity) and trade-offs (substitutability) between the different CSR components. We investigate such relationship using a final unbalanced panel sample of 1094 observations (around 300 firms per year) from 15 countries over the 2002-2007 period. Our results show that responsible behaviours towards employees (human resources dimension) and towards customers and suppliers (business behaviour dimension) appear as complementary inputs of financial performance, indicating mutual benefits and less conflict between those stakeholders. Conversely, responsible behaviours towards customers and suppliers and towards the environment appear as substitutable inputs of financial performance, suggesting more conflict between or over-investment towards those stakeholders.","[Cavaco, Sandra] Univ Paris Pantheon Assas, LEMMA, F-75006 Paris, France; [Crifo, Patricia] Univ Paris West Nanterre La Def, F-92000 Nanterre, France; [Crifo, Patricia] Ecole Polytech, Lab Econometrie PREG CECO, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Crifo, Patricia] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Universite de Montreal,"Crifo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris West Nanterre La Def, F-92000 Nanterre, France.",patricia.crifo@polytechnique.edu,"Cavaco, Sandra/HGP-7568-2022","Cavaco, Sandra/0000-0001-6365-0885; Crifo, Patricia/0000-0001-6907-7856",,,,,65,138,149,5,90,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Import substitution industrialization policies encouraged excessive sectoral diversification early in the development process. Re-specialization in comparative advantage activities by higher per capita income countries coincided with a shift towards more market-oriented policies.

The analysis is carried out using administrative records from a regional public employment service in Spain (INAEM). We measure the effects of continuous training on the probability of finding a job after training and on labor stability by using the propenbsity score matching (PSM) technique. PSM reduces the bias that could be found in an estimate of the treatment effect obtained from simply comparing outcomes among workers participating in training courses versus those who did not. The results indicate that training is effective, but the effects differ significantly depending on workers characteristics and duration of the courses. We also provide new evidence on the effectiveness of labor market training during economic recession. From our results, it is clear that the effectiveness of training on workers employability has increased during the economic crisis that is affecting Spain since 2008.","[Clemente Lopez, Jesus; Garcia Castrillo, Pedro; Gonzalez-Alvarez, Maria A.; Sanso Frago, Marcos] Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"López, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",,"Gonzalez-Alvarez, Maria A./G-7302-2015","Gonzalez-Alvarez, Maria A./0000-0002-6271-4370",,,,,32,0,0,0,15,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2014,,208,,,,,77,106,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.14.1.3,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AW1FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346036800003,0

An equilibrium hegemonic strategy is modeled as the joint production and consumption of two goods (empire and leadership) that are produced with two input factors (political repression and political support). A persistent policy change on the part of a global-level actor, such as a shift in great power interference, leads to a change in the hegemonic strategy of the regional power and to a disequilibrium. It is shown that an equilibrium can only be restored by a corresponding persistent change in the level of state power. Economic performance is identified as a key determinant of state power.

However, governmental funding is usually not able to equip fully the sports sector. In order for the sports sector to be less dependent on government politics and finance, it is necessary to find ways, how sports organizations could themselves create possibilities for the development of their work. To achieve it, there is a need to analyze the cooperation peculiarities of the sports organizations and sponsors and prepare new cooperation management models. The efficiency of the sports organizations depends on the popularity of certain products within the market, target audience as well as business partners or sponsor organizations. To attract more sponsors and make effective and beneficial cooperation for both sides, it is essential to analyze the options for the creation of cooperative business relationship model which would lead to the development of more effective cooperation. The sports organizations and sponsors cooperate in order to strengthen the image of sponsors and reinforce certain social values through consumers caused by associations. The products of the sports organization, its target audience and the scale of product use, determines the outcome of sponsors and the size of the sponsorship program. This topic is significant in the following three problematic aspects: first - the reduction of corruption in the sports sector, second - the need for the sports organizations to be able to support themselves within the development of sports products and to strengthen the competitiveness of the sponsors, third - the development of the sports organizations' activities in order to maximize their potential opportunities. However, as the effective cooperative model has not been constructed yet, it is still difficult to achieve these goals. In order to implement these and other decisions, the article proposes to form a structured business model that is based on the major business elements and their links that ensure the effectiveness of this cooperation for the development of common products for the general market. The model includes the combination of the sports organizations and sponsors potentials at one general activity. The cooperation between the sports organizations and sponsors is underway in order to create symbiosis and synergy effects. This type of cooperation efficiently helps to exploit the potential of the sports organizations for their own benefit and the creation of greater value.","[Dilys, Mantas] Vilnius Univ, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Gargasas, Audrius] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, LT-53361 Akademija, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Dilys, M (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Muitines St 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",m.dilys@yahoo.com; audrius.gargasas@asu.lt,,,,,,,46,4,7,2,68,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Properly accounting for cointegration in an error correction model yields a much larger point estimate of the price elasticity of capital (close to -1).

Post-war regionalism and multipolar regionalism is complemented to a relatively new strategy in international relations - interregionalism. These new phenomena in international relations can be one of the answers to advancing globalization, in which supranational globalized economy takes dominance over local state politics and changes the center of gravity of international politics.

The search for sources of economic growth in this paper drew attention to the productivity growth debate a la Krugman's 'Perspiration vs. Inspiration' discussion. The paper hypothesised that increase in productivity growth is viewed as the key for breaking free from the middle-income trap. Based on Malaysia's early experiences in hosting multinational corporations, this paper also examines the incidence of spillovers from foreign to local industries as a way to improve productivity growth. Findings suggest that increase in skill intensity and capital utilisation may allow countries to move up the value chain and move out of the middle-income trap. Finally, evidence of spillovers may imply that the industrial dualism concerns may be less profound in the later years of a country's industrialisation phase.","Natl Univ Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies, Bangi, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Kam, AJY (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies, Bangi, Malaysia.",Andrew@ukm.edu.my,"Kam Jia Yi, Andrew/R-4041-2017","Kam Jia Yi, Andrew/0000-0002-7608-2423",,,,,44,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We look at fiscal and monetary policy implications of the liquidity problems arising in the crisis and stabilization process after that. The results show that the changes (and the speed of changes) of interest rates, GDP and money supply have occurred relatively fast, meaning that the rising area of the LM curve has been shorter than theory would predict.

We show that, when all groups are rewarded and able to interact freely with their peers, extrinsic and intrinsic motives are mutually self-reinforcing, leading to crowding in effects. As a result, the level of created knowledge increases in each group, reinforcing the diversity of the firm's knowledge base. By contrast, competitive rewards and constrained autonomy are likely to produce motivating effects in a small number of groups, limiting knowledge creation to the firm's core competencies. In this case, the firm can suffer from crowding out effects by the other groups, leading eventually to the extinction of creation in their fields and reduced diversity in the long run. The results are illustrated with empirical findings from a case study of a French high tech firm.","[Lazaric, Nathalie; Raybaut, Alain] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, GREDEG, Valbonne, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Lazaric, N (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, GREDEG, Valbonne, France.",lazaric@gredeg.cnrs.fr; raybaut@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,,,,,,55,7,7,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The Case of Spain,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESPANOLA-REVIEW OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fiscal imbalances; tax-benefit incidence analysis; Spanish territorial transfers; regional cash multipliers,,"The dispute over the manner of computing fiscal imbalances is not a technical one. Different methods serve different purposes and these purposes are political rather than simply economic. They differ basically in the consideration that territorial jurisdictions may merit. This is whether they are being seen much more than simply a pure geographical aggregation of individuals and their net fiscal residuals. Even for those authors who limit those imbalances as the result of personal redistributive fiscal flows, our paper shows that this does not seem to happen in Spain. Indeed, on the expenditure side, we do not observe a systemic pattern for the regional flows that properly matches personal income differences. Regions with similar income levels receive clearly discretional resources from the central government. This is the case not just for the monetary flow method, but also for the tax benefit incidence approach, despite the way in which the externalities of what are assumed to be 'public goods' spills over. In order to test whether this bias is political, purely random, or the result of a structural agglomeration or scale economies effect, we call for more data analysis. We need for a robust estimation of those factors a panel data approach to the composition of the observed imbalances. Transparency in this sense is the best strategy for refocusing the fiscal territorial debate in Spain.","[Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Rossello-Villalonga, Joan] Univ Illes Balears, Balearic Islands, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"López-Casasnovas, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem/A-9342-2013","Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem/0000-0001-8020-9987; Joan, Rossello/0000-0002-1933-6191",,,,,33,4,4,0,10,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2014,,209,,,,,55,97,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.14.2.2,0.0,,,43,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AW1FY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346036900002,0

All the individuals considered in the analysis are second-generation immigrants who were born and live under the same laws and institutions in the US. Following an epidemiological approach, the variation in self-employment rates by ancestors' national origin can be considered as supporting evidence of the effect of culture on self-employment. Our results show that culture has quantitatively significant effects on self-employment. This finding is robust to alternative specifications and to the introduction of several controls. Additional analysis shows that there are differences in the impact of culture on self-employment by gender, in that men are more sensitive than women to culture; and by economic activity, in that those individuals involved in professional, scientific, and technical activities, and those in accommodation and food service activities, are more affected by the impact of cultural differences.

We consider two pragmatic responses that produce a Pareto improvement, compared with the IMF rule: one mandated by the IMF and the other related to the trade of the additional credit limit in the market. Both these responses indicate that the additional credit limit on top of the IMF rule should be positive (negative) for a country whose investment return is larger (smaller) than the average investment return across all IMF member developing countries. The rule for the IMF credit limit does not reflect the demand for credit, which induces inefficiency.

Moreover, the great majority of 3020 DMAC strategies examined in this article outperform the corresponding buy-and-hold (B and H) strategy for both trading targets (i.e., OMX Helsinki 25 index and individual stocks included in the index) in out-of-sample tests.

It first analyses the financial symptoms that precede bankruptcy, such as low profitability, insufficient revenue or low solvency ratios. It also goes into the causes of these symptoms. It poses several hypotheses on causes of failure, such as loan growth (some of them risky), specialization (in this case concentration in real estate) and the pursuit of a turnover-driven strategy neglecting margin. It presents and tests a structural equation modelling based on partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM) and logistic regression. Results show that, 5 years before the crisis, failed banks had, compared to solvent banks, the following: higher loan growth, higher concentration on real estate loans, higher risk ratios, higher turnover, but lower margins. A relationship is found between symptoms and causes. Failed banks present a significant relationship between the percentage of real estate loans and risk. This relationship is negative in excellent banks, confirming that they allocated less real estate loans with a high quality. Nonfailed banks compensated increases in risk by strengthening their core capital.","[Serrano-Cinca, Carlos; Fuertes-Callen, Yolanda; Gutierrez-Nieto, Begona; Cuellar-Fernandez, Beatriz] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Finance, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Cuellar-Fernández, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Finance, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",bcuellar@unizar.es,"; Serrano Cinca, Carlos/K-1744-2017","Gutierrez Nieto, Begona/0000-0003-3044-4983; Cuellar Fernandez, Beatriz/0000-0002-5557-0380; Serrano Cinca, Carlos/0000-0003-2596-9638",,,,,59,11,14,3,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This is obviously connected with the generation of a considerable volume of waste. However, one of the most important strategies in waste management is to select the optimum waste dump site. To face with this problem, managers go in search of the techniques that not only can consider the technical and economic factors but also take into account environmental aspects to get a better perspective on the problem under consideration. The merit of using multicriteria decision making (MCDM) model is to consider different criteria. One of the most standard techniques used for the formulation of a complex problem under different criteria is Additive Ratio ASsessment (ARAS). In this paper, the ARAS based group decision making (GARAS) for evaluating the possible alternatives under partial or incomplete information is proposed. The proposed model contains three main stages: (i) identifying the main and sub-criteria, (ii) evaluating the feasible alternative by using fuzzy GARAS technique, and (iii) conducting a sensitivity analysis to determine how the importance weights influence the process of the decision making. To demonstrate the potential application of the proposed model, a real case study is illustrated. The strength of the proposed model is its effectiveness and capability to produce proper solutions under the inherent uncertainty involved in the process of modeling a real-life problem.","[Shariati, Shahram] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Geol, Sari Branch, Sari, Iran; [Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza] Islamic Azad Univ, South Tehran Branch, Young Researchers Club, Tehran, Iran; [Salsani, Armin] Univ Kharazmi, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Tehran, Iran; [Tamosaitiene, Jolanta] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University; Kharazmi University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Shariati, S (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Geol, Sari Branch, Sari, Iran.",shariati.shahram@gmail.com; Yazdani@ayerma.ir; rmn.salsany@gmail.com; jolanta.tamosaitiene@vgtu.lt,"Tamošaitienė, Jolanta/E-9278-2012; Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza/ABH-5851-2020","Tamošaitienė, Jolanta/0000-0003-4692-6821; Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza/0000-0001-5594-7726",,,,,39,18,19,0,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The cointegration and the Granger causality tests are adopted to examine the relationship between the variables. The results confirm the existence of long-run equilibrium among the variables of interest. Meanwhile, savings have positively affected economic growth in both the short run and long run. The Granger results also show that savings Granger-cause economic growth. Based upon these findings, we confirm that savings is a catalyst of growth for the Pakistani economy. Additionally, our results seem more likely to support the capital fundamentalists because the long run estimation as well as the Granger causality results also indicates that savings growth can effectively spur economic growth in Pakistan.

We then provide and examine an empirical model of old-age expenditure in a panel of 33 countries for the period 1998-2008.

Although the aggregate homeownership rate was relatively stable during that period, the distribution of homeownership rates by age changed in remarkable ways. While younger households saw substantial declines in homeownership rates, the opposite happened for older households. In this paper, we argue that the skill-biased technological change (SBTC) that began during the 1970s has been an important factor behind the observed change in the distribution of homeownership rates by age. We build a life cycle model in which skills are accumulated on-the-job through experience: learning by doing. Early in life, households have lower levels of skills and therefore lower earnings. SBTC increases the returns to skill, widening the wage gap between young and old ages. As a consequence, it takes more time for young households to become homeowners given frictions in financial markets (e.g. downpayment requirements) and housing markets (e.g. large and indivisible houses), in line with consumption smoothing behavior. On the other hand, older households that could not afford a house before may now become homeowners, given higher returns to skill. Our analysis confirms this conjecture, namely, that SBTC shifts the distribution of homeownership from the young to the old.

The paper presented a new model of risk attitudes called prospect theory, which elegantly captured the experimental evidence on risk taking, including the documented violations of expected utility. More than 30 years later, prospect theory is still widely viewed as the best available description of how people evaluate risk in experimental settings. However, there are still relatively few well-known and broadly accepted applications of prospect theory in economics. One might be tempted to conclude that, even if prospect theory is an excellent description of behavior in experimental settings, it is less relevant outside the laboratory. In my view, this lesson would be incorrect. Over the past decade, researchers in the field of behavioral economics have put a lot of thought into how prospect theory should be applied in economic settings. This effort is bearing fruit. A significant body of theoretical work now incorporates the ideas in prospect theory into more traditional models of economic behavior, and a growing body of empirical work tests the predictions of these new theories. I am optimistic that some insights of prospect theory will eventually find a permanent and significant place in mainstream economic analysis.","Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Barberis, NC (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,73,587,706,58,665,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Theoretically, both location determinants may weaken each other's impact. Using a unique 10-year dataset concerning the number of newly setup manufacturing firms at the sector level for 43 Belgian districts, we show that local effective tax rates have a negative impact on location decisions. Moreover, location-specific supply-side agglomeration rents attract new firms and their impact appears to be even stronger for more spatially concentrated sectors. Finally, we show that a higher effective tax rate in a district does not necessarily deter new firms in more agglomerated districts, pointing to the existence of taxable location-specific agglomeration rents.","[Crabbe, Karen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Thomas More Antwerp, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [De Bruyne, Karolien] HU Brussel, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Crabbe, Karen; De Bruyne, Karolien] Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"De Bruyne, K (通讯作者)，HU Brussel, Warmoesberg 26, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",karen.crabbe@kuleuven.be; karolien.debruyne@kuleuven.be,"De Bruyne, Karolien/A-9527-2014","De Bruyne, Karolien/0000-0002-4281-4542",,,,,44,1,3,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2013,161.0,4,,,,,421,446,,10.1007/s10645-013-9215-3,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,248HV,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326690000003,0

Following Pritchett (2000), there is a large empirical literature that has tried to identify the timing of these shifts in economic growth. Two distinct approaches have been developed by this literature. The first is a 'filter-based' approach that identifies growth breaks on the basis of subjectively defined rules, while the second approach is based on statistical structural break tests. The first approach is 'ad hoc' and lacks consistency across studies while the Bai-Perron method that is the basis of the statistical approach has low power, not able to discern true breaks in growth. In this paper, we propose a unified approach that combines the filter and statistical approaches, and avoids the limitations of each approach. Applying our approach to comparable GDP per capita data for 125 countries for the period 1950-2010, we are able to identify a much larger number of plausible breaks in GDP per capita than a pure statistical approach. More importantly, our approach is able to identify more breaks from countries with volatile growth paths, and hence has a larger proportion of breaks from developing countries, compared to other studies that use the pure statistical method of Bai-Perron.

It is also an English legal concept that distinguishes the English common law from the Roman law tradition of continental Europe. The trust is largely absent in the classical writings of Karl Marx and Max Weber on the origins and nature of capitalism. This essay demonstrates that the trust is central to an adequate understanding of capitalism - including the capitalist institutions of modern banking, corporations, and representative democracy - and demonstrates that modern banking and politics are mirror images of each other. Before capitalism, credit economies created institutions to protect debtors or often revived the social order by cancelling debts. The capitalist credit economy, by contrast, considers strict debt obligations a supreme moral good and a way of securing social order. It creates a political scheme to ensure that debt obligations are strictly fulfilled. This essay argues that this scheme is a trust. The trust turns the debts of individuals, whose death can cancel their debt obligations, into the debts of imaginary groups such as the modern state, whose identities and obligations are permanently maintained by replaceable trustees. The essay further holds that without the politics of the trust, modern banking could not have developed.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,,"Kim, Jongchul/0000-0001-9809-556X",,,,,32,7,7,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Firms must make profits to cover entry costs; thus the markup on goods prices is efficient. However, because leisure is not priced at a markup, the consumption-leisure trade-off is distorted. Consequently, the real wage, hours, and production are suboptimally low. Because of the labor requirement for entry, insufficient labor supply also implies that entry is too low. This paper shows that in the absence of fiscal instruments such as labor income subsidies, the optimal monetary policy achieves higher welfare under sticky wages than under flexible wages. The policy maker uses the money supply instrument to raise the real wage-the cost of leisure-above its flexible-wage level, in response to expansionary shocks to productivity and entry costs. This increases labor supply, expanding production and firm entry.","[Lewis, Vivien] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Lewis, Vivien] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, IMFS, Frankfurt, Germany",Ghent University; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Lewis, V (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",vivien.lewis@kuleuven.be,"Lewis, Vivien/N-5517-2015","Lewis, Vivien/0000-0002-2048-3340",,,,,18,11,12,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

By contrast, this analysis takes into account dis/similarities within each of the two regions. We use an ordered probit regression model based on European Social Survey 2010 and test the homogeneity of the two WE and EE regions. We apply a bottom-up psychological theory which divides factors into work-role inputs and work-role outputs. The results confirm the existing WE-EE gap in job satisfaction. Some factors show stronger effects on job satisfaction in one region than the other. The effects of gender and education proved statistically significant only in WE. Being paid appropriately is the most important work-role output and increases job satisfaction substantially more in Germany, France and the UK than in the rest of the WE region. Learning new things in work has the strongest positive impact in France, while Russia is the only country with a negative impact. The article provides a more detailed map of job satisfaction levels and its main factors across European countries.","[Mysikova, Martina; Vecernik, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Sociol, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Mysíková, M (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Sociol, Prague, Czech Republic.",martina.mysikova@soc.cas.cz,"Večerník, Jiří/B-7929-2014; Mysíková, Martina/B-9175-2014; Večerník, Jiří/HNP-8514-2023","Večerník, Jiří/0000-0002-0535-3118; Mysíková, Martina/0000-0002-6340-4753; Večerník, Jiří/0000-0002-0535-3118",,,,,30,10,12,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,DEC 1,2013,25.0,4,,,,,539,556,,10.1080/14631377.2013.844934,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,267OT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328107900007,0

There are many lessons from market experiences over the past eight years: there should be fewer free allowances, better management of market-sensitive information, and a recognition that trading systems require adjustments that have consequences for market participants and market confidence. Moreover, the emerging market architecture features separate emissions trading systems serving distinct jurisdictions and a variety of other types of policies exist alongside the carbon markets.This situation is in sharp contrast to the top-down, integrated global trading architecture envisioned 15 years ago by the designers of the Kyoto Protocol and raises a suite of new questions. In this new architecture, jurisdictions with emissions trading have to decide how, whether, and when to link with one another. Stakeholders and policymakers must confront how to measure the comparability of efforts among markets as well as relative to a variety of other policy approaches. International negotiators must in turn work out a global agreement that can accommodate and support increasingly bottom-up approaches to carbon markets and climate change mitigation.","[Newell, Richard G.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Newell, Richard G.] Duke Univ, Duke Univ Energy Initiat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Newell, Richard G.; Pizer, William A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pizer, William A.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Pizer, William A.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Inst Environm Policy Solut, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Pizer, William A.] Resources Future Inc, Bristol, Avon, England; [Pizer, William A.] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA; [Raimi, Daniel] Duke Univ Energy Initiat, Durham, NC USA",Duke University; Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University,"Newell, RG (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",richard.newell@duke.edu; william.pizer@duke.edu; daniel.raimi@duke.edu,"Raimi, Daniel/JFJ-3573-2023; Newell, Richard/I-3838-2015","Raimi, Daniel/0000-0002-9154-3371; Newell, Richard/0000-0002-3205-5562; pizer, william/0000-0003-1498-1148",,,,,81,118,130,2,242,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We focus on the effect of deunionization on rising skill premiums during the 1980s and 1990s. We find that the deunionization of unskilled workers can explain about 25 percent of the dramatic increase of the degree premium in the private sector. While the degree premium in the public sector increases less than that in the private sector, the deunionization of unskilled workers is also the main drive behind it. However, the deunionization of skilled workers has no significant effect on skill premiums. Neither do taxation and unemployment benefits. We also find evidence that casts doubts on the conventional argument of skill-biased technology change (SBTC) and industrial restructuring on earnings inequality. Our results reveal the specific importance of unskilled workers' unionization in the problem of increasing wage inequality.","[Peng, Fei] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Kang, Lili] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Birmingham; Tsinghua University,"Peng, F (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",,"Peng, Fei/A-2475-2011; Peng, Fei/W-5409-2019; 康, 丽丽/AAC-9220-2021","Peng, Fei/0000-0001-6985-351X; Peng, Fei/0000-0001-6985-351X; Kang, Lili/0000-0002-4726-050X",,,,,63,3,3,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

I find that the increased scarcity of labor over this period was a quantitatively important driver of participation. Moreover, a comparison of the responses in different segments of the labor market shows that the response was relatively stronger in sectors with larger shares of uninsured workers, namely in private firms, those with a larger share of low-educated workers, and those without labor unions. The results suggest that a tighter labor market in the years ahead can aid policy makers to implement social insurance programs and combat insurance inequality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Estimation results show that the surprise component of communication has highly statistically significant effects on exchange rates, whereas the response of euro exchange rates to the unanticipated change in the policy rate is more muted. I also estimate the financial market impact on euro exchange rates of US, European and German macroeconomic news, and I show that the impact of the ECB press conference is economically important. The process of fully incorporating the ECB news shock takes about 1 h, and thus this result suggests that the whole press conference (both the Introductory Statement and the Q&A part) provides valuable information to market participants.

Central to the debate is the conjecture that colleges and universities use their resources inefficiently and focus insufficiently on their mission to expand students' human potential. Our aim in this paper is to examine the theoretical premises of this conjecture in a small open economy and uncover the conditions under which public investment in higher education is efficient and desirable. We analyze non-stationary equilibria of an OLG economy, characterized by perfect capital mobility, intergenerational transfers and a hierarchical education system. The government uses income tax revenues to finance basic education and support higher education that generates skilled labor. Given this, the following issues are considered: (a) the impact of education and international markets on the equilibrium number of low-skilled and skilled workers in each generation; (b) the economic efficiency of public subsidies to higher education in generating skilled human capital; (c) the endogenous support for a government's educational policies found in a political equilibrium.

As the industry has grown, so has the anecdotal evidence that links the casino industry with political corruption. However, there have been no empirical analyses of the issue. We use state-level panel data from 1985-2000 to posit a Granger causality analysis of the relationship between corruption convictions of state public officials and the predicted adoptions of casinos at the state level. We find evidence that predicted casino adoptions Granger cause corruption convictions. This finding is suggestive of a scenario of regulatory capture and may help explain why state-level gaming regulatory agencies have a history of softening gaming regulations after the initial introduction of casinos. Our study provides the first empirical evidence linking casinos to political corruption.","[Walker, Douglas M.; Calcagno, Peter T.] Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29424 USA",College of Charleston,"Walker, DM (通讯作者)，Coll Charleston, 66 George St, Charleston, SC 29424 USA.",WalkerD@cofc.edu,,"Walker, Douglas/0000-0003-2298-3485; Calcagno, Peter/0000-0002-8440-0188",,,,,53,12,12,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The machine learning methodology for subgroup discovery has been used for the analysis. It enabled identification of five subsets of crises. Two of them have been identified as especially useful for the characterization of EU countries with banking crises in the year 2008. Fast growing credit activity is characteristic for the first subgroup while socioeconomic problems recognized by non-increasing quality of public health are decisive for the second subgroup. Comparative analysis of EU countries included into these subgroups demonstrated statistically significant differences with respect to World Bank good governance indicator values for the period before the crisis. Control of corruption, rule of law, and government effectiveness are the indicators which are statistically different for these sets of countries.

An integral part of this application is identifying the drivers of energy use for the energy consuming sector studied. In the case of industry, a monetary activity indicator such as value added is often taken as the driver. With the availability of physical production data for some industry subsectors, such as in tonnes or cubic meters, effort has been made by researchers to incorporate physical activity indicators in order to produce results that can better capture energy efficiency trends. We review and consolidate two different approaches to incorporating physical activity indicators in industrial energy studies using IDA. Based on their underlying concept, they are referred to as the intensity refactorization (IR) approach and the activity revaluation (AR) approach. We refine the AR approach, and compare the AR, IR, and the conventional monetary-based IDA approaches. Numerical examples and recommendations are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We answer this question in the framework of a neoclassical representative household model where the provision of a public consumption good is decided upon endogenously and in a time-consistent fashion. A simple version of such a model with aggregate productivity as the sole driving force fails to match important features of the business cycle dynamics of public consumption, which comes out as not as volatile and persistent as in the data and too synchronized with the cycle. We add implementation lags and implementation costs in the budgeting process to the model, plus taste shocks for public consumption relative to private consumption, and achieve a better fit to the data. All these ingredients are essential to improve the fit.

Evidence indicates that pass-through is faster to import prices than to consumer prices. Price setting behaviour in the distribution sector is suggested as one important explanation. If distribution costs and trade margins are important price components of imported consumer goods, adjustment of import prices and consumer prices to exchange rate movements may differ. We present evidence on these issues for Norway by estimating a cointegrated VAR model for the pricing behaviour in the distribution sector, paying particular attention to exchange rate channels likely to operate through trade margins. Embedding this model into a large scale macroeconometric model of the Norwegian economy, which inter alia includes the pricing-to-market hypothesis and price-wage and wage-wage spirals between industries, we find exchange rate pass-through to be quite rapid to import prices and fairly slow to consumer prices. We show the importance of the pricing behaviour in the distribution sector in that trade margins act as cushions to exchange rate fluctuations, thereby delaying pass-through significantly to consumer prices. A forecasting exercise demonstrates that exchange rate pass-through to trade margins has not changed in the wake of the financial crises and the switch to inflation targeting. We also find significant inflationary effects of exchange rate changes even in the short run, an insight important for inflation targeting central banks.","[Boug, Pal; Cappelen, Adne; Eika, Torbjorn] Stat Norway, Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Boug, P (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",pal.boug@ssb.no,,"Boug, Pal/0000-0003-3809-982X",,,,,45,10,10,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

I also show there could be interactions between the formal sector and modern agriculture. These empirical relations are analysed and theoretical departures from the literature are identified. I propose using a Structuralist-Kaleckian framework: with accumulation in the formal sector a large part of petty agriculture is modernised or converted to suit the needs of accumulation, and thereby we have a long-run drain of resources from petty agriculture and hence from informal sectors as well. However, even under such a resource drain, the urban informal sector may sustain or expand due to productivity advantages and due to pull from the formal sector, at the cost of its rural counterpart. In the short run when the formal sector and hence the urban informal sector expand or when the government promotes the urban or productive part of informal economy, a basic conflict between urban and rural informal sectors is exposed, given the generic agricultural supply constraint. Thus, the paradigms of inclusive growth and development management are questioned.","Visva Bharati Univ, Dept Econ & Polit, Santini Ketan, W Bengal, India",Visva Bharati University,"Chakrabarti, S (通讯作者)，Visva Bharati Univ, Dept Econ & Polit, Santini Ketan, W Bengal, India.",saumya.chakrabarti@visva-bharati.ac.in,,,,,,,53,5,5,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We show that these distributions can be described by mixtures of two distributions, reflecting low-end and high-end price segments. Our main findings are that higher economic growth is predictable from more new buildings being rented, more variation in the price levels and a larger size of the low-price segment, while lower economic growth emerges when the differences in prices between high-end and low-end segments increase and when the average price level in the low-price segment increases.","[Franses, Philip Hans; De Groot, Bert] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Franses, PH (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",franses@ese.eur.nl,,"Franses, Philip Hans/0000-0002-2364-7777; De Groot, Bert/0000-0002-3904-5033",,,,,4,4,4,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We investigate players' incentives to engage in such pre-contest communication. Our key assumption is that a player suffers a cost when he sends a message of confidence but later loses the contest. Sending a message thus increases one's incentive to win. For the favorite, this has the beneficial strategic effect of decreasing the underdog's equilibrium effort. In a standard Tullock contest model, however, with no costs of entry and complete information, this strategic advantage is not strong enough to outweigh the cost of sending the message.

The study evaluates the short- and long-run relationship between terrorism and economic factors over a period of 1975-2011. Both objectives have been achieved with the sophisticated econometrics techniques including cointegration theory, Granger causality test and variance decomposition, etc. The result reveals that macroeconomic factors, i.e., population growth, price level, poverty and political instability cause the terrorism incidence in Pakistan. However, income inequality, unemployment and trade openness have no long-run relationship with the terrorism incidence in Pakistan. The study may conclude that, for some how, Pakistan's macroeconomic indicators have significant long-run equilibrium with terrorism incidence. The result of Granger causality indicates that except unemployment, all other macroeconomic indicators have unidirectional causality with terrorism incidence. Unemployment has a bi-directional causality with the terrorism incidence in Pakistan. The results of variance decomposition indicate that there exists statistically significant cointegration among macroeconomic factors and terrorism incidence in Pakistan. Among macroeconomic factors, changes in price level exert the largest influence on terrorism in Pakistan. Contrary, the influence of poverty seems relatively the least contribution level for changes in terrorism incidence in Pakistan. (C) 2013 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In line with the MPC result, ZIP codes experiencing larger wealth losses, particularly those with poorer and more levered households, experience a larger reduction in credit limits, refinancing likelihood, and credit scores.

Although some previous studies have shown negative effects of oil prices on subjective well-being of one oil importing country the United States, since it is an outlier in terms of dependence on automobiles and in gasoline consumption per capita, these findings may not be representative of other oil importing countries. Our results show that, in fact, oil prices have quite strong negative effects on life satisfaction in a sample of over 40 oil importing countries. By contrast, for oil exporting countries for which there have been virtually no previous quantitative studies, but theoretical analyses suggest the results could be ambiguous, we find strong positive effects on life satisfaction.

We find that the derivative cashflows constitute substantial profits for these companies. Furthermore, hedging contributes to reducing the C-FaR for 10 of the companies. These findings are surprising considering that we expect hedging to yield zero expected profit and to smooth the earnings.

Bottom-up and top-down modeling approaches find widespread use in energy economic modeling and policy analysis, in which they differ mainly with respect to the emphasis placed on technology of the energy system and/or the comprehensiveness of endogenous market adjustments. For this study, we use a hybrid energy modeling approach, MARKAL-Macro, that combines the characteristics of two divergent approaches, in order to investigate and quantify the cost of climate policies for the US and an equivalent carbon tax. The approach incorporates Macro-economic feedbacks through a single sector neoclassical growth model while maintaining sectoral and technological detail of the bottom-up optimization framework with endogenous aggregated energy demand. Our analysis is done for two important objectives of the US energy policy: GHG reduction and increased energy security. Our results suggest that the emission tax achieves results quite similar to the CES policy but very different results in the transportation sector. The CAFE standard and RFS are more expensive than a carbon tax for emission reductions. However, the CAFE standard and RFS are much more efficient at achieving crude oil import reductions. The GDP losses are 2.0% and 1.2% relative to the base case for the policy case and carbon tax. That difference may be perceived as being small given the increased energy security gained from the CAFE and RFS policy measures and the uncertainty inherent in this type of analysis.

Manufacturing, however, has not been a major source of employment in Ethiopia and in other Sub-Saharan African countries. This paper relies on a unique census-based panel data covering the period 1996-2007 to analyse the micro-dynamics of aggregate employment changes. The analysis shows that the weak employment performance of Ethiopian manufacturing is not due to limited job creation but a consequence of simultaneous offsetting processes of job creation and destruction. We find strong evidence of intra-industry job mobility and attribute a substantial proportion of job creation and destruction to firm entry and exit. However, jobs created by small firms tend to be transitory and there has been a re-allocation of jobs from small to larger firms during periods of faster aggregate net employment growth. Overall, the evidence suggests that employment growth and job re-allocation are not necessarily restrained by labour laws and regulations.","[Shiferaw, Admasu] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Shiferaw, Admasu] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Bedi, Arjun S.] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands",William & Mary; University of Gottingen; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Shiferaw, A (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",ashiferaw@wm.edu,,,,,,,26,14,14,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In contrast, pure subsidies for mitigation lead to full participation and hence efficiency, but require large financial transfers which make them unattractive to industrialized countries. We present a simple model to demonstrate the impact of three policy options on the performance of offset programs: (1) baseline scale increases, (2) offset discounting and (3) setting stringent baselines. With baseline scale increases, entire political jurisdictions such as regions or nations are assigned a single, aggregate baseline and must choose whether to participate as one entity. We find that increasing scale both improves efficiency and reduces transfers from offset buyers to sellers. Offset discounting means paying less than the value of abatement and can be paired with trading ratios between offsets and allowances in a cap-and-trade system. We show that discounting is inefficient, but can make offsets more attractive to industrialized countries. Setting stringent baselines also involves a tradeoff between efficiency and transfers. We finally show that Pareto efficient policies that are individually rational for buyers and sellers entail some combination of discounting and/or stringent baselines: offset policies are never first-best, but can be efficiency improving, especially with increased scale.

A literature review on the drivers of cinema supply and demand is provided, and two competing hypotheses are extracted. Economic downturns could either lead to a sober mood and drive the interest in serious genres or drive the need for distraction leading to an increased interest in feel-good or action movies. However, characteristics of the movie industry suggest that economic key factors have only limited effects on supply and demand. A time series analysis of supply and demand in three major European markets indicate that demand is unrelated to the state of the economy. In aggregate, the demand does not instruct supply. Fluctuations in individual movie quality superpose potential effects of the economic context on the aggregated demand. Simultaneously, a focus on film as art superposes potential effects of the economic context on the supply.","Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"von Rimscha, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",b.vonrimscha@ipmz.uzh.ch,,"von Rimscha, M.

Compared to individual incentives, team incentives can affect productivity by changing both workers' effort and team composition. We present evidence from a field experiment designed to evaluate the impact of rank incentives and tournaments on the productivity and composition of teams. Strengthening incentives, either through rankings or tournaments, makes workers more likely to form teams with others of similar ability instead of with their friends. Introducing rank incentives however reduces average productivity by 14%, whereas introducing a tournament increases it by 24%. Both effects are heterogeneous: rank incentives only reduce the productivity of teams at the bottom of the productivity distribution, and monetary prize tournaments only increase the productivity of teams at the top. We interpret these results through a theoretical framework that makes precise when the provision of team-based incentives crowds out the productivity-enhancing effect of social connections under team production.","[Bandiera, Oriana] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Barankay, Iwan] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rasul, Imran] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Pennsylvania; University of London; University College London,"Bandiera, O (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",o.bandiera@lse.ac.uk; barankay@wharton.upenn.edu; i.rasul@ucl.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,33,125,147,0,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

A STRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION OF CHANGES IN THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF OIL PRICES,JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MONETARY-POLICY; INFLATION; RIGIDITIES,"Abstract In the 1970s, large increases in the price of oil were associated with sharp decreases in output and large increases in inflation. In the 2000s, even larger increases in the price of oil were associated with much milder movements in output and inflation. Using a structural VAR approach, Blanchard and Gali (in J. Gali and M. Gertler (eds.) 2009, International Dimensions of Monetary Policy, University of Chicago Press, pp. 373-428) argued that this reflected a change in the causal relation from the price of oil to output and inflation. They then argued that this change could be due to a combination of three factors: a smaller share of oil in production and consumption, lower real wage rigidity, and better monetary policy. Their argument, based on simulations of a simple new-Keynesian model, was informal. Our purpose in this paper is to take the next step, and to estimate the explanatory power and contribution of each of these factors. To do so, we use a minimum distance estimator that minimizes, over the set of structural parameters and for each of two samples (pre- and post-1984), the distance between the empirical SVAR-based impulse response functions and those implied by a new-Keynesian model. Our empirical results point to an important role for all three factors.","[Blanchard, Olivier J.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Blanchard, Olivier J.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",International Monetary Fund; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Blanchard, OJ (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",OBlanchard@imf.org; marianna.riggi@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,34,61,66,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The presumptive tax credit should be taxed at the level of business recipients, but individuals would receive the VAT along with indemnity payments without having to file a return.

Prior to the Great Moderation, there is evidence that changes in commodity price indices linearly lead inflation. The stability of the causal relationship appears to vary over time with a stronger bivariate link established before the Great Moderation. Further, there is evidence of significant nonlinear causality from raw industrials and metals indices to inflation with most of this detected nonlinear relationship being captured using the Baba, Engle, Kraft, and Kroner asymmetric generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model. This implies that the observed nonlinear Granger causality is largely driven by unanticipated shocks and volatility spillovers in the run-up of commodity prices in late 2000.

However, this positive association became either strongly negative or statistically insignificant as the child grew older. The estimated effects of parental job loss on children's happiness also appear to be unrelated to its effect on family income, parent-child interaction, and children's school experience.

This paper explores how this devastating experience affected victims' tendency to trust others. Individual-level data were used to examine the long-term influence of experiencing an atomic bomb on individuals' trust. After controlling for individual characteristics, I obtained the following key findings. Individuals who experienced the attack were more likely to trust others. Furthermore, estimation based on a subsample revealed that victims of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb were more likely to trust others than those born in other areas of Japan before World War II. This implies that experiencing an historically traumatic event in 1945 strongly influenced individuals' trust in others even at the beginning of the 21st century. It follows from this that the effect of this devastating experience was enduring and had a long-term influence on individuals' values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The results predict a reduction in the risk of poverty for the Catalan population of between 1.5 and 2%. Children and especially teenagers are amongst the groups who benefit the most.

Our analysis generates four salient findings. First, for each of the N regions, we define a balanced growth path equilibrium, we characterize the market clearing factor prices, and we determine the free entry condition in the R&D sector. Second, we show that without growth in human capital, there is no sustained economic growth in any of the N regions. Third, we show that human capital growth generates sustained economic growth in each of the N regions.

Poverty traps for the world economy, in the form of Pareto-dominated steady states, are also shown to exist. We show that the opening of trade can have the effect of pulling the initially poorer country out of a poverty trap, with both countries having steady state capital stocks exceeding the autarky level. However, trade can also pull an initially richer country into a poverty trap. These possibilities are a sharp contrast with dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models with normality in consumption, where the country with the larger (smaller) capital stock than the other will reach a steady state where the level of welfare is higher (lower) than in the autarkic steady state.","[Bond, Eric W.] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Iwasa, Kazumichi; Nishimura, Kazuo] Kyoto Univ, KIER, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Vanderbilt University; Kyoto University,"Nishimura, K (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, KIER, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Honmachi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",nishimura@kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23330063, 21243021] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,12,4,4,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We study the Australian age pension scheme and argue that current uncapped exemption may lead to distortionary incentives for high levels of housing wealth to be sheltered from the means test. We set up a life-cycle model with explicit housing choice and borrowing constraints to match some key features of the Australian economy. We find that abolishing the exemption of owner-occupied housing in the assets test increases aggregate output, capital accumulation, and welfare, but decreases housing investment and homeownership. However, removing such distortions does not necessarily imply that all households would be better off. Lowering taxes to maintain fiscal balance would result in wealthy households experiencing a large welfare loss, whereas the majority of the population would benefit.","[Cho, Sang-Wook (Stanley)] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Cho, SW (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",s.cho@unsw.edu.au,"Cho, Sang-Wook/AAS-3855-2020","Cho, Sang-Wook/0000-0002-8435-9322",,,,,24,8,8,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Because stamp duties are endogenous with respect to the house price, we create an instrumental variable that is the stamp duty on a property, based on the starting house price in the relevant postcode and the national house price trend. In a specification with postcode and year fixed effects, this instrument effectively captures policy changes and non-linearities in the stamp duty schedule. We find that the impact of an increase in the tax rate is to lower house prices suggesting that the economic incidence of the tax falls on the seller. We also observe impacts of stamp duty on housing turnover. A 10 per cent increase in stamp duty lowers turnover by 3 per cent in the first year, and by 6 per cent if sustained over a 3-year period.","[Davidoff, Ian] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Leigh, Andrew] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",International Monetary Fund; Australian National University,"Leigh, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",andrew_leigh@ksg02.harvard.edu,"Leigh, Andrew/AAV-1366-2020","Leigh, Andrew/0000-0002-5639-0509",,,,,32,13,14,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

As the generally accepted classical theory of land rent exemplifies, many types of income in capitalist economies, including interest, financial fees, speculative trading profits, and intellectual property royalties, arise as parts of the surplus value generated by the exploitation of productive labor appropriated through the assertion of various property rights. The dramatic phenomena of highly profitable business models based on network externalities associated with the internet and other information-based technologies do not represent new modes of value production, but modes (in some cases not particularly new) of participation in the pool of surplus value. National income accounting conventions that impute a fictitious output as a counterpart to incomes generated in sectors such as finance, professional and business services, education and health, and government, where there are no market-based measures of output create a distorted and misleading picture of value production and growth in advanced capitalist economies. A clear understanding of the origin of value in the expenditure of productive labor and of surplus value in the exploitation of productive labor is essential to thinking through the problems of post-industrial capitalist growth, distribution, resource conservation, and environmental protection.","[Foley, Duncan K.] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Foley, Duncan K.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM USA",The New School; The Santa Fe Institute,"Foley, DK (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, 6 East 16th, New York, NY 10003 USA.",foleyd@newschool.edu,,,,,,,14,63,68,3,70,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Using a nonlinear correlation measure, we find that the price co-movement between China's and international oil prices is stronger in the long-term than in the short-term. Employing a threshold error correction model, we find that long-term equilibrium relationships display significant asymmetric effects and exist in a regime only. Moreover, international oil prices can drive China's oil prices to run towards long-term equilibrium level, but not vice versa. Finally, we also investigate volatility transmission using BEKK-GARCH models. Both in-sample and out-of-sample evidences indicate that only unidirectional volatility spillover running from benchmark markets to China's oil market can be found. Benchmark markets dominate China's oil market. Overall, our results do not support the one great pool hypothesis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, the analysis presents life cycle trajectories of transfer receipt for immigrants and natives and studies the correlation between contextual factors and transfer receipt. We find no statistically significant differences in the probability of transfer receipt between immigrants and natives once socioeconomic characteristics are taken into account. Being a single parent, labor market status, and human capital are most closely correlated with the incidence of transfer receipt for both natives and immigrants. Interestingly, recent welfare reforms did not reverse prior patterns of welfare dependence.","[Riphahn, Regina T.; Wunder, Christoph] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Riphahn, RT (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Econ, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",regina.riphahn@wiso.uni-erlangen.de,,,,,,,52,8,8,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The direct effect is the difference in the test performance between classes of the same school with and without external examiners. The indirect effect is the difference in performance between un-monitored classes in schools with an external examiner and un-monitored classes in schools without external monitoring. We find that the overall effect of having an external examiner in the class is to reduce the proportion of correct answers by 5.5 to 8.5% - depending on the grade and the test - with respect to classes in schools with no external monitor. The direct and indirect effects range between 4.3 and 6.6% and between 1.2 and 1.9% respectively. Using additional supporting evidence, we argue that the negative impact of the presence of an external examiner on measured test scores is due to reduced cheating (by students and/or teachers) rather than to the negative effects of anxiety or distraction from having a stranger in the class.

In addition, we examine environmental sector performance related factors through a shift-share decomposition analysis. We show that wide divergences exist regarding environmental, economic and innovation performances among the EU countries. The leading role of Germany emerges, with strong underpinnings in its economic specialization, rooted in manufacturing. France excels in some services, while Italy suffers. Germany and Sweden present the most win-win economic-environmental sector performances. Our investigation illustrates how economic and environmental performances can potentially be effectively interrelated. Examples of integrated innovation-economic-environmental performances appear. Nevertheless, the sector view highlights that the foundations of macro performance rely on various elements related to structural change and innovation. Further research could investigate how composition effects and innovation changes correlate towards the achievement of sustainable economic development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Sukuk issues, which are Islamic financial instruments structured to replicate the cash flows of conventional bonds, have notably proliferated, fuelling the debate on the similarity between Islamic and conventional finance. Using an event study methodology on a sample of Malaysian listed companies, we investigate whether stock market investors react differently to the announcements of sukuk and conventional bond issues. We find that the stock market is neutral to announcements of conventional bond issues, but it reacts negatively to announcements of sukuk issues. We attribute this finding to the excess demand for Islamic investment certificates and to an adverse selection mechanism that favors sukuk issuance by lower-quality debtor companies.

Using the misalignment of actual REER from its equilibrium level, we have estimated the factors explaining the extent of currency over- or under-valuation. Overall, we find that the higher the flexibility of the currency regime, the lower is the misalignment. The estimates are robust to different sub-samples of countries. We then explore the impact of such misalignment on the probability of a currency crisis in the next period, indicating the extent to which misalignment could be used as a leading indicator of a potential crisis. This paper thus makes a new contribution to the debate on the choice of exchange rate regime by bringing together real exchange rate misalignment and currency crisis literature.

High work morale is therefore essential for sustaining voluntary cooperation and high productivity in firms. We conducted a field experiment to test whether workers reciprocate wage cuts and raises with low or high work productivity. Wage cuts had a detrimental and persistent impact on productivity, reducing average output by more than 20%. An equivalent wage increase, however, did not result in any productivity gains. The results from an additional control experiment with high monetary performance incentives demonstrate that workers could still produce substantially more output, leaving enough room for positive reactions. Altogether, these results provide evidence consistent with a model of reciprocity, as opposed to inequality aversion.","[Kube, Sebastian] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Marechal, Michel Andre] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Puppe, Clemens] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Zurich; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Kube, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",kube@uni-bonn.de; marechal@iew.uzh.ch; clemens.puppe@kit.edu,,"Marechal, Michel/0000-0002-6627-0252",,,,,36,104,121,1,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

I use firm-level data and two events in Mexico as a natural experiment to identify the effects of a fall in the marginal cost of offshoring to Mexico. I find that domestic wages actually rise at US firms likely to take advantage of this new offshoring opportunity. At the same time, domestic wages fall at US firms unlikely to take advantage of this opportunity. Furthermore, I find no evidence of greater domestic job loss at the former compared to the latter firms. These findings are consistent with productivity effects from offshoring. To explain the mechanism, I develop a theoretical framework that combines heterogeneous firms with imperfect labor markets and rent-sharing. Firms likely to take advantage of new offshoring opportunities increase their productivity and profitability at the expense of their competitors. Through rent-sharing, this channel leads to higher domestic wages at the former firms relative to the latter. Further, there is no empirical evidence of greater domestic job loss at the firms likely to expand their offshoring compared to their competitors that are unlikely to increase their offshoring.

We discuss possible alternative criteria for choosing one fertility level over another. In accordance with earlier studies, we focus on age dependency as the sole criterion. But we do so by relaxing the strong assumption that all individuals of a given age are equal in terms of their economic contribution to society and introduce education as probably the most relevant observable source of population heterogeneity. Our criterion variable is the education-weighted support ratio and we perform thousands of alternative simulations for different constant levels of fertility, starting from empirically given populations. If education is assumed to present a cost at young age and results in higher productivity during working age, then for most countries the desirable long-term total fertility rate turns out to be well below replacement level.","[Striessnig, Erich] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Social Policy, Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital IIA, VID OAW,WU, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Lutz, Wolfgang] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, World Populat Program, Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital IIA, VID OAW,WU, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Striessnig, E (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Social Policy, Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital IIA, VID OAW,WU, Nordbergstr 15-6-A, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",erich.striessnig@wu.ac.at; lutz@iiasa.ac.at,,"Striessnig, Erich/0000-0001-5419-9498",,,,,39,11,14,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2013,40.0,3,,,SI,,409,425,,10.1007/s10663-013-9213-3,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,181KH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321666000003,0

After controlling for country and loan specific variables, we find that lenders residing in countries with low tolerance to uncertainty and ambiguity price risk upwards more proportionately than lenders in other countries. The average loan spreads are higher in countries with a higher masculinity index. The lenders charge a higher risk premium because of the perceived higher risk embedded in a higher masculine society. Also, even controlling for the credit ratings of the borrowers, we find that trade balance affects the cost of borrowing firms.

A single firm's R&D investment increases (or decreases) if the network effect (or piracy effect) is dominant. With R&D competition, if the firms significantly differ with respect to their R&D efficiencies and if the piracy effect dominates the network effect then the less efficient firm's R&D investment increases and that of the more efficient firm's decreases. In this case, the overall probability of successful innovation increases. The reverse holds if the network effect dominates the piracy effect. If the firms are less asymmetric then their R&D investment either increases or decreases depending on the relative strengths of the piracy and network effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The agent receives a fixed prize when her prediction error, defined by a loss function specified in the incentive scheme, is smaller than an independently generated random number and earns a smaller prize otherwise. Adjusting the loss function according to the belief elicitation objective, the scoring rule can be used in a rich assortment of situations. Moreover, the scoring rule can be incentive compatible even when the agent is not an expected utility maximizer. Results from our probability elicitation experiments show that subjects' predictions are closer to the true probability under this scoring rule compared to the quadratic scoring rule.","[Hossain, Tanjim] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Okui, Ryo] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",University of Toronto; Kyoto University,"Hossain, T (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,"Okui, Ryo/HLX-4542-2023",,,,,,44,89,110,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

When customers are fully rational, it is optimal for sellers to offer the right to cancel or return on favourable terms. A generous return policy makes the seller's cheap talk at the point of sale credible. This observation provides a possible explanation for the excess refund puzzle and also has implications for the management of customer reviews. When customers are credulous, instead, sellers have an incentive to set unfavourable terms to exploit the inflated beliefs they induce in their customers. The imposition of a minimum statutory standard improves welfare and consumer surplus when customers are credulous. In contrast, competition policy reduces contractual inefficiencies with rational customers, but it is not effective with credulous customers.","[Inderst, Roman] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Inderst, Roman] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Ottaviani, Marco] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Goethe University Frankfurt; Imperial College London; Bocconi University,"Inderst, R (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,"Ottaviani, Marco/0000-0002-0943-162X",,,,,29,29,34,2,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Yet this crucial element of their story was abandon by most later trade economists in favor of the analytically-tractable but counter-empirical assumption that all countries share identical and homothetic preferences. This paper presents a set of assumptions which produces multiple results when they hold jointly. Most of these results are novel, but several that are implicit or explicit in earlier literature are also noted for completeness. Adding non-homothetic preferences to traditional models helps explain such diverse phenomena as a growing skill premium, the mystery of the missing trade, home bias in consumption, the behavior of trade to GDP ratios, and the role of intra-country income distribution, from the demand side of general equilibrium. With imperfect competition, we can explain higher markups and higher price levels in higher per-capita income countries, and the puzzle that gravity equations show a positive dependence of trade on per-capita-incomes, aggregate income held constant. The model also predicts horizontal multinational activity is negatively related to per-capita income differences between countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, an average person born at the end of the 20th century completed 14 years of schooling and spent 40 hours a week working. In the span of 100 years, completed years of schooling doubled and working hours decreased by 30%. What explains these trends? We consider a model of human capital and labor supply to quantitatively assess the contribution of exogenous variations in productivity (wage) and life expectancy in accounting for the secular trends in educational attainment and hours of work. We find that the observed increase in wages and life expectancy accounts for 80% of the increase in years of schooling and 88% of the reduction in hours of work. Rising wages alone account for 75% of the increase in schooling and almost all the decrease in hours in the model, whereas rising life expectancy alone accounts for 25% of the increase in schooling and almost none of the decrease in hours of work.

Based on the sample of contest experiments that we review, the median overbidding rate is 72%. We provide different explanations for the overbidding phenomenon, including bounded rationality, utility of winning, other-regarding preferences, probability distortion, and the shape of the payoff function.

For the empirical analysis a unique firm-level data set is constructed that combines survey data for German firms with a merger and acquisition database. After a cross-border acquisition, investing firms display a higher rate of domestic expenditures for research and development. Controlling for endogeneity of foreign acquisitions by estimating a two-equation system with limited dependent variables and applying instrumental variable techniques it is found that part of this correlation stems from a causal effect. The estimated effects are robust towards alternative identification strategies and are higher in industries with high knowledge intensity. The analysis is complemented by an investigation of the effects on tangible investment spending and by a comparison of the. effects of cross-border acquisitions to those of greenfield foreign direct investments and domestic acquisitions.

Using a large panel of firms from several Central and Eastern European countries, the paper identifies factors influencing the competitiveness of firms in conditions of transition. Competitiveness, measured by firms' market share, is defined as a function of several elements of firms' restructuring behavior (e. g., improvements in cost-efficiency and labor productivity and investment in new machinery and equipment) as well as characteristics of firms and their environment, such as location, experience, technological intensity of their industries, and intensity of competition. To control for the dynamic nature of competitiveness and the potential endogeneity of its determinants, and to distinguish between short-and long-run effects of firm behavior, a dynamic panel methodology is employed. Our results indicate that the competitiveness of firms in transition economies is enhanced by improvements in their cost efficiency and labor productivity, investment, and their previous business experience, but stronger competition has a negative effect on it.","[Stojcic, Nebojsa] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik, Croatia; [Hashi, Iraj] Staffordshire Univ, Sch Business, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DE, Staffs, England; [Telhaj, Shqiponja] London Sch Econ, CEP, London, England; [Telhaj, Shqiponja] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Dubrovnik; Staffordshire University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Sussex,"Stojcic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",nstojcic@unidu.hr; i.hashi@staffs.ac.uk; s.telhaj@lse.ac.uk,"Stojcic, Nebojsa/S-5641-2018","Stojcic, Nebojsa/0000-0001-6638-8771",,,,,52,8,9,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

We find that path independence to income changes can further be imposed provided a numeraire good is available in the consumption set. We show that, for practical purposes, McFadden's (1981) 'residual income' specification of the conditional indirect utility function offers an appropriate means of representing path independence to price and income changes.

This paper develops a disaggregated model of the BP constraint with two types of exports (manufactures and primary commodities) and two types of imports (intermediate and final goods). Econometric estimates (including tests for structural breaks) show that the BP-equilibrium growth rate did not fall, but instead rose in the post-liberalization period, so this model cannot account for the country's growth slowdown. Instead, the analysis points to the need to consider the real exchange rate as well as internal obstacles and policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First, consistent with previous empirical studies, we find that a plant that belonged to industries with higher imported intermediate variety growth experienced higher productivity growth. Second, our empirical results suggest that increased imported intermediate varieties stimulated the product-switching behavior of domestic plants. Because product-switching behavior (i.e. simultaneously adding and dropping products) could be understood as a part of the continual process of creative destruction' within plants, our results imply that imported intermediate variety growth may be one of the channels through which resource reallocation within plants can be promoted.","[Choi, Yong-Seok] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Hahn, Chin Hee] Gachon Univ, Dept Econ, Songnam 461701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Gachon University,"Choi, YS (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Hoegidong, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",choiy@khu.ac.kr; chhahn@gachon.ac.kr,"Choi, Yong-Seok/AAH-9264-2020","Choi, Yong-Seok/0000-0002-9689-2335",,,,,28,3,4,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Unlike previous research in the urban growth literature, we formulate the model as a one-shot game and take an evolutionary game-theoretic approach for stability analysis. Our approach enables us to analyze stability of nonstationary equilibria in which populations of each region are not constant over time. We show that if both the expenditure share for housing and inter-regional transport cost are small, a stable stationary equilibrium does not exist. Moreover, in such a case, we show that there can exist a stable nonstationary equilibrium in which mobile workers agglomerate in one region at first but some of them migrate to the other region later. We argue that such a nonstationary location pattern is related to return migration. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We consider whether consumption growth is affected by stock returns and the dividend yield. The use of returns determines the existence of a wealth effect, while the use of the dividend yield can determine whether consumption is affected by short-term deviations of prices from fundamental value (bubbles) as well as expectations of future economic behaviour. Panel unit root tests confirm the stationarity of each variable, although high persistence is noted in the dividend yield. Regression results support a significant relationship between the dividend yield and consumption growth, such that a fall in the yield (high prices relative to dividends) is associated with higher future consumption. This result is robust across different empirical specifications to control for high persistence and possible cross-sectional dependence. Results for returns differ across the specifications but are typically supportive of a positive relationship. Overall, we argue our results support the view that when stock prices deviate from their fundamental path this has an effect on future consumption. This may have important implication with regard to how policy-makers deal with stock market bubbles, both positive and negative. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Kazakhstan has two major export products, oil (point-source) and wheat (diffuse), and in theory these two products have different impacts on growth. Auty (1997), Woolcock et al. (2001) and Isham et al. (2005) found that it is the composition of resources, rather than any kind of natural resource, which is problematic for economic growth. The novelty of this research is that the natural resource endowments are considered as a nonlinear function of institutional quality. In contrast to others, we observe that it is not the type of natural resources that breeds economic failure, but rather their overabundant or excess production that is often associated with rent-seeking activities.

The American and European responses were new regulation and supervision of the rating agencies' activities and resolving issues on an as-needed basis. Are these efforts enough? Building on the discussion in M. Ahmed Diomande, James Heintz and Robert Pollin (2009), this paper puts forth a template for a public credit ratings agency. This agency's functions include the validation of the ratings of private rating agencies and the examination of the relationship between ratings changes and the business cycle. A public credit rating agency could be split into divisions, each of which focuses on particular types of borrowers: financial firms (banks and non-bank financial institutions), nonfinancial firms (corporations and SMEs) and households. These divisions could liaise with relevant agencies such as, for instance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The paper concludes by arguing that national public credit rating agencies are not enough, and there needs to be an international credit rating agency, possibly housed at the United Nations, designed to validate sovereign ratings created by private agencies.","Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Schroeder, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,,"Schroeder, Susan/0000-0002-5780-219X",,,,,9,3,3,0,16,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We look at country and product diversification of exports from Eastern Europe (EE) and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), two groups of countries that both substantially increased trade openness since the beginning of transition, but took different paths in terms of product and geographical composition of exports, and compare with the export diversification predicted by the gravity equation estimated on a large sample of countries in 2001-2007. The results demonstrate substantial deviations of the actual diversification levels from the levels predicted by the gravity model for the CIS countries, while the EE countries' levels of diversification are much closer to the levels predicted by the model and consistent with the data. All CIS countries lag behind the region leaders - Czech Republic and Poland - in terms of the degree of export diversification. In particular, the CIS countries extensively engaged in the export of raw materials have the most concentrated exports in terms of their product composition. In terms of geographical diversification, Belarus has the least diversified exports among all transition countries.","[Shepotylo, Oleksandr] Kyiv Sch Econ, UA-04119 Kiev, Ukraine; [Shepotylo, Oleksandr] Kyiv Econ Inst, UA-04119 Kiev, Ukraine",Kyiv School of Economics; Kyiv School of Economics,"Shepotylo, O (通讯作者)，Kyiv Sch Econ, Vul Yakira 13, UA-04119 Kiev, Ukraine.",oshepotylo@eerc.kiev.ua,"Shepotylo, Oleksandr/G-4773-2015","Shepotylo, Oleksandr/0000-0003-4990-6025",,,,,27,8,10,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This paper analyzes two distinct mechanisms on norm compliance: punishment and reputation. The model considers two groups of agents in a society with one norm. Agents in one group choose whether to comply with the norm, while agents in the other group potentially punish opponents who violate the norm. The paper investigates two scenarios to account for the long-run stability of the norm. In one scenario, the norm is enforced due to a higher level of punishment of the violation. In another scenario, everyone is motivated due to reputation formation, despite a lower level of punishment by others. The interaction of two mechanisms provides a convenient way to norm compliance.

These variables have been exposed to large fluctuations for more than two decades in all emerging economies; therefore, structural breaks have to be taken into account in all estimations. In this article, various methodological techniques have been used to examine this long-run relationship (with and without the structural breaks). Two important results have emerged, first; when the structural changes are excluded there is a strong evidence for long-run relationship between current account and relative prices. Second; when the structural breaks are included, variables are found to be stationary. Hence, depending on the stability of the variables, the validity of the cointegration relationship has been seriously questioned. This study illustrates that the test results proving non-stationary of the series and the presence of cointegration may be spurious if there is any possibility of instability.","[Uz, Idil; Ketenci, Natalya] Yeditepe Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Yeditepe University,"Uz, I (通讯作者)，Yeditepe Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",idiluz@yeditepe.edu.tr,"Ketenci, Natalya/S-7612-2017","Ketenci, Natalya/0000-0002-7299-2833",,,,,61,0,0,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The most telling finding is that median wealth plummeted by 47 percent over the years from 2007 to 2010. The inequality of net worth, following two decades of little movement, was up sharply between 2007 and 2010. Relative indebtedness continued to expand during the late 2000s for the middle class, although the proximate causes were declining net worth and income, rather than an increase in absolute indebtedness. In fact, the average debt of the middle class in real terms was down by 25 percent. The sharp fall in median net worth and the rise in its inequality from 2007 to 2010 are traceable to the high leverage of middle class families and the high relative importance of homes in their portfolio.","NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Wolff, EN (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,8,31,36,0,16,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In this paper we review and contrast the trilemma policy choices and trade-offs faced by the two key drivers of global economic growth: China and India. China's trilemma configurations are unique relative to other emerging markets in terms of the predominance of exchange rate stability, and in the failure of the trilemma regression to capture a consistently significant role for financial integration. In contrast, the trilemma configurations of India are in line with choices made by other emerging countries. Over time, India, like other emerging economies, has converged towards a middle ground among the three policy objectives, and has achieved comparable levels of exchange rate stability and financial integration buffered by sizeable international reserves.","[Aizenman, Joshua] USC, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，USC, SIR & Econ, VKC 314, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",aizenman@usc.edu,,,,,,,16,16,18,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Why are financial systems hierarchical? The answer offered here is mutualization at scale: balance sheets with access to larger economic catchment areas impart liquidity discipline or elasticity on smaller balance sheets, thereby setting the terms on which the latter operate. Hierarchy then sets the logical limit to the constructive power of law viz. finance. Yet because hierarchy is an abstract, functional requirement, the concrete institutional form that expresses this function is indeterminate a priori. This openness is a key predicate of the constructive power of law and politics in finance, allowing us to conceptualize systems that are democratic even while they attend to the specific logic of financial systems.

On the whole, results show that forwards negatively affect leverage risk, the use of swap contracts has negative effect on credit risk, the use of Options generally increases risk, and finally the use of futures minimally contributes to bank risk. There is some evidence that forwards and swaps are used primarily for risk-control purposes, while options tend to be used for speculative purpose. The main finding is that banks in the sample do not seem to be at risk by using derivative instruments.","[Keffala, Mohamed Rochdi] Univ Lyon 1, Inst Financial & Insurance Sci, ISFA Sch, Lab Actuarial & Financial Sci,SAF,EA2429, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [de Peretti, Christian] Ecole Cent Lyon, Inst Financial & Insurance Sci, ISFA Sch, Dept CLES,Lab Actuarial & Financial Sci,SAF,EA242, F-69130 Ecully, France",Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Ecole Centrale de Lyon,"Keffala, MR (通讯作者)，ISFA, 50 Ave Tony Garnier, F-69366 Lyon 7, France.",mrkeffala@yahoo.fr,"Keffala, Mohamed Rochdi/KAL-8613-2024; de+Peretti, Christian/AAA-3368-2019","de+Peretti, Christian/0000-0001-7956-6629",,,,,17,1,1,0,10,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

In regards to risk sharing, less risk-averse agents prefer highly risk-averse partners, who pay a high risk premium. Negative sorting is, however, inconsistent with empirical and experimental literature. To resolve this conflict, we propose a model where agents can control the risks to their incomes. In regards to risk management, agents prefer similar partners because of their aligned objectives in risk management. When it is easy to control risks or all agents are sufficiently risk-averse, the risk-management effect dominates, leading to positive sorting.","[Li, Sanxi; Chen, Pu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Sun, Hailin] Sunshine Insurance Grp, Asset Management Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Li, SX (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",lisanxi@gmail.com; hailinsun@gmail.com; puchen@ruc.edu.cn,"wang, chen/JED-7289-2023",,,,,,22,7,8,2,19,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

I include rule-of-thumb households with no access to financial markets and test whether remittances are countercyclical and serve as an insurance mechanism against macroeconomic shocks. When evaluating the welfare implications of alternative monetary rules, I consider both an anticipated large secular increase in the trend growth of remittances and random cyclical fluctuations around this trend. In a purely deterministic framework, a nominal fixed exchange rate regime avoids a rapid real appreciation and performs better for recipient households facing an increasing trend for remittances. A flexible floating regime is preferred when unanticipated shocks driving the business cycle are also part of the picture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We also found interesting power by culture interactions that Chinese were more likely to judge the items found by powerful people to be more valuable than the ones found by less powerful people, while Americans were more likely to judge the items found by less powerful people to be more valuable than the powerful people. In addition, American participants were more likely to judge the items loss by powerful people to be more valuable than by less powerful people.

Also, we make some hybrid cases to go further in the detail of the tested asymmetries. While mainly following the methodology given by Cover (1992), we make some necessary variations to the procedure. We find evidence in the favor of asymmetry in the effects of monetary policy actions on output. Our results indicate that monetary policy actions seem ineffective in periods of high growth while having strong effects on output during low growth periods. Further, output responds strongly to tight monetary policy actions when the economy is in low growth phase. We also find some support for the argument that negative money supply changes affect output whereas positive changes do not. The findings also suggest that output responds only to small monetary policy shocks and big shocks do not significantly explain the variations in the transitory component of output The results of hybrid case give further insight that output strongly responds to small negative monetary policy shocks. Wald test rejects the hypothesis of symmetry in the favor of asymmetry in the response of output to monetary policy actions in all the cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Default induces permanent exclusion from financial markets and endogenously determined solvency constraints prevent debt repudiation. Our analysis shows that such an enforcement mechanism is essentially fragile, leading to equilibrium multiplicity. We accomplish this by establishing Welfare Theorems under a weaker notion of constrained efficiency, inspired by Malinvaud, corresponding to the absence of welfare improving feasible redistributions over finite (though indefinite) horizons. A Negishi's Method permits to show that, for any arbitrary value of social welfare in between autarchy and constrained optimality, there exists an equilibrium attaining that value.

A question central to the study of knowledge-sharing arrangements is the impact of competition on cooperation. While cooperation has the benefit of avoiding duplication, it may have an adverse effect on the competitive advantage of a leading firm. Hence, firms face a difficult challenge during the innovation process while deciding which components of it, if any, to carry out in collaboration with other firms. This paper reports the results of controlled laboratory experiments which identify how the decision to form research joint ventures changes with both relative progress during the R&D process and the intensity of product market competition. The design is based on a modified version of Erkal and Minehart Optimal Sharing Strategies in Dynamic Games of Research and Development. Research Paper 1038, University of Melbourne, Department of Economics, 2008. The results indicate that if expected profits are such that the lagging firms always stay in the race, cooperation unravels as firms move forward in the discovery process and as monopoly profits become more attractive. These results are generally consistent with the theoretical predictions.","[Deck, Cary] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Erkal, Nisvan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Melbourne,"Deck, C (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",cdeck@walton.uark.edu; n.erkal@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,28,7,10,0,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,,,ECON INQ,Econ.

We then present a model which links house price movements across neighborhoods within a city and the gentrification of those neighborhoods in response to a city wide housing demand shock. A key ingredient in our model is a positive neighborhood externality: individuals like to live next to richer neighbors. This generates an equilibrium where households segregate based upon their income. In response to a city-wide demand shock, higher income residents will choose to expand their housing by migrating into the poorer neighborhoods that directly abut the initial richer neighborhoods. The in-migration of the richer residents into these border neighborhoods will bid up prices in those neighborhoods causing the original poorer residents to migrate out. We refer to this process as endogenous gentrification. Using a variety of data sets and using Bartik variation across cities to identify city level housing demand shocks, we find strong empirical support for the model's predictions.

Then, recasting the firms in a simple economic model that features consumers explicitly, I show how a merger wave - a contagious urge to merge - can occur and what benefit it may bring to consumers. Together, these two models suggest that there is a tradeoff to consider: While a merger wave may result in higher systemic risk, it may also bring about higher consumer welfare.

The modelling approach stems from the need to meet two key concerns: (i) the presence of cross-sectional dependence among commodity prices; and (ii) the identification of potential structural breaks. To address these concerns, the Hadri and Rao (Oxf Bull Econ Stat 70:245-269, 2008) test is employed. The findings suggest that all commodity prices exhibit a structural break whose location differs across series, and that support for the Prebisch and Singer hypothesis is mixed. Once the breaks are removed from the underlying series, the persistence of commodity price shocks is shorter than that obtained in other studies using alternative methodologies.","[Maria Iregui, Ana] Banco Republ, Unidad Invest, Bogota, Colombia; [Otero, Jesus] Univ Nacl Rosario, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia",Banco de la Republica Colombia,"Otero, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Rosario, Fac Econ, Calle 12C 4-69, Bogota, Colombia.",airegubo@banrep.gov.co; jesus.otero@urosario.edu.co,"Iregui-Bohorquez, Ana Maria/C-5766-2017; Otero, Jesus/G-1038-2011","Iregui-Bohorquez, Ana Maria/0000-0001-7527-8953; Otero, Jesus/0000-0002-2551-0053",,,,,54,7,8,1,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

The paper presents a dynamic model of consumer demand for differentiated durable products that explicitly accounts for consumers' expectations of future product quality and consumers' outflow from the market that arises endogenously from their purchase decisions. The timing of consumers' purchases is formalized as an optimal stopping problem. A solution to that problem defines the hazard rate of product adoptions, while the nested discrete choice model determines the alternative-specific purchase probabilities. Integrating individual decisions over the population distribution generates rich dynamics of aggregate and product-level sales. The empirical part of the paper applies the model to data on the U.S. computer printer market for 19981999. The estimates support the hypothesis of consumers' forward-looking behavior, allowing for better demand forecasts and improved measures of welfare gains from introducing new products.

The redistribution arising from such programs, however, can introduce significant additional costs to government procurement budgets. In this paper, the extent to which small business set-asides increased government procurement costs is examined. The estimates employ data on Japanese public construction projects, where approximately half of the procurement budget is set aside for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Applying a positive relationship between profitability and firm size obtained by the nonparametric estimation of an asymmetric first-price auction model with affiliated private values, a counterfactual analysis is undertaken to demonstrate that approximately 40 percent of SMEs would exit the procurement market if set-asides were removed. Surprisingly, the resulting lack of competition would increase government procurement costs more than it would offset the production cost inefficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper models the impact of such employment guarantee schemes in the context of an agrarian economy characterized by lean season involuntary unemployment as a consequence of tied-labor contracts. Specifically, we examine labor and output market responses to a productive rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS) and determine the optimal compensation to public work employees consistent with the objectives of (i) productive efficiency in agriculture and (ii) welfare maximization of the laborers. Our framework provides a theoretical framework for the evaluation of a number of (sometimes) conflicting observations and empirical results on the impact of an EGS on agricultural wages, employment and output, and underscores the importance of the relative productivity of workers in the EGS program vis-A -vis their counterparts engaged in agricultural production in determining the success of these programs.","[Basu, Arnab K.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Basu, Arnab K.] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany; [Basu, Arnab K.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",William & Mary; University of Bonn; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Basu, AK (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",akbasu@wm.edu,,,,,,,53,19,19,2,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

This conclusion, which contrasts with a recent World Bank scenario suggesting that the decline in labor supply due to demographic trends can be faced with sustained growth in productivity, is based upon a demand-driven model of migration. Moreover, according to the same model, the decline in fertility (and the one child policy that has been partially responsible for it) will end up provoking immigration flows above replacement level. The working age population and the total population will continue to increase, and China will remain the most populous country on the planet. The last part of the paper surveys the policies that China could adopt to reduce its structural need for foreign labor.",,,,mbbruni44@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2013,21.0,2,,,SI,,56,77,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12015.x,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,112YA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316630000004,0
