Research focus on small and medium-sized enterprises stems from the fact that from the point of the total number of entities it is this category of enterprises which dominates in the national economy.

Moreover, the negative link between the bank credit and trade credit proportions was rather weak and accounted for no more than 15% of the total variance observed within these variables. The individual pairwise comparison of annual change in return on sales ratio and annual change in accounts payable over total assets did not reveal any significant relationship between these variables also.

We use a real-structural convergence matrix, made up of indexes, to assess the evolution of economic convergence in 2010 as compared to 2000. Then, we compute an econometric regression in order to study the effect of real convergence on structural convergence. The analysis shows that real convergence has a positive effect on structural convergence and that the impact is even stronger when using labor shares for assessing the structural convergence index. We also report important progress in terms of real and structural catch-up with the Euro area.

Money supply is said to be endogenous if it is determined within the economic system itself. The present paper investigates this theory using a panel dataset of 177 countries from year 1970-2011 utilising dynamic panel data analysis and has found that money supply is endogenous as proposed by Post Keynesian theorists.

J,"Rubin, A",,,,"Rubin, Anita",,,"Hidden, inconsistent, and influential: Images of the future in changing times",FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In a research on the images of the future held by young Finns, the images dealing with personal future and one's own immediate life domain were generally seen as the realization of individual hopes, while the future of the country was seen much gloomier and the future of the world was mainly described as the actualization of all the global dangers and threats the mass media and science fiction have ever brought about. The same dichotomy is also evident in other studies in which the images of the future held by teachers and educators have been studied. Teachers and educators are not aware of the problem of young people's confusing images of the future at all. Instead, it rather seems that they share the confusion. The images of the future are more or less based on the assumption that the course of development in the future will follow the same route it has trailed so far. The future is taken as somehow given and described in rather conventional or popular terms and effects, without any deeper or more profound consideration or analysed anticipation. For example, the future of the school or university where an individual teacher works were described with concepts and choices that are more positive and optimistic than those used in describing the future of the school or university as an institution in a wider sense. When it comes to society itself, and especially to the future of the world, the images became much grimmer and issues and ideas of negative development were mentioned or chosen much more often. The results show that teachers' images are dominated by the belief in the persistence of traditional institutions and conventional, familiar ways of doing things. The challenge for teachers and educators is, how to prevent young people from losing their belief in the future and in their own possibilities to influence it, to take their future in their own hands, even if they also inevitably must see the threats facing this world? How to increase the positive effects of the world becoming smaller, contiguous, and more intimate at the same time when its future threats seem more and more uncontrollable? This means that teachers and educators should first become aware of their own images of the future and the dichotomies and discontinuities they might be composed of. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The dimensions of machine developed were 1,044 mm (width), 679 mm (length), 1,348 mm (height). The important components of machine consisted of the seed hopper, the seed metering device, the seed releasing units, the soil compressing units and the depth controlling units. The metering device was established by plastic sheet. The plastic rod cut into groove along its axis for keeping seeds were inserted into the seed metering device in order to move the seeds from the seed hopper to the flexible tube. The flexible tube brought the seeds into seed releasing units located under the part of seed metering device in order to drop the seeds 1-2 seeds per cell of plug tray. The seed metering device were set 3 units, 1 unit for releasing seeds on 20 cells of plug tray, on the seeder frame. Chain drive mechanism was set to drive the system for releasing seeds on plug tray. Testing the efficiency of releasing seed on plug tray of machine was equal to 79%. For operation time of sowing in plug tray, Comparing between this seeder and human-hand found that the sowing by the seeder was 7.88 times quicker than the sowing by human-hand.","[Sriwongras, P.; Dostal, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Technol & Automobile Transport, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Sriwongras, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Technol & Automobile Transport, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",agrpyp@ku.ac.th; pet.d@seznam.com,"Dostál, Petr/JTV-6004-2023; Dostál, Petr/A-4164-2018",,,,,,6,1,1,0,7,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,867,871,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800153,0

People usually do not want to support project of building stations for renewable energy at their neighborhood. The inhabitant's view of producing energy from renewable source is changing, when citizens may participate in the energy production. My next detection is, that in municipalities, where the power station for RES was built, the cultural and social life is functional. In the surveyed villages a lot of events have taken place. Actually, the building of RES station motivates residents to joint tree planting or takes care about municipal pond. A certain factor for acceptance of RES stations will be also age - young people are less conservative and more open to new technologies.

These factors influence the diversity of resources to which the poor have access and result in specializations in livelihood strategies. We analyzed the relation between forest dependence and livelihood strategies in the Bolivian Amazon, applying the SLF. We tested for the differences across strategies with respect to financial, human, physical, social, and natural livelihood assets. Results show that forest income is highly related to cash income from Brazil nut, while income from agriculture and timber exploitation is associated with higher levels of education. Brazil nuts serve as a safety net and start-up capital for certain livelihood strategies in our study region. Livelihood strategies that are based on the commercialization of multiple products from forests and agriculture and services inside and outside communities depend less on forests. Livelihoods can be supported by investing in sustainable livelihood asset endowments. Our results demonstrate that activities that aim to support community forest management and to enhance household income should explicitly consider a differentiated support for different strategies. This will result in a more effective outcome of development efforts from which the poorest people would benefit most. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using a sample of 724 students from the People's Republic of China, Germany, and the United States and an initial set of sixteen items, we extract a scale that measures the basic attitude toward social health insurance in the three countries. The scale is internally consistent in each of the three countries. A secondary factor labeled government responsibility is marginally consistent for the total sample and for the German sample. German respondents have the most favorable attitude toward social health insurance, followed by China, and then the United States. Chinese respondents have the most favorable attitude toward government responsibility in health insurance.

We performed a cost-benefit analysis of dual dispatch defibrillation by ambulance and fire services in the County of Stockholm, Sweden. Methods and results A cost-benefit analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of dual dispatch defibrillation. The increased survival rates were estimated from a real-world implemented intervention, and the monetary value of a life ((sic) 2.2 million) was applied to this benefit by using results from a recent stated-preference study. The estimated costs include defibrillators (including expendables/maintenance), training, hospitalisation/health care, fire service call-outs, overhead resources and the dispatch centre. The estimated number of additional saved lives was 16 per year, yielding a benefit-cost ratio of 36. The cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was estimated to be (sic) 13,000, and the cost per saved life was (sic) 60,000. Conclusions The intervention of dual dispatch defibrillation by ambulance and fire services in the County of Stockholm had positive economic effects. For the cost-benefit analysis, the return on investment was high and the cost-effectiveness showed levels below the threshold value for economic efficiency used in Sweden.

These ecosystems are under many stresses due to unsustainable management practices, lack of clarity on tenure and access rights, and persistent pressure for land-use change. Climate change is exacerbating the impact of these stresses on both forest ecosystems and forest dependent people. What are the current forest coping strategies of different livelihoods? What is the role of forest ecosystems in increasing the resilience of rural communities? Over a two-year period, an interdisciplinary team of civil society researchers and development practitioners made an attempt to address these questions in a systematic manner through the use of the CRiSTAL tool Community-based Risk Screening Tool for Adaptation and Livelihoods - in different countries. For this publication, case studies conducted in three African countries - Zambia. Mali and Tanzania - are presented. Particular focus is given to the coping strategies used forest, livestock and agriculture based livelihoods. In all cases, forest ecosystems provided key goods and services during extreme events (droughts and floods) and become key assets for reducing vulnerability in the context of climate change However, issues related to unclear land tenure, as well as legislation forbidding forest use, strengthen underlying conflicts over natural resources and therefore increase the high pressure on forest ecosystems and thus the overall vulnerability of poor rural communities. This paper analyzes the corresponding challenges and offers a number of recommendations for decision- and policy-makers, on how to support local adaptation to climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, they have gone widely unnoticed in the literature to date and drawn little attention in World Trade Organization (WTO) fora. Nevertheless, such 'minus commitments' are poisonous. Given the broad definitional scope of the GATS, extending inter alia to commercial presence, they may affect third-country investors, cast doubts on the status of the respective agreements under the GATS and have severe implications for the trading system overall. Without clear cross-references to existing GATS commitments, many RTAs remain insulated and are virtually impossible to multilateralize.

Its main premise sustains the idea that in addition to the number of deaths, the loss of quality of life and the pain suffered by patients and their family members as a result of diseases and accidents, there are other indicators that provide us with a better understanding of their socioeconomic impact. Our analysis provides estimates of the loss of labour productivity in Spain as a result of health problems in 2005. Our main finding suggests an estimated loss amounting to over 37,969 millions euros, of which 9,136 millions euros are due to premature deaths, 18,577 millions to permanent disability and 10,255 millions to temporary disability. The loss in labour productivity due to accidents and health problems was estimated to a figure equivalent to nearly 4.2% of the Gross Domestic Product of Spain in 2005. This study underscores the strong economic impact of non-medical costs of diseases. In addition, it stresses the need for better information systems for collecting data that is relevant to the topic at hand.","Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales Toledo, Toledo 45071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Oliva-Moreno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales Toledo, Cobertizo San Pedro Martir S-N, Toledo 45071, Spain.",juan.olivamoreno@uclm.es,"Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023","Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307;",,,,,42,30,32,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The present study adapted a dynamic optimization framework to analyze optimal land use decisions. Results show that ignoring negative climate change effects on tea production and forest carbon storage values leads to excessive deforestation and lower optimal forest stock levels. The analyses also suggest that optimal forest stock is inversely related with the discount rate and at discount rates higher than 5%, complete deforestation becomes the optimal land use choice. This points to the need to critically reassess discount rates currently applied to approval of projects in Ethiopia, which are generally higher than 5% and which do not distinguish projects with long-term environmental costs and benefits from others. It is therefore also necessary to introduce incentive mechanisms such as rewarding reductions in emissions from deforestation and forest degradation to prevent further clearing of forests.

The data were collected through face-to-face interviews that covered indicators of sports and exercise behaviour; money/time price and perceived benefits of participation; and socio-economic/demographic details. Count, linear and probit regression models were fitted as appropriate. Seventy eight per cent of the sample participated in sports and exercise and spent an average of A 27 pound per month and an average of 20 min travelling per occasion of sports and exercise. The demand for sport and exercise was negatively associated with time (travel or access time) and 'variable' price and positively correlated with 'fixed' price. Demand was price inelastic, except in the case of meeting the UK government's recommended level of participation, which is time price elastic (elasticity = -2.2). The implications of data from a larger nationally representative sample as well as the role of economic incentives in influencing uptake of sports and exercise are discussed.","[Anokye, Nana Kwame; Pokhrel, Subhash; Buxton, Martin; Fox-Rushby, Julia] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University,"Anokye, NK (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",Nana.Anokye@brunel.ac.uk,"Pokhrel, Subhash/AAO-8648-2020","Pokhrel, Subhash/0000-0002-1009-8553; Anokye, Nana/0000-0003-3615-344X; Fox-Rushby, Julia/0000-0003-0748-0871",Department of Health Funding Source: Medline,Department of Health,,,35,14,17,3,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Although the gender gap narrowed significantly among working parents with young children, the gap between mothers and fathers in this group remained much smaller in Quebec than in the United Kingdom by the end of the period. The author attributes this pattern to Quebec's healthier economic environment, more women-friendly social policies, and fathers' significantly shorter hours of work.","Quebec Inst Stat, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Cloutier-Villeneuve, L (通讯作者)，Quebec Inst Stat, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,76,6,6,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

A fixed-dose combination of extended-release niacin (ERN) with laropiprant (LRPT) provides comprehensive lipid management. We adapted a decision-analytic model to evaluate the economic value (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] in terms of costs per life-years gained [LYG]) of ERN/LRPT 2 g over a lifetime in secondary prevention patients in a German setting. Two scenarios were modelled: (1) ERN/LRPT 2 g added to simvastatin 40 mg in patients not at LDL-C goal with simvastatin 40 mg; (2) adding ERN/LRPT 2 g compared with titration to simvastatin 40 mg in patients not at LDL-C goal with simvastatin 20 mg.

The main features of an evolutionary methodology deal with emergence, macrolaws, civil or societal transitions, macrosystem design, and the absorption of extreme events. The following principles apply: (1) The civil system is an open system in which investment capital is the system growth parameter that drives it away from equilibrium, with the formation of spatial structure. (2) The historical circumstances of human settlements provide a path dependency in respect of natural resources, defence, energy, transport, or communications. (3) Emergent properties arise within a complex adaptive system from which a theory of the system can be formulated, and these are not deducible from the features of the transacting entities. (4) Futures research identifies the conditions that will lead to an irreversible civil or societal phase transition to a new stage of development.

While markets for ecosystem services show potential for increasing forestland value, there is concern that the lack of an integrated program will simply add to the complexity of these services without generating significant public benefits. If not designed properly, these fragmented programs can result in the restoration of many small sites that lack ecological integrity and are unlikely to provide the benefits from protecting larger and more contiguous areas. An integrated approach that combines or bundles services and provides financial incentives for forest landowners may be more effective to achieving broad conservation goals, including enhancing fish and wildlife habitat, improving watershed health, sequestering carbon to mitigate climate change, and providing other ecosystem services at an ecologically relevant scale. We outline some of the policy and regulatory frameworks for some of the emerging markets for ecosystem services in the United States, and discuss the role that different regulatory agencies play for each of these services. We then assess the potential benefits for bundling different ecosystem services such as water quality, wetlands, species conservation, and carbon and describe an integrated accounting protocol for combining these services.

Notably, those who feel pulled out of school (i.e., they say they dropped out of school to work or take care of family) do similarly with respect to labor market and criminal outcomes in their early twenties to individuals with similar pre-dropout characteristics who complete high school. It is only those who feel they are more pushed out of school (i.e., they say they drop out for other reasons including expulsion, poor grades, moving, and not liking school) who do substantially worse than otherwise similar high school completers.

We study the experience of the University of Brasilia, which established racial quotas in 2004 reserving 20% of available admissions slots for students who self-identified as black Based on university admissions data and a student survey conducted by the authors, we find evidence that race, socioeconomic status, and gender were considerable barriers to college attendance and achievement. For example, first-difference regressions involving pairs of siblings indicate that black identity and gender had a negative effect on entrance exam scores. Moreover, we compare displaced and displacing applicants and find that racial quotas helped promote equity to some extent. Nevertheless, the scale and scope of redistribution were highly limited, and the vast majority of Brazilians had little chance of attending college, suggesting that more still needs to be done.

Within a sample of nearly 9000 students from the Baccalaureate and Beyond, we find that these measures are correlated with college type, college major, and highest postgraduate degree earned in generally predictable ways. For instance, students claiming it important to be well-off financially are significantly more likely to attend top public universities and major in Business or Engineering while students claiming it important to live near family are significantly less likely to attend top quality private institutions and significantly more likely to major in education.

However, this feature of prostate cells is lost during carcinogenesis and, thus, prostate cells are unable to accumulate zinc(II) ions in high levels. Therefore, we can expect that zinc(II) ions can significantly contribute to the progression of tumour disease and to the ability of prostate cell lines to metastasize. In this study, we aimed our attention on determining the expression of Bcl-2, c-Fos, c-Jun, Ki-67, NF-kappa B and p53 genes in two prostate cell lines, as the 22Rv1 cell line, a model of aggressive partially androgen-sensitive prostate cancer and the PNT1A cell line, a normal prostate cell line model. Moreover, we were interested in the mechanisms through which exposure of these cell lines to zinc(II) ions could influence expression of the above-mentioned genes. We found that zinc(II) ions caused elevated expression of Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, extremely low expression of p53, high expression of Bcl-2 and no changes in the expression of p53. Our experimental data show different effect of zinc(II) ions on expression of the above-mentioned regulatory genes, which may give us more information on their impact on cancer development and progression with possible using for cancer therapy.","[Balvan, J.; Holubova, M.; Gumulec, J.; Sztalmachova, M.; Raudenska, M.; Masarik, M.] Masaryk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol Physiol, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Sztalmachova, M.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.; Masarik, M.] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Gumulec, J.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.; Masarik, M.] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Mendel University in Brno; Brno University of Technology; Masaryk University Brno,"Balvan, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol Physiol, Kamenice 5, Brno 62500, Czech Republic.",141792@mail.muni.cz,"Kratochvilova, Monika/I-3190-2012; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Balvan, Jan/I-2945-2012; Masarik, Michal/D-9920-2012; Gumulec, Jaromir/D-7638-2012; Sochor, Jiri/E-1135-2012; Svobodová, Markéta/F-4144-2012; Krizkova, Sona/E-9617-2012; Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Raudenska, Martina/F-9187-2012","Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Masarik, Michal/0000-0003-1172-7195; Gumulec, Jaromir/0000-0002-9658-3444; Sochor, Jiri/0000-0001-7823-1544; Raudenska, Martina/0000-0001-8258-6671",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1158,1165,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200135,0

Benchmarking is the process of comparing one's business processes and performance metrics to industry best practices. Dimensions typically measured are quality, time, and cost, but nost of the cases, a large number of financial and non-finalcial indicators are involved. In a new appropch, the present paper suggests the application of Cross-Impact Analysis to identify the most influencing factor of influence on various area of performance. The general CIA is used to identify, for deeper understanding, the correlation among a set of variables by revealing the characteristic role of a factor / variable in relation to all other variables within a system.

For this purpose we have resorted to panel OLS and GMM fixed and random effects estimations for first difference series, the results obtained being in compliance with the economic theory. Also panel cointegration and causality techniques have been used, considering the presence of heterogeneity in the estimated parameters and dynamics across countries. The overall results show that foreign direct investments exert a direct and positive influence on the target countries, both in the short-run and in the long-run, thus improving their economic growth and reducing the technological gap with the leading country. The Granger causality revealed a bidirectional relationship: the causality goes not only from FDI to economic growth but also in the reverse direction, suggesting that an increase in FDI will cause an increasing FDI-GDP chain reaction effect. Therefore, we insist on the importance of taking any necessary measures fit for stimulating foreign direct investments in the analyzed countries so as to ground their overall well-being.","[Hudea (Caraman), Oana Simona; Stancu, Stelian] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Hudea, OS (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",caraman_simmy2005@yahoo.com; stelian_stancu@yahoo.com,"STANCU, Stelian/HRB-5488-2023",,European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/107/1.5/S/77213],European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was co-financed from the European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/107/1.5/S/77213 Ph.D. for a Career in Interdisciplinary Economic Research at European Standards (DOCCENT).",,38,1,1,1,32,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The corresponding effects on the fisherman's profits and the profits of oil company that supplies the raw fuel to the fishery are also examined. The findings are, first, that the subsidy policy benefits the oil company, but its effects on the fisherman are ambiguous. Second, an increase in detection effort leads to less illegal activity in relation to fuel trading and more legal fishing resulting in less fish biomass. The detection policy hurts the oil company, the fisherman who engages in fuel trading, and resource conservation. Finally, an increase in fish price leads to a similar result as an increase in detection effort, but the effects on the fisherman's profits are reversed.

Aim of this study was the optimization and of quantitative reduction GSSG to GSH for HPLC-ED determination using tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphin (TCEP) and ethylendiamintetracetic acid (EDTA). The efficiency of reduction of GSSG was analyzed using high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED). For GSH and GSSG determination we used gradient elution with methanol on reversed-phase column and coulometric detection. Limit of detection for GSH and GSSG was determined as 30 nM and 200 nM respectively. For qualitative reduction of GSSG to GSH we optimized the concentration of reducing agent (1, 2, 4, 6 mM), time of reaction (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 minutes) and pH range of tested buffers (Britton-Robinson, Borate buffer, Phosphate buffer and Acetate buffer). The influence of addition of EDTA was also tested. We determined the optimal condition of the reducing reaction as 2 mM TCEP in Borate buffer (pH 9) and reaction time 15 minutes. No influence of EDTA addition on the reducing reaction was observed. The usage of the method was estimated for concentration range 60 nM - 200 mu M of GSSG.","[Kominkova, M.; Zitka, O.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Havel, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Biol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Zitka, O.; Rodrigo, Merlos M.

Drawing on historical sociology, it suggests why paid or unpaid work by children has been difficult to discuss, define, and measure in contemporary industrialized countries, in part by comparing debates on child workers and economically inactive housewives. The paper then asks whether mothers' increasing workforce participation has led to a rise in the number of children whose labor is domestically useful. The answer, focusing on Australian research, considers ethnographies of teenagers who resist housework, accounts of those who make substantial contributions to their families, surveys of children's employment, and data from national time-use surveys. The paper concludes that the interdependence of all family members should be considered in one analytical frame.","RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Miller, P (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,"Miller, Pavla/0000-0001-7539-7450",,,,,86,10,10,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

As opposed to earlier studies, this one is European-wide, taking international market integration into account. Average own-price flexibilities for fresh captured fish are found to be -1.1. This implies that price flexibilities previously estimated for single European countries underestimate price changes at the European level caused by quantity changes. Results indicate that changing quantities can increase revenues from individual species with large own-price flexibilities, provided that stocks supply a significant share of the total EU supply That is found to be the case for sole and anchovies, but not for cod and hake. Thus, for sole the short-run decline in fishermen's incomes following quota and quantity reductions are partly compensated by rising prices.

The objective of this study was to explore ways to help the floriculture industry improve sales through increased industry awareness of consumers' expectations of floral gifts. A questionnaire and focus group discussion were used to investigate consumers' expectations. We found that Generation XY participants felt floral gifts were the least practical.

Previous studies explore CAATTs acceptance from individual auditor perceptions and did not consider issues from both organization and individual perspective at the same time. Therefore, this paper contributes to extend better understanding on factors that audit firms would need to consider in predicting CAATTs adoption. It applies a combination of Technology-Organization-Environment framework and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology variables, and adds new variables of technology risk, technology fit, and top management commitment. The framework provides assistance to audit firms and other organizations' internal audit departments that need to evaluate CAATTs acceptance. Future empirical studies may be done to provide evidence and empirically validate this I-TOE framework.","[Rosli, Khairina] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Sch Accountancy, Sintok 06010, Kedah, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,,khairina@uum.edu.my; paul.yeow@monash.edu; siew.eu-gene@monash.edu,"Siew, Eu-Gene/JBR-7830-2023","Yeow, Paul/0000-0003-2277-8916",,,,,21,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2515,2523,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801126,0

We gave them 20 individuals of one aphid species and we found that ladybirds fed most number of A. pisum. In two-choice test, we combined pairs of studied species: A. f cirsiiacanthoidis x A. pisum, A. pisum x A. sambuci, A. sambuci x A. f cirsiiacanthoidis. We put 10 aphids of each of the two species combined into a plastic Petri dish and then we introduced one ladybird adult or larva. We made 20 replicates with adults. We found that there was statistical difference only in the combination A. sambuci vs. A. f cirsiiacanthoidis, where males consumed more individuals of the toxic aphid A. sambuci. For this combination, we then made 20 replicates with larvae who preyed in contrast with males more of the suitable food A. f cirsiiacanthoidis than toxic A. sambuci. We also studied the influence of contrasting background on food choice in adults. We used both tests and all combinations. We found that females did not prefer any aphid species, except for the black A. f cirsiiacanthoidis being consumed more often than the green A. pisum on black background. Because they consumed much more A. pisum in no-choice experiment on both backgrounds, the difference in choice experiment is very strong and its polarity surprising.","[Senkerikova, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Zool Fisheries Hydrobiol & Apiculture, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Nedved, O.] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Nedved, O.] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Senkeriková, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Zool Fisheries Hydrobiol & Apiculture, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xsenkeri@node.mendelu.cz; nedved@prf.jcu.cz,"Nedvěd, Oldřich/H-7816-2014","Nedvěd, Oldřich/0000-0001-9932-3456",,,,,11,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1008,1015,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200117,0

Stress reaction of plants was evaluated by Relative Water Content (RWC) and Osmotic Pressure (OP) in leaves and by expression level of two Cor/Lea genes (Wdhn13 and Wrab17). The obtained results clearly indicate a relation between the expressions of both genes and tissue water content; the reduction in RWC was strongly connected with changes in genes activity. Particularly the Wdhn13 gene expression in Merino variety increased even though the tissue hydration level was only slightly reduced, which can be related to the good adaptiveness of this genotype to stress.","[Truhlarova, E.; Smutna, P.; Holkova, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Truhlárová, E (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",eva.truhlarova@mendelu.cz,"Smutná, Pavlína/J-6397-2018; Holková, Ludmila/J-9839-2018",,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,901,909,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200103,0

In order to solve the housing problems of these migrant workers, the government intends to include these migrant workers into urban housing security system. The large number of migrant workers and limited financial resources have become the maincontradiction of solving the housing problem. The urgent task facing Chinese government to study and solve is how to allocate the limited resources to those who are most in need and how to develop indemnificatory housing system ecnomically. With time stretches on, the amount and income situation of migrant workers will change. Meanwhile, the national housing structure and the state revenue condition will change, too. How to find out a scientific allocation pattern of indemnificatory housing for migrant workers in such a complicated and dynamic change is the key of this paper.

Moreover, it is now apparent that human activities are perturbing the climate system at the global scale leading to disturbances to complex ecological processes. In this paper, we present a cooperative differential game of climate change control. Climate change is incorporated as structural changes in the pollution dynamics and the payoff functions. The policy instruments of the game include taxes, abatement efforts and production technologies choices. Under cooperation, nations will make use of these instruments to maximize their joint payoff and distribute the payoff according to an agreed upon optimality principle. To ensure that the cooperative solution is dynamically consistent, this optimality principle has to be maintained throughout the period of cooperation. An analytically tractable payment distribution mechanism leading to the realization of the agreed upon imputation is formulated. This analysis widens the application of cooperative differential game theory to environmental problems with climate change.

Descriptive statistics reveal large variations across countries in per-capita consumption and price levels both overall and at the brand level. We explore potential sources for the cross-country consumption differences by estimating several multivariate regression models. Our results show that large parts of the cross-country variation are explained by time-invariant country-specific factors (e.g., disease prevalence, demographics, health care system). We also find that differences in income [gross domestic product (GDP) per capita] and health spending (share of GDP) explain the cross-country variation in consumption, while relative price differences seem to have limited impact.","[Brekke, Kurt Richard] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Dalen, Dag Morten] Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, N-00484 Oslo, Norway; [Holmas, Tor Helge] UNI Rokkan Ctr, N-5015 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); BI Norwegian Business School,"Brekke, KR (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",kurt.brekke@nhh.no; dag.m.dalen@bi.no; tor.holmas@uni.no,,,,,,,21,4,4,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We use data from a survey carried out in Hungary in 2010 among a representative sample of 1,037 respondents. The contingent valuation method is used to elicit the willingness to pay official charges for health care services covered by the social health insurance if certain quality attributes (regarding the health care facility, access to the services and health care personnel) are guaranteed. A bivariate probit model is applied to examine the relationship between willingness to pay and past informal payments. We find that 66 % of the respondents are willing to pay formal fees for specialist examinations and 56 % are willing to pay for planned hospitalizations if these services are provided with certain quality and access attributes. The act of making past informal payments for health care services is positively associated with the willingness to pay formal charges. The probability that a respondent is willing to pay official charges for health care services is 22 % points higher for specialist examinations and 45 % points higher for hospitalization if the respondent paid informally during the last 12 months. The introduction of formal fees should be accompanied by adequate service provision to assure acceptance of the fees. Furthermore, our results suggest that the problem of informal patient payments may remain even after the implementation of user fees.","[Baji, Petra; Gulacsi, Laszlo] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment Res Ctr, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Baji, Petra; Gulacsi, Laszlo] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Ctr Publ Affairs Studies Fdn, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Baji, Petra; Pavlova, Milena; Groot, Wim] Maastricht Univ, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Med Ctr,CAPHRI, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Farkas, Miklos] Cent European Univ, Dept Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Groot, Wim] Maastricht Univ, Topinst Evidence Based Educ Res TIER, Maastricht, Netherlands",Corvinus University Budapest; Corvinus University Budapest; Maastricht University; Central European University; Maastricht University,"Baji, P (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment Res Ctr, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",petra.baji@uni-corvinus.hu,"Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023; Pavlova, Milena/B-4778-2011; Baji, Petra/JHV-1617-2023","Pavlova, Milena/0000-0002-6082-8446; Baji, Petra/0000-0003-2899-8557; Farkas, Miklos/0000-0002-1707-866X; Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746",,,,,47,12,12,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The potentially productive interactions among these instruments in the emerging forestry regime create prospects for engendering learning, stimulating cross-fertilization, and enhancing accountability. In this article, we analyze the EU's Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative, interacting with public legal timber regulations and private certification schemes, as the core of an emerging transnational experimentalist regime. An experimentalist regime of this type may provide a promising approach to addressing contentious transnational environmental issues like forest governance where there is no global hegemon to impose a single set of rules. However, experience with FLEGT implementation suggests that there are also a number of outstanding challenges to constructing an effective timber legality assurance regime, which if unresolved could undermine its promise. The argument proceeds in three steps, based on an exhaustive analysis of recent developments. First, we outline the architecture and promise of the emerging timber legality assurance regime. Then, we review key accomplishments to date. Finally, we examine the ongoing challenges facing this innovative regime as it moves forward, and consider how they might be overcome through the adoption of a more consistent experimentalist approach.

This study challenges the bargaining model by arguing that theories of marital quality, derived from women's voices and subaltern knowledge, should be integral to feminist economic theories of marriage and intrahousehold gender relations. Findings from a longitudinal (1999-2009) ethnographic study of microcredit loanee families in rural Bangladesh reveal that Muslim women believe high marital quality or togetherness leads to peace in the household. This local model of marriage is central to the moral economy of social life. The study identifies eight local measures of marital quality that define what low-income women think a good Muslim husband should be like. The study concludes that the peace-in-the-household model emphasizes the transformation of masculinity as a program strategy that should be implemented in microcredit households in various parts of the world.","Miami Univ, Harvard Univ, South Asia Inst, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",Harvard University; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Ahmed, FE (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Harvard Univ, South Asia Inst, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",ahmedfe@miamioh.edu,,,,,,,46,12,17,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Using a new theoretical framework, this study translates patriarchy as a concept to macro- and micro-level explanations of employment. It formulates and tests hypotheses for societal norms and institutions and household composition, including how the latter's effects are context dependent. The study analyzes data from surveys (1997-2008) for twenty-eight countries, 383 districts, and 250,410 women and finds that men's public dominance over women decreases women's employment. Presence of - in particular non-foster - children and elderly people at home withholds women from labor market entrance. However, presence of other women in the household stimulates labor market entrance. Absence of a partner, male household head, or other adult men pushes women into the labor market, and thus, for example, male breadwinners' absence has a weaker negative effect in contexts of male public dominance.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Spierings, N (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",n.spierings@maw.ru.nl,"Spierings, Niels/H-9812-2016","Spierings, Niels/0000-0002-3116-3262",,,,,58,35,40,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Decades of government neglect and poor infrastructural development has tilted the balance of the region's rural economy away from smallholder cash crop cultivation to ASM. While this study does not suggest that the region is experiencing complete de-agrarianisation, high gold prices, the absence of policies and regulations, ubiquitous land availability and the absence of large-scale mine production has fuelled the growth of ASM activities in the area. These are thought to be self-sustaining and not considered to be poverty-driven. Significant finds and high incomes from the region's activities have fuelled a gold bonanza but the big question is: how long will this last? Key issues such as the ability of deposits to support an increasing rate of extraction, environmental degradation and potential future conflicts with large-scale mining operations will need to be carefully managed to ensure that the ASM economy is sustained.

J,"Chi, MJ",,,,"Chi, Manjiao",,,'Exhaustible Natural Resource' in WTO Law: GATT Article XX (g) Disputes and Their Implications,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRADE,"Trade in natural resources is an important part of international trade and can be governed by World Trade Organization (WTO). Article XX (g) of the GATT 1994 is the only WTO rule that expressly employs the term 'exhaustible natural resources', but it is silent as to the meaning and scope of this term. There are in total nine General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and WTO disputes in which Article XX (g) has been invoked. In various disputes, the term 'exhaustible natural resources' has been interpreted within the framework of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaty. An exhaustive study of Article XX (g) disputes shows that there are several different scenarios in which this term has been interpreted, and that the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) panels and the Appellate Body (AB) often held flexible and friendly attitudes when interpreting the term. Although WTO case law suggests that this term has been interpreted to cover a wide range of subjects, no consensus on the meaning and scope of this term in WTO law has been reached. Consequently, the threshold for invoking Article XX (g) exception remains high. This also helps explain how the DSB panels and the AB tried to balance the two seemingly conflicting policy aims of Article XX (g), i.e., ensuring free trade and protecting the environment. Given the world's increasing reliance on natural resources, persisting need for free trade and mounting concerns over environmental protection, Article XX (g) is highly likely to be invoked in more WTO disputes in the future. It remains to be seen how the term 'exhaustible natural resources' will be interpreted and what role Article XX (g) can play in international trade governance.","[Chi, Manjiao] Xiamen Univ, Sch Law, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Chi, Manjiao] Univ Siegen, Res Ctr Shaping Future Fokos, D-57068 Siegen, Germany",Xiamen University; Universitat Siegen,"Chi, MJ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Law, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",chimanjiao@xmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,49,10,10,0,17,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We first discuss the contribution made by China's manufacturing sector to capital accumulation, manifested internally by domestic oversaving and externally by China's trade surplus. China's output under various conditions is then measured, and the role of FDI in different manufacturing industries, differentiated according to technological type, is examined. Deconstructing the trade balance and highlighting the role of processing, the analysis provides details on the role of FDI in China's merchandise trade. The analysis also shows that China's distorted research and development expenditure in various manufacturing industries is related to lack of innovation capacity in the high-technology industries dominated by FDI.","[Gao, Yuning; Hu, Angang] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Gao, YN (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",gao_yuning@tsinghau.edu.cn; anganghu@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

A major question for successful REDD + implementation, and forest sector reform more broadly, is how changes in formal rights are understood and internalized by resource users. This paper explores the determinants of knowledge of formal rights, and whether accurate knowledge of rights influences forest clearing and forest product harvesting behavior in Uganda. We find limited awareness of rules surrounding clearing forest, and mixed levels of awareness regarding rights to harvest specific forest products. Harvesting behavior is variably correlated with awareness of rights depending on the product and capacity of district forest officials. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using decomposition analysis, the study finds that aggregate profit rate declined, but the profit share did not. Male variables - such as earnings, output, employment, and working hours - tended to have more weight than female ones in explaining aggregate outcomes. Structural change also played a major role, as the economy specialized in sectors with falling real wages and wage shares, especially the financial sector and construction. Further falls in the wage share and widening wage gaps may not guarantee a rise in profitability. This result entails that neo-mercantilist approaches to solve the crisis might only prepare the next crisis, while a coordinated expansion of demand could be more successful. Moreover, gender issues should not be neglected in terms of favoring women's employment and entrepreneurship.","[Tescari, Alice; Vaona, Andrea] Univ Verona, Dept Econ Sci, I-37129 Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Tescari, A (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Econ Sci, Via Artigliere 19, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",alice.t@email.it; andrea.vaona@univr.it,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

IF represents an approach for bringing the future into holistic innovation processes, in which users and other stakeholders are systematically involved to detect future opportunities and risks. This could allow for a better integration of inclusive, long-term visions in decision-making and strategic thinking in the context of innovation. To be effective and enable mutual learning, the IF process calls for future-oriented, continuous interaction with current/anticipated users and a better integration of methods and approaches from different fields, including Foresight, user/market research and human-centred product design. This paper discusses two empirical studies that closely involved users in the exploration, imagination and creation of future TV experiences. Study 1 aimed to identify users' specific (future) needs and possible Lead User ideas concerning digital TV (DTV) in Flanders through an online survey (N = 11.802 digital TV users). 13 unique ideas representing important unfulfilled needs were identified and evaluated. Study 2, which focused on 'Future TV experiences', consisted of a multi-method research approach in three phases, resulting in six persona profiles, that help to provide an understanding of users' daily practices and futures aspirations. It is argued that a better introduction of future anticipation in inclusive innovation processes could enhance the input of users in innovation and contribute to the detection of potential user/societal needs and possible unexpected forms of use.

Increasingly, sophisticated regression techniques require the availability of appropriate data sets, often longitudinal and typically collected at a national level. This raises challenges for researchers seeking to investigate issues requiring data that are not typically included in regular large-scale data. It also raises questions of the adequacy of relying mainly or solely on regression analysis for investigating key issues of economic theory and policy. One way of addressing these issues is to employ a mixed-methods research framework to investigate important research questions. In this article, we provide an example of applying a mixed-methods design to investigate the employment decisions of mature age women working in the aged care sector. We outline the use of a coherent and robust framework to allow the integrated collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data. Drawing on particular examples from our analysis, we show how a mixed-methods approach facilitates richer insights, more finely grained understandings of causal relationships and identification of emergent issues. We conclude that mixed-methods research has the capacity to provide surprises and generate new insights through detailed exploratory data analysis.","[Jefferson, Therese] Curtin Univ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Austen, Siobhan; Ong, Rachel] Curtin Univ, Ctr Res Appl Econ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Austen, Siobhan; Ong, Rachel] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Sharp, Rhonda; Adams, Valerie] Univ S Australia, Hawke Inst, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Lewin, Gill] Curtin Univ, Ctr Res Ageing, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University; Curtin University; Curtin University; University of South Australia; Curtin University,"Jefferson, T (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Curtin Grad Sch Business, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",Therese.Jefferson@gsb.curtin.edu.au,"Ong ViforJ, Rachel/C-1097-2008; Sharp, Rhonda/AAL-3633-2020","Ong ViforJ, Rachel/0000-0001-8557-8802; Jefferson, Therese/0000-0001-7393-7046; austen, siobhan/0000-0002-2367-0889",,,,,26,14,14,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Gum arabic is one of these products by 'Acacia senegal' trees that are found in Kenya. It is a source of additional income for rural households. The study explores household decisions to collect gum arabic in the forest using the two stage Heckman selection model. The data for the analysis come from the 213 randomly sampled collectors from the north-eastern and western regions of Kenya. The findings show that livestock ownership, possession of skills, insecurity and price obtained from the previous season impact on decision making to collect gum arabic. Furthermore, household's age, experience in collecting gum arabic and topography increase the quantities collected while gender negatively impacts amounts of collection. The research concludes by emphasizing that collection of the non-timber forest products including gum arabic would be attractive if the returns from collection justify the risk and cost to go to the forest.

Economists no longer operate as passive observers of economic phenomena. Instead, they participate actively in the research process by collecting data from field experiments to investigate the economics of everyday life. This change can be shown to students by presenting them with evidence from field experiments. Field experiments related to factor markets, behavioral economics, and discrimination are presented to explain how this approach works across different economic content. The three questions that are highlighted are the following: (1) Why do women get paid less than men in labor markets? (2) How can we use behavioral economics to motivate teachers?

We show that the agriculture-informal sector interaction is distinctly different from the agriculture-formal sector relationship. Although agriculture supports the formal sector only from the supply-side, it helps the informal sector by providing both demand-and supply-side inducements. Next, contrary to the general perception of formal-informal complementarities, we rather propose a fundamental conflict. This conflict arises in the presence of the food supply-constraint or the generic resource-constraint. Subsequently, with these theoretical perspectives, we show that policies that are beneficial for the formal sector, in fact, constrict the informal economy.","Visva Bharati Univ, Agroecon Res Ctr, Santini Ketan 731235, W Bengal, India",Visva Bharati University,"Chakrabarti, S (通讯作者)，Visva Bharati Univ, Agroecon Res Ctr, Santini Ketan 731235, W Bengal, India.",saumya.chakrabarti@visva-bharati.ac.in,,,,,,,38,3,3,1,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

By using diverse procedures and work techniques, the internal audit function offers a comprehensive analysis and a complete overview of on-going activities an image achieved by examining work methods used within the company, its organizational structure and its processes. Therefore, internal audit is considered to bring added value to the business and offers assurance that the internal control system is operational. As a result, internal audit also conveys transparency when linked with the company's corporate governance compliance. This paper sheds light on the practices of internal audit by observing work methods, the positioning and organizational structure and the processes regarding the internal audit function, when applied in 40 listed companies in the FTSE 100 index, London Stock Exchange. This study plans to answer key questions like Is the internal audit function efficient in Great Britain's most important companies? but also How does internal audit help achieve proposed objectives?. By firstly approaching the notion of internal audit from a theoretical point of view, we've outlined its conceptual frame, as well as facts regarding its purpose, scope and organizational matters. Later, and most significantly, we investigated internal audit in practice, by trying to present our findings in a logic and coherent sequence. Hence, we've analysed internal audit practices at 40 listed companies on the London Stock Exchange Financial Times 100 index (FTSE 100). Our results are synthesized by using a predefined frame containing key aspects regarding internal audit. This study does not plan to represent a thorough investigation of aspects on the topic of internal audit practices because it is based solely on data collected from the 40 companies. Thus, our results are limited, and if we had picked different companies, our results might have been slightly altered. Either way, our conclusions confirm the fact that most companies have implemented and use a worthy internal audit function. (C) 2014 The Authors.

However, owing to worries over the use of agricultural feedstocks for biofuel, forest biomass as a feedstock has been investigated for some time and appears to be a promising alternative. Current corn-based ethanol facilities range in size from a few million to over 380 million liters (100 million gallons) per year with associated construction costs near $117 million for the latter sized capacity. On the other hand, the economics for forest biomass to biofuel facilities are different and there appears to be a lack of understanding about the cost optimal size for the processing facility and the associated investment. With this in mind, a mathematical model is developed to describe the total annual costs of a forest biomass to biofuel facility using the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as the case study area. The model includes terms associated with forest resource harvesting and collection, transportation, storage, and facility construction and operation costs. The model is used to establish a relationship for the optimal size of a production facility, that is, the facility size that provides the minimum unit cost. The effect of various factors on the optimal facility size and the associated biofuel unit cost are examined, especially transportation cost rate and equivalent yield. The results indicate these two factors do impact optimal size and unit cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A traditional approach to build CSD has been concentrated on the strengthen management material goods in order to increase the added value for the shareholders. Based on the limited focus of the traditional approach towards CSD and the pressure of the global business practices, enterprises are taking defensive position and reactive approach for solving business problems. Such approach is not sustainable and as a result, enterprises in general and family business in particular must shift their paradigm from materialistic management to new post-materialistic value management. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to achieve a deeper understanding on how the EoC can contribute to sustainable development (SD) of family businesses in Croatia. The main objective of this study is to investigate new values of post-materialistic management (i.e., culture of giving, profit distribution, ecology and the responsibility for future generations) and their influence on SD of family businesses in Croatia. In the context of new values of post-materialistic management, the profit and growth are not the final objectives of the business activity but elements of the wider circle of the corporate values. Common good of all stakeholders is put in the forefront. This qualitative study is based on a comparative analysis of the research results from the review of relevant literature and empirical research conducted by Zivkovic (2012) on the EoC. The research results indicate that there is an alternative to business models of market economy. Principles of EoC, the business model that puts humans and their spiritual and material needs and development in the forefront, contribute to sustainable economic, social and environmental development. Practical application of the culture of giving develops relationships that promote the development and distribution of profits to internal and external stakeholders, thus contributing to SD of family businesses.","[Kopecki, Dragan; Katavic, Ivica] VERN Univ Appl Sci, Zagreb, Croatia; [Saracevic, Nerma] Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Kopecki, D (通讯作者)，VERN Univ Appl Sci, Zagreb, Croatia.",drkopecki@gmail.com; ivica.katavic@vern.hr; nermasa@bih.net.ba,"Katavic, Ivica/HGU-3249-2022",,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,561,573,,,,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000055,0

Since understocked channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) do not reach market size until the second year of production, static one-year economic models and analyses may not be adequate. A previous mixed-integer profit-maximizing model was extended to include a second year to evaluate the effects of varying feeding frequencies on farm management decisions, particularly on adjustments in the second year. Production options considered included frequency of feeding (every day, every other day, and every third day), multiple-batch production from four different fingerling sizes, and single-batch production from three different stocker sizes. Every day feeding was identified as the profit-maximizing feeding strategy on farms using multiple-batch production but unfavorable market prices, high feed prices, and operating capital constraints reduced feeding frequencies. Every day feeding remained the optimal strategy for farms in single-batch foodfish production. Market and capital constraints reduced the scale of farms operating in single-batch foodfish production, but did not change the optimal every day feeding strategy. Farms maximized profits by transitioning from multiple batch to single batch over the two-year period.","[Kumar, Ganesh; Engle, Carole R.] Univ Arkansas, Aquaculture Fisheries Ctr, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Kumar, G (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Aquaculture Fisheries Ctr, Mail Slot 4912,1200 N Univ Dr, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA.",gkumar@uaex.edu,"Karunakaran, Ganesh kumar/I-7881-2019","Karunakaran, Ganesh kumar/0000-0003-4765-5306",USDA-CSREES [ARKO5027],USDA-CSREES(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),Funding for this project was provided in part by USDA-CSREES Project No. ARKO5027.,,28,15,17,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 CHESTNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

For evaluation of strategies and solution of optimization problem we use differences between proposed hedging strategy with active buying put options and basic hedging strategy with put option. Results show that optimal proposed strategy can bring additional positive expected return in strong bull market, but price for this additive return is smaller return of proposed hedging strategy in bear market in comparison with basic strategy.

Afterwards, those indicators are framed through CAMELS approach. The research period was divided into pre-crisis period - before 2007 and post-crisis period - after 2007 and up to the present. The 2007 year was used as a crossroad point because starting with this year it was visible the downturn of the economic and financial evolution in Romania's system and also at global level.

Entrepreneurs are generally positively focused on the development of their entrepreneurial careers but their knowledge and acquiring of practical skills needed for starting and running a business is mediocre, while initiatives aimed towards gaining required competencies are insufficient.

Then we introduce a reference return which is used to measure the value of gains and losses into the model to allow the reference return controlling the characteristics of investors' risk preference to change. The top ten market value stock composite indexes in Global Stock Exchange are adopted to make the empirical analysis. Results show that investors become risk averse when they gain and risk seeking when they lose, which effectively explains the inconsistent risk-return relationship. And with the different distribution of the error item in the D-GARCH-M model, there are also differences between the extent of risk aversion in gains and that of risk-seeking in losses. Considering the influence of the magnitude of gains/losses on the risk preference, we find the degree of investors' risk aversion and risk-seeking is in direct proportion to the value of gains and losses respectively. What's more, for the same size of gains and losses, the extent of risk seeking with losses is greater than that of risk aversion with gains.","[Wen, Fenghua; He, Zhifang] Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Dai, Zhifeng] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaoguang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China","Central South University; Changsha University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS","Wen, FH (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",wenfenghua54321@sina.com; hezfang@126.com; zhifengdai823@163.com; xgyan@iss.ac.cn,"Wen, Fenghua/ABD-5745-2021","Dai, Zhifeng/0000-0002-7912-1280","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71171024, 71371195, 71221061]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71171024, No.71371195, No. 71221061).",,23,83,89,0,44,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

These significant household health events could result in a combination of financial and time constraints on the household, limiting the educational opportunities available to survey respondents. We find that household hospitalizations lead to reductions in the likelihood of completing high school, attending college and completing a bachelor's degree. These negative effects are disproportionately experienced by male respondents. Respondents with higher pre-hospitalization ability appear to be insulated from these health events. Birth-order and the gender composition of siblings also appear to play a role. We find that the oldest children in the household bear the burden of a hospitalization, substantially lowering the educational attainment of these respondents, while insulating their younger siblings. Similarly, the presence of a brother appears to insulate respondents from the negative impacts of household hospitalizations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation support delivered by mobile phone text messaging. The lifetime incremental costs and benefits of adding text-based support to current practice are estimated from a UK NHS perspective using a Markov model. The cost-effectiveness was measured in terms of cost per quitter, cost per life year gained and cost per QALY gained. As in previous studies, smokers are assumed to face a higher risk of experiencing the following five diseases: lung cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary heart disease (i.e. the main fatal or disabling, but by no means the only, adverse effects of prolonged smoking). The treatment costs and health state values associated with these diseases were identified from the literature. The analysis was based on the age and gender distribution observed in the txt2stop trial. Effectiveness and cost parameters were varied in deterministic sensitivity analyses, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also performed. The cost of text-based support per 1,000 enrolled smokers is A 16,120 pound, which, given an estimated 58 additional quitters at 6 months, equates to A 278 pound per quitter. However, when the future NHS costs saved (as a result of reduced smoking) are included, text-based support would be cost saving. It is estimated that 18 LYs are gained per 1,000 smokers (0.3 LYs per quitter) receiving text-based support, and 29 QALYs are gained (0.5 QALYs per quitter).

Empirical evidence from China-bound FDI by Taiwan's listed companies between 2000 and 2010 is summarized as follows. First, under the internalization of FDI, performance tends to rise with intensity of FDI activity. Second, profitability appears higher as FDI targets the export market outside China. Third, synergetic performance is created mainly through improved efficiency in resource management rather than increased sales, which indicates effective cost control is crucial for successful FDI in emerging markets such as China.","[Shiau, Huey-Ling; Huang, Chen-Jui] Tunghai Univ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chen, Fong-Chyi] Roundmax Trading Co, Taipei, Taiwan",Tunghai University,"Huang, CJ (通讯作者)，Tunghai Univ, Taichung, Taiwan.",shl@thu.edu.tw; cjhuang@thu.edu.tw; roundmax@ms39.hinet.net,,,,,,,39,5,6,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

It analyses the micro-dynamics of the Forest Rights Act using three dimensions: individual tenure rights, citizenship, and conflict to discuss the contested nature of household-level tenure rights to forest land. The arguments are based on data collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews from six Bhil tribal villages in Banswara district, Rajasthan. The findings indicate that the forest tenure reform promoted the individualisation of forest right claims - thereby increasing Bhil tribal inter-household-level conflicts - and that households' forest land tenure claims relate primarily to the formal recognition of their citizenship rights. The paper suggests that one of the priorities for a way forward is to work towards harmonising the government's own contradictory policies, and avoid competition between line departments.

This new regime follows several years of consistently falling prices. At the same time price volatility has increased substantially. This article models the volatility of salmon prices and establishes empirically that volatility is on an increasing trend. Further empirical analysis suggests that the volatility trend is largely accounted for by the common trend in other food prices relevant to salmon, including meats, cereals, oils and fish meal observed in recent years. Other potentially contributing factors to volatility are also discussed. This includes the role of the 2005 maximum total allowable biomass restriction, the 2006 introduction of the Fish Pool ASA futures market for salmon, the Chilean Salmon crisis and the increasing use of bilateral contracts.","Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Oglend, A (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",atle.oglend@uis.no,,,,,,,51,69,70,0,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

We examine the effect of an Individual Development Account (IDA) program on (1) educational enrollment, (2) degree completion, and (3) increased education level. The IDA program, which ran from 1998 to 2003 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, provided low-income households with financial education and matching funds for qualified savings withdrawals, including a 1:1 match for educational uses. We find a significant impact on education enrollment and positive (but nonsignificant) impacts on degree completion and increase in level of education. We also examine the interaction between gender and treatment assignment, finding that the IDA had a strong positive effect on increased educational attainment for men but not for women.

To describe this shift, different authors use a variety of terms, such as the transmodemity paradigm (Ghisi); the transmodern philosophy of political liberation (Dussel); the Hegelian dialectical triad of thesis, antithesis and synthesis (Magda); the reflective/living-systems paradigm (Elgin); partnership model of caring economics (Eisler); relational global consciousness and biosphere politics (Rifkin); love ethics (hooks); and the circularity paradigm of interdependence (Steinem). Reviewing a broad range of perspectives, I will argue that the reason we do not hear more about the emerging socio-cultural, economic, political and philosophical shift described by these authors is because it is not centralised and coordinated under a single unifying name. Hence, I will offer the concept of transmodernity as an umbrella term that ropes together many concepts and tenets to communicate the overall idea of an emerging paradigm shift and the next step in human history.

The features of a complexity theory of cities have been developed at multiple levels with scientific analogies such as ecology, biology and physics. The following principles apply: (1) complexity science unifies a wide variety of urban phenomena including emergence, technological evolution, civil phase transitions, macrolaws, and resilience to system failures and extreme events. (2). World urbanisation raises the number of levels in the urban hierarchy, with an increasing number of megacities with over 10 m inhabitants. (3) Urban development involves the institutional coordination of technological development with engineered transformations. (4) Civil and societal transitions arise with increasing per capita investment, such that some social norms and planning standards have consistent scaling factors across a range of city sizes for countries at similar stages of development. (5) The trajectory of the urban system depends upon the allometric pattern of growth for cities, and human settlements in 2150 will occupy less than 10% of the world's land area.

Here we study the French implementation of the EU AES program. We estimate additional and windfall effects of five AESs for a representative sample of individual farmers using difference-in-difference (DID) matching. We derive the statistical assumptions underlying DID-matching from a structural household model and we argue that the economics of the program make it likely that these assumptions hold in our data. We test the implications of the identifying assumptions, provide a lower bound using triple-difference matching, test for crossover effects and insert our estimates of both additionality and windfall effects into a cost-benefit framework. We find that the AESs promoting crop diversity have inserted one new crop into the rotation but on a small part of the cropped area. We also find that the AES subsidizing the planting of cover crops has increased cover crops by 10 ha on the average recipient farm at the expense of almost 7 ha of windfall effect. This AES does not appear to be cost effective. In contrast, we find that the AES subsidizing grass buffer strips could be socially efficient despite large windfall effects. We finally estimate that the AES subsidizing conversion to organic farming has low windfall effects and high additionality. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, material prices are often dramatically unstable making it difficult to obtain accurate, short-term predictions using long historical observations. Facing the challenge, forecasting with new limited data is considered more effective, efficient, and of considerable interest. Grey theory is one useful approach that can effectively handle uncertain problems under small data sets, and the AGM(1,1) is a forecasting model based on this theory that can obtain better forecasting outcomes. However, this technique is initially suggested for use with very short-term forecasting. To improve this drawback for a longer forecasting, this study aims to extend the applicability of the AGM(1,1) by combining the AGM(1,1) with the rolling framework technique into a useful model referred to, here, as AGMRF. The forecasting performance of AGMRF is confirmed in this study using aluminum price data collected from the London Metal Exchange (LME). The results are compared with the other four methods, GM(1,1), AGM(1,1), LR, and BPN, and show that the proposed procedure can effectively deal with the problem when the sample size is limited.","[Chang, Che-Jung] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Chungli 32023, Taoyuan County, Taiwan; [Li, Der-Chiang; Chen, Chien-Chih] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Dai, Wen-Li] Tainan Univ Technol, Tainan, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University; National Cheng Kung University,"Chang, CJ (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Chungli 32023, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.",r3795102@nckualumni.org.tw; th0045@mail.tut.edu.tw,"li, der-chiang/K-6214-2013; Chang, Che-Jung/B-8285-2013","li, der-chiang/0000-0002-0887-1308; Chen, Chien-Chih/0000-0002-6041-3689; Chang, Che-Jung/0000-0002-1145-0934",,,,,23,6,6,0,17,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In one quarter of cases, the difference in output emissions is more than enough to compensate for the emissions cost of transport. Finally, we examine how likely patterns of global trade growth will affect modal use and emissions.

Such fluctuations are frequently ascribed to exogenous Basel II procyclical effects on credit flow into the economy and, consequently, Basel III output-based point-in-time Credit/GDP countercyclical buffering. We have tested the opposite null hypotheses that such variation is correlated to actual default rates, and that such correlation is explained by fluctuations of credit supply around a steady state. We have found that, between June 2008 - and June 2012 (n=17), linear regression of credit growth rates on default rates revealed a negative correlation and that credit supply fluctuated steadily around the default rate with a Steady State Parameter SSP=.00245 with chi(2)=.3747. We conclude that credit risk management in Italy has been effective in parameterising the credit supply variation to default rates within the Basel II operating framework. Basel III prospective countercyclical point-in-time output buffers based on filtered Credit/GDP ratios and dynamic provisioning proposals should take into account this underlying steady state statistics pattern.","[Olgiati, Stefano; Danovi, Alessandro] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Econ & Quantitat Methods, Bergamo, Italy",University of Bergamo,,stefano.olgiati@unibg.it; alessandro.danovi@unibg.it,"Olgiati, Stefano/X-9278-2019; Danovi, Alessandro/AAD-4442-2021",,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-1-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,65,74,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336025300006,0

On the other side, consumption patterns of livestock products have changed considerably as a result of new dietary preferences and new health lifestyle trends. Within this context and large proportion of CAP expenditures for livestock products, especially for milk, it is worth to investigate long run and short run relationship among production and demand of such products. For this purpose was chosen most frequently used livestock food products: milk and hen eggs. Both of these products are controversial in terms of health lifestyle, and also closely connected with food safety issues which could significantly affect their consumption in recent period. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the production and consumption pattern of cow milk and hen eggs, and to identify long and short run relationship between key variables. As a key factors affecting production of selected livestock products were used size and level of growth of the EU market. Market size was measured using data about population, and income (GDP per capita) was used as measure of EU market growth. For the purpose of this analysis were used panel data for 27 EU countries, which covered period for the years 1994 to 2010 (yearly data). For both examined commodities were estimated models for normal products determination. From the methodological point of view were used cointegration techniques and error correction model in combination with panel data analysis. This paper follows article by Batzios-Lawler-Ling-Katsouli-Galanopoulos, who investigated milk and eggs production patterns for the period 1970 to 1994. While authors used aggregated data for the EU, in this paper were used longitudal data for 27 EU countries over the period 1994-2010. At the end can be concluded, that consumption and production patterns changed over the last two decades considerably.","[Palkovic, Jozef; Sojkova, Zlata] Fac Econ & Management SUA Nitra, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Nitra 94901, Slovakia",,,jozef.palkovic@uniag.sk; zlata.sojkova@uniag.sk,"Palkovič, Jozef/IUO-3489-2023",,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,399,407,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600037,0

Notwithstanding this improvement in the fiscal outlook, the author suggests that India should pursue a policy of fiscal consolidation in the years ahead, both because the ratio of public debt to the gross domestic product is still high compared to other emerging market countries and because weak fiscal solvency implies potential adverse consequences on the management of public debt.","Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Econ & Metodi Quantitativi, Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa,"Tronzano, M (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Econ & Metodi Quantitativi, Genoa, Italy.",m.tronzano@mclink.it,"TRONZANO, MARCO/AAD-9382-2021",,,,,,44,7,7,0,19,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

However, in order to use these ordinal methods to produce health state values for use in cost-effectiveness analysis using cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) analysis, these values must be anchored on the full health-dead scale. The paper reports on two feasibility studies that use two approaches to anchor health state utility values derived from discrete choice data on the full health-dead scale: normalising using (1) the TTO value of the worst state and (2) the coefficient on the 'dead' dummy variable. Health state utility values obtained using rank and discrete choice data are compared to more commonly used TTO utility values for two condition-specific preference-based measures; asthma and overactive bladder.

While there is mixed evidence on the effects of these immersion policies on the ELL students, research examining potential peer effects on their non-ELL classmates is non-existent. This paper begins to fill in this gap by using a nationally representative longitudinal sample of children in early elementary grades. Results indicate that having an ELL classmate during kindergarten and first grade is associated with lower test score gains in reading but not necessarily in math for non-ELL students whose primary language is English, controlling for unobserved fixed school characteristics as well as individual characteristics. The negative peer effects on reading test score gain are sensitive to the frequency of within classroom ability grouping usage, gender, and household income level of non-ELL children.

The authors add to the literature by analyzing students' decisions to take their first introductory economics course, an intermediate theory course, and ultimately major in economics, using the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development. Results indicate that a smaller percentage of women take economics at all levels-introductory courses, theory courses, and majoring in economics. Even after controlling for aptitude, demographic characteristics, prior interest, course performance, environment, and course timing, persistent gender differences in the likelihood of partaking in economic education beyond the introductory course decision endure.","[Emerson, Tisha L.

We propose a model in which fully rational agents exploit all the available information to update their beliefs using Bayes' rule, eventually learning their true type. We show that when the learning process does not converge quickly to the true ability level, small differences in initial confidence can result in diverging patterns of human capital accumulation between otherwise identical individuals. If differences in self-confidence are correlated with socio-economic background (as a large body of empirical literature suggests), self-confidence can be a channel through which education and earning inequalities perpetuate across generations. Our theory suggests that cognitive tests should take place as early as possible, in order to avoid that systematic differences in self-confidence among equally talented people lead to the emergence of gaps in the accumulation of human capital.

The aim of this study was to quantify the burden of active CHB in terms of mortality and morbidity, the eligibility of antiviral treatment and to assess various treatment scenarios and possible salvage combinations for cost-effectiveness. A population cohort from a large data base of chronic hepatitis B patients was constructed and stratified according to 10-year age groups, the prevalence of HBsAg, HBV DNA level, ALT level, HBeAg status and the presence of cirrhosis. An age-specific Markov model for disease progression and cost-effectiveness analysis was constructed and calibrated for the specific population setting. Of about 3.2 million estimated HBsAg carriers, 25 % are eligible for treatment. If the active cohort remains untreated, 31 % will die due to liver related complications. Within a 20-year period, 11 % will have developed decompensated cirrhosis, 12 % liver cancer and 6 % will need liver transplantation. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for the no treatment scenario ranged from 9.3 to 14.0. For scenarios with antiviral treatment, QALYs ranged from 9.9 to 14.5 for lamivudine, 13.0-17.5 for salvage therapy, and 16.6-19.0 for the third generation drugs entecavir and tenofovir. In a country with considerable amount of active CHB patients, monotherapy with a highly potent third generation drug has the most health-gain, and is cost-effective in both HBeAg-positive and negative in all stages of liver disease.","[Toy, Mehlika; Richardus, Jan Hendrik] Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, Dept Publ Hlth, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Toy, Mehlika; Schalm, Solko] LiverDoc, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Onder, Fatih Oguz; Akdogan, Meral] Yuksek Ihtisas Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Ankara, Turkey; [Idilman, Ramazan; Kabacam, Gokhan; Yurdaydin, Cihan] Ankara Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Sch Med, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Bozdayi, Mithat] Inst Hepatol, Sch Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Kuloglu, Zarife; Kansu, Aydan] Hacettepe Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Ankara, Turkey; [Schalm, Solko] Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Turkey Specialized Higher Education & Research Hospital; Ankara University; Hacettepe University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Toy, M (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, Dept Publ Hlth, Dr Molewaterpl 50, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",m.toy@erasmusmc.nl,"Kuloglu, Zarife/AAG-8210-2020; Richardus, Jan Hendrik/AAE-1278-2021; Kabacam, Gokhan/ABI-4746-2020; BOZDAYI, ABDURRAHMAN MITHAT/E-9290-2019; Onder, Fatih Oguz/X-6135-2018","Richardus, Jan Hendrik/0000-0003-0564-6313; Kabacam, Gokhan/0000-0002-2099-9697; Toy, Mehlika/0000-0001-7848-4816; KANSU, AYDAN/0000-0002-3133-9846; BOZDAYI, ABDURRAHMAN MITHAT/0000-0002-2785-1804; Kuloglu, Zarife/0000-0001-9442-7790; Onder, Fatih Oguz/0000-0003-2845-201X",,,,,57,27,28,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

J,"Shah, N",,,,"Shah, Nikhil",,,Welfare and technology in the network society-Concerns for the future of welfare,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GOVERNMENT,"The last decade of explosive innovation thanks to the growth of information and communication technologies (ICT) has left the public sector, and particularly the provision of welfare services, largely unchanged. Where socialising, commerce, information finding, entertainment and travel have all undergone profound structural transformations, the workings of government have not seen a similar shift. To be sure, the pace of decision-making has been sped up, as it has elsewhere, by Blackberries, and a small number of services are delivered online. But these services are still based around their offline equivalents, and usually aim simply at cutting the costs associated with their delivery by moving online. While this will continue to be a key motivation for the digitisation of government, other more fundamental developments are set to take place which will herald new online-only services, and which will encourage radical decentralisation of power. The first part of this paper will look at the private sector's experience over the past decade for clues as to why the public sector has moved relatively slowly, and likely directions of development in coming years. We will also here present evidence from our own forecasts of the likely narrowing of the digital divide. The next two sections will then deal with future developments in more detail, firstly looking at ICT's future role in welfare service delivery, and secondly at the ways in which it might be used for greater citizen engagement, and the reshaping of power structures that will result from this. The final section will examine some conflicts that arise from this reorientation away from the centre. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, to investigate the impact of several extrapolation methods on the results. A Markov model was developed to reflect the clinical events in this specific patient population, including target vessel revascularization, myocardial infarction, and death. To extrapolate clinical data beyond 1 year, a linear, an exponential, and a Weibull survival curves were estimated. Patient characteristics and transition probabilities were derived from a high-risk subgroup of the ESPRIT trial; patient-level utility data came from a published Dutch study. Costs were calculated from a hospital and from a third-party payer perspective. For both perspectives, the additional treatment with eptifibatide is the considered dominant alternative. The incremental net benefit of its use exceeds a,not sign10,000 for both perspectives. Results proved stable in probabilistic sensitivity analysis as well as under the different extrapolation scenarios. Eptifibatide is likely to be dominant strategy with 77.7 and 96.7% of the simulations leading to QALYs gained and generating cost savings from both the hospital and the third-party payer perspective. Eptifibatide offsets its additional treatment costs by avoiding costly repeat procedures and leads to positive QALY gains by preventing cardiovascular events lending themselves to transient or permanent lower quality of life. The method used to extrapolate the short-term risks did not impact on results, mainly due to similar clinical risk profiles between the two treatment groups in the long term.","[Dewilde, Sarah] Serv Hlth Econ, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Brueggenjuergen, Bernd] Alpha Care GmbH, Celle, Germany; [Brueggenjuergen, Bernd; Willich, Stefan N.] Charite, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Nienaber, Christoph] Kardiol Univ Rostock, Klin & Poliklin Innere Med, Rostock, Germany; [Senges, Jochen] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Herzinfarktforsch Ludwigshafen, Ludwigshafen, Germany; [Welte, Robert] GlaxoSmithKline GmbH & Co KG, Munich, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; University of Rostock; Institute Heart Attack Research; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; GlaxoSmithKline,"Dewilde, S (通讯作者)，Serv Hlth Econ, Rue Eburons 55, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",sd@she-consuling.be,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The demand for an assessment of the current forest management, which generally involves criteria and indicators (C&I) at all levels, from local to national has increased in the last decade. Therefore a case study has been done, applying a combination of a top-down and bottom-up approach with multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to identify a set of C&I with different groups of stakeholders in selected sites at the forestry management unit level (leshoz). Six workshops and a series of discussion meetings were conducted to perform a sound analysis of the preferences of four different stakeholder groups. A final set of C&I that consists of seven criteria and 45 indicators has been identified for evaluating sustainable forest management (SFM) in the walnut-fruit forests. Forest health and vitality was found to be the most important criterion, while the maintenance of forest biodiversity was found to be the least prioritized among other criteria. Furthermore, four different management strategies were developed by foresters, research groups, ecologists and forest administrators in order to overcome the present challenges in forest management. By utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), one particular management strategy (MS II) was identified by all stakeholder groups as being the overall best alternative strategy. It was shown that the consideration of non-timber forest products and other options for income generation can improve the livelihood of the people, increase the productivity of resources as well as conserving the gene pool for maintaining forest biodiversity. The findings of this study highlight the importance of a C&I evaluation and its further policy implications. Moreover, it is discussed how the involvement of local stakeholders in the decision making process and their participation in forest management could be stimulated by the C&I development process in the walnut forests of Kyrgyzstan.

Twenty-five forest owners in southern Finland were interviewed using a semi-structured qualitative attitude approach. Three discursive strategies were found: (1) submitting to others' power, (2) questioning others' power and (3) taking power. As discursive resources for these strategies, forest owners used two identities, forestry identity and conservation identity, as well as expressions of justice, in order to create tension or alignment between policy actors. The first two strategies emphasized non-cooperation and non-communication between stakeholders and were dominant in the interviews. As a contrast, the third strategy emphasized cooperation and communication; however, it was used rarely. The results of the study can help policy stakeholders to become aware of the discursive construction of policy processes and the presence of power in all social interaction between policy stakeholders.

It focuses on standard-like measures such as technical barriers and sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. The approach overcomes the shortcomings of the mainstream approach based on the analysis of foregone trade caused by trade costs. The latter ignores market imperfections, and welfare is found to increases when NTMs are reduced and trade expands. We explain how to account for external effects and market failures in trade-focused welfare analysis, leading to a more balanced overall assessment of measures despite a potential reduction of trade flows. The relationships between trade, welfare, and NTMs are complex, and generalizations are best avoided. Very often, the optimum NTM is not the absence of regulation. An application to shrimp trade illustrates the feasibility of the proposed approach. The illustration shows that the reinforcement of a food safety standard can be socially preferable to the status-quo situation, both domestically and internationally.","[Beghin, John] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Beghin, John; Marette, Stephan] AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR Econ Publ, Paris, France; [Disdier, Anne-Celia] Paris Sch Econ, INRA UMR PSE, Paris, France; [Van Tongeren, Frank] OECD, Trade & Agr Directorate, Paris, France",Iowa State University; AgroParisTech; INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; Paris School of Economics; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Beghin, J (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",frank.vantongeren@oecd.org,"Beghin, John/G-7803-2018; Beghin, John/AAN-2854-2020","Beghin, John/0000-0002-8403-3277; Beghin, John/0000-0002-8403-3277",,,,,45,44,46,2,46,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2012,11.0,3,,,,,356,375,,10.1017/S1474745612000201,0.0,,,20,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,984TR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307215500002,0

Using the concept of ocognitive variety', we focus on the increasing role of the independent sector as a source of creativity in the delivery of programming for the BBC. The paper shows that the intended benefit of introducing new competencies has been thwarted by, at the micro-level, a high level of cognitive proximity between in-house and external producers and, at the meso-level, a conflict in values between the BBC and the independent sector, with many of the larger producers responding to a commercial imperative that encourages creativity in profitable genres, but leaves gaps in other areas of provision. Tracing these meso-level institutional effects has implications for micro-level analyses of innovation, notably communities of practice theory.","[Turner, Simon] Kings Coll London, NIHR Kings Patient Safety & Serv Qual Res Ctr, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Lourenco, Ana] Catholic Univ Portugal, Sch Econ & Management, Porto, Portugal",University of London; King's College London; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Turner, S (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, NIHR Kings Patient Safety & Serv Qual Res Ctr, London WC2R 2LS, England.",simon.j.turner@kcl.ac.uk,"Turner, Simon/HTL-6456-2023; Lourenco, Ana/U-9739-2017","Turner, Simon/0000-0002-1801-8351; Lourenco, Ana/0000-0003-1629-4595",,,,,56,9,10,1,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The vast majority of these bans are partial bans given that smoking is still permitted in certain places. This article investigates the role of partial smoking bans in coping with externalities caused by the secondhand smoking problem. Although it is widely known that Pigouvian taxation is superior to a perfect ban, this result does not necessarily carry over to a partial ban because taxes cannot (easily) be differentiated according to location. We show that under an easy and intuitive condition, (1) enacting a partial smoking ban alone always improves social welfare (a) in an unregulated society and (b) even in a regulated society if externalities can be eliminated, and (2) it is ensured that a combination of Pigouvian tax and a partial smoking ban leads to a higher social optimum than implementing corrective Pigouvian taxation alone.","[Hofmann, Annette; Nell, Martin] Univ Hamburg, Inst Risk & Insurance, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Nell, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Risk & Insurance, Hamburg, Germany.",hofmann@econ.uni-hamburg.de; Martin.Nell@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,45,2,3,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The authors measure wage discrimination against disabled persons after controlling for unobserved disability-related productivity differences. Using data for 11 European countries from the European Community Household Panel (19952001), they estimate wage equations for persons with disabilities hampering them in daily activities, for those not hampered, and for non-disabled people. Most countries showed no relevant wage differential against disabled workers not so hampered, compared with non-disabled workers. Where it existed, it related mainly to low productivity characteristics, not wage discrimination. However, compared with non-disabled workers, disabled workers hampered in daily activities suffered from low productivity characteristics and wage discrimination.","[Malo, Miguel A.] Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Pagan, Ricardo] Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",University of Salamanca; Universidad de Malaga,"Malo, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.",malo@usal.es; rpr@uma.es,"Pagan, Ricardo/AAF-4906-2020; Malo, Miguel Ángel/B-5160-2017","Malo, Miguel Ángel/0000-0002-1057-8397; Pagan Rodriguez, Ricardo Braulio/0000-0002-7391-5127",,,,,18,24,27,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

They are of particular sociological interest because they claim to explain phenomena hitherto seen as sociologys terrain, and some exponents see economics as capturing that terrain. Field experiments in work relations are taken as the focus because these relations throw particular light on the operation of social factors in experimental settings. The experiments have two linked weaknesses: they see these social factors as largely fixed attributes of individuals rather than as collective phenomena emerging through interaction; and they have an ontology which is limited in its ability to recognize multiple causal powers and causal conditions. These can be overcome through a sociological view of labour relations as a contested terrain combined with a realist ontology. This view offers guides to further experiments and forms the basis of a well-constructed bridge.","Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Edwards, P (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",p.k.edwards@bham.ac.uk,"Edwards, Paul/JMC-7544-2023",,,,,,86,6,6,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

As a form of foresight raw material, weak signals can be thought of as gross, unstructured, fragmented, incomplete and inadvertent environmental data that may be refined into valuable information regarding context and further be articulated into strategically actionable knowledge. As advanced indicators that precede significant discrete one-off events and/or novel developments in the rate and direction of trends, their analysis has the potential to facilitate the real-time alignment between organisational decision-making and changing external circumstances. These predictors of future change pose fundamental problems of identification and interpretation and represent a challenge to established mental models. Thus, the practical significance of weak signals is that they can be transformed into meaningful insight for policy action. Such a value, however, does not materialise automatically. Realising this potential requires a degree of tolerance and fluidity of the collective cognitive frameworks by which weak signals can be apprehended, assessed and acted upon. This paper aims at covering the scope of perceptions and actions typically involved in the tracing and tracking of this shaping process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This article provides an analytical assessment of such policies. We construct a general equilibrium, open economy model that captures the rationale typically invoked to justify government intervention in this setting: to alleviate the environmental impact of energy consumption and to decrease US energy dependence on foreign sources. The model is used to study both the positive and normative implications of alternative policy instruments, including the subsidies and mandates specified by the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. From a positive perspective, we find that biofuels mandates are equivalent to a combination of fuel taxes and biofuels subsidies that are revenue neutral. From a welfare perspective, we show that biofuels mandates dominate biofuels subsidies, and that combining fuel taxes with mandates would be welfare enhancing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These same tools of thought and action are no less critical to the advance of education than to medicine, agriculture, psychology, or transportation. There has been impressive growth in the use of experimental methods in education over the past decade. As a result, much more is known today about what works and what does not. Future progress will be enhanced by research that better explicates process: linking trials to administrative data; serving the interest of local and state officials in examining the impact of their policies and practices; better preservice training for education practitioners in the logic and value of rigorous research; and more generous federal funding for the research enterprise.","Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution,"Whitehurst, GJ (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, 1775 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",gwhitehurst@brookings.edu,,,,,,,14,13,13,0,3,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Using a complex dynamic forest optimization model, we analyse impacts on economy and biodiversity of forest management restrictions implemented to protect biodiversity. A reference scenario is compared to two preservation regimes based on 1) the current Norwegian forest certification system and 2) an expert judgement designed to put strong emphasis on biodiversity protection in boreal forests. Economic impacts are expressed as net present value and harvesting level, while impacts on forest structure are expressed by a vector of variables including old forest proportions, growing stock, number of retention trees, size of buffer zones and amount of dead wood. A rather detailed description of forest structure and biodiversity measures represents the main improvements compared to previous analyses. Different restrictions result in 10-45% decrease in economic value of the forest compared to no restrictions.

Information from a third survey of anglers in Colorado and California is integrated to predict the short-term shocks that would occur to various industries if anglers at privately stocked fisheries were to discontinue fishing (simulating a hypothetical collapse of the industry). Accounting for both the backward and forward linkages of the private, recreation-based aquaculture industry's production, model results indicate that for every dollar of fish stocking, $36 dollars of recreational angler-related expenditures are supported, and that the total economic contribution of this industry in the Western United States is roughly $2 billion annually.

Information systems governance is a component of corporate governance which aims to direct and control the organisation in order to achieve its mission. Public sector organisations are often criticised for not being as efficient or effective as private sector organisations. By introducing an information systems governance framework public sector organisations can maximise the return on investment and ensure that their technology enabled operations are efficient and effectively aligned with organisational strategy. Specific issues relevant to information systems governance within organisations include responsibility for decision making, strategy alignment, acquisition and development of technology resources, performance evaluation, conformance to legislative and organisational requirements, and human behaviour. Public sector organisations may improve their approach to the direction and control of information systems by adopting a principled approach to information systems governance. The Australian/New Zealand standard for 'Corporate Governance of Information Technology' (AS/NZS ISO/IEC 38500:2010) provides both private and public sector organisations with a principled framework for effective information systems governance. This paper focuses on this framework and discusses issues and challenges posed to information systems governance in public sector organisations.","[Haider, Abrar] Univ S Australia, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia",University of South Australia,,abrar.haider@unisa.edu.au,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,11,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2681,2690,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801142,0

Sustainable production practices that reduce or eliminate the use of plastic are very important in the floriculture industry due to increased concerns about plastic waste created by the industry, as well as increased oil and transportation costs. Using Net Present Value (NPV), financial feasibility and internal rate of return analysis, we determined that purchasing an Elleguard machine and converting to paper Ellepots instead of conventional plastic pots would be a profitable activity for this operation. We also compared the profitability of substrates, in terms of added value, and found that using the current substrate was the most profitable option.

For a specific kinematics, not all control variables may be presented implicitly in the corresponding optimality conditions and some additional local conditions are to be invoked to design strategies for these controls. We apply the general technics to evaluate a chance for the pursuer P to approach the real target that uses decoys by a kill radius r. Assumed that P cannot classify the real and false targets. Therefore, P tries to come close to the furthest evader, and thereby to guarantee the capture of all targets including the real one. We setup two-person zero-sum differential games of degree with perfect information of the pursuing, P, and several identical evading, E-1,E-..., E-N, agents. The P's goal is to approach the furthest of,E-1,...,E-N as closely as possible. Euclidean distances to the furthest evader at the current state or their smooth approximations are used as evaluation functions. For an agent with simple motion, the method allows to specify the strategy for heading angle completely. For an agent that drives a Dubins or Reeds-Shepp car, first we define his targeted trajectory as one that corresponds to the game where all agents has simple motions and apply the locally optimal strategies for heading angles. Then, to design. strategies for angular and ordinary velocities, local conditions under which the resulting trajectories approximate the targeted ones are invoked. Two numerical examples of the pursuit simulation when one or two decoys launched at the initial instant are given.","[Shevchenko, Igor] Pacific Fisheries Res Ctr, 4 Shevchenko Alley, Vladivostok 690950, Russia; [Shevchenko, Igor] Far East Fed Univ, Vladivostok 690950, Russia",Research lnstitute of Fisheries & Oceanography; Far Eastern Federal University,"Shevchenko, I (通讯作者)，Pacific Fisheries Res Ctr, 4 Shevchenko Alley, Vladivostok 690950, Russia.",igor@tinro.ru,,,,,,,19,2,3,0,2,ST PETERSBURG UNIV GRAD SCH MANAGEMENT,ST PETERSBURG,"VOLKHOVSKY PER, 3, ST PETERSBURG, 199004, RUSSIA",2310-2608,,978-5-9924-0075-5,CONTRIB GAME THEOR,,,2012,5.0,,,,,,293,303,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BH0QJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395958000025,0

The development of rural finance, especially the development of rural credit cooperatives, during the period of the Republic of China, would be analyzed from the view of institutional economics. The institutional alienation of rural credit cooperatives took place during the period of the Republic of China, and then made rural credit cooperatives in a dilemma. Firstly, the goal was to make the voluntary cooperation of farmers, but the result was completely opposite to the original goal. Secondly, the goal was to help farmers, but the result was that farmers got little benefit. Government paradox played an important role in the institutional change of rural credit cooperatives. The real reason why rural credit cooperatives were in low efficiency state is the change from the induced institution to the mandatory institution of rural credit cooperatives during the period of the Republic of China.

Utilizing a dataset built from federal, state, and institutional information, the 2011-2012 non-resident tuition prices of 1780 institutions across the contiguous U.S. were modeled. Four different neighboring specifications were used to measure the influence of the 1st, 5th, 10th, and 20th closest institutions. The findings support that localized competition and influence exists. Institutions use variations in their tuition prices to compete locally and remain a marketable option for non-resident students. Heterogeneous neighboring structures affect tuition setting above and beyond spatial dependence. Institutions' tuition price-setting benefit the most by competing against doctoral/research institutions. Fixed-effects and HLM techniques were incapable of handling spatial dependence.

The narratives and practices of Green Growth have already been rejected by many stakeholders as a reformulation of business as usual discourse. However, this article argues that this critique is grounded in a false conflation of distinct interpretations of the concept. In place of homogenising all associated narratives, we argue for an aspirational Critical Green Growth perspective, socially inclusive and conducive to structural transformation, incipiently identified in Asian national policies, particularly Korea. Drawing on this background, and other development insights, we conduct a 'backasting' exercise to identify trajectories leading to this imagined future of Green Growth. We address a key gap in the literature, the lack of dialogue between Green Growth and Developmental State studies. We then argue for the importance of the Green Growth State (GGS) in introducing fundamental change in this critical window of opportunity. Elements of this overarching concept would include broad characteristics of: a flexible and diverse policy mix; value-driven, multi-stakeholder, multi-level governance; public trust and collaboration; and appropriate measurements of progress discouraging commodification of nature.

Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) between the EU and producing countries have emerged as a primary tool for achieving these goals. VPAs combine legality licensing as a market-based approach to stem illegal harvesting and trade with multi-stakeholder processes that seek to address underlying problems of forest governance, including unclear or contradictory forest related laws and weak community rights. We explore whether the EU FLEGT pathway from legality to sustainability is being laid down through VPAs by drawing on case studies of Ghana and Indonesia These countries are among the first to agree VPAs and are currently working towards the issuance of FLEGT licenses for timber product exports to the EU. The paper uses a critical socio-legal approach that focuses not only on the negotiation of VPA text but also on the implications of that text for how VPA policies will be interpreted, enacted and contested in their implementation. Our analysis indicates that both countries are adopting a uniform approach driven by the technical verification requirements needed to license timber for export. This overemphasis on timber licensing fails to address the leading role of the agricultural sector in driving forest loss, constrains civil society participation and creates disproportionate market barriers for local producers. We conclude that a more sustainable approach requires balancing trade-based licensing of large industry with other governance models more appropriate for small-scale operators and domestic markets.

Forests historically covered over 50% of the countries' land area, and have been of major importance for both local livelihoods, the national economy and 'ecosystem services' such as biodiversity and catchment hydrology. The export timber trade has however played a decisive role in determining forest sector policy and indeed has exerted a significant influence on overall national politics since the colonial era began and continuing to the present day. Under the post-independence military dictatorship the timber trade involved ever more unsustainable plunder, particularly from the 1970s, rapidly degrading forests. But now reform of Myanmar's timber trade is on the national political agenda, reform which will be crucial for the Nation's transition towards an equitable and sustainable development trajectory. New legislative measures within consuming countries, including the EU, to challenge illegally sourced timber and wood product supplies have begun to exert a catalytic influence on Myanmar's forest policies, and converging with domestic civil society pressures have led in 2013 to the initiation of a formal 'Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade' (or FLEGT) bilateral process between the European Union and the Government of Myanmar. This paper presents an analysis of the nature of Myanmar's current timber trade and of the challenges and opportunities for reform, particularly in relation to the emerging FLEGT process. We argue that there are eight key aspects of Myanmar's timber trade overdue for democratic reform, which the FLEGT process puts into sharp relief: 1) resolution of ethnic conflicts primarily in upland forested areas, 2) reform of forest tenures; 3) a review of overall forest sector policies and the appropriate place of timber production; 4) reform of military era state timber institutions, 5) a return-to silviculturally based sustainable forest management; 6) restructuring of the timber industry away from 'crony' domination; 7) measures to combat illegal logging and assure the rule of law; and 8) citizen participation in policy development and implementation. This 'shopping list' of democratic reforms implies a major and undoubtedly difficult process ahead, and success is far from certain. From 2013 promising initial progress has already begun on several of these areas. However, although the Government of Myanmar may give the international audience the impression that it is rapidly democratising, on the ground only limited substantive changes are yet experienced in rural areas, and resistance to reform persists amongst the military and their commercial partners. A spectrum of possible outcomes for forest sector reform may be foreseen, from mere token improvements on the dictatorship-era 'business as usual' to a thorough realisation of democratic aspirations. The outcome will be determined by the balance of power between civil society, public representatives, timber merchants particularly the powerful so-called 'crony' and proxy military business interests, and the intermediating powers of Government (including a significant rent-seeking 'shadow state'), the EU, and the international markets that drive the demand for Burmese timber. The extent to which the FLEGT process can reinforce the wider democratisation process may be a decisive factor. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Springate-Baginski, Oliver; Thein, Aun.

This approach pays special attention to intersectionality, historicity, and structural constraints by focusing on the diversity of the experiences of women and men by religion, location, citizenship, class, age, ethnicity, race, marital status, and other factors. It recognizes the complex relationships between the economic, political, cultural, and religious spheres and the role of local and transnational histories, economies, and politics in shaping people's lives.

Our approach recognizes the data limitations and selection problems inherent in higher education, and highlights the challenges these issues pose for education policy. Combining information from different administrative sources in the state of Texas, we follow the universe of Texas college applicants from the time of application (pre-enrollment) through public college and into the labor market. In specifications that do not control for selection, we find large, significant differences across colleges in terms of persistence, graduation, and earnings; however, these differences decrease substantially when we control for selection. In light of the growing interest in using value-added measures in higher education for both funding and incentivizing purposes, our methodology offers unique evidence and lessons for policy makers.

I find that greater use of TIF is associated with reduced education expenditures. I also find little evidence to support the commonly held proposition that school spending increases when TIF districts expire. Finally, the negative price effect of TIF on education spending is increasingly larger for school districts in lower wealth or income groups compared with their counterparts in higher wealth or income groups. The negative, though small, effect of TIF on education spending, coupled with no gain from the often-claimed long-run benefits of TIF, justifies policy measures to protect school districts from TIF.","[Phuong Nguyen-Hoang] Univ Iowa, Publ Policy Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Phuong Nguyen-Hoang] Univ Iowa, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa; University of Iowa,"Phuong, NH (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Publ Policy Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",phuong-nguyen@uiowa.edu,"Nguyen-Hoang, Phuong/E-1960-2011","Nguyen-Hoang, Phuong/0000-0001-8960-7199",,,,,45,7,8,1,11,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

A geographic discontinuity in the policy's implementation and the presence of common pre-treatment trends between hardship and non-hardship schools provide sources of identifying variation. We find that the hardship allowance increased the share of qualified (certified) teachers by 10 percentage points. The policy also reduced the pupil-qualified teacher ratio by 27, or 61% of the mean, in recipient schools close to the distance threshold. Further analysis suggests that these gains were not merely the result of teachers switching from non-hardship to hardship schools.

Strikingly, Ogawa and Wildasin (2009) find that in a model with heterogenous jurisdictions, interjurisdictional capital flows, and interjurisdictional environmental damage spillovers, decentralized planning outcomes are equivalent to that under a centralized planner. We first show the critical importance of two key assumptions (no retirement of capital, fixed environmental damages per unit of capital) in obtaining this result. Second, we consider a more general model allowing for capital retirement and abatement activities and show that the outcome of a decentralized market generally differs from the solution of a centralized planner's social welfare-maximizing problem.

Outgrower schemes are partnership contracts that encourage smallholders/farmers to consider reforestation in addition to their agricultural crops. The company provides inputs and seedlings for planting in exchange for the exclusive right of timber purchase at harvest time. The cash flows of tree growers and forest company are evaluated using the Net Present Value and Average Production Cost for the project, with and without the outgrower scheme. The management regimes are evaluated by Linear Programming (LP), the objective function of which is to maximize the Equivalent Annuity (EA) of 144 farms with outgrower schemes. There has been an increase in the profitability of tree growers enrolled in the program for an economic radius of 160 km, showing the importance of incentives for eucalyptus plantations in small and medium farms. By LP, 10 management prescriptions common to the 144 farms were selected. It was observed that 15% of the 144 outgrower schemes analyzed did not have an economical prescription. A 10% reduction in the current wood price would increase this amount to 39%. Furthermore, with discriminant analysis of the 10 selected management prescriptions, it was possible to create a classification rule for new partnership contracts, with a 80% success rate.

Econometric results show that the decline in job satisfaction is due mainly to the increase in work pressure-which might be reaching a limit for high-skill workers-and that job satisfaction is most affected by an increase in work pressure when this is not accompanied by greater work autonomy.","[Lopes, Helena; Lagoa, Sergio; Calapez, Teresa] ISCTE Inst Univ Lisboa, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Lopes, H (通讯作者)，ISCTE Inst Univ Lisboa, Dept Polit Econ, Ave Forcas Armadas Lisboa, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",helena.lopes@iscte.pt,"Calapez, Maria Teresa D/A-3112-2013","Calapez, Maria Teresa D/0000-0002-8584-2906; Lagoa, Sergio/0000-0003-2790-6518; Lopes, Helena Maria Sousa/0000-0003-1710-778X",,,,,38,61,71,12,136,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The aim of this study was to estimate the factual direct and productivity costs of hypersomnia in a controlled study including all national patients and their partners. Using records from the Danish National Patient Registry (1997-2009), we idendified all patients with a diagnosis of hypersomnia and compared these patients and their partners with randomly chosen controls matched for age, gender, geographic area and marital status. Direct and productivity costs, including frequencies of primary and sector contacts and procedures, medication, labour supply and social transfer payments were extracted from the national databases. A total of 2,855 national patients was compared to 11,382 controls. About 70 % of patients and controls were married or cohabiting. Patients with hypersomnia had significantly higher rates of health-related contact, medication use and socioeconomic cost. Furthermore, they had slightly lower employment rates, and those in employment had a lower income level than control subjects. The annual mean excess healthrelated cost including social transfers was (sic)3,498 for patients with hypersomnia and (sic)3,851 for their partners. The social and health-related consequences could be identified up to 11 years before the first diagnosis among both the patients and their partners and became more pronounced as the disease advanced. The health effects were present in all age groups and in both genders. On the basis of this retrospective controlled study in the Danish population, symptoms and findings of hypersomnia are associated with major socioeconomic consequences for patients, their partners and society.","[Jennum, Poul] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Ctr Hlth Aging,Glostrup Hosp, Danish Ctr Sleep Med,Dept Clin Neurophysiol, DK-2600 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ibsen, Rikke] Itracks, Aarhus, Denmark; [Avlund, Kirsten] Univ Copenhagen, Sect Social Med, Dept Publ Hlth, DK-2600 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Avlund, Kirsten] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Hlth Aging, DK-2600 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Avlund, Kirsten] Univ Aarhus, Danish Aging Res Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark; [Kjellberg, Jakob] Danish Natl Inst Local & Reg Govt Res, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; Aarhus University,"Jennum, P (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Ctr Hlth Aging,Glostrup Hosp, Danish Ctr Sleep Med,Dept Clin Neurophysiol, DK-2600 Copenhagen, Denmark.",poul.jennum@regionh.dk,"Kjellberg, Jakob/AAN-7147-2020","Kjellberg, Jakob/0000-0003-4336-2397",,,,,28,17,19,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Such an orientation towards preventive investment in education rather than redistribution (or social spending) raises the question of whether, and if so, what kinds of relationships exist between educational and economic inequalities. Based on an international comparison of 20 advanced economies, the results of the analyses suggest that the role of education as an 'equalizer' should not be overestimated. Direct redistribution is much more likely than education to combat poverty in advanced societies. Yet increasing the mean literacy rate by reducing the proportion of low-literate adults is also positively associated with less economic inequality. Welfare states with 'double liability'-investing in children's education and in more equal family conditions-therefore perform best in terms of economic inequality.","[Solga, Heike] WZB Berlin Social Res Ctr, Res Unit Skill Format & Lab Markets, D-10785 Berlin, Germany; [Solga, Heike] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Solga, H (通讯作者)，WZB Berlin Social Res Ctr, Res Unit Skill Format & Lab Markets, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.",heike.solga@wzb.eu,"Solga, Heike/AAY-4793-2021","Solga, Heike/0000-0002-1589-4380",,,,,59,49,51,2,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

That is, PIPEs may have a direct effect on R&D investment and an indirect or smoothing effect using liquidity reserves. This paper also shows that innovative SMEs such as venture businesses, inno-biz firms, and management innovative firms are more likely to use PIPEs for R&D investment than are noninnovative SMEs. The implications of this paper are that PIPEs can be used as an important source of external financing to fund R&D investment and can be particularly valuable for R&D investment in innovative SMEs.","[Shin, Minshik] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Taegu, South Korea; [Kim, Sooeun] Sangmyung Univ, Dept Finance & Management, Cheonan, Chungnam, South Korea",Kyungpook National University; Sangmyung University,"Kim, S (通讯作者)，Sangmyung Univ, Dept Finance & Management, Cheonan, Chungnam, South Korea.",msshin@knu.ac.kr; sekim@smu.ac.kr,,,,,,,22,7,7,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Salmon production peaked in 2002 at 38,900metric tons. Annual production during 2007-2012 was 21,560-30,220metric tons, with a value of US$140-185 million. Farm sizes have increased considerably since 1978; during this time there has also been consolidation of industry ownership. All currently operating companies are locally owned. The industry has faced numerous challenges, including fish health problems, coastal zone conflicts, environmental concerns, and economic issues. Initially, lease applications were evaluated on a site-by-site basis, and most farms were multi-year-class operations, stocking every year. Farms are now operated within a framework of Aquaculture Bay Management Areas, and all farms are single-year-class operations, stocking every three years, with mandatory fallowing between successive crops.

This contribution discusses the tension between this formal recognition and concrete realities in rural development for traditional Amazonian communities by examining large-scale land acquisitions in Brazil, a land-abundant developing country, in the wake of the 2007-08 global food price crises. This study applies anthropological and legal perspectives to analyze problems related to gender inequality caused by large-scale land acquisitions. It argues that inequalities cannot be resolved by simply changing regulations related to traditional communities' and women's rights and that gender relations and land tenure issues reflect interconnected social arrangements based on historical specificities of traditional communities. Case studies show that land acquisitions by outsiders disrupt these arrangements, despite stated commitments to social and environmental responsibility. Such coercive harmony is only unmasked when communities are conscious of their rights, enabling effective use of the legal apparatus.","[Porro, Noemi Miyasaka] Fed Univ Para, Nucleo Ciencias Agr & Desenvolvimento Rural, BR-66094540 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Neto, Joaquim Shiraishi] Fed Univ Maranhao Direito, Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Para; Universidade Federal do Maranhao,"Porro, NM (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Para, Nucleo Ciencias Agr & Desenvolvimento Rural, Travessa Curuzu 1475,Apto 1402, BR-66094540 Belem, Para, Brazil.",noemi@ufpa.br; jshiraishi@uol.com.br,,,,,,,46,8,9,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

However the delay leads a deterioration of countries financial stability. We present a simple theoretical model that connects between countries' saving rate and their net foreign assets. Using cross section data set of 135 countries in 2010 we estimated the econometric relation between saving rate in 2010 as dependent variable and two explanatory variables: the current account in 2010 and the aggregated current account during 1980-2010. Our findings show that industrial countries in a bad financial state tend to decrease their saving rate as external debt is larger causing to deterioration in external debt while countries with good financial state tend to increase their saving rate and the tendency increase as financial state becomes better. Only in countries with a very large external debt saving rate tends to grow.

This acquires additional significance because economies such as the United States and Japan have been close to the zero lower bound since 2008 and 1995, respectively.

According to our results, CIVETS stock markets seem to exhibit a negative relationship between market returns and volatility: negative news have a leverage effect for the most of CIVETS stock markets, as greater volatility is generated by negative than by positive shocks.

We found that, on average, public-listing age has a negative incremental effect on future operating performance in China and that accounting accruals do play a role in postissue underperformance. However, our industrial analysis reveals that the listing-age effect does not persist in industry-specific models; this implies that listing age has heterogeneous effects on post-IPO operating performance and that these effects deserve further attention.","[Huang, Lin; Shu, Yan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Shu, Y (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",lhuang@swufe.edu.cn; shuyan@swufe.edu.cn,"Huang, Lin/J-2121-2014","Huang, Lin/0000-0002-7529-4782",,,,,31,2,2,1,17,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

It is argued that the latter tradition of research requires new forms that impinge not so much on its established modes of scholarly communication - the article, the monograph - but on how it establishes the conditions of fieldwork in contemporary multi-sited spaces of complex assemblages and big projects through which ethnography operates and defines its objects of study. These forms are conceived as 'third spaces', materialized as staged occasions, studios, labs, established alongside the traditional serendipitous path of fieldwork, and involve explicit intellectual partnerships with persons who might otherwise be viewed as facilitators or subjects of research. These third spaces produce prototypes as accessible alternative products of contemporary ethnographic experiments. The author's recent experiments with collaborative research at the World Trade Organization is explored in these terms.","[Marcus, George] Univ Calif Irvine, Anthropol, 2151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Marcus, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Anthropol, 2151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA USA.",gmarcus@uci.edu,"Marcus, George E/H-3230-2016",,,,,,18,22,26,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Performance of these zakat institutions have been the subject of public scrutiny. Multiple objectives, typical of non-profit organizations such as zakat institutions lead to difficulties in determining performance. As such, this paper proposes a performance measurement model for zakat organizations. The model proposes a process approach in measuring performance. In the process approach, tasks accomplished by zakat organizations are cumulative of four dimensions namely input, process, output and outcome. This study employed index as a method of measurement due to its ability to measure magnitude of change over time or place. Data was collected from 303 respondents comprising zakat beneficiaries, staff, head of departments and stakeholders of zakat institutions in the state of Selangor and Negeri Sembilan. Four different sets of questionnaires were specially designed for each category of respondents. The findings were able to determine the performance level of both zakat institutions. The state of Selangor zakat institution, being a more advance as compare to other zakat institutions in Malaysia records a higher index the survey.

However, little attention is paid to the political and broader governmental conditions upon which actuarialism rests. Analysis of fire insurance in Australia indicates that despite urgings from other branches of insurance, the industry did not go down this 'scientific' track until well into the twentieth century. Instead, it relied on detailed individual inspection by insurance agents and a process of 'cumulative dangerousness' - adding up the multiple hazards discovered in each case and using this as a guide to setting premiums. The result was slow, expensive and cumbersome. But the industry was forced to adopt this approach because the built environment in Australian cities was so underregulated that nothing could be taken for granted. Only when adequately designed and enforced government regulations began to appear after the mid-1920s could fire insurance adopt actuarial techniques for economising uncertainty.","[O'Malley, Pat; Roberts, Alex] Univ Sydney, Sydney Law Sch, F10 Eastern Ave, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"O'Malley, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney Law Sch, F10 Eastern Ave, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",pat.omalley@sydney.edu.au; alex.roberts@arts.sydney.edu.au,,,Australian Research Committee [DP1093187 ARC]; Australian Research Council [DP1093187] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Committee(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was funded by an Australian Research Committee Discovery Grant Project: DP1093187 ARC.

In this study, we focus on the Australian edible oyster industry, which is dominated by two major species-the native Sydney rock oyster (grown mainly in Queensland and New South Wales) and the non-native Pacific oyster (grown mainly in South Australia and Tasmania). We examine the integration of the Australian oyster market to determine if there exists a single or several markets. Short-and long-run own, cross-price and income flexibilities of demand are estimated for both species using an inverse demand system of equations. The results suggest that the markets for the two species are integrated. We found evidence that the development of the Pacific oyster industry has had an adverse impact on Sydney rock oyster prices. However, our results show that both species are not perfect substitutes. Demand for Sydney rock oysters is relatively inelastic in the long run, yet no long-run relationships can be identified for Pacific oysters, reflecting the developing nature of this sector.","[Schrobback, Peggy; Coglan, Louisa] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Pascoe, Sean] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, CSIRO Wealth Oceans Flagship, EcoSci Precinct, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Schrobback, P (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",p.schrobback@qut.edu.au,"Coglan, Louisa/J-1113-2012; Coglan, Louisa/AAF-2356-2019; Schrobback, Peggy/X-4697-2019; Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011","Coglan, Louisa/0000-0001-5730-7845; Coglan, Louisa/0000-0001-5730-7845; Schrobback, Peggy/0000-0003-0526-1659; Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649",Fisheries Research Development Cooperation (FRDC) [2008/306],Fisheries Research Development Cooperation (FRDC)(Fisheries R&D Corp),The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Fisheries Research Development Cooperation (FRDC) under the FRDC-funded project 2008/306: Building economic capability to improve the management of marine resources in Australia''; and in-kind support of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO).,,76,13,13,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 CHESTNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The empirical research was carried out for a sample of companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE), over the period 2007-2011, being estimated multivariate regression models for panel data, unbalanced, with fixed effects. The companies' value was measured through Tobin's Q ratio, but adjusted in order to account for the industry membership diversity of the selected companies. We considered the ownership of the five Romanian Financial Investment Companies (SIF-s), the ownership of the Investment Funds and Financial Investment Service Companies (SSIF-s), as well the sum of shareholdings of all categories of financial intermediaries, including in the last the Property Fund (FP) ownership, but only for 2011, when the Romanian Government became minority shareholder. The results provide support for a positive influence of the five Romanian Financial Investment Companies on firm value, but up to an ownership threshold of 23.71 percent, whereupon the influence becomes negative. By considering the ownership of the Investment Funds and Financial Investment Service Companies, we identified a positive influence on firm value. Further, the results provide support for a positive influence of the sum of shareholdings of all categories of financial intermediaries on firm value, but up to an ownership threshold of 50.3 percent, whereupon the influence becomes negative.

In addition, dissatisfaction with one's relative standing in society, and annoyance at government inefficiency, both have a significant positive effect on male informal labour supply.

Neither approach allows for an examination of the impact of even the most basic fire attributes, such as distance and fuel type, on air quality and health outcomes. Improved knowledge of these effects can provide important guidance for efficient wildfire management strategies. This study aims to bridge this gap using detailed information on 24 large-scale wildfires that sent smoke plumes to the Reno/Sparks area of Northern Nevada over a 4-year period. We relate the daily acreage burned by these fires to daily data on air pollutants and local hospital admissions. Using information on medical expenses, we compute the per-acre health cost of wildfires of different attributes. We find that patient counts can be causally linked to fires as far as 200-300 miles from the impact area. As expected, the marginal impact per acre burned generally diminishes with distance and for fires with lighter fuel loads. Our results also highlight the importance of allowing for temporal lags between fire occurrence and pollutant levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A limited set of studies, undertaken in recent years, on the diffusion of new drugs in developing countries indeed conjectures the importance of these factors in shaping drug launch dynamics. Taking a survival analysis approach, we investigate the delay of new drug launch in India for drugs launched in the German market during 1990-2004, when, due to weak intellectual property rights (IPR), not only the innovators but also domestic firms could launch new drug molecules in the country. The paper makes an attempt to distinguish between the commercial success of a new drug and its innovativeness. We find little association between these two characteristics of a drug. Also, the influence of global commercial success in shortening delay is much stronger than that of innovativeness. The study also finds interesting results for the threat of imposition of a strong IPR system, market structure and first mover advantages.

However, offsets have a basic problem stemming from asymmetric information. Sellers of offsets have private information about their opportunity costs, leading to concerns about whether offsets are additional. Non-additional offsets can undermine a cap-and-trade program or, if the government purchases them directly, result in enormous government expenditures. We analyze contracts for carbon sequestration in forests that mitigate the asymmetric information problem. Landowners are offered a menu of two-part contracts that induces them to reveal their type. Under this scheme, the government is able to identify ex post how much additional forest each landowner contributes and minimize ex ante its expenditures on carbon sequestration. To explore the performance of the contracting scheme, we conduct a national-scale simulation using an econometric model of land-use change. The results indicate that for an increase in forest area of 61 million acres, government expenditures are $5.3 billion lower under the contracting approach compared to a uniform subsidy offered to all landowners. This compares to an increase in private opportunity costs of just $110 million dollars under the contracts. Thus, the contracting scheme is preferable from society's perspective.

It relies on International Monetary Fund (IMF) fiscal projections and IMF country reports to gauge how social assistance and other public spending decisions have evolved since the start of the global economic crisis. The study finds that most developing countries boosted total expenditures during the first phase of the crisis (2008-09); but beginning in 2010, budget contraction became widespread, with ninety-one governments cutting overall spending in 2012. Moreover, the data suggest that nearly one-quarter of developing countries underwent excessive fiscal contraction, defined as cutting expenditures below pre-crisis levels. Governments considered four main options to achieve fiscal consolidation - wage bill cuts/caps, phasing out subsidies, further targeting social safety nets, and reforming old-age pensions - each of which would be likely to have a disproportionately negative impact on children and women.","[Ortiz, Isabel; Cummins, Matthew] UNICEF, Div Policy & Practice, New York, NY 10017 USA",UNICEF,"Ortiz, I (通讯作者)，UNICEF, Div Policy & Practice, 3 UN Plaza,420, New York, NY 10017 USA.",iortiz@unicef.org; mcummins@unicef.org,"Ortiz, Isabel/K-5665-2014","Ortiz, Isabel/0000-0002-2230-0974; Ortiz, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3257-4821; Cummins, Matthew/0000-0002-7768-985X",,,,,39,15,17,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The two studies used near-identical methods, except that in England, data were collected in one-to-one interviews with substantial amounts of interviewer assistance, whereas in the Netherlands, the computer aid was used as a self-completion tool in group interviews with lesser amounts of interviewer assistance. In total, 801 members of the general public (403 in England; 398 in the Netherlands) each completed five TTO valuations of EQ-5D-5L health states. Respondents in the Netherlands study showed a greater tendency to give 'round number' values such as 0 and 1 and to complete tasks using a minimal number of iterative steps. They also showed a greater tendency to skip the animated instructions that preceded the first task and to take into account assumptions that they were specifically asked not to take into account. When faced with a pair of health states in which one state dominated the other, respondents in the Netherlands study were more likely than those in the England study to give a higher value to the dominant health state. On the basis of these comparisons, we conclude that the one-to-one, interviewer-led setting is superior to the group, self-complete setting in terms of the quality of data generated and that the former is more suitable than the latter for TTO studies being used to value EQ-5D-5L.","[Shah, Koonal K.; Devlin, Nancy J.] Off Hlth Econ, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Shah, Koonal K.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Lloyd, Andrew] Oxford Outcomes, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England; [Oppe, Mark] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Sheffield; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Shah, KK (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, 7th Floor Southside,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England.",kshah@ohe.org,"Devlin, Nancy/M-3816-2014; Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858",,,,,13,18,18,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In this paper, we present a theoretical model showing that local school administrators have an incentive to allocate weaker students to smaller classes. Then, using a rich individual-level dataset on secondary public schools in Israel, we provide evidence that weaker students are, indeed, systematically placed in smaller classes, thus exhibiting a compensatory allocation scheme. Moreover, schools with enrollment levels just over cut-off points induced by a maximum class size rule are systematically weaker than schools with enrollment levels just under those cut-offs. This finding indicates that not only do local school administrators allocate students into classes in a compensatory manner, but they also manipulate the class-size rule to achieve such an allocation.

And researchers too often believe that simply publishing a brief is sufficient to communicate its results. By focusing briefs on topics on the policy agenda, helping policy makers see their constituents in the results, writing clearly, studying implementation and not just outcomes, weighing evidence and drawing conclusions, and reaching out to policy makers beyond publication, researchers have the greatest potential to see their work influence public policy.","Massachusetts Dept Elementary & Secondary Educ, Malden, MA 02148 USA",,"Conaway, CL (通讯作者)，Massachusetts Dept Elementary & Secondary Educ, Malden, MA 02148 USA.",cconaway@doe.mass.edu,,,,,,,17,5,5,0,5,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

These days, advances in the field of biotechnology redefine the borders between human beings and their environment; contemporary evolutionary patterns coincide with a technology that have developed detached from any cultural discourse. From an artistic point of view, it is unfortunate that there is little possibility to be responsibly involved in the discourse concerning biotechnology and culture. In fact, this matter concerns our society and its various agents. No longer can it remain solely the realm of engineers whose research, while largely ignoring the broader social ramifications of biotechnology, exerts increasing influence on our daily lives. Given this cultural backdrop, it is not surprising that several artists and designers have critically positioned themselves within the fields of biotechnology and genetic engineering; thus in the late 1980s, a new term, Bioart, evolved: shaped by a complex technology and its appropriation by artists, Bioart engages and examines genetic engineering and its impact on the contemporary cultural environment. This article reflects on these developments and questions the possibility of an artistic practice related to synthetic biology. It bases itself on a project realized by a group of students in the fields of media art and genetic engineering from the Bauhaus University Weimar and the University of Heidelberg called Super Cell, presented at the iGEM competition 2010 at MIT. Furthermore, it draws upon and investigates potentialities for a social and cultural involvement of practitioners on an interdisciplinary level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the process of asset accumulation may also have effects. While asset-based policies are predicated on the premise of asset accumulation, little is known about the effects of different asset accumulation trajectories. This study attempts to fill this gap. The results indicate that youths born into households that had asset holdings significantly higher than zero have better college outcomes compared to youths born into households with lower levels of net worth that did not increase significantly over time. However, when lower-wealth households experience significant asset accumulation over time, youths from these households have similar educational outcomes as youths from wealthier households.

In this paper a way is offered to link the current surge in renewable energy investment to the theorizing over long (Kondratiev) waves and techno-economic paradigm shifts. The paper argues that the current renewable energy surge can be best comprehended as a secondary surge in the fifth long K-wave, coinciding with the shift from gestation to installation of a new sixth techno-economic paradigm within the matrix of the fifth. It is argued that this emergent 6th paradigm is a continuation and fulfilment of the 5th, where IT and ICT are applied to the electric power grid, and that both are in conflict with the still-incumbent 4th paradigm based on fossil fuels and centralized power generation. The emergent 6th paradigm is driven by the technology surge associated with renewable energies, particularly in China where the investment is most intense and the falling costs are driving market expansion. It portends a renewable energy speculative financial boom and bubble which could burst sometime in the period 2015-2020, ushering in a period of sustained development of renewables and energy-efficiency services by productive rather than financial capital.

Thus, the success of knowledge sharing is vital because, if successful, it results in shared intellectual capital. Knowledge sharing success, to a great extent, lies in the employees' capability to share knowledge. It is important that this knowledge sharing capability is translated into success through appropriate HRM practices. Knowledge sharing capability is therefore an important factor to consider when designing human resource management (HRM) practices that help to facilitate successful knowledge sharing behaviours among employees. 270 knowledge workers of knowledge-based organisations were surveyed about their perceptions of knowledge sharing capability, and knowledge sharing success. Our study confirms that knowledge sharing capability is important for knowledge sharing success, suggesting its significant role in the design of knowledge-driven HRM practices. This has important implications for HRM delivery in Malaysian and global knowledge based organisations, as the lack of employee's sharing capability on the success of knowledge sharing may lead to an inability of the organization to remain competitive. Implications for HRM practices and future research directions are discussed in detail. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Outer row of cubicles was observed, where 8 cubicles were with 85% shading, 8 cubicles were overshadowed to 95% and 8 cubicles were without shading. The temperature of environment and light intensity with every shading were measured at periodic intervals. 288 individual observing were done, where the occupancy of cubicles was evaluated. Cubicles with 85% shading were used by dairy cows 56 times (it's 58.33%), 95% overshadowed cubicles were occupied 83 times (it's 86.46%) and cubicles without shading were occupied 65 times (it's 67.71%). The difference in occupancy between cubicles 85 % overshadowed and 95% overshadowed was statistically confirmed. Statistically significant difference at occupancy of overshadowed and unshadowed cubicles wasn't determined. The temperature in cubicles with 85% shading was 22.3 degrees C and the light intensity was 2,825 lx, cubicles with 95% shading had the average temperature of 22.5 degrees C and the intensity of the light 1,977 lx and in cubicles without shading the average environmental temperature of 22.5 degrees C and the light intensity 57,039 lx were measured. As regard the temperature of the environment, there wasn't statistically significant difference between different shading. Different light intensity with different shading was statistically highly significant in all cases. It's evident from results, that the dairy cows preferred cubicles with 95% shading and cubicles without shading.","[Andrysek, J.; Chladek, G.; Javorova, J.; Velecka, M.; Vecera, M.; Falta, D.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Andrysek, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xandryse@node.mendelu.cz,"Večeřa, Milan/L-1560-2018; Falta, Daniel/J-5001-2018; Falta, Daniel/AAT-9509-2020; Chládek, Gustav/K-3994-2018","Večeřa, Milan/0000-0002-3363-0717; Falta, Daniel/0000-0002-7679-923X; Falta, Daniel/0000-0002-7679-923X; Chládek, Gustav/0000-0002-4223-0934",,,,,15,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,172,176,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800028,0

The aim of this study is to explore if default risk, represented by CDS spreads, is embedded in stock returns. Our main assertion rests on the idea that if CDS spreads proxy default risk, then it should have informational content for stock markets and should have a significant impact in price formation process. The analysis is conducted by using CDS Regional Index spreads and MSCI Regional Index values in Europe, Pacific Region and Emerging Markets. The results indicate that changes in CDS Regional Index spreads significantly impact stock indices within the same region as well as cross-regionally.","[Baklaci, Hasan Fehmi] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Int Trade & Finance, Izmir, Turkey",Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,,hasan.baklaci@ieu.edu.tr; osuer@gsu.edu.tr,"SUER, OMUR/AAB-2982-2020","SUER, OMUR/0000-0001-9997-6457",,,,,7,1,1,0,4,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-1-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,75,80,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336025300007,0

The barley grain samples from inoculated and non-inoculated field trials performed at four locations in the year 2012 were used for analyses. The spectroscopic data were collected using the FT-NIR Nicolet Magna device. All samples were analysed by a reference method of ultra high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap((R)) MS) at the Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague. The statistics of the calibration and of the cross-validation of the FT-NIR data for DON and NIV showed that the best predictive ability was obtained using the first derivation of spectra. The correlation coefficient of calibration and cross-validation models for DON reached 0.875 and 0.513 and for NIV 0.828 and 0.744, respectively.

This study was conducted in Chile using one 2010 grow-out cycle of trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and combined productivity indicators with economic analysis based on investment theory. Results showed that CAM net yielded better productivity indexes and higher net economic benefits than those of nylon net with anti-fouling coating.

The animals were fed for 40 days ad libitum. Each group was composed of 10 animals. DHA oil and fish oil have high representation in proportion of n-3 fatty acids and safflower oil has high representation in proportion of n-6 fatty acids. The experiment blood samples were taken from the animals in heparin tubes, which were analyzed for the concentration of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triacylglycerols at the end of the experiment. The analytical determination of the content of fatty acids was found in the liver tissues.

Taking into consideration structural change, basis effects, and return and volatility spillover effects, the authors find that the estimated hedging performance is not improved. Their findings suggest that the effectiveness of the hedging performance of aluminum futures contracts in China is not affected by the magnitude or direction of return and volatility spillovers. Therefore, even when the magnitude and direction of volatility spillover from other markets can be correctly predicted, the hedging performance of a futures contract cannot be significantly improved. This paper uses precise measures of return spillovers and volatility spillovers based directly on the framework of vector autoregressive variance decompositions.

Quantitative analysis of fiscal protest in 13 European countries from 1980 to 1995, combined with in-depth comparative-historical analysis of selected countries, shows that fiscal protest was most prevalent where there was a poor fit between tax policy and social spending commitments. Policy incoherence produced pressure for fiscal reforms, which in turn provoked protest. The findings are consistent with the theory that the choice of appropriate tax instruments may help to explain why welfare states persist. They also imply that scholars should not conflate tax protest with welfare backlash, nor assume that tax protest in welfare states is aligned with neoliberal interests.","[Martin, Isaac William] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Sociol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gabay, Nadav] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Bar Ilan University,"Martin, IW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Sociol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",iwmartin@ucsd.edu,"Gabay, Nadav/GLV-6251-2022","Gabay, Nadav/0000-0001-7292-4040",,,,,78,16,17,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Relatively high levels of women's education, by being indicative of household socioeconomic status, may be associated with increased ability to discriminate against girls through prenatal sex selection, especially in the presence of cultural biases resulting in low women's rates of participation in paid work, persistence of dowry payments, and lack of women's property rights.

Concentration was evaluated by haematocytometry method using Burker chamber and activity by subjective method according to the percentage of motile sperm in the native ejaculate. We evaluated the percentage of sperm with progressive direct movement after the head. Viability eosin-nigrosin stain method was performed for evaluation. In this case, we evaluated the total number of alive and dead sperms. Monitored characteristics were expressed in weighted average and standard error. Based on the results we can state that, in case of monitoring factors, the age of dogs had the significant influence. In case of activity, as well as viability, statistically highly significant differences (P < 0.01) were observed between group of youngest dogs (A: 1.5-2 years) and oldest dogs (C: 5-6.5 years). Statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) was proved between dogs from group B (2-5 years) and dogs from group C (5-6.5 years). In conclusion, the negative correlation of age, in case of activity (r = -0.44; P < 0.001) and even viability (r = -0.33; P < 0.01), was demonstrated. With increasing age, the values of both factors were reduced. In case of total number of spermatozoa, this phenomenon was not observed (r = 0.01; P > 0.05).","[Paldusova, M.; Hosek, M.; Filipcik, R.; Machal, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Paldusová, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",paldusovamisa@gmail.com,"Filipcik, Radek/I-6515-2018; Machal, Ladislav/K-7596-2018; Hosek, Martin/K-9805-2018","Filipcik, Radek/0000-0002-5376-5061; Machal, Ladislav/0000-0001-6638-4404; Hosek, Martin/0000-0002-6044-8910",,,,,12,0,0,0,9,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,764,768,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800134,0

The literature stresses the importance of strategic innovation in order to create competitive advantage in the transport company. In the first part of the article the construct of strategic innovation is shown. Strategic innovation initiatives undertaken by industry participants are presented as well. Enterprises in transport industry and their managers are sometimes fixed in industry specifications. These recipes can block the creation and realization of strategic innovation. Some enterprises are trying to break out of existing frames and their experiences determine to specific ways of markets sensing. The research frames of strategic innovation initiatives are brought in the managerial frames and identify drivers and barriers with advantages and disadvantages of the process of strategic innovation in Polish transport enterprises.

The Vietnamese government has promoted shrimp farming as a way to reduce poverty, provide employment opportunities and increase exports to support economic development. The shrimp farming system, however, is economically and ecologically risky and may negatively influence the environment and the sustainability of local people's livelihoods. Because very little is known about the diversity of strategies people employ to deal with these risks, a study was performed in the Mekong Delta across four shrimp farming systems: (1) improved extensive non-forest, (2) mixed mangrove-shrimp, (3) intensive and (4) clustered intensive. The risks and livelihood strategies that were encountered differed systematically across the four farming systems. It was found that the uncertainties that the shrimp farmers faced include limited access rights to the mangrove forest, crop failure due to regular occurrence of shrimp disease, high investment costs and volatile markets for shrimp. Shrimp farmers have created several strategies for coping with these uncertainties, including redesigning farms, producing salt, changing the species farmed from Penaeus monodon to Penaeus vannamei, becoming involved in a cooperative cluster, integrating aquaculture and agriculture, and farming shrimp by organic standards.","[Tran Thi Phung Ha] CanTho Univ, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Can Tho, Vietnam; [Tran Thi Phung Ha; van Dijk, Han] Wageningen Univ, Rural Dev Sociol Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bosma, Roel] Wageningen Univ, Aquaculture & Fisheries Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Sinh, Le Xuan] CanTho Univ, Coll Aquaculture & Fisheries, Cantho City, Vietnam",Can Tho University; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Can Tho University,"Ha, TTP (通讯作者)，Can Tho Univ, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Campus 2,3-2 St, Can Tho City, Vietnam.",ha.tranthiphung@wur.nl,"van Dijk, Han/L-6710-2016","van Dijk, Han/0000-0002-4406-4909",,,,,50,37,45,0,44,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Analysing selected European Commission and Council documents, this article identifies the changes and enduring features of the EU social policy discourse and investigates their potential determinants. It divides this discourse into three periods: the first is associated with the Lisbon Strategy, the second with the reforms that followed (200509) and the third with Europe 2020. The most recent period has witnessed a radical marginalization and tokenization of social policy as compared with macroeconomic and financial concerns. At the same time, EU institutions have increasingly encroached upon national jurisdiction over social policy. These changes seem to be explained by reshuffling among important actors.","[Barbier, Jean-Claude] Univ Paris 01, Sorbonne Ctr Econ Res CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Barbier, Jean-Claude] Univ Paris 01, CNRS, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Barbier, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Sorbonne Ctr Econ Res CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",Jean-Claude.Barbier@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,48,16,16,4,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

The main student-level data samples come from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) and the associated Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:2000). I estimate a multinomial logit of college choice and find that students self-select into for-profit colleges and that the choice of for-profit college is affected by community college tuition. The probability of a student choosing a for-profit college is also heavily influenced by the student's socioeconomic background and parental involvement in the student's schooling. The students with higher school absenteeism are more likely to enroll into for-profit college. Finally, the concentration of for-profit colleges in the student's county is important for the choice of for-profit college. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper makes use of a unique setting in which students take a common, high-stakes post-test which is centrally graded and serves as the basis for capturing actual student learning. We match these student-specific measures of learning to student-specific course evaluation scores from electronic records and a rich set of student-level covariates, including a pre-test score and other measures of skills prior to entering the course. While small in magnitude, we find a robust positive, and statistically significant, association between our measure of student learning and course evaluations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Structured methods encompass a range of pedagogical and managerial instruments applied in the educational system. In recent years, several municipalities in the state of Sao Paulo have contracted out private educational providers to implement these structured methods in their schooling systems. Their pedagogical proposal involves structuring of curriculum content, development of teacher and student textbooks, and the training and supervision of teachers anti instructors. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find that the 4th- and 8th-grade students in the municipalities with structured methods performed better in Portuguese and mathematics than did students in municipalities not exposed to these methods. We find no differences in passing rates.

This article first clarifies the differences between globalization, internationalization and supranational-regionalization by examining the evidence on trade and investment patterns for Denmark. In particular, it presents a detailed analysis of the business strategies of the large corporate sector in Denmark. Denmark is an interesting case, as it is a small open economy (SOE) that might be thought to be one uniquely vulnerable to the forces of globalization. Up until now examination of MNCs internationalization strategies has concentrated upon large economies. We provide evidence for a SOE. In addition, we expand the range of dimensions used to consider internationalization beyond the location of turnover (sales) to include measures of company assets, employment and physical investment. Furthermore, in the light of the analysis of this company sector, we explore the public policy implications of our results for the future of SOEs in a rapidly changing international business environment.","[Kaspersen, Lars Bo] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Thompson, Grahame F.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Copenhagen Business School,"Kaspersen, LB (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark.",lbk@ifs.ku.dk,,,ESRC [ES/H010769/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H010769/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,28,2,2,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This has significant implications for assumptions about corporate structure, law and governance. The article examines governance of sporting organisations from a number of perspectives and draws distinctions between standard assumptions about governance and the realities of sports governance in Australia. It concludes that a number of assumptions made about organisations in law and governance theory do not apply to Australian sporting organisations.

Few teachers transfer between regions, but teachers are considerably more likely to leave Appalachia than to transfer to it. Our results also indicate that Appalachian teachers are more likely to exit the profession.

People are very poor in the area, also beyond the areas close to the park. The average income is around 0.45 USD per person per day. People report food shortages in two out of the last five years. Even the least poor group earns no more than an average of 2 USD/cap and day. Main incomes (80%) are derived from agriculture and non-farm incomes. There is a differential diversification pattern where poor people depend more on selling their labour within agriculture, while the less poor group depends more on non-farm activities. Environmental (forest and natural resources) incomes are low, compared to what is typically found in such rural areas, making up 6.3% of total incomes. Living close to the park incurs costs in the range of 2 to 20% of total household incomes, mainly through wildlife raiding crops and livestock; the scale depending on village location. The study documents that attempts to reduce tensions between local people and the park through outreach activities yield negligible results compared to the costs people incur, and do little to reduce the conflict-ridden park-people relations. Although the park may not necessarily be a poverty trap, it must be seen as yet another and substantial constraint for people securing their livelihoods. Increasing land scarcity, population densities, income inequalities all imply mounting pressures that aggravate resource use conflicts. Furthermore, the present situation with external political interference in selection and implementation of outreach activities is not conducive to progress. Given that 24% of Tanzania consists of wildlife protected areas, much more focused, rights-based and location specific approaches should be developed to reduce losses, and to secure local people's rights to income from the parks and due compensation for accrued costs. People should have formal rights to access park resources that can be subjected to controlled, sustainable harvesting. The present park management culture in terms of attitudes, values and norms needs to change through training in how to work with local people. Such interventions would help reduce conflict levels.

This article explores the evolving relationship between the concept of discrimination in international labour law and the socio-economic phenomenon of inequality at work. While non-discrimination was initially understood as a fairly limited legal principle mandating equal treatment for similarly situated individuals, it subsequently expanded to address indirect discrimination resulting from apparently neutral rules, standards and practices at work. It has expanded further to take on group-based patterns of inequality at work related to the structural constraints of the market, the family and community life, ultimately resulting in convergence between anti-discrimination law and legal initiatives to reduce class-based socioeconomic inequality and poverty.","[Sheppard, Colleen] McGill Ctr Human Rights & Legal Pluralism, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Sheppard, Colleen] McGill Univ, Fac Law, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada",McGill University,"Sheppard, C (通讯作者)，McGill Ctr Human Rights & Legal Pluralism, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,68,12,14,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

We argue that recent futures studies have essentially deepened the analysis of this concept, which originally lacked an accurate definition. Placing weak signals in the general context of futures research has provided the concept with a theoretical point of attachment and linked it with other futures concepts - such as strong signals and trends. Recent studies have also increased the applicability of the concept of weak signals, specifying ways in which signals can be identified, collected and interpreted. Consequently, a number of empirical examples of the analysis of weak signals are nowadays available. In the present paper, we summarize and evaluate both theoretical contributions and managerial implications of these new approaches. While emphasizing the advancements of research, we also want to point out that Ansoff not only was a pioneer in the field, but developed many ideas that are still applicable today. We conclude our paper by suggesting directions for the further development of weak signals research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The conclusion is that the instrument mix matters. The Flemish interventionist approach, which focuses more on traditional instruments, was not as effective as the Dutch stimulating approach, which uses a broad pallet of social and economic instruments, including many new environmental policy instruments. It is conspicuous that the government remains the most important regulator in all cases, although the importance of surrogate regulators is growing. Mostly the government is needed to stimulate or even create such surrogate regulators. Therefore, the government has a key position to decide which regulatory tasks will be transferred to surrogate regulators. This is currently restricted to capacity-building and certification.

The analysis integrated available data on on-site and off-site effects of the conservation measure. Major benefit and cost items related to this specific measure were identified, quantified, and valued. Direct market prices and variants of indirect environmental valuation techniques (cost based and productivity change methods) were employed in valuing the benefit and cost items included in the analysis. Our results indicate that establishing exclosures in degrading marginal lands generate a large positive net present value (NPV) of ETB 5620 ha(-1). However, putting productive agricultural land under exclosures yields a negative NPV even under some hypothetical scenarios of 50% rise in prices of forest products and a social discount rate halved from the base rate of 8%. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the net present value is quite volatile to changes in biomass production and the social discount rate. Thus, appropriate forest management schemes have to be adopted in order to maximize sustainable biomass production. Furthermore, factors such as credit constraints that affect local people's time preference should be addressed to induce local people to discount the future at lower rate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The study augments existing statistical approaches to demographic history by discussing women's motivations. Women's LFP influenced their likelihood of family limitation (via effects on both age at marriage and marital fertility). Where women were most likely to be in paid work, they were most likely to limit family size. It is further argued that the diversity of LFP patterns is the principal explanation for the varied patterns of fertility decline in different parts of Britain.","Univ Huddersfield, Dept Hist, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England",University of Huddersfield,"Atkinson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Huddersfield, Dept Hist, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.",p.d.atkinson@hud.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,12,13,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The assumptions upon the research is based, aims that healthy motivating is a strategy developed in time, whose results not appear immediately and the intervention for retaining employees in cases of emergency occurs immediately, has no effect in the long term and aims their basic needs. After a short introduction supported by the subject matter in literature, the analysis focuses on a retention model applied in a multinational corporation, also present in Romania.

The basic evaluation of uncertainty is an ongoing process that can consume time and resources. It is supported by strong stochastic analysis and is based on the evidence that always, in a certain context, there is a limit on the resources available for economic analysis of projects. A view should be taken on the balance of time to be devoted to the basic assessment of economic viability or cost-effectiveness, including sensitivity analysis, to financial incentives and fiscal impact, and to environmental and distributional issues.

In this article we formalize the optimal corridor design as a connected subgraph problem, which maximizes the amount of suitable habitat in a fully connected parcel network linking core habitat areas, subject to a constraint on the funds available for land acquisition. To solve this challenging computational problem, we propose a hybrid approach that combines graph algorithms with Mixed Integer Programming-based optimization. We apply this technique to the design of corridors for grizzly bears in the U.S. Northern Rockies, illustrating the underlying computational complexities by varying the granularity of the parcels available for acquisition. The approach that is introduced is general and can be applied to other species or other similar problems, such as those occurring in social networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These blends were chosen deliberately because dishes flavored with these spices can be consumed by the consumer without subsequent heat treatment. This preserves the original microflora of spices. In these samples were determined the total plate count, the number of spore-forming bacteria, the number of coliform bacteria and the number of molds and yeasts. The thesis was to compare quantity of microorganisms in spices with legislative requirements and with specialized literature and to compare the microflora blended spices from various companies. All samples were contaminated with microorganisms. The most contaminated was four-colour pepper and then Provencal spices. Salad spices were contaminated less than Provencal.

These controversies were determined by the fact that the matter of the commercial law was often an opportunity for the legislator to derogate from common law, having in view the commercial character. Thus, defaults or delays in the execution time can have much more serious consequences than in the civil law, can determine huge financial losses, payment of substantial penalties or even a company's bankruptcy. This paper aims to demonstrate that, although legal practice in Romania is not unanimous, in commercial matters, the penal compensation clause is also applied to the obligations concerning the payment of a sum of money, considering that the trade requires more celerity, professionalism, fixed-term obligations due, but default terms have more serious consequences than in the civil law. This issue is not regulated even in the new Civil Code, entered into force on October 1st 2011, which permits to oblige the debtor to pay money damages default, but in the case in which these are not higher than the legal interest, the creditor is entitled, besides this, to full compensation for damages.","[Gradinaru, Sandra] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,sandra.gradinaru@yahoo.com,"Gradinaru, Sandra/F-8263-2018",,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2524,2533,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801127,0

This contribution draws on historical research to challenge such an account. First, it demonstrates that the trough in participation is in part statistically manufactured by uncritical reliance on official sources that systematically undercount women workers. Second, it exploits nonstandard sources to construct alternative estimates of women's participation. Third, it analyzes the reconstructed rates to determine their congruence with neoclassical economics and modern empirical studies. Not all posited relationships time travel. Supply-side factors such as marital status and number and age of children are major determinants of modern women's decision to enter the labor force, yet appear less prominent in historical contexts. Instead, the demand for labor seems decisive. Finally, the U-shaped curve is not entirely a statistical artifact, but appears to evolve at higher levels of participation than usually suggested.","[Humphries, Jane] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Humphries, Jane] Univ Oxford All Souls Coll, Oxford OX1 4AL, England; [Sarasua, Carmen] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Humphries, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,"Humphries, Jane/GQA-8830-2022; Sarasua, Carmen/AAS-9630-2020","Sarasua, Carmen/0000-0002-5391-0601",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H003940/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H003940/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,106,128,133,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The results show that, corporate internal financing and debt financing have a significantly positive impact on the investment, while the investment behavior has a positive effect in upgrading the enterprise value.","[Li, Xiaoju] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Accounting Sch, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China",Chongqing Technology & Business University,,lixiaoju19871210@163.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-61896-012-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,1249,1252,,,,,,4,Economics; Management; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BBY61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308816301127,0

The current study explores the issue of labor market discrimination and examines the extent to which highly skilled immigrant women experience an earnings disadvantage as a result of both gender status and nativity status. Relying on data from the 2000 US Decennial Census 5-Percent Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample and using an augmented Oaxaca decomposition technique, this study finds that highly skilled immigrant women do experience a double earnings penalty. In addition, the results suggest that nativity status explains a larger portion of the double earnings penalty than gender status.

Sap flow of 8 trees was measured using heat dissipation method, then expressed as transpiration per square meter of projection area and by adding into rewritten Penman-Monteith equation the canopy conductance (gs) was obtained. Compared with direct measurements on leaf level this approach is advantageous for obtaining gs, because of integrating all leaf categories of tree or whole canopy. Further analysis also proved, that gs is strongly driven by VPD.

The results were used for determination of technological quality of bulbs and so their suitability for subsequent processing in sugar factory. Also, for the whole time of vegetation period the dynamics of the growth of root and leaf area was monitored. The leaf surface kept growing until the end of August when it reached the maximum of 1013 g. Since then there was a decrease in the weight of leaf area because of old leaves necrosis. Concerning the weight of root, over a period of four collections we could observe regular weight increases from 462 g in the second decade of July till 955 g at the end of September. Definitely the biggest final weight both of the root (1704 g) and the leaf area (1462 g) was reached when fertilizer called Carbonbor was applied, that means the variation when boron was applied. At the beginning of the sampling, digestion was very low and reached only 13.7% of sugar content, however, at the end of September it increased for the average value of 16.2%. The highest sugar content (16.9%) was reached with the variation of application of NaCl p.a + DAM 390. Soluble ashes content ranged between 0.4-0.6 %. The alpha-aminonitrogen content was high and as early as from the end of August showed the values 42 mg. 100g(-1).

This contribution uses a cross-country United Nations Office on Crime and Drugs dataset on human trafficking from 2006 to empirically evaluate the socioeconomic characteristics of high-trafficking origin countries and compare them with patterns that have emerged in the literature on migration. In particular, the authors ask how and how much per capita income and gender inequality matter in shaping patterns of human trafficking. Ordinal logit regressions corrected for sample selection bias show that trafficking has an inverse U-shaped relationship with income per capita, and, controlling for income per capita, trafficking is more likely in countries with higher shares of female-to-male income. These results suggest strong parallels between patterns of trafficking and migration and lead the authors to believe that trafficking cannot be addressed without addressing the drivers of migration.","[Rao, Smriti] Assumption Coll, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",Assumption College,"Rao, S (通讯作者)，Assumption Coll, Dept Econ, 500 Salisbury St,313 Founders Hall, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.",srao@assumption.edu; cpresenti@live.com,,,,,,,58,37,48,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

It explains long-term developments in Dutch LFP and concludes that the existing image of Dutch women's historically low participation in the labor market should be reconsidered. Contrary to what many economic historians have supposed, Dutch women's LFP was not lower, and was perhaps even higher, than elsewhere in the pre-1800 period. As in other Western European countries, the decline of (married) Dutch women's LFP only started in the nineteenth century, though it then probably declined faster than elsewhere. Thus, this study concludes that the Netherlands did not constitute the first male-breadwinner economy, as historians and economists have suggested. Scrutinizing the nineteenth-century data in more detail suggests that a complex of demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural changes resulted in this sharp decline of Dutch women's crude activity rates.","[Schmidt, Ariadne] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schmidt, Ariadne] Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Schmidt, A (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,"van Nederveen Meerkerk, Elise/0000-0003-1527-5798",,,,,55,53,57,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In the scan, it is assumed that the management of these themes is at the core of sustainable entrepreneurship. The 'sustainability scan' generally relates to larger companies as it includes a range of themes and steps in the management cycle that are most relevant to large firms. The empirical research suggests that fewer factors are relevant for small fruit producers. In order to reduce the bureaucracy as far as possible, it is suggested that only the most relevant themes and steps in the management cycle be retained. Relevant themes in the 'people' domain are: (i) food safety, (ii) food and health, (iii) terms of employment, and (iv) working conditions. In the 'planet' domain, the following themes can be retained: (i) water, (ii) waste, (iii) energy, (iv) minerals, (v) nature and landscape, and (vi) plant protection products. The 'profit' component can be limited to the following themes: (i) external orientation, (ii) value added, and (iii) capacity to change.

Firstly in article is analyzed gas mining sector using the SWOT analysis and analysis of supply and demand for gas. On the supply side we are defining states with the largest gas reserves and the size of the global proven gas reserves. On the demand side we are analyzed the largest consumers of natural gas. Furthermore, it is examined the dependence between two quantitative variables using correlation analysis (average price of natural gas and proven reserves of gas in each year since 1984).

We find a large and significant protective effect on cognition as measured by word recall. We also explore whether heterogeneity and selection play a part in the large discrepancy between OLS and IV (LATE) estimates of the effect of education on depression and cognition. Using the data available in SHARELIFE on early life conditions of the respondents such as the individuals' socioeconomic status, health, and performance at school, we identify subgroups particularly affected by the reforms and with high marginal health returns to education.

Using participant observation and semi-structured interviews conducted during 2011-12 in two civil-society organizations that run programs fostering women's entrepreneurship, this study shows how neoliberal ideologies interact with ideas of labor, responsibility, and gender. Emphasizing individual rationalities and entrepreneurial attitudes, these civil-society programs contribute to the construction of model subjects of neoliberal citizenship, who are expected to be self-governing and self-sufficient. Yet problems embedded in the neoliberal paradigm and these particular organizations' commitment to women's rights produce contradictions in implementation. The goal of entrepreneurial women is predicated on the assumption that women contribute more to their families' well-being than men. The programs' attempts to construct potential entrepreneurs out of women for this purpose reveal problems with discourses of individual self-sufficiency and responsibility.","Koc Univ Int Relat, TR-34450 Istanbul, Sariyer, Turkey",Koc University,"Altan-Olcay, Ö (通讯作者)，Koc Univ Int Relat, Rumelifeneri Yolu Sariyer, TR-34450 Istanbul, Sariyer, Turkey.",ozaltan@ku.edu.tr,,,,,,,69,39,40,2,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Multilateral discussion is hampered by inconsistent definitions and incomplete data, which could increase the risks of WTO disputes. Members do not notify such subsidies as much as they should under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM), which limits the usefulness of the SCM Committee. The reports of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism on individual countries and on the trading system draw on a wider range of sources, creating an opportunity for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide the missing data from publicly available sources. We suggest a new template that could be used for such third-party notifications. The objective is to shine a light on all fossil fuel subsidies that cause market distortions, especially trade distortions. The result should be better, more comparable data for the Secretariat, governments, and researchers, providing the basis for better-informed discussion of the incidence of fossil fuel subsidies and rationale for their use.","[Casier, Liesbeth; Halle, Mark] Int Inst Sustainable Dev, Geneva, Switzerland; [Fraser, Robin; Wolfe, Robert] Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Wolfe, R (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",robert.wolfe@queensu.ca,,,,,,,84,11,11,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2014,13.0,4,,,,,603,632,,10.1017/S1474745614000226,0.0,,,30,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AT5SB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345001000001,0

Specific attention is paid in the document to mercury contamination that has accompanied the expansion of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in many developing countries. In addressing these articles, the Convention looks to initiate a new wave of policymaking and extension projects in coming years, as signatory countries work to stem emissions from the ASGM sector. If these efforts are to be effective, however, designers must first overcome the barriers and challenges posed by a legacy of failed efforts aimed at educating small-scale prospectors about the environmental and health implications of extensive mercury use and cleaner technologies. In order to do so, a reconceptualisation in approach towards mercury pollution in the sector will be necessary. There are some positive signs that academics and policymakers alike are steadily reaching a new consensus on how to tackle the issue more effectively. A strong case can be made for a 'humanistic' understanding of this persistent issue, and it is critical that such new perspectives are carried forward, not only under the Minamata Convention, but more generally.

Apart from providing financial incentives, the state has also promoted local autonomy and participation in the program. This promotion represents a big shift in forest policy that grants more power to local communities and increases the involvement of local governance in decision-making. Whether the SLCP has been effectively implemented, the extent of its ecological and socioeconomic outcomes and how its performance can be improved are still unclear in the absence of adequate biophysical and socioeconomic data. To gain a holistic understanding of the SLCP's implementation and impacts, this research examines the interplay between the governance of the policy's implementation and local variations leading to the various ecological and socioeconomic outcomes observed, based on a comparative case study in two communities. It provides a novel explanation for why the SLCP, generally implemented via a top-down approach, produces better positive outcomes in one place than in the other, and argues for the significance of local institutions in shaping the policy's outcomes. This paper recommends institutional reform across the country's socio-ecological system, with the national policy-maker considering local dynamics in policy formulation and implementation and developing mechanisms of accountability and local institutions.

To identify the causal effect of this policy on exports, we use sectoral export data for a panel of Chinese cities and exploit variations in exports between cities and sectors, over time, and, in a second step, between firm types. We find a relative fall in sectoral exports in targeted cities after the implementation of the policy, which is sharper the more polluting the industry. Further, we find that the observed effect is mainly driven by privately owned firms, whereas exports of state-owned firms seem to be unaffected by the new policy. This finding is consistent with the preferential political treatment of state-owned firms in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In subsidy-related cases, retaliation becomes an option for an injured Member when the offending Member fails to withdraw the prohibited or actionable subsidy, or fails to remove the adverse effect of the actionable subsidy within the required time. This article provides an in-depth overview of retaliation in subsidy-related cases and advocates that 'inducing compliance' should be the goal of retaliation in WTO dispute settlement. To achieve this, the article analyses two main factors relating to the retaliation rules in subsidy-related cases, namely, the determination of the level of retaliation and the principles and procedures for retaliation and cross-retaliation. It also examines how the WTO arbitrators apply the rules in real-case scenarios, using the case of US-Upland Cotton as an example. In the process, the US-Upland Cotton (Article 22.6-US) arbitration decision is shown to have introduced six major developments to the WTO dispute settlement system.","[Guan, Song] Embassy China, Econ & Commercial Counsellors Off, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guan, Song] UIBE, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Guan, S (通讯作者)，Embassy China, Econ & Commercial Counsellors Off, Beijing, Peoples R China.",guansong@rocketmail.com,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

It finds that, while there is evidence of a positive impact of SHG membership on women's autonomy, on average, SHG membership does not affect subjective well-being. However, results also reveal that for members living in communities with relatively conservative gender norms among nonmembers, subjective well-being is notably lower. The authors interpret this finding as evidence that these SHG members feel a loss of identity - a problem that looms larger when women's enhanced autonomy implies a stronger violation of gender norms at the community level. In these communities, social-sanctioning mechanisms contribute to a negative impact of women's SHGs on subjective well-being, as evidenced by qualitative accounts of women's empowerment trajectories in the research area.","[de Hoop, Thomas] Amer Inst Res, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [van Kempen, Luuk] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Ctr Int Dev Issues, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Gelderland, Netherlands; [Linssen, Rik] Maastricht Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Maastricht, Limburg, Netherlands; [van Eerdewijk, Anouka] Royal Trop Inst, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands",American Institutes for Research; Radboud University Nijmegen; Maastricht University,"de Hoop, T (通讯作者)，Amer Inst Res, Washington, DC 20007 USA.",tdehoop@air.org; l.vankempen@maw.ru.nl; rik.linssen@maastrichtuniversity.nl; a.vaneerdewijk@kit.nl,"van Kempen, Luuk/D-1720-2012; de Hoop, Thomas/IUQ-1858-2023; de Hoop, Thomas/R-7196-2019","van Kempen, Luuk/0000-0002-5965-3271; de Hoop, Thomas/0000-0002-0033-1139;",,,,,47,21,28,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

It constitutes an enormous burden of disease due to high prevalence, severe co-morbidities and high costs for society. This study is the first comprehensive study on the direct and indirect costs of DM (type 1 and type 2) and associated complications in Poland. In order to estimate the direct medical costs of DM and its complications, including the costs of medical consultation, hospitalisation, rehabilitation, drugs and medical equipment, data from the National Health Fund were used. Indirect costs on loss of productivity due to diabetes and its complications were based on data obtained from the ZUS (Social Insurance Institution) and from GUS (Poland's Central Statistical Office). Attributable risk methodology was used to assess the burden of DM complications. A continuous increase of the direct costs of diabetes has been observed since the year 2005. In the analysed time period (2005-2009) the direct costs of medical services for both types of DM doubled. DM is a cause of significant sickness absence and incapacity for work and therefore is associated with a growing productivity decline in Poland. The highest direct costs and indirect costs are associated with treatment of diabetes-related complications. Direct costs of hospital complication treatment were EUR 332 million, which exceeded by more than five times the direct costs of hospital treatment of diabetes per se, which in the same year amounted to EUR 58.5 million. The indirect costs of diabetes-related complications were higher by 41 % compared with indirect costs related to DM itself. Total costs of health care services for DM and its complications amounted to EUR 654 million, which constitutes a 2.8 % of total health care costs in Poland. Total DM cost in Poland in 2009 amounted EURO 1.5 billion. DM is causing a growing economic burden on the health care system and on Polish society in terms of health care and productivity losses. Most of the total cost of diabetes are indirect costs caused by productivity losses. Both direct and indirect costs are driven by the cost of diabetes complications.","[Lesniowska, Joanna; Wojna, Michal] Kozminski Univ, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland; [Schubert, Agata; Skrzekowska-Baran, Iwona] Novo Nordisk, PL-02146 Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University; Novo Nordisk,"Lesniowska, J (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, 57-59 Jagiellonska St, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland.",jlesniowska@kozminski.edu.pl,"Leśniowska, Joanna/AAC-2003-2020","Leśniowska, Joanna/0000-0003-2764-9910",,,,,13,38,41,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Time series data on forest cover, land use, timber production, and socio-economic variables of Peninsular Malaysia were analyzed by regression modeling using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Peninsular Malaysia experienced extensive deforestation during the 1970s and early 1980s, but since then deforestation has slowed down substantially. Regression results highlighted that poverty alleviation was the principal underlying factor leading to change in forest area. Neither population growth nor economic growth was a major factor affecting forest cover. Oil palm expansion was identified as the main proximate cause of deforestation. Regression results also indicate that oil palm expansion greatly contributed to poverty reduction. Our empirical evidence suggests that in Peninsular Malaysia, agricultural development to reduce poverty, in particular oil palm development, initially led to deforestation. However, substantial decrease in poverty caused decrease in deforestation over the long term. Based on the results of this study, we propose poverty alleviation as a strategy to reduce deforestation. Our findings demonstrate the need to analyze factors that reduce deforestation and to develop effective REDD programs. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We have developed a standardised approach for the consideration of national circumstances in REDD + reference levels, which applies the global curve of forest cover development as the benchmark for accounting of avoided deforestation. The approach draws on the identification and empirical quantification of a global deforestation curve which was created by applying the forest transition concept (Kothke et al., 2013). By the underlying regression model the most relevant national circumstances were identified as the average of 140 countries. These national circumstances represent the development stages of the individual countries, from which their future forest cover development in the global average can be determined. By applying national data for estimating the corresponding average development the article identifies national reference levels for 86 REDD + target countries which are still in their deforestation phase. It is estimated by how much actual deforestation in each country deviates from the mean deforestation curve; the period considered is 2005-2010. This is the first time a uniform global deforestation pattern was used to determine the consideration of national circumstances in REDD + reference levels. The quantitative results provided here may be an important basis for further policy discussions about reference level determination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This article explores the relationship between Australia's experience of economic restructuring and the political dynamics of an emerging `dual welfare state'. Importantly, the article argues that Australian reformers did not reject the state per se, nor egalitarianism as an objective. Instead, reform sought to combine greater competition with compensation, generating larger inequalities in market incomes alongside growing social spending. The article explores how Labor combined neoclassical ideas about competition with a commitment to a `small state' version of social democracy. This did moderate inequalities through the period of restructuring, but it also altered the dynamics of political contestation. The article provides two typologies to understand this political dynamic, arguing forms of marketisation opened the door to a political contest over the nature, rather than the extent, of public provision, while the model of targeting reinforced paternalist tendencies inherent in neoliberal reform.","[Spies-Butcher, Ben] Macquarie Univ, Dept Sociol, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Spies-Butcher, B (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Sociol, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",ben.spies-butcher@mq.edu.au,,"Spies-Butcher, Benjamin/0000-0002-0427-5082",,,,,76,19,19,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The abolition of the benefit was publicly announced about 10 months in advance, creating the opportunity for prospective parents to (re-)schedule conceptions accordingly. We find robust evidence that, within the month before the abolition, about 8 % more children were born as a result of (re-)scheduling conceptions. At the same time, there is no evidence that mothers deliberately manipulated the date of birth through medical intervention. We also find a substantial and significant increase in the fraction of birth complications, but no evidence for any resulting adverse effects on newborns' health.","[Brunner, Beatrice; Kuhn, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Brunner, Beatrice] ZHAW Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Winterthur, Switzerland; [Kuhn, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Vocat Educ & Training, Zollikofen, Switzerland; [Kuhn, Andreas] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Zurich; Zurich University of Applied Sciences; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kuhn, A (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Vocat Educ & Training, Zollikofen, Switzerland.",beatrice.brunner@econ.uzh.ch; andreas.kuhn@econ.uzh.ch,,"Brunner, Beatrice/0000-0002-6010-5184",,,,,26,13,14,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

From the ruling of the Appellate Body, and the unappealed part of the panel decision, one can conclude that a WTO Member normally must ensure an evenhanded distribution of the natural resources that it decides to mine or harvest amongst the WTO membership. The only difference arises where a Member's citizens or industries face a crisis because of a temporary shortage of an essential product. For those who share an international outlook on the world, this is an acceptable, and even a desirable outcome. The ruling potentially has far-reaching implications for international trade, not only in minerals and metals, but for agricultural and energy goods as well. However, in reaching this laudable result, circumscribing the use of export restrictions, the Appellate Body also made a highly regrettable finding. It ruled that China, because of the wording of its Accession Protocol, was not allowed to invoke a public policy justification for certain of its export restrictions (notably: its export duties, on which it had assumed additional commitments). The underlying assumption that sovereign states can sign away their rights to pursue public policies, such as environmental protection, which are generally admitted amongst the WTO membership, is deplorable.","[Bronckers, Marco] Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Maskus, Keith E.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Bronckers, M (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",Marco.Bronckers@vvgb-law.com; Keith.Maskus@colorado.edu,,,,,,,17,22,24,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2014,13.0,2,,,,,393,408,,10.1017/S1474745614000032,0.0,,,16,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AG5GA,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335446300010,0

In this paper, we show that the structure of socio-economic inequality produced by the housing market has dramatic effects on both citizen's preferences over education and its provision, along the lines suggested by scholars in the tradition of Tiebout. In particular, growing housing prices permit wealthier individuals to 'target' education in ways that exclude lower income citizens. Districts with higher house prices have higher average academic performance but also greater variation in performance and a greater number of schools opting out of local authority control. Moreover, in districts with high variation in school performance, owners of expensive housing are more satisfied with schooling than are non-owners, with the reverse pattern obtaining in districts with low academic variation.","[Gingrich, Jane] Univ Oxford, Magdalen Coll, Oxford OX1 4AU, England; [Ansell, Ben] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Ansell, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, New Rd, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",ben.ansell@politics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,22,24,25,6,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Tied aid is a form of development aid granted upon the condition that it is spent according to donor preferences. The legal review concentrates on the consistency of tied aid with the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCMA) and Article XVII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Here, many potential breaches of the SCMA are revealed, while a violation of the GATT is less apparent due to the unclear concept of State Trading Enterprises. Many variants of tied aid are found to constitute prohibited or at least actionable export subsidies and no regular development aid. Despite the breaches, no trade dispute involving tied aid has been brought before the WTO's dispute settlement system. The final section analyses the practical obstacles to a precedent and argues that the freedom from regulation of development aid cannot be extended to tied aid, which is guided by protectionist motives.","Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Fac Law, Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Hagemeyer, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Fac Law, Nurnberg, Germany.",teoman.hagemeyer@fau.de,,"Hagemeyer-Witzleb, Teoman M./0000-0002-2709-4364",,,,,104,3,3,0,19,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In this work, the effect of the financial reform on hospital efficiency is subjected to empirical testing by means of two complementary testing approaches. On the one hand, we apply a two-stage procedure based on non-parametric efficiency measurement. On the other hand, a stochastic frontier model is employed that allows a one-step estimation of both production frontier parameters and inefficiency effects. To identify efficiency gains as a consequence of changes in the hospital incentive structure, we account for technological progress, spatial dependence and hospital heterogeneity. The results of both approaches do not reveal any increase in overall efficiency after the DRG reform.

Literature search was made to retrieve relevant publications using AMED, the Cochrane Library, CRD (DARE, NHS EED, HTA), EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the journal Homeopathy (former British Homoeopathic Journal). A hand search of relevant publications was carried out. Homeopathy researchers were contacted. Identified publications were independently assessed by two authors. Fifteen relevant articles reported on 14 economic evaluations of homeopathy. Thirteen studies reported numbers of patients: a total of 3,500 patients received homeopathic treatment (median 97, interquartile range 48-268), and 10 studies reported on control group participants (median 57, IQR 40-362). Eight out of 14 studies found improvements in patients' health together with cost savings. Four studies found that improvements in homeopathy patients were at least as good as in control group patients, at comparable costs. Two studies found improvements similar to conventional treatment, but at higher costs. Studies were highly heterogeneous and had several methodological weaknesses. Although the identified evidence of the costs and potential benefits of homeopathy seemed promising, studies were highly heterogeneous and had several methodological weaknesses. It is therefore not possible to draw firm conclusions based on existing economic evaluations of homeopathy.

The major factors which are causing this tectonic shift are changes in demographics, increase in empowerment of certain segments of society, global exposure, improvement in infrastructure and worries about health and sustainability. These changes will be reflected in terms of how identities will evolve - how confident and free do Indians feel in being able to express themselves and hence what will they seek to stimulate their senses. Will technology enable or disable relationships or the very nature of relationships will change? How will Indians deal with creativity - will it be a part of their DNA? And finally, what parameters will define well-being and how willing will the Indian consumer be to pursue it.

A Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) was commissioned to develop guiding principles for GPO investments. Here we offer commentary on the BRP report from scholars in multiple disciplines that study the oceans: environmental economics, environmental politics, fisheries science, physical oceanography, and political economy. The BRP is a prominent, unique group of individuals representing diverse interests of GPO partners. We applaud the call for knowledge creation, but identify diverse issues that the BRP omitted: the need for effective governance to address data-poor stocks so that gaps do not dictate solutions; the deployment of projects that facilitate learning about governance effectiveness through program evaluation; and the importance of large-scale coordination of data collection in furthering the BRP's call for capacity building. Commenters' opinions are mixed on the likely impact of the report's recommendations on ocean health, governance, and economic development, but they highlight several key features of the report. A centerpiece of the report that distinguishes it from most previous high-level reports on the oceans is the prominence given to human well-being. The report emphasizes the commons problem as a critical institutional failure that must be addressed and focuses heavily on market-based mechanisms to improve governance. The report successfully acknowledges tradeoffs-across different stakeholders as well as across human well-being and ocean health but there is little specific guidance on how to make these tradeoffs. Historical tensions among GPO partners run deep, and resolving them will require more than high-level principles. For instance, it is unclear how to resolve the potential conflict between proprietary data and the report's stated desire for transparency and open access to information. Some differences may ultimately be irreconcilable. The report appropriately advocates flexibility for the GPO to adapt solutions to particulars of a problem, avoiding the trap of one size fits all. However, flexibility is also a weakness because the BRP does not provide guidance on how best to approach problems that span multiple scales. Some scales may be beyond the scope of the GPO; for example, the GPO cannot meaningfully contribute to global climate change mitigation. Nevertheless, the GPO could play an important role in climate adaptation by facilitating the development of governance regimes that are resilient to climate-induced species migrations.","[Abbott, Joshua] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Anderson, James L.] World Bank, Oceans Fisheries & Aquaculture Serv, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Anderson, James L.] World Bank, Agr Serv, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Anderson, James L.] World Bank, Environm Serv, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Campling, Liam] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London, England; [Hannesson, Rognvaldur] Norwegian Sch Econ, London, England; [Havice, Elizabeth] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Lozier, M.

The article shows that developed stock markets, the ability of limited partners (insurance companies) to invest in LBO funds and low employment protection are more important determinants than investor protection in the case of LBO investments. However, venture capital (VC) investments are found to be positively associated with investor protection but also with developed stock markets and favourable tax rates for managers. R&D tax incentives for investee companies are found to have a negative impact on VC investments, which are nonetheless promoted by public R&D expenditures. Even if national institutional configurations matter in explaining differences, as emphasised by LO and DoC, we observe a common trend in PE development and financialisation.","[Bedu, Nicolas; Montalban, Matthieu] Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, F-33608 Pessac, France",Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bedu, N (通讯作者)，Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",nicolas.bedu@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,69,15,15,0,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Primary data were collected via an original survey. The results indicate that large-scale, non-shellfish marine aquaculturists without an advanced graduate degree are more likely to expand abroad.

This significantly affects the economics of logging and, consequently, the viability of carbon payments to aid in the conservation or management of the world's forests. In this paper we first develop a conceptual model to investigate how theoretical opportunity costs and the conservation potential of carbon payments vary across forests with stocking rates and species composition. We focus the model on two possible conservation contexts: 1) strict protection of unlogged forests and 2) conservation of selectively logged forests. Results suggest that the type of forest, with regard to both timber volume and species composition, greatly affects the potential of a carbon payment to mitigate forest degradation. Additionally, two complementary insights emerge. First, in forests where timbers of high commercial value represent only a small proportion of total wood volume (and therefore carbon), selective logging may make conservation of the wider landscape more feasible, and cost-effective. Second, in forests where selective logging of highly-prized species has already occurred, engaging in long-term conservation of forest (and hence thwarting conversion to agriculture) may make the conservation of biodiverse landscapes more feasible, and their management more cost-effective.

However, most research on illegal forest activities deals with illegal timber harvesting with little efforts on other activities like Non Timber Forest Products (NTFP). In Cameroon, commercial exploitation of most NTFP is regulated by a permit system. However a majority of traders who sell these products do not have the necessary permits. The objective of this paper is to assess and use transactions costs economics (TCs) to explain why traders in Cameroon do not comply with regulations on permits. Results show that the process to obtain permits may require more than 26,000 USD and may require regular monitoring during a time span of more than 4 years. Analyses of traders' perceptions illustrate that the major sources of high TCs in the forest sector are the perceived complex administrative procedures and information asymmetry on procedures and the requirements to obtain permits. The study concludes that it is the impracticality to abide to high TCs rather than the inclination to disobey the law that pushes traders to operate without permits. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is hypothesised that due to the bureaucracies' informal goal of gaining and maintaining responsibility over political issues, mainly ministries of agriculture including forestry and ministries of environment are competing for the task of representing states in international forest and forest-environmental negotiations. A survey design based on a semi-structured questionnaire was used to study the bureaucratic representation of the selected states to the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) and to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) negotiations between 2000 and 2011. The results show that in the processes under study the representation of states by utilitarian types of bureaucracies is rather increasing, while the role of conservationist bureaucracies is declining. Likewise, the roles of ministries of foreign affairs and economic affairs are declining, while hybrid organisations on agriculture/environment were observed being on a strong increase. Under CBD negotiations the vast majority of responding countries was represented by environmental bureaucracies, while agricultural ones played a marginal role. In contrast, under UNFF negotiations countries were represented by agricultural, economic and hybrid agricultural/environmental bureaucracies in approx. equal shares. Agricultural bureaucracies especially gained influence under UNFF negotiations during the study period. The article concludes on these trends also highlighting options for future research.

Furthermore, they show that the exchange rate was the main determinant of the price variation in the first period when neglecting the inertia. In the second period, the main causes of inflationary pressures were demand pressures. The results also show that, in the Brazilian case, the significant currency devaluation in a short period of time can be dangerous to price stability.","[Gonzales, Erica Oliveira; de Araujo, Eliane Cristina] Univ Fed Sergipe, Econ, Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil; [Gonzales, Erica Oliveira] Univ Estadual Maringa, Grad Program Econ, Econ Theory, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [dos Santos, Allan Silveira] Univ Brasilia, Grad Program Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Araujo, Eliane Cristina] Univ Estadual Maringa, Econ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sergipe; Universidade Estadual de Maringa; Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade Estadual de Maringa,"Gonzales, EO (通讯作者)，PCE UEM, 5790 Jardim Univ, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",ericagonzales22@gmail.com; allansilveira1@gmail.com; elianedearaujo@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,2,DENFAR TRANSNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,ONTARIO,"58 RIDEAU HEIGHTS DR, ONTARIO, OTTAWA NEPEAN K2E 7A6, CANADA",,,978-0-9868210-5-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,49,63,,,,,,15,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353691000004,0

Our method is applied to the Gulf of Mexico red snapper quota lease market and finds that certain quota lease traders with larger information-sharing networks or stronger network positions have greater negotiating power. Also, average quota lease prices varied by region even though there are no geographic trading restrictions. Results indicate social networks are correlated with price dispersion and inefficiencies in the trading markets that can undermine the success of catch share programs that seek to improve fishery profits and reduce overcapacity.","[Ropicki, Andrew J.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ FRE Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Larkin, Sherry L.] Univ Florida, FRE Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ropicki, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ FRE Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",aropicki@ufl.edu; slarkin@ufl.edu,,"Larkin, Sherry/0000-0002-8850-0856; Ropicki, Andrew/0000-0002-9275-1463",Florida Agricultural Experiment Station; National Marine Fisheries Service/Sea Grant Fellowship in Marine Resource Economics,Florida Agricultural Experiment Station; National Marine Fisheries Service/Sea Grant Fellowship in Marine Resource Economics,The authors thank Dan Holland and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

This paper explores J-curve pattern and relationship between exchange rate volatility and trade flows using quarterly data over the period 1997 -2012. We employ a Johansen cointegration test to analyze the long run relationship. Short term effects are explored by estimating an error correction model and by assessing impulse-response functions. We reveal J-curve for trade with France and an inverse J-curve for Slovakia and United Kingdom. Volatility has no clear impact on trade flows. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Regional efficiency is driven by naturally, historically and politically conditioned unequal county positions over which counties do not have total control. Categorical approach is introduced as an extension to the basic DEA models. This approach, combined with window analysis, changes relations among efficiency scores in favour of continental counties. The results should assists policy makers in designing effective regional policies by identifying main regional disparity determinants using an improved DEA model.","[Skare, Marinko; Rabar, Danijela] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dr Mijo Mirkovic Fac Econ & Tourism, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dr Mijo Mirkovic Fac Econ & Tourism, Pula, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr; drabar@unipu.hr,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692",,,,,28,4,4,0,8,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Thus, by employing Ward's method as agglomerative hierarchical clustering there resulted three classes of companies. Subsequently, we identified the discriminant functions based on which we could accomplish predictions regarding the companies' membership to the three previously established classes.

Chilean Native Forest Legislation has created policy instruments that encourage the participation of civil society in the determination of native forest policies, and established the Native Forest Research Fund, which is instrumental to the application of regulations. Examining the process of research priority setting and the Native Forest Research Fund reveals evidence of communicative action action oriented at reaching understandings and not personal benefits; supporting the Habermasian ideal. However, strategic behavior of participants from civil society in the process of managing the research fund is also found.

We conclude that monopolistic competition prevails in both markets. However, banks' market power in the credit market is much lower than in the deposit market. Moreover, the comparison of demand elasticities in these two markets shows that credits will respond more than deposits to the taxes imposed on them, suggesting that loan provisions can be more effective than reserve requirements as a macroprudential policy tool to restrict credit growth.","[Akin, G.

The resulting fragmentation in the international trade regime poses serious risks to economic welfare and the coherence of international trade law. Similar challenges have been faced in the international investment regime, which is comprised of a highly fragmented network of bilateral investment treaties (BITs). However, scholars have identified several mechanisms that promote harmonization in the international investment regime. Among these are cross-treaty interpretation in dispute settlement and the inclusion of most-favoured nation (MFN) clauses in BITs. This paper assesses the scope for these two mechanisms to emerge in the international trade regime by comparing the legal framework, institutional dynamics, and political economy of the trade and investment regimes. The analysis suggests that cross-treaty interpretation is likely to emerge in the trade regime as PTA dispute settlement activity increases and that greater use of MFN clauses in PTAs is a viable possibility. These developments would mitigate the effects of fragmentation and advance harmonization in the international trade regime.","[Johnston, Adrian M.] Supreme Court Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Trebilcock, Michael J.] Univ Toronto, Fac Law, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Johnston, AM (通讯作者)，Supreme Court Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,63,12,13,1,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2013,12.0,4,,,,,621,652,,10.1017/S1474745613000128,0.0,,,32,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,217CA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324333000001,0

Other joint services such as biodiversity protection or landscape beauty are rarely paid for and are insufficiently provided. Payment schemes are designed to reduce this undersupply. In this paper, we analyze how paying for the additional provision of some services might affect the production of joint services. Payments should at least compensate for the loss of revenue resulting from providing more services. These opportunity costs can be estimated using a production possibility frontier in which the maximum profit from currently marketed outputs is a function of the externalities. We show that payment for a single service can threaten other services if there are diseconomies of scope. If at least two services are considered, then payments can either be made independently for each of them (stacking) or simultaneously in a bundle. In the case of bundling, the minimum payment amount corresponds the total opportunity cost whatever the interactions between services. In the case of stacking, if there are diseconomies of scope and if the amount paid for increasing each service equals the individual opportunity cost, then the total payment would not compensate for the total cost. Some services might remain undersupplied. On the contrary, if there are economies of scope then the total stacked amount will be greater than the total opportunity cost. Hence, it is critical to analyze interactions between ecosystem services because they are likely to change the profitability or the opportunity costs related to increasing the production of the ecosystem services and so the schemes of payments.

In our case study we focus on problem-solving performances related to a) the organizational response of state-owned forest companies confronted with heterogenedus expectations and interests from their dynamic environments (an external perspective) and b) long-term decision-making under uncertainty on the regional and local level (an internal perspective). First, we presume that practical decision-making concerning climate change adaptation measures (e.g. tree species selection) is far from rational. Based on Karl Weick's sensemaking concept (Weick, 1995), forest companies are rather understood as interpretation systems that scan, interpret, and learn while acting in mutual dependencies with their environment. Second, along with DiMaggio and Powell (1983), we assume that these organizations absorb uncertainty by adopting solutions (e.g. working tools such as risk maps) from other forest administrations and companies, whose response, when faced with the same problem, is considered as legitimate within the forestry community (institutional isomorphism). Based on qualitative (32 expert interviews with senior administrators) and quantitative (national online survey among district foresters) data, we argue that - instead of being considered a hurdle for long-term planning - the acceptance of indispensable uncertainty leads to an understanding of planning as a creative process, enabling a variety of solutions.

Revenue can be recycled through a lump-sum transfer or a reduction in pension contributions. Our theoretical results as well as the calibration of our model to the German economy show that the median voter's preferred tax rate may exceed the efficient rate. This holds whenever income of the decisive voter is sufficiently high compared to the average income, as rich individuals benefit more from a reduction in pension contributions than they are harmed by an increase in ecotaxes. The calibration confirms that the median voter prefers the earmarking of tax revenue for reductions in pension contributions to the alternative lump-sum transfer. This is quite an accurate prediction of the situation in Germany. Aging of society as expected for Germany lowers the ecotax in the political equilibrium below its optimal level.

Yet, despite Australia's long history of industrial activism and political representation of labour, there are fewer examples of social or political movements in Australia resisting precarious work than in Europe. This article provides a partial explanation of this puzzling lack of social resistance to casual employment. It begins from the idea, developed by the Frankfurt School tradition of critical social theory, that economic systems can create or sustain norms that conceal their more harmful social effects from public view. It then uses conceptual categories drawn from critical social theory to show how individual and social costs of casual employment have been overlooked or reified' in the workplace and in public political discourse.

Assessment of farmers' behaviors in response to the reforms would be useful when policy adjustments are considered. This paper investigated farmers' participation and investment using labor and money input in forest management as indicators. The data were collected in Tonggu County in southern China. Results indicate that positive attitudes toward the reforms and higher income from forest product sales encourage participation in forest management. In contrast, higher off-farm income would hold back their participation and investment.

We propose an extended NKPC model for China, which can be easily rationalized in terms of sticky-price setting of backward-looking firms. Empirical results show that further lags of inflation are needed in the hybrid specification of the NKPC in order to rule out serial correlation; forward-looking behavior has a relatively larger impact on inflation dynamics than backward-looking behavior; and conventional output measures remain valid inflation forces in the extended model. Open economy augmentations, nevertheless, indicate that neither exchange rate nor import prices exert a significant impact on inflation in China.","[Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, Dept Monetary Finance, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China,"Zhang, CS (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Dept Monetary Finance, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangchengsi@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,7,7,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In response to policy demands for triple-bottom-line assessments, developing transdisciplinary endeavours has been a primary focus, catalysing methodological innovations. However, the period of innovation has increased the divergence between a science domain characterised by increasing complexity of communicated analytical outputs and a policy domain that generally remains impelled towards single metric outcomes. We argue that this new phase will see the focus shift from method innovation towards the design of research processes to correct the discrepancy. This paper describes the Challenge-and-Reconstruct Learning framework (ChaRL) for designing sustainability-focused research processes to better align science contributions and policy aspirations in complex decision making arenas. This paper provides evidence for how the ChaRL framework can (1) establish and maintain an effective science-policy interface despite high levels of complexity and high levels of contested values and (2) challenge and reconstruct existing knowledge, providing a robust foundation to evidence-based decision making. Critical for these achievements is that the design of the engagement process starts with the cognitive elements critical to the decision making processes, that is individuals' causal beliefs and values.

What is becoming clear to many commentators as well as science fiction writers is how rapid prototyping, or 3D printing more generally, could permit many final objects to be made near to or even by consumers on just-in-time 'printing' machines. This revolution in making would have many implications for the economy-and-society in the future by seriously augmenting, or possibly replacing, current systems of manufactured production, long-distance transportation and consumption. These 3D technologies have featured in SF works, including Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age, Ian McDonald's Brasyl, Charles Stross's Rule 34 and Cory Doctorow's Makers. The article reports on current research seeking to understand the implications of what may be a major new sociotechnical system in the making. Some creative uses of SF are presented in a professional workshop setting. As well the article documents the use of SF as a methodological prototype in forecasting alternative scenarios of the future. SF prototyping could be a powerful tool in the social science repertoire when put into action in forecasting possible technology and business futures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It contrasts the author's vision of what life could be like in the United Kingdom in a decade's time (just as he contemplates retirement) with the simpler values of the 1980s, when he began his postgraduate career. The lyrics of the poignant 1982 Bruce Springsteen song, Highway Patrolman are used to bridge the epochs'. The prototype relocates the two main 'middle-America' characters, brothers Joe and Frank Roberts, in London in the year 2025. Much has already changed politically and socially in 'Western societies' in the intervening period up to 2012, driven by the inexorable advances of technology. As further scientific advances drive us to an anticipated paradigm change,2 one can only speculate on how society will advance, posing serious ethical dilemmas. Many of the changes will be positive. However, the story explores the potential negative consequences to the ageing population, in what appears to be a successful economy. Although somewhat pessimistic in outlook, a hopeful conclusion is that the 'ties that bind' will still predominate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

After outlining some of the main limitations of poverty line studies, the paper explains how the deprivation approach addresses these weaknesses and illustrates the insights that deprivation studies can provide into the nature of poverty in contemporary Australia. It then compares the results produced by a deprivation approach with those produced using a poverty line - both in terms of what they imply about the extent of the problem and who they suggest is most affected by it. The comparisons demonstrate that the reservations that many hold about poverty research can be overcome and that when this is done, the results become more compelling and thus have the potential to have a greater impact on anti-poverty policy.","[Saunders, Peter] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Saunders, P (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",P.Saunders@unsw.edu,,,,,,,30,7,7,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

In Australia, problems with schedule and budget overruns have been addressed through business process reforms aimed at tightening control and improving professionalism. However, studies of complex contracting in other contexts show the importance of relational factors of trust, collaboration and risk-sharing. These factors are not encouraged by the predominantly transactionally based contractual environment of Defence. Based on a detailed examination of three case studies, we suggest that there is a disjunct between the types of controls that are applied by Defence and the requirements of delivering complex, long-term projects involving multiple stakeholders. The need for both improved flexibility as well as heightened accountability is evident. We argue that balancing these values involves processes that encourage, rather than discourage, communication, risk-sharing and trust.","[Stewart, Jenny; Ablong, Tony] Univ New S Wales, Canberra, BC 2610, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Stewart, J (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Business, Canberra, BC 2610, Australia.",j.stewart@adfa.edu.au,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Under Florida rules, scores of students in several special education (ESE) and limited English proficient (LEP) categories were not included in the computation of school grades. One might expect these rules to induce F schools (that faced stigma and threat of vouchers) to strategically classify their weaker students into these excluded categories. The interplay of these rules with those of the McKay program for disabled students, however, created an interesting divergence of incentives as far as classifications into excluded LEP and ESE were concerned. Because classifying students into ESE made them eligible for McKay vouchers that were funded by public school revenue, the McKay program acted as a strong disincentive to such classification. Using a regression discontinuity strategy, I investigate whether the differences in incentives led the F schools to exhibit different behaviors as far as classifications into excluded ESE and LEP were concerned. Indeed, I find robust evidence in favor of classification into excluded LEP in high-stakes grade 4 and entry grade 3. In contrast, I do not find evidence of classification into excluded ESE.","Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Chakrabarti, R (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA.",Rajashri.Chakrabarti@ny.frb.org,,,,,,,31,9,20,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Focussing on Japan, the paper also examines whether firms' CO2 emissions are influenced by the emissions of neighbouring firms and other possible sources of spatial correlation. Results suggest that size, the capital-labour ratio, R&D expenditure, the extent of exports and concern for public profile are the key determinants of CO2 emissions. Local lobbying pressure, as captured by regional community characteristics, does not appear to play a role, however emissions are found to be spatially correlated. This raises implications for the manner in which the environmental performance of firms is modelled in future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Cole, Matthew A.; Elliott, Robert J.

We investigate the effects of this program on new vehicle sales and the environment. Using Canada as the control group in a difference-in-differences framework, we find that, of the 0.68 million transactions that occurred under the program, the program increased new vehicle sales only by about 0.37 million during July and August of 2009, implying that approximately 45 percent of the spending went to consumers who would have purchased a new vehicle anyway. Our results cannot reject the hypothesis that there is little or no gain in sales beyond 2009. The program will reduce CO2 emissions by only 9-28.2 million tons based on upper and lower bounds of the estimate of the program effect on sales, implying a cost per ton ranging from $92 to $288 even after accounting for reduced criteria pollutants.

Yet, there is an evidence of a strong cointegrating relationship among tax structure and international trade's activities.

This study points to changes in the properties of liposomes and its influence on encapsulated doxorubicin according to the content of cholesterol in the phospholipid bilayer. The influence of SDS addition to liposomal variants was also evaluated. Three variants of liposomes differing in various concentrations of cholesterol were assessed. Firstly, the toxicity of all types of liposomal doxorubicin was evaluated and it was found that the content of cholesterol increases the IC50 values of encapsulated doxorubicin in liposome. The highest concentration of cholesterol in liposome increased the IC50 value even four times compared to liposomes without cholesterol. Secondly, the new approach to compare the influence of different variants of liposomes on detection of carried doxorubicin was used using the electrochemical detection with construction of differential hydrodynamic voltammograms.","[Guran, R.] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Guran, R.; Kominkova, M.; Kopel, P.; Chudobova, D.; Zitka, O.; Adam, V.; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Kopel, P.; Zitka, O.; Adam, V.; Kizek, R.] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Mendel University in Brno; Brno University of Technology; Masaryk University Brno,"Gurán, R (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Kotlarska 2, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.",r.guran@email.cz; kizek@sci.muni.cz,"Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Guran, Roman/C-2610-2016; Kopel, Pavel/E-5711-2012; Kominkova, Marketa/D-2297-2013; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Zitka, Ondrej/L-5588-2019; Hegerova, Dagmar/J-7030-2012","Guran, Roman/0000-0002-2912-714X; Kopel, Pavel/0000-0003-4216-9544; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Zitka, Ondrej/0000-0001-7607-5058; Hegerova, Dagmar/0000-0003-0826-234X",,,,,10,0,0,0,5,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,913,918,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800161,0

A growth function is estimated, and random fluctuations in growth and recruitment are used to simulate the fishery. Three different migration models are considered: (i)deterministic, ii) stock-dependent, and iii) purely random. With deterministic migrations, the minor player has a disproportionate bargaining strength and must be offered a relatively large share of a cooperative solution. The minor player's bargaining strength is weak if the migrations into his economic zone are stock-dependent, but strong if they are purely random. The risk of extinction is shown to be high without stock-dependent unit cost of fish, and to get a viable Nash-Cournot equilibrium the major player's share must be well above one half.","Norwegian Sch Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Hannesson, R (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",rognvaldur.hannesson@nhh.no,,,Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),This research was partially funded by the Norwegian Research Council under the project International Management of Pelagic Fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic.,,20,27,27,0,24,"MRE FOUNDATION, INC",KINGSTON,"PO BOX 1828, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA",0738-1360,,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The impact of locality, year and variety on root system attributes was quantified. The amount of root biomass was always influenced significantly by year (up to 43.5%), locality (up to 19.5%) and their mutual interaction. The impact of these factors differed according to the depth of soil profile. In deeper depths the effect of variety also developed. In 2011 statistically significantly higher values of root length density (RLD) were identified in all localities. In shallow layers of soil plants produced more roots in Zelesice. Highest values of RLD were determined in the layer of 0 to 10 cm. Tendency to increase RLD in both localities and most varieties in layer of 40 to 60 cm were detected. A significant dependency of grain yield on RLD was only determined in middle layers of the soil profile. In wet year of 2010 a significant negative correlation was determined.

The resampling algorithm was thus used to generate cross-sectional distributions of alphas and t-statistics. We consider the bootstrap procedure relevant for this analysis as it does not rely on prior assumptions about the distributional properties from which individual fund alphas are drawn nor necessitates the estimation of the entire covariance matrix characterizing the joint distribution of individual funds and also allows us to deal with time-series dependencies that are due, for example, to heteroskedasticity or auto correlation in the residuals from performance multifactor models. In the estimation of excess returns we use a seven factors asset pricing model proposed by Fung and Hsieh (2004). After 1000 bootstrap iterations we can report that the performance of the top alpha hedge funds can solely be attributed to sampling variability. Our results are therefore in line with the classical view in finance that the top hedge funds are just lucky, and superior active management skills do not persist.","[Paraschiv, Dorel; Tudor, Cristiana] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Int Business & Econ Dept, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paraschiv, D (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Int Business & Econ Dept, Bucharest, Romania.",dorel.paraschiv@ase.ro; cristiana.tudor@net.ase.ro,"tudor, cristiana/A-2705-2010; Tudor, Cristiana/AGZ-0508-2022; Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/O-9071-2016","tudor, cristiana/0000-0001-6108-1666; Tudor, Cristiana/0000-0001-6108-1666; Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/0000-0002-4559-3466","CNCS-UEFISCDI [IDEI 303, PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0593]",CNCS-UEFISCDI,"This research was supported by CNCS-UEFISCDI, Project number IDEI 303, code PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0593.",,29,0,0,0,16,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

If trading screens provide traders with all the needed informational resources (including data interpretation), why do said traders constantly engage in chatter and instant messaging? These latter should be seen as time consuming, as distracting, and as increasing uncertainties. The theoretical puzzle is provided by the need to conceptualize communication as more than a set of maintenance and support functions for networks of traders, and as different from a tool used in reducing uncertainties about the future. I argue that in order to be able to act, actors need to typify transactions, based on their observable features. Typification is a collaborative activity, consisting in identifying particular, observable elements of market transactions as marks or tags characteristic for a certain type. Tags enable market participants to judge transactions as instances of particular types, along multiple criteria. Four kinds of tags are identified here: personal, agential, actional and procedural. Based on them, market actors solve action- and decision-relevant problems. The communicative engagement in typifications is a mechanism of differentiation and group building in online markets. Its investigation helps shed light on the social dynamics of electronic trading.","Kings Coll London, Dept Management, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Preda, A (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Management, Franklin Wilkins Bldg,150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",alexandru.preda@kcl.ac.uk,"Preda, Adrian/K-8889-2013; Preda, Alex/M-4625-2014","Preda, Adrian/0000-0003-3373-2438; Preda, Alex/0000-0003-2456-2713",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F038208/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F038208/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,56,16,16,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

A trail of 6 treatments was arranged in a split plot design with 3 replications. The main plots were non-burning and burning rice straw before maize planting. The sub plots were of plant density (1) 7.69 plants/m(2) (65x20 cm, 1 plant/hill), (2) 7.69 plants/m(2) (65x40 cm, 2 plants/hill) and (3) 11.54 plants/m(2) (65x20 cm, 1 plant/hill alternate 2 plants /hill). Experiment 2: To study the effects of maize cultivars and rates of organic fertilizers on grain yield. A trail of 6 treatments was arranged in a 2x3 factorial in randomized complete block design with 3 replications. The first factors were opened-pollinated and hybrid cultivars. The second factors were 3 rates of organic fertilizer at the dose 0, 375 and 1,500 kg/ha. The results of these study revealed that planting with 1 plant/hill at 20x65 cm was recommended. The highest grain yield was observed in the variant where 1,500 kg/ha of organic fertilizer was applied.

We analyze micro data on alumni giving at an anonymous research university, and focus on three types of financial aid, scholarships, loans, and campus jobs. Consistent with the view of some professional fundraisers, we allow the receipt of a given form of aid per se to affect alumni giving. Our main findings are: (1) Individuals who take out student loans are less likely to make a gift, ceteris paribus. Further, individuals who take out large loans make smaller contributions as alumni, conditional on making a gift. (2) Scholarship aid reduces the size of a gift, conditional on making a gift, but has little effect on the probability of making a donation. (3) Aid in the form of campus jobs does not have a strong effect on donative behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper contributes to the literature on non-convex ecosystem management by considering the implications of a particular behavioral response in a regional economy - that of amenity-led growth - to changes in ecosystem services generated by a lake ecosystem subject to a eutrophication threshold. The essential policy challenge is to achieve optimal levels of lake nutrients and urbanization given that improvements to water quality will induce additional migration and urbanization in the region with attendant ecological impacts. We show that policies that ignore the recursive relationship between urbanization and water quality unintentionally exacerbate boom-bust cycles of regional growth and decline and risk pushing the system towards long-run economic decline. In contrast, the optimal policy accounts for the behavioral feedbacks to improved ecosystem services, and balances regional growth and ecological degradation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We show that HCE is a multifaceted phenomenon where demographic, social, economic, technological and institutional factors all play an important role. The comparison of total, public and private HCE reveals an imbalance of European welfare toward the care of the elderly.

We argue that workers will find themselves in an age of transition driven by new technological opportunities and the feminization of the labor force. The consequences of these changes will affect the organization of future work and the concept of the work-life balance. Special attention is given to the Scandinavian models and cases, as the welfare states of the north are often regarded as being on the forefront concerning the work-life balance. We will demonstrate how aging is affecting Denmark and purport that the Scandinavian model will face significant challenges. We describe the components of worklife balance and present alternative fictionalized scenarios for future work that highlight the interplay between macroeconomics and the work-life balance.

In a dynamic general equilibrium closed economy, primary education is mandatory but there is an opportunity to continue to secondary education and beyond. High-quality education increases the returns to schooling, and hence the incentives to accumulate human capital. This is caused by two different channels: higher quality makes education accessible to more people (extensive margin), and once individuals decide to participate in higher education, higher-quality increases the investment made per individual (intensive margin). Furthermore, educational quality determines human capital composition and growth. Cross-country data evidence shows that the proposed channels are quantitatively important and that the effect of the quality and quantity of education on growth depends on the stage of development.

The empirical results based on event-time cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) and buy-and-hold abnormal returns (BHARs) show that announcing firms do not experience significant positive long-term return relative to the control firms. Moreover, using the calendar-time portfolio approach, we find the abnormal returns are significantly negative over twelve, twenty-four, and thirty-six months, suggesting stocks of firms that repurchase their shares are underperformed in the postannouncement period.

The restoration effort's economic effects are not completely understood. This study will provide the Forest Service with a framework for better communicating the biological and economic impacts of future forest plans and amendments. It also seeks to provide information on how shortleaf pine responds to different management regimes and the implicit cost to maintain the endangered red cockaded woodpecker habitat, and the economic consequences of transitioning from the traditional management regime to a regime which restores the shortleaf pine-bluestem grass ecosystem. The paper suggests by adopting the new pine-bluestem management regime, timber harvests in the pine-bluestem area decline by 25% during the 100-year simulation period, which will incur an additional implicit cost of $72/ha/year to maintain the red cockaded woodpecker habitat. An implied value for each pair of woodpeckers amounts to either $10,550 per year (for the desired 400 total pairs) or $16,880 per year (for the 250 reproducing pairs). Timber sale marking costs decline, while prescribed burning costs increase. The success of the pine-bluestem restoration requires the maintenance of a burning regime that prevents competing vegetation from occupying the middle canopy layer. Maintaining the pine-bluestem ecosystem will be difficult if environmental regulations become more stringent.

In the 1980s, similar scales were developed and tested in Sweden and Norway. These scales were, however, fairly complex and did not follow a standard procedure, thus comparison between different settings and studies was difficult. In this paper, we present ten years of experience using a simplified and standardized version of the purism scale in a Norwegian context. We provide an introduction to the purism concept and discuss relevant theoretical and empirical aspects associated with this nebulous construct. Key findings from seven of the eight studies are presented, focusing on allocation of the three purism groups (low, medium and strong purists). We take a more detailed look at the most recent study (in Rondane National Park in 2009) to validate the purism scale and construct. We conclude that our simplified scale, based on two interrelated sub-dimensions (preferences for physical facilities and social conditions) is a relevant, valid and reliable instrument for management and monitoring purposes, and that it also seems to tap a broader content of the purism construct.

Analyzing the potential of public and private policy intersection to ameliorate forest challenges in Southeast Asia,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,Forest governance; Market mechanisms; Legality verification; Forest certification; Illegal logging; Institutions,ENERGY EFFICIENCY; INSTRUMENTS; MALAYSIA,"One of the most important and pressing questions of our times is to understand better what types of governance arrangements at the local, domestic and international levels, as well as innovative non-state market driven mechanisms that might best address fundamentally important but seemingly intractable environmental, economic and social challenges. This paper sheds light on these questions by assessing the emergence of legality verification as a means to address global forest degradation. Legality verification is puzzling because it presents a relatively modest solution compared to previous efforts to build a legally binding global forest convention, global certification systems or domestic focused good forest governance initiatives, and yet it is garnering the interest of wide ranging and diverse global coalitions within developed and developing countries. Does the relatively limited scope of legality verification represent a race to the bottom in global forest regulation that many scholars assert is inevitable with the rise of economic globalization? Or, does legality verification trigger the beginning of a process that may provide institutional solutions to global forest governance in ways that previous efforts have yet to accomplish? The purpose of this paper is to offer a theoretical framework with which to guide future research on these questions. To accomplish this task we distinguish conceptually legality verification from global certification and domestic good forest governance initiatives. We then review current support in developed and developing countries, focusing our lens on coalitions supporting legality verification in the United States, European Union, and Southeast Asia. Third, inductively from this review, and deductively, we develop propositions to guide further conceptual and empirical researches focusing on the institutionalization logics of legality verification to become an authoritative arena of global forest governance, as well as its potential to reinforce, rather than detract from, global certification and good forest governance initiatives.

Without leakage, an intensity standard (regulating emissions per unit of output) is inferior clue to an implicit output subsidy. This inefficiency can be eliminated by an additional consumption tax. With leakage, an intensity standard can dominate the optimal emissions tax, since the implicit output subsidy prevents leakage. The addition of a consumption tax improves an intensity standard's efficiency, may prevent leakage, and may be efficient. Comparing intensity standards to output-based updating shows that the latter dominates if updating is sufficiently flexible. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In that study, covering 36 charter middle schools in 15 states, we found that charter schools did not affect student achievement or behavior on average, although there was substantial variation across schools. In this paper, we discuss the prevalence of oversubscribed charter schools at the time the study was conducted (the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 school years), which was lower than commonly reported. We then describe how the sample of schools that participated in the study compared to all other charter middle schools nationwide, to provide some insight into the generalizabilty of findings from lottery-based studies. In general, oversubscribed charter schools were more likely to be located in urban areas and serve a higher-achieving population of students than those without excess demand. We also describe common features of school lotteries and waitlists, and examine implications of these features for a school's ability to support a lottery-based study. Finally, we summarize lessons learned for conducting lottery-based research on charter schools, drawing on our observations of the schools' lotteries and analysis of the data from these lotteries.

This is done by confronting the demands of a deliberative public sphere with assumptions resulting from media theory and discussing it on the basis of exemplary cases from environmental and forest policy cases. A core concept of this paper is Jurgen Habermas' notion of a deliberative discourse in the public sphere, where the essential elements for a democratic ideal are openness to speakers from the periphery of the political system, a discursive communication flow and a public consensus or a result supported by the majority. Since today's political public sphere mostly comprises the media public these elements are confronted with the constraints of the media. Theoretical approaches of media studies as well as empirical examples of debates on forest, agricultural and environmental policies in the media corroborates that the media lacks the function of deliberation. Nevertheless, normative demands allow empirical findings to be interpreted relative to expectations. Applying the theoretical concept of a deliberative democracy to the empirical cases of forest, agriculture or environmental policy already serves as a first step toward awareness of deliberation in public communication. It not only can exemplify the gap between normative ideals and the empirical approach but it highlights the degree of grey between the static poles of black or white used in entitling processes as deliberative or not deliberative.

After outlining the framework's main features and development over time, we review numerous ACF applications in natural resource policy studies and relate them to existing theoretical debates. The framework accounts for long-lasting policy debates between advocacy coalitions regarding value conflicts in multitude geographical domains and political systems. However, we identify several empirical anomalies and conceptual inconsistencies regarding advocacy coalition properties and causal paths to policy change. We draw on cultural theory and veto-player theory and the empirical evidence to theorize and propose several conceptual improvements and new hypotheses. By doing so, we address the ACF's concepts of belief systems, collective action, the role of and interdependencies among external events, political resources and institutions. Our theoretical proposals could provide for more detailed, dynamic and comprehensive look at the interactions among actors and their wider political and socioeconomic environment. These theoretical enhancements could mediate between the ACF propositions and the long-lasting theoretical critique directed to this framework and the divergent empirical evidence as regards to policy change analysis. We acknowledge that the further conceptual development of the framework will depend on the willingness of ACF theorists to integrate insights from rival research programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Both types of insurance are founded on different principles. Since basic and supplementary insurance are sold by the same health insurers, both markets may interact. This paper examines to what extent basic and supplementary insurance are linked to each other and whether these links generate spillover effects of supplementary on basic insurance. Our analysis is based on an investigation into supplementary health insurance contracts, underwriting procedures and annual surveys among 1,700-2,100 respondents over the period 2006-2009. We find that health insurers increasingly use a variety of strategies to enforce a joint purchase of basic and supplementary health insurance. Despite incentives for health insurers to use supplementary insurance as a tool for risk selection in basic insurance, we find limited evidence of supplementary insurance being used this way. Only a minority of health insurers uses health questionnaires when people apply for supplementary coverage. Nevertheless, we find that an increasing proportion of high-risk individuals believe that insurers would not be willing to offer them another supplementary insurance contract. We discuss several strategies to prevent or to counteract the observed negative spillover effects of supplementary insurance.","[Roos, Anne-Fleur; Schut, Frederik T.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Roos, AF (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",roos@bmg.eur.nl; schut@bmg.eur.nl,"Schut, Frederik/D-2823-2013","Schut, Frederik/0000-0002-5748-5403",,,,,43,22,23,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Both types of behaviors will be mapped against different cultural dimensions as laid out in a theoretical framework called Hofstede (1984). The first section introduces the significance of KS and gives definitions of key concepts and the theoretical frameworks. The next section presents a culturally-oriented framework of KS behaviors. We propose that a collectivistic culture which inculcates collaborative behaviors within an organization promotes KS behavior in that organization. Paradoxically, individualistic culture that advocates competitive behaviors within an organization could either promote or hinder KS. Following that, we discuss the implications of KS for multinational corporations (MNCs) when cultural factors are taken into consideration, and the contribution of culture and knowledge sharing to the literature of knowledge management and international management.

However, how land tenure arrangements influence deforestation in Ghana's high forest zone is not well understood. Only a few studies have empirically examined the effects of land tenure on deforestation. This knowledge gap is addressed by examining the nexus between deforestation, land tenure arrangements and local rules in Ghanaian communities. Data were collected through interviews with 756 randomly selected households and analyzed using descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression techniques. Of the different tenure arrangements reported by 441 respondents, 42%, 25%, and 33% were customary freehold, sharecropping, and leasehold arrangements, respectively. Under arrangements such as sharecropping and lease-holdings, farmers who engaged in short-rotation farming systems were hesitant to undertake long-term investments, such as tree planting. In many cases from this study, the local tenure system contributes to deforestation because the rules governing land holdings create adverse effects. In dealing with this problem, policy reform is required that should target benefit sharing schemes, including future benefits from Payment for Environmental Services (PES), which until now has only benefited land owners.

The main objective of success factor research is to detect a few reliable determinants that impact on the success of an enterprise in the long term. For this study, the success of 41 traditional horticultural retail stores in southern Germany was analyzed using a number of economic indicators. Objectives like profit maximization or increasing productivity were rated much lower than maintaining high customer satisfaction, continuity of the enterprise or compatibility of work life and family. Using employee satisfaction as the intended aim, the aim-success-relationship model was able to demonstrate how the long-term commitment of sales staff, up-scale shop layout, additional customer service and high purchase frequency from regular customers increased employees' satisfaction.","[Gabriel, A.; Schoeps, J.; Menrad, K.] Univ Appl Sci, Weihenstephan Triesdorf, Germany",,"Gabriel, A (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci, Weihenstephan Triesdorf, Germany.",,"Gabriel, Andreas/HHN-3686-2022; Gabriel, Andreas/ABB-1513-2021","Gabriel, Andreas/0000-0001-5736-1593; Menrad, Klaus/0000-0003-1079-1056",,,,,11,2,2,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66050-68-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2012,930.0,,,,,,107,113,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BDT45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314782400013,0

As mainstream consumer credit has become progressively de-moralized, authoritative intervention now turns particular attention to problematizing the financial subject's freedom and autonomy, their ability to choose. The concept of over-indebtedness reveals that authorities acknowledge that the use of certain types of credit is essential for the pursuit and realization of individual consumer freedom. Nevertheless, it is also understood that certain risks potentially undermine that freedom by rendering credit consumption and other financial commitments unsustainable and un-repayable over the longer term. In response, authorities propose a range of responses to manage the risk of lost choice, including the promotion of individual financial capability and the implementation of market disclosure and responsible lending practices.","[Marron, Donncha] Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Garthdee Rd, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, Scotland",Robert Gordon University,"Marron, D (通讯作者)，Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Garthdee Rd, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, Scotland.",d.s.marron@rgu.ac.uk,,,,,,,67,33,34,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

These developments have important implications for all stakeholders involved in food supply chains, including smallholder farmers in developing countries. In an empirical analysis, a dataset of 50 Vietnamese fruit and vegetable processing firms is employed. Logistic regression models show that the type of quality assurance program (QAP) differs between OECD and non-OECD markets. While the overall probability of exports at a given QAP status does not vary much at different levels of domestic sales, the relative probability of OECD versus non-OECD exports decreases exponentially, particularly for firms with international QAPs. Consumer demand elasticities for high-value horticultural products are estimated and demand projections are made based on a survey of 499 households in Vietnam's two major cities. Disaggregated expenditure elasticities for fresh fruit and vegetables from emerging supply chains are significantly higher than the aggregate elasticity. Purchased quantities of fresh fruit and vegetables from modern retail outlets are projected to grow rapidly over the coming years. Growth is particularly high for products from modern retailers, but also for imports from non-neighbouring countries. Contingent valuation methods are used to estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) for innovative horticultural products. By employing a mediation framework that explicitly considers consumer perceptions, the potential to gain a greater understanding of food attribute valuation and the underlying psychological process is explored. Based on models considering socio-demographic and media predictors, as well as consumer perceptions as mediators, the mean WTP for the food safety attribute is estimated to be 60% higher than the current market price. The results of these studies have important implications for the industry and for rural development strategies in poor countries.","Univ Appl Sci, Southwestphalia, Germany",,"Mergenthaler, M (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci, Southwestphalia, Germany.",,"Mergenthaler, Marcus/IUQ-6314-2023; Mergenthaler, Marcus/AAD-7987-2019","Mergenthaler, Marcus/0000-0002-7485-2383",,,,,16,0,0,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66050-68-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2012,930.0,,,,,,13,26,,,,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BDT45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314782400001,0

In terrestrial ecosystems the main component of water loss is evapotranspiration. One of the standard techniques used to measure evapotranspiration indirectly is the Bowen ratio energy balance method (BREB). This study focuses on the quantification of errors caused by insufficient fetch (upwind distance from the edge of investigated cover) using data from two BREB systems obtained through intensive summer 2012 campaign. The measurement took advantage of one mobile and one fixedly positioned BREB systems employed at turf grass cover from the prevailing north-west wind direction surrounded by broadleaved trees, poplar stoolbed dirty road and buildings at experimental station in Domaninek near Bystrice nad Pernstejnem. Surprisingly, the results showed no significant systematic deviation between the reference BREB with sufficient 180 m long fetch and mobile BREB positioned at fetches between 10 to 100 m. Moreover, it was not found any impact of the fetch on non-systematic errors leading to the conclusion that the fetch did not have any effect on the overall data quality and consistency. One of the explanations may be very similar response to soil moisture conditions of the selected contrasting living ecosystems and thus their similar Bowen ratios.","[Poznikova, G.; Trnka, M.; Fischer, M.; Orsag, M.; Zalud, Z.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Trnka, M.; Fischer, M.; Orsag, M.; Zalud, Z.] Global Change Res Ctr ASCR, Vvi, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Pozníková, G (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",g.poznikova@gmail.com,"Orság, Matěj/G-9765-2014; Fischer, Milan/H-3996-2014; Poznikova, Gabriela/G-1897-2014; Fischer, Milan/GXZ-9833-2022; Zalud, Zdenek/G-3203-2014; Trnka, Miroslav/F-9428-2014","Zalud, Zdenek/0000-0003-1882-9901; Trnka, Miroslav/0000-0003-4727-8379",,,,,11,1,1,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,493,503,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200060,0

The results revealed that the metropolises, which were living in the big city like Jakarta and were assumedly sufficient-educated, were not illusion free on transaction.

This was followed by field study in the regions, on the basis of which information obtained before have been modified or added. The interviews were conducted with the representatives of municipalities and the questionnaire survey with residents. All regions are losing population, population is aging and there is a high unemployment rate. People have to commute to work even over long distances. The preliminary results of the questionnaire survey show, that the majority of the respondents still use plants to prepare meals, drinks and for treatment and decorative purposes. People at least occasionally collect the plants in nature. People received the information about these plants from literature or from their grandparents. People have very positive attitude to collection of wild plants and they would like to know more new information about it. The most popular recipes for homemade products are honey of dandelions, syrup of plantain or of elderflower, stuffing and spinach of nettle and rosehip tea. The existing research shows, that in the regions, where the traditions are preserved, there is a strengthened regional identity among people and it leads to the establishment of local communities. Then these groups are able to organize various regional events, which contribute to the visibility of the region.

But there is limited understanding about forest agencies' role in the adoption of new governance modes and their contribution to policy delivery. By drawing on a qualitative implementation study of Bavaria's Mountain Forest Initiative in locally-operating forest agencies, the present paper addresses these gaps. The government wants them to establish collaborative arrangements with various stakeholders to facilitate measures for adaptation to climate change in private forests. The cross-case comparison provides detailed empirical insights into distinct sets of activities for making the initiative 'work'. Stakeholder participation gains a firm basis at the local level if forest agencies develop interest in and generate ownership of prospects for collaborative planning, and tailor these to their needs. The study suggests, however, that involvement of local stakeholders in forest planning is not necessarily instrumental for delivery of effective policies, as reliance on the local level entails the risk that the broader picture of initial policy goals gets lost.

The challenge is thus finding ways to turn this wealth into development opportunities. For many rural people in central Mozambique, artisanal gold mining is the most direct source of income and this is most likely to remain so. Drawing on our personal experiences, we reflect on the future of artisanal gold mining in Mozambique. The government's strategy consists of promoting improved technologies and encouraging artisanal miners to establish themselves as businesses by creating miners associations. This has proved successful where the ore allows for sufficiently long exploitation, in practice, where reef gold occurs. The same cannot be said, however, of colluvial or alluvial deposits, where placer gold is mined. Given the variable nature of these deposits, accompanying mining activities are relatively short-lived at such sites. In these cases, local authorities and community representatives must play an expanded role in enforcing good mining practices. Doing so would be in line with the country's current decentralisation and democratisation policies in relation to rural development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We take this as evidence of growing influence of private financial constraints on decisions to attend college as tuition costs have risen and the relative importance of government subsidies has declined. The main policy implication of our results is that labor and education reform without concomitant capital market reform and government support for the financially disadvantaged exacerbates increases in inequality inherent in elimination of the traditional wage-grid.

Data are drawn from interviews with key actors in the REDD + process and an extensive critical review of policy documents and deforestation estimates. We find that research over the past 50 years has not resulted in accurate estimates of forest cover and deforestation rates, nor have major deforestation drivers been convincingly documented. Estimates are difficult to compare due to inconsistent use of key terms, methodological pluralism and differences in social framing. We argue that an epistemic community is able to influence production, circulation, and application of deforestation related knowledge. Furthermore, in a situation of weak and contradictory empirical evidence, this community is arguably able to sustain a deforestation discourse centred on high forest loss and neo-Malthusian causal explanations. This is done through mechanisms making it difficult to separate facts from politics, e.g. by black boxing the origin and units of measure of deforestation estimates. We argue that this makes it more difficult to realise positive outcomes through REDO + implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

First, regardless of regime, we observe a negative contemporaneous correlation between the VKOSPI and KOSPI 200. Second, while the KOSPI 200 generally leads the VKOSPI under normal market conditions (lower regime), this relationship is overturned when market volatility measured by the VKOSPI level is extremely high (upper regime). Third, in the TVECM framework, the effects of lagged VKOSPI on the KOSPI 200 are positive only in the upper regime, while the effects of lagged KOSPI 200 on the VKOSPI are positive only in the lower regime; this cannot be explained by the traditional framework of an asymmetric volatility phenomenon. Fourth, the KOSPI 200 exhibits greater sensitivity to implied volatility shocks in the upper regime than it does to those in the lower regime.","[Lee, Jaeram] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Financial econ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Financial econ, Seoul, South Korea.",sadsoul87@business.kaist.ac.kr; sharpjin@skku.edu,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean government [NRF-2013S1A5A2A03045406],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"Jaeram Lee (sadsoul87@business.kaist.ac.kr) is a Ph.D. candidate in finance at the College of Business, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea.

Specifically, the article examines the establishment of the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) during the 1940s. The UJA provided donors with an institutional setting within which the nation became relevant. Through participation in UJA events, the Jewish nation turned into a more practicable and meaningful category for donors. Interestingly, rather than simply emphasizing the unity of the nation, the UJA engaged in simultaneous marking and blurring of the boundaries between different groups of Jews.

We conclude by providing a set of policy recommendations as well as suggestions for future research inquiries.","[Pinheiro, Romulo] Univ Agder, Dept Polit Sci & Management, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway; [Geschwind, Lars] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Learning, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Aarrevaara, Timo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Agder; Royal Institute of Technology; University of Helsinki,"Pinheiro, R (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Dept Polit Sci & Management, Gimlemoen 25, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway.",romulo.m.pinheiro@uia.no; larsges@kth.se; timo.aarrevaara@helsinki.fi,,"Aarrevaara, Timo/0000-0002-4412-1360",,,,,91,36,37,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Pharmaceutical manufacturers have to submit a benefit dossier for evaluation by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). A final decision is made by the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA). The aim of this investigation was to analyse the outcomes 18 months after introduction of the new legislation and to identify critical areas requiring further discussion and development. All EBAs commenced prior to June 2012 were included. The G-BA website was used to obtain manufacturers' benefit dossiers, IQWiG assessments, and G-BA decisions. Four areas of interest were analysed: levels of additional benefit, appropriate comparative therapy (ACT), patient-relevant endpoints, and adverse events. Twenty-seven EBAs were analysed. IQWiG stated a benefit in 50 % of EBAs, whereas G-BA stated a benefit in 63 %, but only in 50 % of identified subgroups and 40 % of patients involved. In 12 EBAs, the ACT suggested by G-BA differed from the comparator used in phase III trials. The G-BA reported no benefits on health-related quality of life. Discrepancies arose in morbidity outcomes such as 'progression-free survival' and 'sustained virological response'. Categorisation and balancing of adverse events was conducted within various assessments. Considerable variance was observed in the levels of additional benefit reported by pharmaceutical manufacturers, IQWiG and G-BA. The areas of disagreement included ACT selection, definition of subgroups and patient-relevant endpoints, and classification and balancing of adverse events.","[Ruof, Joerg] Roche Pharma AG, D-79639 Grenzach Wyhlen, Germany; [Ruof, Joerg; Schwartz, Friedrich Wilhelm] Med Sch Hanover, Hannover, Germany; [Schulenburg, J. -Matthias] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Dintsios, Charalabos-Markos] German Assoc Res Based Pharmaceut Co Vfa, Berlin, Germany; [Dintsios, Charalabos-Markos] Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Publ Hlth, Dusseldorf, Germany",Roche Holding; Leibniz University Hannover; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Ruof, J (通讯作者)，Roche Pharma AG, Emil Barrell Str 1, D-79639 Grenzach Wyhlen, Germany.",joerg.ruof@roche.com,,"Dintsios, Charalabos-Markos/0000-0003-3469-092X",,,,,11,60,61,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

To do this we use a sharp regression discontinuity design. We show that scholarships have substantial effects on school attainment. By the time children would have been in grade 11 had they remained in school, two years after they stopped being eligible for scholarships, those who were offered scholarships have attained 0.6 more grades of completed schooling.

However, CUAsinformed by local evidence are often unavailable, and the cost-effectiveness of the several currently reimbursed biologicals is unclear. Aim To estimate the cost-effectiveness as multiples of per capita GDP/quality adjusted life years (QALY) of four biologicals (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab) currently reimbursed in six CEE countries in six inflammatory rheumatoid and bowel disease conditions. Methods Systematic literature review of published cost-utility analyses in the selected conditions, using the United Kingdom (UK) as reference country and with study selection criteria set to optimize the transfer of results to the CEEs. Prices in each CEE country were pro-rated against UK prices using purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP, and local GDP per capita/QALY ratios estimated. Results Central and Eastern European countries list prices were 144-333 % higher than pro rata prices. Out of 85 CUAs identified by previous systematic literature reviews, 15 were selected as a convenience sample for estimating the cost-effectiveness of biologicals in the CEE countries in terms of per capita GDP/QALY. Per capita GDP/QALY values varied from 0.42 to 6.4 across countries and conditions (Bulgaria: 0.97-6.38; Czech Republic: 0.42-2.76; Hungary: 0.54-3.54; Poland: 0.59-3.90; Romania: 0.77-5.07; Slovakia: 0.55-3.61). Conclusion While results must be interpreted with caution, calculating pro rata (cost-effective) prices and per capita GDP/QALY ratios based on CUAs can aid reimbursement decision-making in the absence of analyses using local data.","[Gulacsi, Laszlo; Rencz, Fanni; Pentek, Marta; Brodszky, Valentin; Hever, Noemi V.; Baji, Petra] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Rencz, Fanni] Semmelweis Univ, Doctoral Sch Clin Med, H-1085 Budapest, Hungary; [Pentek, Marta] Flor Ferenc Cty Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, H-2143 Kistarcsa, Hungary; [Lopert, Ruth] George Washington Univ, Dept Hlth Policy, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Lopert, Ruth] LW Hlth Policy Consulting, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Corvinus University Budapest; Semmelweis University; George Washington University,"Gulácsi, L (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",laszlo.gulacsi@uni-corvinus.hu,"Péntek, Márta/HTQ-3097-2023; Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023; Brodszky, Valentin/AFN-4112-2022; Baji, Petra/JHV-1617-2023","Péntek, Márta/0000-0001-9636-6012; Brodszky, Valentin/0000-0002-6095-2295; Baji, Petra/0000-0003-2899-8557; Lopert, Ruth/0000-0002-0882-4288; Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746",,,,,36,12,12,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

To that end, we extend the Great Fish War model of Levhari and Mirman (1980) to a learning environment in which several agents interact strategically and learn about the distribution of the stochastic evolution of the resource. We find that the effect of anticipation of learning with heterogeneous beliefs is twofold. First, the anticipation of learning makes future payoffs more uncertain, which induces the agents to decrease present exploitation due to the precautionary motive. Second, under heterogeneity of beliefs, there is a differential informational externality that induces the agents to increase or decrease present exploitation. We also perform a comparative analysis on the Cournot-Nash equilibrium with learning by studying the effect of optimism and riskiness on resource exploitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The best performing NMS-11 country in the forestry industry trade with the enlarged EU-27 is Cyprus with a trade surplus mostly based on finished or at least semi-finished wood products. The results suggest a convergence in the forestry industry trade specialisation of the NMS-11 countries. A significant variation in the mobility of the forestry industry trade specialisation is found, but with a deterioration in forestry industry trade specialisation patterns over time. The results suggest the crucial role that the wood-processing and furniture industries can play with finished wood products and their backward linkages to raw wood and semi-finished wood products for forestry industry competitiveness. Forestry industry management should focus on better quality and greater trade competitiveness in the vertical wood industry supply chains from lower to higher value-added and marketed wood products.

The results show that in developing countries with relatively higher financial development, firm internationalization corresponds with a greater level of debt when firms have more growth opportunities (which also indicate a higher level of asymmetric information). This evidence suggests that relatively developed financial markets in developing countries at least partially mitigate the effect of asymmetric information and decrease the agency cost of debt for firms with higher levels of internationalization.","[Gonenc, Halit] Univ Groningen, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Gonenc, H (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, Groningen, Netherlands.",h.gonenc@rug.nl; daniel.j.de.haan@gmail.com,"Gonenc, Halit/K-2728-2019","Gonenc, Halit/0000-0003-2047-5225",,,,,22,8,11,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

To explore these channels, we exploit the randomized timing of the arrival of the 2008 Economic Stimulus Payments. We find that the payments raised the probability of an adult emergency department visit over the following 23 weeks by an average of 1.1 percent. This effect is difficult to reconcile with the Permanent Income Hypothesis. We observe little impact on avoidable hospitalizations or emergency visits for nonurgent conditions and no difference in effects as a function of health insurance coverage. By contrast, we show that the increase is driven by visits for urgent medical conditions, like drug- and alcohol-related visits. Complementary evidence suggests that consumers are not simply substituting from outpatient doctor visits to hospital care. The results thus suggest that liquidity constraints may not constitute a direct barrier to care, but rather that liquidity can increase health care utilization indirectly by increasing the need for care.","[Gross, Tal] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Gross, Tal; Tobacman, Jeremy] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tobacman, Jeremy] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania,"Gross, T (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA.",tg2370@columbia.edu; tobacman@wharton.upenn.edu,,"Tobacman, Jeremy/0000-0003-2905-577X",,,,,19,16,25,1,10,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

The labour discussed relates to the exertions of artists to make places for themselves and their practices within the field of cultural production. It is what Bourdieu has described as a 'specific labour' in relation to milieu. Drawing on Florian Znaniecki's philosophical and sociological work as a means of engaging with the multidimensional cultural values involved, this study found that the interviewed artists laboured across four realms of cultural production. Artists laboured in order to (1) define their practices, (2) create the conditions under which they can continue to practice, (3) attract validations of their practices and artistic identities and all the while they actively laboured to (4) maintain their integrity as an important creative and social resource. These four realms of production are integrated in a dynamic system where artists' efforts in each impact on and influences the products of the others. Over the course of this article, it will be argued that the labour of professional visual art practice can be, and must be, understood across a number of dimensions and systems of cultural values.","Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Commun & Arts, Perth, WA 6050, Australia",Edith Cowan University,"McKay, D (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Commun & Arts, 2 Bradford St, Perth, WA 6050, Australia.",dmckay0@our.ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,55,2,2,2,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

TAP is a comprehensive school reform model designed to attract highly effective teachers, improve instructional effectiveness, and elevate student achievement. We use a panel data set to estimate a TAP treatment effect by comparing student test score gains in mathematics in schools that participated in TAP with student test score gains in non-TAP schools. Ordinary least squares estimation reveals a positive TAP treatment effect on student test score gains in the elementary grades, with weaker but still positive point estimates in the secondary grades. When estimation methods control for selection bias, the positive effect remains at the elementary level, but most estimates for grades 6 through 10 turn negative. Our findings are qualified by the lack of information on the fidelity of implementation across TAP schools and on variation in features of TAP programs at the school level.","[Springer, Matthew G.] Vanderbilt Univ, Natl Ctr Performance Incent, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Ballou, Dale; Peng, Art (Xiao)] Vanderbilt Univ, Natl Ctr Performance Incent, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College,"Springer, MG (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Natl Ctr Performance Incent, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",matthew.g.springer@vanderbilt.edu; dale.ballou@vanderbilt.edu; xiao.peng@vanderbilt.edu,,"Springer, Matthew/0000-0001-9759-0999",,,,,17,7,10,0,4,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Two surveys were conducted - the working age population survey (n-1008) and the survey of municipality development planning experts (n-67). The survey led to the conclusion that there was a close and intense flow of population movement from cities to rural areas and vice versa. The most significant causes of the movement are visiting, entertainment, services, and employment. Taking into account the fact that public services are located mostly in urban areas, municipalities establish mutual partnership in several spheres, for example, education, culture, employment, health care etc. Improvements in the public transport network accessibility as well as the quality of roads will promote rural - urban interaction and provide equal living conditions for inhabitants in both rural and urban areas.","[Bulderberga, Zane] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,zane.bulderberga@llu.lv,"Vitolina, Zane/AAF-4767-2019",,,,,,16,0,0,2,17,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-2-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,35,,,,,156,163,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347133500017,0

On overall, the fiscal policy changes will be reflected in macroeconomic variables, such as GDP, government budget, government debt and also foreign direct investment (FDI). The 2007 financial crisis had a major impact on all economies and each country has applied several fiscal policy measures in order to stabilize their economies. This paper aims to analyze the impact of fiscal policy on FDI for Central and Eastern European countries (EU members) in the context of the recent global crisis. The crisis had a major impact on economic activity of the region, although the magnitude of the impact differed notably, depending on the characteristics of each country economy. In order to highlight this, we use a regression model and panel data methodology, trying to find the most important fiscal policy instruments that influenced the level of FDI for the analyzed countries. The results will be very useful if there is a pattern for different countries regarding the power of a specific fiscal policy instrument in influencing the FDI flows.

Escalating competition in a globalize market, expanding a markets, shrinking corporate resources, rapid shifts in technology, and the recruitment and retention of talented and skilled people are just a few of these challenges.

Today's knowledge is a commodity and a strategic resource of knowledge-intensive organisations and it is effective Management is critical for competiveness. The companies had to face it with the changes and developing their Knowledge Management with the challenges of the modern world. This paper studies the relationship between the classic and new concept of Knowledge Management. The best way to transfer knowledge is an e-learning and m-learning. By using e-learning and m-learning approach means to improve technological solutions in the company and structure of organisation is also important. First of all, need to be concentrate on organisational solutions ( culture, behaviour, HRM) in order to support existing practice that can lead to stronger communication and cooperation between employees, which are the roots of personalisation approach. So, it need to be develop IT solutions in order to support geographically dispersed employees, which are unable to communicate in an effective way. That is the rule of sociotechnical system is true in these cases even if a company concentrates on technological solutions, it has to create the organisational background of the usability. Leadership and cultural change are basic factors of change processes that are also basic enablers of Knowledge Management activities. If companies have successfully developed their initial knowledge management program, will last for, at least, several years. The leadership has to be realised that old solutions are not last forever, and without the help of conscious change management, these achievements could be lost.","[Genzic, Jasna; Grgic, Ivan; Gujic, Martina] Visoka Poslovna Skola Libertas, Kennedyev Trg 6a, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Genzic, J (通讯作者)，Visoka Poslovna Skola Libertas, Kennedyev Trg 6a, Zagreb, Croatia.",jasna.genzic@gmail.com; ivan.grgic@windowslive.com; martina@vps-libertas.hr,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,548,560,,,,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000054,0

With three real discount rates; 5%, 7% and 9%, we found that landowners would find short rotation biomass plantations attractive when the stumpage price is approximately $10.50 ton(-1) on a Piedmont site with a 14-year rotation and approximately $13.50 ton(-1) on a Coastal Plain site with a 9-year rotation.

The idea of a flat tax, i.e. a tax levied at a single rate, has become an increasingly discussed and implemented fiscal strategy across Europe and the rest of the world afterwards. However, despite some general similarities, the taxation system differs across the Baltic States which has led to the aim of the present research to study the income taxation trends in the Baltic States. The research leads to the conclusion that the Estonian tax system is one of the most liberal and simplest systems even in the world. The most rational income taxes among the Baltic States are observed in Lithuania (15% both CIT and PIT). Estonia and Lithuania have the same PIT and CIT rates, while Latvia applies the most severe PIT rate (24%). Changes in tax revenues and government expenditure occur automatically with a change in the economic situation. This means that the application of fiscal policy instruments may either hinder or promote the tax system development and respectively the development of income taxation. Hence, the basic difference in the taxation systems of the Baltic States include the calculation and application of the tax-exempt minimum, tax reliefs, and flexibility of the system to the changing economic conditions.","[Mazure, Gunita; Viksne, Dace] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,Gunita.Mazure@llu.lv,"Mazure, Gunita/AAA-7586-2020","Mazure, Gunita/0000-0002-3722-9437",,,,,17,2,2,0,3,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-0-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,33,,,,,34,44,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347130400003,0

In this respect, the research methodology is based on closely analysing the regulations mentioned above and determining the similarity and dissimilarity coefficients, in order to assess the progress of national accounting regulations in converging with the International Accounting Standard. This study provides statistical evidence that the level of convergence between the national and international accounting treatment for lease transactions achieved in 2011 is 22% in terms of complexity and requirements imposed by the six criteria analysed in the research. In addition, by calculating the coefficients of similarity and dissimilarity for each criterion, the study demonstrates that the recognition of a financial lease is the criterion with the greatest similarity coefficients and the lease disclosure differs totally in the two regulations. This study contributes to the development of lease accounting and literature in the field, considering that it is a topic that is very much debated in the later years by the inclusion in the agendas of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) of a joint project regarding accounting for these transactions.

The objective of this paper is to provide some empirical evidence of the ambiguous relation between elections and fiscal policy in Romania over the period 1999:Q1 - 2013:Q3. The methodological innovation of this paper is that we exploit whether Romanian fiscal policy or monetary policy is more effective in influencing growth, in the electoral context. According to the results fiscal policy indirectly influences the dynamics of voter turnout, through economic growth. The dynamics of economic growth in Romania is significantly clarified by the fiscal policy, with a lag of one period.","[Moldovan, Nicoleta-Claudia; Lobont, Oana-Ramona] West Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania; [Hatmanu (Gagea), Mariana] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",West University of Timisoara; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Moldovan, NC (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania.",nicoleta.moldovan@e-uvt.ro; mariana.gagea@uaic.ro; oana.lobont@e-uvt.ro,"Lobont, Oana-Ramona/AAP-8584-2020; Hatmanu, Mariana/AAY-7186-2020; Lobont, Oana Ramona/AHA-3609-2022; Moldovan, Nicoleta Claudia/ADP-3323-2022","Lobont, Oana Ramona/0000-0002-2942-3715; Moldovan, Nicoleta Claudia/0000-0002-1916-2638",,,,,37,3,3,0,16,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Starting with year 2012, Romania imposed trough its national regulatory body (the Ministry of Finance) the presentation of individual financial statements according to IERS for 67 Romanian listed companies. The main concern has been to understand the most important differences between national accounting rules and IFRS and how these could affect their reported performance. The goal of the paper is to address this concern by highlighting some empirical evidence of the differences between Romanian accounting regulation and IFRS. These differences are identified in the reconciliation of shareholders' equity and net income of the Romanian listed companies in order to present the significant impacts of the conversion to IERS. The conclusion of this study is that for all 67 companies, presented in our study, the application of IFRS had a small effect on net income and shareholders' equity. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Different authors have proved, in theoretical as well as empirical approaches, the relation between some indicators of innovation performance and volume and performance of high-tech exports. In this paper, we intend to assess, at the European level, the relationship between medium and high-tech exports, on one hand, and some of the main determinants of innovation, on the other hand. The volume of research-development expenditure, both public and private, the human resources employed in knowledge intensive activities or the propensity for international commercial relation have been assumed as important causal factors for increasing high tech export in EU countries. The results of the econometric analysis conducted in this paper confirm a causal relationship between the independent variables mentioned above and the EU high-tech exports level. The specific variations at country level are also displayed. Research results also confirm a positive correlation between total R& D expenditure volume and the level of high-tech exports, with variability between countries. The influence of private R& D expenditure on high-tech exports is stronger than public R& D expenditure. Under current European and national policies for increasing the intensity of R& D funding, raising the average EU level of R& D expenditure to the target of 3% of GDP, and particularly the EU average of private R& D expenditure to 2% of GDP, may significantly boost exports and competitiveness. Romanian export policy and R& D and innovation policy should be correlated in order to maximize effects in both policy fields. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

Each factor, sub factor and degree of intensity receives a score reflecting its relative importance. In order to obtain a hierarchy of the work positions, each factor is ordered according to its importance for each key position, receiving a rank from I to V, the prior reflecting a higher placement of the position in relation to that factor.

While it is widely recognized that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other countries successfully developed with strong government intervention in their economies, the rise of neoliberalism in recent years has called into question whether the concept of the developmental state is still relevant, whether it is still a workable model of development and, perhaps most interestingly, whether any truly developmental states still exist. This paper enters into this debate and concludes that the developmental state is not only still possible, but that China provides a successful modern example of a developmental state. It also demonstrates that although the paradox of competition between developed and developing countries in the global market makes uncertainty for China, the Chinese government has been successful in managing the transition to becoming a participant in the global economy. As long as the government can struggle to maintain its agenda and make certain reforms, China will not only survive in global economy, but also promote the transformation through external pressure of globalization.","[Sun, Chenguang; Zhang, Tianzi] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Int Studies, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Sun, CG (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Int Studies, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",chengusun2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; 923819690@qq.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-9311-1,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2014,31.0,,,,,,29,34,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC8FB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000355588400005,0

The improved GM(1,1) can take full advantage of new information in sequence of raw data for a small sample size prediction. The predicted energy intensities are derived from the prediction of applying the improved GM(1,1) model. And the energy savings are obtained from the differences of predicted energy consumption and actual energy consumption from 1999 to 2004. From the results we can find that in the beginning of implemented energy policies the energy consumption grows slowly and energy savings effects are obvious. However, the actual energy consumption has exceeded the predicted energy consumption in terms of results in this paper in 2004. This phenomenon represents that the energy policies has reached the best effects and some new energy savings policies should be formulated to keep both economic growth and energy savings sustainable. Our analysis in this paper is consistent with the decision-making of Chinese government. In the end of 2004 the medium and long term specific schema on energy savings is formulated and some other energy savings measures have been formulated to achieve the goal in the specific schema from 2004.","[Wang, Yuhong] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Wang, YH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wyh2003@gmail.com; tangjianrong703@163.com; xiaozhongli1127@sina.com; sfliu@nuaa.edu.cn,"tang, jia-rong/HZH-8860-2023; Wang, Yuhong/B-3759-2008","Wang, Yuhong/0000-0002-8549-7495",National Project for Education Science Planning [EFA110351],National Project for Education Science Planning,This paper is partially supported by the National Project for Education Science Planning (EFA110351).,,14,1,1,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Infants were followed from the age of 5 weeks until 3 years of age. During this time, the number of children with AD who were treated with verum or placebo was observed at eight visits. Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed at different time points. A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial performed in Germany included 606 newborns. After randomization, n = 303 patients were classified in the placebo group and n = 303 in the verum group. A total of 119 participants left the study, so data from n = 250 patients of the placebo group and n = 237 patients of the verum group were available for analysis. At the beginning of the study, newborns were treated prophylactically with bacterial lysate or placebo for 26 weeks. After this, children were observed until the age of 3 years. A systematic literature research was done to evaluate treatment costs of atopic eczema in newborn/small children. Finally, 17 publications were included and checked for searched treatment costs of AD. A study was then initiated to evaluate the direct costs to statutory health insurance. Based on the described clinical trial, a decision tree model was developed. Using the evaluated direct costs and prevalence according to the clinical trial, the developed model can be used in cost-effectiveness analyses. The focus of the analyses was on the subgroup single heredity for atopy in clinical trials. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed an advantage for bacterial lysate after 3 years. To further support this result a model extension was executed; the model was expanded from 3 to 6 years. Cost-effectiveness of bacterial lysate was also proven after 6 years. Prophylactic treatment with bacterial lysate of infants with single heredity for atopy for 26 weeks in the 1st year of life is cost-effective at the age of 3 and 6 years, i.e. prophylactic use of bacterial lysate generated lower costs by leading to lower prevalence compared to placebo.","[Kiencke, Peter; Viehmann, Kristina; Rychlik, Reinhard] Inst Empir Hlth Econ, D-51399 Burscheid, Germany",,"Kiencke, P (通讯作者)，Inst Empir Hlth Econ, Ziegelfeld 28, D-51399 Burscheid, Germany.",peter.kiencke@ifeg.de,,,,,,,15,6,8,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Further sub-group analysis of etanercept treatment was performed. Patient level data were obtained from three regions of the Swedish Rheumatology Registers. The dataset contained 2,558 patients who had started TNF-inhibitor treatment, 1,049 with etanercept as their first biological treatment. A total of 819 patients had switched to a second TNF-inhibitor, of which 425 to etanercept. A Markov cohort model was used in which health states of disease severity were classified according to HAQ and DAS28. Disease progression and discontinuation rates of TNF-inhibitors were based on the registry and for the comparator on published literature. Mortality, costs and utilities were based on Swedish data. The main analysis had a societal perspective over 20 years and efficacy was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). TNF-inhibitor treatment was associated with an increase in QALYs and an incremental cost compared to no biological treatment. The cost per QALY gained with the three TNF-inhibitors ranged from a,not sign50,000 to a,not sign120,000, with lower estimates for TNF-inhibitors used in combination with MTX and as a first biologic. At a progression of 0.045 for the comparator, most values remain within the accepted range for cost-effectiveness. These results demonstrate that the cost per QALY for TNF-inhibitors was higher than in previous assessments based on registry data and that the results were sensitive to the HAQ progression of the comparator.","[Lekander, Ingrid; Borgstrom, Fredrik; Lindblad, Staffan] Karolinska Inst, LIME MMC, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lekander, Ingrid; Borgstrom, Fredrik] I3 Innovus, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lysholm, Jorgen] Dept Rheumatol Falu Lasarett, Falun, Sweden; [van Vollenhoven, Ronald F.] Karolinska Inst, Unit Clin Therapeut Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindblad, Staffan] Karolinska Inst, Rheumatol Unit, Stockholm, Sweden; [Geborek, Pierre] Lund Univ, Dept Rheumatol, Lund, Sweden; [Kobelt, Gisela] European Hlth Econ, Speracedes, France",Karolinska Institutet; i3 Innovus; Falun Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska Institutet; Lund University,"Lekander, I (通讯作者)，Rostvingevagen 33, S-14137 Huddinge, Sweden.",ingrid.lekander@ki.se,"van Vollenhoven, Ronald/ABE-1244-2021",,,,,,35,16,16,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Because of intermittency and the composition of other generators in the power system, the value of certain renewable particularly wind and solar - varies across locations and technologies. This paper investigates the implications of this heterogeneity for the cost effectiveness of renewable electricity policies. A simple model of the power system shows that renewable electricity policies cause different investment mixes. Policies also differ according to their effect on electricity prices, and both factors cause the cost effectiveness to vary across policies. We use a detailed, long-run planning model that accounts for intermittency on an hourly basis to compare the cost effectiveness for a range of policies and alternative parameter assumptions. The differences in cost effectiveness are economically significant, where broader policies, such as an emissions price, outperform renewable electricity policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

I argue that the decision to invest pits current consumption against future consumption, both of which accumulate to the private decision maker. Public projects, on the other hand, provide benefits that accrue to society in general. To examine the appropriateness of discount rates based on returns to private investment, this paper considers lab experiments designed to test whether individuals discount personal and social benefits at different rates. Personal benefits are captured through personal monetary payments, while social benefits are captured through anonymous donations to charitable organizations.

To determine the excess or slack carbon dioxide emissions of individual countries, the total carbon dioxide emissions of every country are adjusted for international trade to account for carbon dioxide out-sourcing and carbon sequestration by forests and forest products to arrive at their net carbon dioxide emissions. Countries with above the global average in net per capita carbon dioxide emissions have excess emissions. Those with below the global average have slack emissions. Total excess or slack carbon dioxide emissions are determined by multiplying the per capita excess or slack per capita emissions by its population. They then pay into or get compensated from the Green Climate Fund based on their respective excess or slack carbon dioxide emissions. Based on the total excess carbon dioxide emission figures from 2009 and $10 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions, major excess emission countries and the amount of money they would pay into the Green Climate Fund are the U.S. $40.8 billion, Japan $7.8 billion, U.K. $5.1 billion, Canada $4.7 billion, Germany $4.6 billion, and Russia $42 billion. China, for the first time, also would become an excess emission country and would pay $446 million, thus obliterating the artificial separation between developed and developing countries and removing a major stumbling block in climate change negotiations. Major slack emission countries and the amount of money they would earn from the Green Climate Fund are India $3.7 billion, Pakistan $645 million, Bangladesh $626 million, Nigeria $433 million, Ethiopia $358 million, the Philippines $351 million and Vietnam $333 million. The incentives created by the proposed solution would propel all countries to focus on controlling or lowering their total global carbon dioxide emissions. Excess emission countries have incentives to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions to lower their payments. Slack countries also have incentives to lower or limit their emissions, if they want to keep earning money over time. When the price of carbon dioxide emissions is high enough, its impact on the global carbon dioxide emissions would be significant. Furthermore, as a dynamic system, every year the price set for carbon dioxide emissions would depend on how quickly the total global carbon dioxide emissions are being reduced through conservation efforts and technical innovations. Once the price is set, there is total transparency. Every country will know exactly how much it would either pay into or earn from the Green Climate Fund, sparing rich countries from haggling over how much each will pay and poor countries over how much each will earn.

Rather than selecting as inputs a few variables, it integrates the maximum amount of available information via the use of correspondence analysis (CA). Efficiency is estimated at the individual level via corrected ordinary least squares and is then regressed on explanatory variables obtained again via correspondence analysis. Unobserved school effects are taken into account by estimating a random effect model. Finally, using the so-called Shapley decomposition, we determine the exact impact on individual efficiency of each of the factors that are considered as determinants of this efficiency.

This paper discusses the need of new frontiers of forest economics, provides an overview of the special issue, and presents thoughts about new frontiers. The paper suggests that all knowledge of forest economists is conjectural, and without the competition of contradictorily theories forest economics sinks into intellectual poverty. The progress of forest economics will need a never ending fabrication on new and venturous theories for solving problems and strong attempts to refute, to critically assess and discuss, and to test empirically the new theories.

The objective of this article is to investigate the determinants of inefficiency. We use a stochastic frontier approach that allows the estimation of a production function and an inefficiency function. The sources of inefficiency can be separated into temporary shocks and factors that lead to permanent efficiency differences. The results indicate an improvement in technical efficiency over time. This improvement can partly be explained by a restructuring of the industry, with firms becoming bigger and more specialized, as well as by improvements in government regulations. The inefficiency that is still present is mainly the result of temporary shocks. Disease outbreaks seem to be the most important of these temporary shocks, as disease problems lead to early harvesting or destruction of the fish and thereby, obviously, increase inefficiency.","[Asche, Frank; Roll, Kristin H.] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",frank.asche@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728",Norwegian Research Council; Norwegian Seafood Research Fund,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Norwegian Seafood Research Fund,"Thanks to Ragnar Tveteras and two reviewers for helpful comments, and to the Norwegian Research Council and the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund for financial support.

This paper presents an analysis of consumer response to an advisory for sustainable seafood adopted by a regional supermarket in the United States. The advisory consisted of a label in which one of three traffic light colors was placed on each fresh seafood product to inform consumers about its relative environmental sustainability. Green meant best choice, yellow meant proceed with caution, and red meant worst choice. Using a unique product-level panel scanner data set of weekly sales and taking advantage of the random phase-in of the advisory by the retailer, we apply a difference-in-differences identification strategy to estimate the effect of the advisory on overall seafood sales as well as the heterogeneous impact of the advisory by label color and whether the seafood met additional health-related criteria. We find evidence that the advisory led to a statistically significant 15.3% decline in overall seafood sales, a statistically significant 34.9% decline in the sale of yellow labeled seafood, and a statistically significant 41.3% decline in the sale of yellow labeled seafood on a mercury safe list. We find no statistically significant difference in sales of green or red labeled seafood. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, the overconfidence investment behavior of institutional investors is the main cause for significant momentum returns observed in an up market.

By simplifying aid eligibility requirements, improving the aid application process, and engaging in early awareness efforts, states could improve the effectiveness of existing aid programs. Additionally, by targeting aid in ways that encourage college completion, more students (particularly those who are most constrained by finances) will improve their chances of earning postsecondary degrees. In recent years, several states have adopted goals of greatly increasing educational attainment levels, so we argue that innovative financial aid policy reform is one of the necessary steps toward meeting these goals. This brief can inform ongoing policy negotiations between state commissioners of higher education, state education task forces, and education and workforce legislative committees.","[Hillman, Nicholas W.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Orians, Erica Lee] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Hillman, NW (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",nwhillman@wisc.edu; erica.orians@utah.edu,,,,,,,45,2,2,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

This value is substantially higher than the Faustmann NPV. This is in contrast to the situation without carbon where the difference is small and reduces as log price increases. When carbon is included, the difference in value is also large for existing stands and increases with stand age until at least the minimum harvest age is reached. Additional value comes from the flexibility of when to harvest and hence when carbon units have to be surrendered. The real options approach also provides additional insight on the probability of a stand being harvested. Harvesting does not occur at low log prices and only occurs at higher log prices when carbon prices are relatively low. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using trivariate probit analysis with predicted probabilities, in this exploratory study we find recent changes in the financial aid system place a higher responsibility on African American, Latino/Hispanic, and moderate-income students to pay for college themselves. We also find when parents open a savings account, start a state-sponsored savings plan, or open a college investment fund students are less likely to pay for college with student contributions. Therefore, we suggest in addition to grants and scholarships, policies that encourage accumulation of savings for college among minority and lower income families may help reduce the college cost burden they experience.

Secondly, analyze whether institutional arrangements, population behavior, and socioeconomic or environmental determinants are associated with HSE. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was utilized to calculate OECD countries' HSE. Life expectancy and infant survival rate were considered as outputs in both models. Healthcare systems' rankings according to the super-efficiency and the cross-efficiency ranking methods were used to analyze determinants associated with efficiency. (1) Healthcare systems in nine countries with large and stable economies were defined as efficient in model I, but were found to be inefficient in model II; (2) Gatekeeping and the presence of multiple insurers were associated with a lower efficiency; and (3) The association between socioeconomic and environmental indicators was found to be ambiguous. Countries striving to improve their HSE should aim to impact population behavior and welfare rather than only ensure adequate medical care. In addition, they may consider avoiding specific institutional arrangements, namely gatekeeping and the presence of multiple insurers.

Households in both randomized treatment arms were informed about the arsenic level in their well and whether that level was above or below the Bangladesh standard for arsenic. Households in one group of villages were encouraged to seek water from wells below the national standard. Households in the second group of villages received additional information explaining that lower-arsenic well water is always safer and these households were encouraged to seek water from wells with lower levels of arsenic, irrespective of the national standard. A simple model of household drinking-water choice indicates that the effect of the emphasis message is theoretically ambiguous. Empirically, we find that the richer message had a negative, but insignificant, effect on well-switching rates, but the estimates are sufficiently precise that we can rule out large positive effects. The main policy implication of this finding is that a one-time oral message conveying richer information on arsenic risks, while inexpensive and easily scalable, is unlikely to be successful in reducing exposure relative to the status-quo policy.

Furthermore, such programs often include subgroup achievement rules that attempt to hold schools accountable for the performance of all demographic classes of students. This paper looks at two issues: the degree to which such rules increase the likelihood of school failure, and the effect of failure to meet a performance standard on subsequent student achievement. Using data from California's state accountability program, I find that subgroup rules lead to otherwise similar schools having different probabilities of failure. I also find that subgroup induced failure leads to lower future student achievement under both the state's system and its' implementation of No Child Left Behind. This implies that small demographic differences play a large role in how schools are judged and how they perform under current accountability systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, aid is fungible and recipients cannot commit to using it for the purpose it was intended. We analyze competition for aid games with aid fungibility and cross-border pollution to gain insights on how to allocate environmental aid more efficiently. We set up a two stage game of two recipients receiving aid from a donor interested in minimizing pollution. Recipients cannot commit on the use of aid but they can commit on the infrastructure necessary to use aid for pollution abatement. We find that the success of competition for aid games depends critically on the degree of cross-border pollution. This determines whether it is more efficient to set up such games between recipients with little (or a lot of) cross-border pollution between them. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The issue of smuggling activities related to the indirect taxation had caused a great lost to the government not only in term of monetary aspect, but also non-monetary aspects such as quotas, embargo and product quality. However, the study of a tax evasion and smuggling activities in the indirect taxation have received less attention among the researchers and legislators. Hence, the current study aims to examine factors affecting the tax evasion on excise duties for importation of vehicles that can be associated with smuggling activities in Malaysia. The study has indentified several potential determinants related to tax evasion on imported vehicles, such as the tax rate, penalty structure, the car's brand and size of the business of car importers. To achieve the objectives, this study used sample data from vehicles smuggling cases investigated by the tax authorities in Malaysia. The hypotheses were tested using both univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The statistical results provided evidence on the significant values of evaded excise duties, whereby the excise duties and penalty rates are the contributing factors for the tax evasion in vehicles smuggling activities. Hence, this study contributes towards the body of literature in the discussed area and also provides strategic information to the policymakers in reviewing the tax policy related to excise duties on imported vehicles in the future.

The principal-agent framework and the propensity score-matching technique are employed for the analysis. We demonstrate that insurance incentive-based problems. are the rationale for the coexistence of share contracts and flat-wage contracts, even though share contracts bring greater economic benefit to both vessel owners and crew members. Crew members are found to be risk averse. Crew size and residence are important factors that influence the choice of contracts. Compared with flat-wage contracts, small share-contracted vessels are more efficient in managing the operating costs, while large ones are more efficient in yielding a high catch.","[Pham Thi Thanh Thuy; Flaaten, Ola] Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Pham Thi Thanh Thuy; Nguyen Thi Kim Anh] Univ Nha Trang, Nha Trang, Vietnam",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Nha Trang University,"Thuy, PTT (通讯作者)，Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",thanh.thuy@uit.no; ola.flaaten@uit.no; sonan-hcc@gmail.com,,"Pham, Thuy/0000-0003-4987-4879",Nha Trang University [SRV 2701]; Government of Vietnam; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD),Nha Trang University; Government of Vietnam; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD)(CGIAR),"We thank Harald Bergland and three anonymous referees, as well as the participants of the IIFET conference in Montpellier (2010), for valuable comments on a previous draft.

Measures proposed and realized in the future in the frame of a landscape consolidation project are highlighted in this contribution. These following aspects can be named among them: consolidation of parcels, enlargement of holdings and additional measures including irrigation and drainage infrastructure to improve water management, construction of field roads, land levelling, soil improvement measures and changes to land use such as converting agriculturally inferior land into forest land or wetlands. Impact of land consolidation on rural development is demonstrated. By designing new field roads the road infrastructure in the cadastral area has been improved. Water erosion control measures and new water facilities aided in better water resource management. Measures for ecological stability increased the land resistance.","[Varga, V.; Bazik, J.] Slovak Univ Agr, Hort & Landscape Engn Fac, Dept Landscape Planning & Ground Design, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Varga, V (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Hort & Landscape Engn Fac, Dept Landscape Planning & Ground Design, Hospodarska 7, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",viki.varg@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,1,1,1,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,526,530,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800091,0

Availability of satellite guidance systems, which allow greater accuracy and controlled movement of machines, gives a possibility to reduce the economic costs of production and increase the environmental sustainability. The objective of this article was to evaluate keeping working width for manually and automatically guided tractor and tillage implements. Automatic guidance is provided by a satellite navigation system. In experiments a dual frequency RTK GNSS receiver and field controller Topcon GRS-1 was used for measuring working width. In manually guided experiment the sum of the absolute values of off-track errors was 8.66m. It represents an error from the ideal passes with the value of 6.88%. In automatically guided experiment the sum of the absolute values of off-track errors was 4.45m, which represents technological deficiencies with the value of 3.71%.

The experimental plots were manipulated using roof constructions enabling exclusion/transmission of incident precipitation and UV radiation, respectively. Generally, UV and drought treatments had a similar effect on the accumulation of flavonols. UV exclusion resulted in a slight reduction of UV-screening compounds, particularly under the conditions of ambient precipitation. Likewise, drought treatment caused an increase in the accumulation of flavonols per area unit. Under UV exclusion, drought slightly reduced light-saturated CO2 assimilation rate (A(max)) in the both species studied. The presence of UV radiation, however, led to less of a difference in A(max) between [wet] and [dry] treatments. In addition to the increased induction of flavonols, UV radiation increased water use efficiency and alleviated thus the negative impact of drought on photosynthesis.","[Vesela, B.; Novotna, K.; Rajsnerova, P.; Klem, K.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Inst Forest Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Vesela, B.; Novotna, K.; Rajsnerova, P.; Klem, K.] CzechGlobe Global Change Res Ctr AS CR, Vvi, Brmo 60300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Vesela, B (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Inst Forest Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",vesela.b@czechglobe.cz,"Klem, Karel/G-9726-2014; Novotná, Kateřina/H-6221-2014",,,,,,17,1,1,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,391,396,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800068,0

It is found that 6.2% of the households were not able to deal with a small shock, while more than 20% were unable to cope with a large shock. Households will resort to using their savings or cutting down daily expenditure, or turn to family and friends in coping with financial shocks. Malay households have less and fewer sources of funds in meeting unexpected financial needs.

Using the UK Labour Force Survey we evaluate the distributive effects of our model. We compute the repayment burdens and taxpayer subsidies for average, low and high earnings graduates.

Use of logging residues and non-marketable small diameter trees available in these forests, are thought to create economic opportunities for NIPF owners and contribute in maintaining healthy forest systems. However, in the absence of a well-defined market, it is difficult to predict the willingness of landowners for supplying biomass from their forests. This study uses multinomial logit models to understand landowners' willingness/unwillingness to supply biomass at hypothetical price levels and examines landowner, forest, and demographic characteristics underlying these decisions. The results indicate significant association between landowners' bid acceptance decisions and factors such as, forest tract size, size of trees in the forest, distance of landowners' residence from the forest, landowners' age, previous harvesting experience, price of timber, and forest management objectives.

We address the potential selection of students into ED, including estimating an upper bound of 46 percentage points following Altonji. Elder, and Taber (2005). One college appears to use the ED process to screen applicants with high SAT scores and female applicants, thereby avoiding the potential adverse selection of applicants in the regular decision process. Finally, even conditional on higher socioeconomic status and other observable characteristics, applying ED is correlated with higher financial aid packages, perhaps because the college's financial aid resources are higher earlier in the admission process.

In a trial including HER2+ MBC patients who had received at least one prior course of trastuzumab and no more than one prior course of palliative chemotherapy (GBG 26/BIG 03-05), continued trastuzumab plus capecitabine (T + C) also improved TTP. An economic model using patient-level data from EGF100151 and published results of GBG 26/BIG 03-05 as well as other literature were used to evaluate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained with L + C versus C-only and versus T + C in women with HER2+ MBC previously treated with trastuzumab from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Expected costs were A 28,816 pound with L + C, A 13,985 pound with C-only and A 28,924 pound with T + C. Corresponding QALYs were 0.927, 0.737 and 0.896. In the base case, L + C was estimated to provide more QALYs at a lower cost compared with T + C; cost per QALY gained was A 77,993 pound with L + C versus C-only. In pairwise probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probability that L + C is preferred to C-only was 0.03 given a threshold of A 30,000 pound. The probability that L + C is preferred to T + C was 0.54 regardless of the threshold. When compared against capecitabine alone, the addition of lapatinib has a cost-effectiveness ratio exceeding the threshold normally used by NICE. Compared with T + C, L + C is dominant in the base case and approximately equally likely to be cost-effective in probabilistic sensitivity analyses over a wide range of threshold values.","[Delea, Thomas E.; Sofrygin, Oleg] Policy Anal Inc PAI, Brookline, MA 02445 USA; [Tappenden, Paul; Karnon, Jon] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Browning, Dominy; Walker, Mel D.] GlaxoSmithKline, London, England; [Amonkar, Mayur M.] GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA USA; [Karnon, Jon] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Cameron, David] Univ Leeds, Sect Oncol & Clin Res, Leeds LS2 9LN, W Yorkshire, England",Policy Analysis Inc; University of Sheffield; GlaxoSmithKline; GlaxoSmithKline; University of Adelaide; University of Leeds,"Delea, TE (通讯作者)，Policy Anal Inc PAI, 4 Davis Court, Brookline, MA 02445 USA.",tdelea@pai2.com,"Cameron, David/C-7781-2013","Cameron, David/0000-0002-2717-7979; Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",,,,,55,18,20,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We contribute to this debate by focusing on a single occupation and organization and by comparing the careers of employees with and without occupation-related training in high school. We use longitudinal data on the careers of military recruits who completed high school Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC), a military science program that has features of a vocational training and school-to-work program. We find that the occupation-specific training received via JROTC reduces early turnover and improves long-run job stability for those who choose military jobs, suggesting that an important effect of vocational training is to improve job match quality. We also. find that promotion rates for vocational graduates are similar to their peers, suggesting that vocational education in general works by improving occupational sorting.

The existence of employment observations prior to MBA enrollment allows for the control of unobserved ability or selection into MBA programs (through the use of individual fixed effects). In addition, variation in the amount of pre-MBA work experience allows for a test to distinguish between the models. In particular, a predominant signaling view is shown to predict smaller returns to the degree, the more pre-MBA work experience one has (controlling for total experience). Additionally, a unique feature of the data is that respondents were asked to report skills or abilities gained through their schooling, allowing us to determine the extent to which these purported skills are valued in the labor market. The combined evidence suggests that while human capital accumulation may contribute to the returns to an MBA, the majority of the returns is derived from the signaling/screening function of the degree.

However, using quantile regressions, we find the elasticity estimates form an inverted U-shape across the scholastic aptitude distribution, and that higher aptitude teachers are more profoundly affected by the percentage of students eligible for free lunch and local street crime, while lower aptitude teachers are more profoundly affected by local education support.

Futures research ought to be methodologically and professionally sound, should to a certain extent be accurate, and should have a degree of impact on strategic decision making and policy-making. However, in the case of futures studies, the one does not automatically lead to the other. Quality of method does not ensure success, just as quality and success do not guarantee impact. This article explores the new paths for understanding evaluating of futures studies that are provided by the various articles in this special issue and sets out an agenda for next steps with regard to evaluation of futures research. The more structural and systematic evaluation can result in an increased level of trust in futures research, which may in turn lead to more future oriented strategy, policy and decision making. Therefore, evaluation should be seen as more than a burden of accountability - albeit important as accountability is - but as an investment in the credibility and impact of the profession. It may set in motion a cycle of mutual learning that will not only improve the capacity of futures-researchers but will also enhance the capacity and likeliness of decision-makers to apply insight from futures research.

As a consequence of the variety of scientific approaches available, students of forest policy can choose between three alternatives: (i) relying on and applying an existing theory, (ii) attempting to combine several theories in a new context or (iii) creating a new theory based on their own experiences and findings from desk research and/or empirical surveys. Whereas alternatives (i) and (ii) have been chosen in the majority of scientific studies focusing on the relationship between forests and people, theory building has not as yet been commonly applied in forest policy research. Seeking to discern both the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, the methodological aspects of each are emphasised in this paper. Subsequent to an outline of the general significance of theories for scientific research practised in the social sciences, and a depiction of the features of 'good' theories, the widespread procedure for testing existing theories is outlined. This is followed by descriptions of several techniques employed in theory building. Finally, some conclusions on the application of existing theories and on theory building in the context of forest policy are presented. It is argued that given its innovative potential, theory building should not be neglected in forest policy discipline. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we assess the economic potential to substitute wood for coal in large scale heat and power production. We also review the impacts of increased energy wood usage on the forest industry and roundwood prices. The analysis is conducted with the European Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model. We consider three scenarios, where carbon price remains at 20 (sic)/tCO(2), increases to 50 (sic)/tCO(2), or increases to 110 euro/tCO(2) by 2040. It seems that a carbon price higher than 20 (sic)/tCO(2) is required to increase wood based energy production. At prices below 50 (sic)/tCO(2), energy wood consists mainly of forest chips, recycled wood, bark, and black liquor. At the carbon price of 50 (sic)/tCO(2). the use of wood for energy begins to compete with the use of wood in the forest industry. At the price of 110 (sic)/tCO(2), roughly one third of wood used in large scale heat and power production would also be suitable for material use.

Norway presents an interesting case for three reasons. First, it was among the first countries to implement smoke-free laws, so it is possible to assess the long-term effects. Second, it has a cold climate so if there is a negative effect on revenue one would expect to find it in Norway. Third, the data from Norway are detailed enough to distinguish between revenue from pubs and restaurants. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) intervention analysis of bi-monthly observations of revenues in restaurants and pubs show that the law did not have a statistically significant long-term effect on revenue in restaurants or on restaurant revenue as a share of personal consumption. Similar analysis for pubs shows that there was no significant long-run effect on pub revenue.","[Melberg, Hans Olav] Univ Oslo, Hlth Econ Res Programme, Inst Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Lund, Karl E.] Norwegian Inst Alcohol & Drug Res, N-0105 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Melberg, HO (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Hlth Econ Res Programme, Inst Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, POB 1089, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",hans.melberg@gmail.com; kel@sirus.no,,"Melberg, Hans Olav/0000-0002-2349-5902",,,,,19,23,24,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

One of these services is avalanche protection of forests. A monetary valuation of this service would be helpful to provide efficient and effective protection to the local population. We present the results of a case study from the Swiss Alps, where we determined the willingness to pay for avalanche protection based on a choice experiment combined with virtual reality visualizations. Furthermore, we compare these results with the costs of alternative technical measures for natural hazard mitigation as well as with the results of a risk-based evaluation. We conclude that the willingness to pay for avalanche protection of forests is about the same range as the collective risk related to a 300-years avalanche event and within a range similar to the per-household costs of alternative measures. However, willingness to pay is substantially higher than the costs of silvicultural measures to maintain protection forest. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

If this research comes out with a positive result, this may signify the most influential impact of Koop Guru's CSR activities or scheme in Kota Bharu Kelantan Malaysia towards its member's welfare. Design/methodology/ approach - This study is quantitative in nature using the responses of 30 cooperative customers/ members who answered a survey questionnaire on a face to face basis. Findings - The results of the study demonstrate how corporate social responsibility (CSR) schemes influence customer satisfaction and also examine CSR's impact on membership growth and brand loyalty. The study's hypothesized relationships were principally supported, i.e. company's offerings and customers/ members expectations are positively associated with members' satisfaction mediated by membership growth and loyalty. CSR schemes play an important role in customer/ members satisfaction, which in turn, influences trust and brand effect. Research limitations/ implications - While the results are clear and have strong salience to the cooperative industry in Malaysia, applications of the findings beyond Malaysia should take into account other factors such as the nature of co-operative industry, the perception, behavior and demographics of co-operative customers as well as the strategic focus of co-operative toward CSR. Practical implications - This study provides a set of findings relating to CSR schemes initiatives and perception of customers/ members satisfaction towards building loyalty and satisfaction. Originality value - This paper exhibits an empirical derivation of CSR schemes initiatives measured from customers/ members' point of view, and is expected to be a benchmark for other cooperatives in Malaysia to learn about cooperative strategy development and customers/ members' retention.","[Aaijaz, Naila; Salleh, Siti Sarwani Bt Mohamed; Ibrahim, Mohamed Dahlan B.] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Entrepreneurship & Business, Kota Baharu, Kelantan, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Kelantan,,naila@umk.edu.my,"Boolaky, Mehraz/A-9449-2012; Jerez, Maria/IQX-0405-2023","Boolaky, Mehraz/0000-0002-2559-5843;",,,,,54,3,3,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2092,2112,,,,,,21,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801087,0

This thesis incorporates economic development level, OFDI, export level into its research framework and on this basis have institutional determinants added to analyze the roles that institutional environment and policy support play in OFDI of developing countries. This thesis adopts the panel data of 36 countries from 1984 to 2008 and divides the study sample by economic development level. By studying the roles that those different determinants play in various development phases of OFDI, this thesis reveals the variation rules of OFDI impact caused by different determinants. The results show that: economic determinants have a growing significant influence on the different development phases of OFDI; institutional environment has both a positive and negative significant influence on OFDI of developing countries. Some factors also have a significant influence on OFDI of developed countries, but they are all negative influence. Policy support has a positive influence on all the countries, but with different significance.","[Chen, Yan; Xu, Ruiyang; Yang, Jiaxing] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,,shanshan040507@163.com,"Xu, Ruiyang/HTM-8372-2023; Yang, Jiaxing/HMO-6544-2023","Yang, Jiaxing/0000-0003-4760-383X",,,,,34,1,1,0,4,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-61896-012-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,1411,1419,,,,,,9,Economics; Management; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BBY61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308816302023,0

Data on the number of farms, the production area and the labour input are available. Some 34,702 farms were engaged in horticultural production which utilized some 209,703 ha and employed 122,184 full time equivalents. Two thirds of these farms were specialized in horticultural production activities which used 78% of the production area. The fruit and vegetable sectors each have a significant influence on the development of the production structure in Germany. Of the total production area used by specialized farms, 29% are dedicated to fruit and 42% to vegetable production. However, the number of farms producing vegetables decreased by 42% between 1994 and 2005. On the other hand, the production area increased by more than one third to 97,218 ha. The development of specialized fruit producers was similar. In the same period, the number of farms producing fruit and specialized fruit producers decreased by about one third each to 16,594 farms and 7,345 farms respectively. A slight reduction in the production area for specialized fruit producing farms to 46,308 ha was observed, whereas the fruit production area increased by 12% to 82,144 ha. The result of these developments are larger but fewer farms. Comparing the labour input and production area reveals improvements in labour productivity in specialized fruit and vegetable production. Furthermore, horticultural production has become more professional today, due to the concentration of production activities in greater and more specialized farms. It is likely that these developments will continue in the future.","Inst Farm Econ, Braunschweig, Germany",,"Dirksmeyer, W (通讯作者)，Inst Farm Econ, Braunschweig, Germany.",,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66050-68-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2012,930.0,,,,,,91,97,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.930.11,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BDT45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314782400011,0

Originality/value - the significance of the research is that it examines the method of the labor law of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which discloses its peculiarity consisting in the contractual regulation of labor and directly connected to it relations. Findings - this article attempts to clarify the characteristic trends of the development of labor relations in the Republic of Kazakhstan with the adoption of the Labor Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan (hereinafter - LC RK) on May 15th, 2007. Analysis of the Labor Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan suggests that individual-contract method is the primary method for the regulation of labor and directly connected to it relations. With the transition to a market economy, the range of possibilities of centralized regulation of social and labor relations becomes narrow and mandatory (imperative) rules of labor law lose their widespread nature. The combination of private and public basis had great influence on the limits of the rights of the employee and the employer in establishing conditions of employment and collective agreements. Hence the limits of the rights of the employee and the employer in establishing conditions of employment and collective agreements are limited to prohibition of worsening the position of the employee, compared to the normative acts (in favorem).

This study quantified amounts of carbon accumulated in wood products harvested from loblolly pine (Pious taeda L) stands grown in Mississippi by extending rotation ages traditionally used to manage these stands for timber. The financial viability of this approach was examined based on carbon payments received by landowners for sequestering carbon in standing trees and harvested wood products. Results indicated a potential to increase carbon accumulated in wood products by 16.11 metric tons (t) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) per hectare (ha) for a rotation increase of 5 years and 67.07 tCO(2)e/ha for a rotation increase of 65 years. Carbon prices of $50/tCO(2)e and $110/tCO(2)e would be required to provide a sufficient incentive to forest landowners to extend rotations by 5 and 10 years, respectively. With 2.8 million ha of loblolly pine stands in Mississippi, this translates to a possible increase in wood products carbon of 45 million tCO(2)e and 80 million tCO(2)e for harvest ages increased by 5 and 10 years, respectively. Higher carbon prices lengthened rotation ages modestly due to low present values of carbon accumulated with long rotations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Passengers traveling on the same origin-destination pair can choose between two flights run by the same airline. The two flights are scheduled at different time periods of the day. Demand follows a non-homogeneous Poisson process at each price level. Both flights have multiple passenger classes who are price sensitive. Passengers make their purchase decisions based on fares and seat availability. To optimize expected revenues, the airline integrates seat inventory control on the two flights. We formulate the problem as a continuous-time stochastic control model. Through analyzing the properties of the expected value function, we derive its close-form solution. Specifically, we show that an optimal policy is featured by a sequence of threshold points at which price changes are made. This threshold control policy is simple and easy to implement.","[Yu, Yanbing] SW Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Baichun] Long Isl Univ, Dept Management, Greenvale, NY 11548 USA",Southwest Jiaotong University; Long Island University Post,"Yu, YB (通讯作者)，SW Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China.",Yuyb2002@hotmail.com; Baichun.xiao@liu.edu,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-61896-012-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,1756,1759,,,,,,4,Economics; Management; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BBY61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308816302102,0

This assessment is mainly theoretical in nature. The various meanings and main criticisms of forest governance will be dealt with. In so doing, the paper applies the so-called 'Triple G' perspective (government, governance, governmentality). Firstly, the paper explains the emergence of the forest governance concept from the shortcomings of forest government, or 'state forestry' (overexploitation, policy failure, corruption). In a next step, it also criticises the concept of forest governance, now using a governmentality perspective. This latter view assumes that control by the state and self-governance by people go hand in hand. It thus challenges one of the key assumptions in many governance studies, namely that the state has substantially withdrawn from the forest sector and that forest politics has been relocated from the state to the market and to society.

By contrast, wealthy individuals, such as the Middle and Large Groups, are the sellers of attention-grabbing stocks and prefer non-attention-grabbing stocks, thereby exhibiting a behavior resembling that of institutional investors.

Using the interaction mitigates many of the concerns regarding quarter of birth instruments. A dollar increase in financial need is associated with 15 cents in federal grants and 47 cents in loans.

Theoretically, audits may (1) improve compliance by enhancing the effectiveness of treatment technologies and pollution prevention methods, (2) undermine compliance by distracting facilities' personnel with audit-related administrative burdens, or (3) not influence compliance because these effects neutralize each other. By examining the extent of compliance, our study's results reflect both improvement toward and beyond compliance. By assessing compliance with multiple pollutants separately, our study examines whether audits influence the control of different pollutants uniformly.

'Place' is used in a political context by examining how global realities are experienced in place, and the author argues the need to look at the everyday realities of the crisis from a gendered ontological perspective in order to counter grand narratives of gloom and doom where women (whether old, young, migrant, heterosexual or otherwise) are particular victims. By discussing local contexts of the gendered realities of the crisis in three southern Europe areas, the author shows the possibility of changing the crisis narrative from one of overwhelming paralysis to one of potential transformation. The focus is on the rise of resistance, solidarity economies and new types of communities in the search by women in southern Europe for alternatives to neoliberal capitalism.","Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Harcourt, W (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",harcourt@iss.nl,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The average size of home bias in both bond and stock markets is found to be much larger in emerging countries than in developed countries. Using the explanatory variables in two categories of economic development and market performance, we employ dynamic panel data regression models to analyze major sources of home bias. The main results are the following: First, market performance factors generally affect home bias more strongly than do economic development factors. Second, market factors including market return, volatility, and liquidity support various hypotheses under informational asymmetries, such as return chasing, risk aversion, and flight to quality. Third, among macroeconomic factors, it is shown that real gross domestic product growth has negative effects and country leverage has positive effects on a specific home bias, backing up the size-bias and the flight-to-quality hypotheses, respectively. Finally, and perhaps most important in this paper, the effect of bond market performance on equity home bias is found to be significantly stronger than the effect of equity market performance on bond home bias from the market interaction model estimation, suggesting that a policy design needs to begin with increasing bond market efficiency to reduce equity market home bias.","[Kim, Byoung Joon] Kangnam Univ, Yongin, South Korea; [Yun, Young Sup] Korea Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Cin, Beom Cheol] Kyonggi Univ, Dept Econ, Suwon, South Korea; [Kim, YoungJun] Korea Univ, Grad Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea",Kangnam University; Korea University; Kyonggi University; Korea University,"Cin, BC (通讯作者)，Kyonggi Univ, Dept Econ, Suwon, South Korea.",bobbyjoe@kangnam.ac.kr; ysyun@korea.ac.kr; bccin@kyonggi.ac.kr; youngjkim@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,55,6,6,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The first principle is understanding interconnected innovation systems. This principle ensures that participants position the foresight exercise and their own activities in a global context. The second principle is responsiveness towards diverse languages and cultures. This principle strengthens commitment and encourages learning and creative problem solving. The third principle is capacity to reconfigure international networks. This principle is about taking advantage of existing organisational structures and facilitates timely and efficient mobilisation of stakeholder communities. The fourth and last principle is 'glocal' impact orientation. This principle ensures that foresight activities are connected to both local and international decision-making structures.

Our theoretical model shows that, depending on schools' and students' reactions to resource changes, the overall effect of resources on education outcomes is ambiguous. Schools, however, have an incentive to adjust their grading structure following resource shifts, such that grade inflation is likely to accompany resource-driven policies.

This article offers both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the potential impact on China from the EU's two major PTA negotiations one with the US and the other with japan. Chinese intellectuals who are paying attention to these two FTAs, however, have very mixed opinions, which can be characterized as positive, negative or what can be termed as 'marginal impact'. On the basis of the analysis of the mixed opinions, the authors make further predictions about the possible responses of the Chinese government towards new PTA strategy of the EU, and suggest that the EU's FTAs need to exhibit sign of greater amicability and accepting of differing opinions and most importantly, they should form building blocks, instead of stumbling blocks,for the multilateral trading system.","[Zhang Xiaotong; Zhang Ping] Wuhan Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yang Xiaoyan] Minist Commerce, Bur Fair Trade, Beijing, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Zhang, P (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",xtzhang@whu.edu.cn; zpwhu@163.com; yang_xiao_yan@yahoo.com,"Zhang, Xiaotong/HIR-6204-2022",,,,,,47,2,2,0,15,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The aim of this study was to explore the financing of LTC in Hungary, with a disease-specific focus on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Data and methods Data were derived from the National Health Insurance Fund Administration (NHIFA). For 2012, we analyzed the following indicators: number of patients and cases, crude and weighted hospital days, and health insurance expenditure. Results The annual health insurance expenditure of LTC was 112.6 million EUR in Hungary in 2012 and covered 209,000 patients (225,000 cases). The NHIFA spent 0.69 million EUR for the LTC of 976 patients with RA. The annual health insurance cost per patient was significantly (by 32 %) higher for patients with RA (710 EUR) than the average cost of all patients (538 EUR). The average length of stay was also higher for patients with RA (19.7 days) than for the general LTC population (17.4 days). Conclusions The cost of LTC of patients with RA is higher than the average cost of the general LTC patient population. Early treatment of RA patients could contribute to decreasing LTC expenditure. More generally, health technology assessment can inform future LTC funding debates in Central and Eastern European countries by putting more emphasis on LTC utilization and costs.","[Horvath, Cs Zoltan; Sebestyen, Andor; Endrei, Dora; Boncz, Imre] Univ Pecs, Inst Hlth Insurance, Fac Hlth Sci, H-7621 Pecs, Hungary; [Horvath, Cs Zoltan] Natl Inst Qual & Org Dev Healthcare & Med GYEMSZI, South Transdanubian Reg Directorate, H-7621 Pecs, Hungary; [Sebestyen, Andor] Natl Hlth Insurance Fund Adm OEP, South Transdanubian Reg Off, H-7645 Pecs, Hungary; [Oesterle, August] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Social Policy, Dept Socioecon, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Oesterle, August; Boncz, Imre] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary; [Betlehem, Jozsef; Olah, Andras] Univ Pecs, Fac Hlth Sci, Inst Nursing & Patient Care, H-7621 Pecs, Hungary; [Imre, Laszlo; Bagosi, Gabriella] Natl Inst Qual & Org Dev Healthcare & Med GYEMSZI, H-1125 Budapest, Hungary",University of Pecs; Vienna University of Economics & Business; Corvinus University Budapest; University of Pecs,"Boncz, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pecs, Inst Hlth Insurance, Fac Hlth Sci, Maria U 5-7, H-7621 Pecs, Hungary.",imre.boncz@etk.pte.hu,"Betlehem, József/AAF-2446-2021; Boncz, Imre/A-8940-2013","Boncz, Imre/0000-0003-3699-6236; Sebestyen, Andor/0000-0002-4078-5477",,,,,31,7,8,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, this effect is partially offset by the production process-that is, the final goods prices in downstream industries are generally less affected by global prices. This indicates that China's commodity market has a close link with global commodity markets.

The transition is assumed to begin in California and the other U.S. states that have adopted California's Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) requirements. Five years after the ZEV standards take effect in 2015, the rest of the U.S. adopts polices strongly supporting the transition. After roughly a decade of net costs, market adoption of electric drive vehicles becomes self-sustaining. In the long run, the model implies that social benefits exceed excess costs by approximately an order of magnitude.

Limited knowledge about uncertainty has prompted this empirical investigation of forest planners' understanding of uncertainty related to its recognition, its management and risk perception. We used a comprehensive uncertainty framework to address and test these uncertainties, with data from an online survey, to identify the views of 33 forest planners through Britain. Responses were analysed using non-parametric tests. The results showed that planners have significantly different views on uncertainty among economic, social and climatic categories. Uncertainty in the climatic category was more acutely perceived than in the economic and social categories. Planners preferred to practice active uncertainty management, as the results suggest they feel more able to manage uncertainty in forest models and their outcomes. Forest planners also indicated diverse perceptions of salient risks of change over the next 30 years. The results show they may take action only to pests, drought and wind risks posing a threat to forests even though they perceived these risks potentially to be highly regulated and controlled by forestry policies. The findings provide a better understanding of uncertainty as a source of inertia to climate change adaptation in forestry, identify new research objectives and support the development of forestry policies for climate change adaptation.

This paper analyses whether the degree of political inequality between social groups is shaped by features of the welfare capitalist system. Specifically, we hypothesize that more labour protection and social support decrease participatory inequality via more evenly distributed resources and engagement between high-and low educated citizens. Our regression analyses combining micro-and macro-level data from 37 capitalist democracies over the past 20 years provide evidence that some protective and supportive elements of welfare capitalism reduce education-based participatory inequality. Our fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis identifies three functionally equivalent types of welfare capitalism that all produce low participatory inequality via increased protection, support or both. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that the mechanisms behind this link are, indeed, a more equal distribution of resources and engagement across low-and high educated citizens.","[Schneider, Carsten Q.] Cent European Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Budapest, Hungary; Cent European Univ, Dept Int Relat & European Studies, Budapest, Hungary",Central European University; Central European University,"Schneider, CQ (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Budapest, Hungary.",schneider_carsten@ceu-budapest.edu,"Makszin, Kristin/ABH-9039-2020","Makszin, Kristin/0000-0002-3595-5515; Schneider, Carsten Q./0000-0001-5651-4156",,,,,46,17,20,2,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In the model individuals derive utility both from their own direct enjoyment of the public good and from the enjoyment of those in their network. We find that network structure almost always matters, both for utility and for valuation. The network increases aggregate valuation when it assigns higher importance, that is, stronger connections, to individuals with higher private values for the public good. The model provides a theoretical foundation for the idea of opinion leaders who have disproportionate influence over their communities. Specifically, opinion leaders are individuals assigned high importance by the network, and projects favored by opinion leaders tend to be favored by the network as a whole. The model can also guide future empirical studies by enabling a more structural approach to non-market valuation in a socially connected group. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

I find a 5 percentage point gap in the probability of selecting the rigorous curriculum between 9th grade students who just passed and those who just failed the exam. RD results across two years (one year in which the graduation standards were not in place) suggest that the discontinuity arose due to fewer students opting into the college track as a result of the exam results.

This includes high-profile and long-standing WTO disputes such as EC-Bananas or Softwood Lumber. By offering a negotiated solution to hard cases, MAS have added stability to the multilateral trading system. MAS, however, also raise concerns. Settlements favour the instant resolution of disputes, but may conflict with third party interests and collective stakes. Where WTO members use their MAS to contract out of WTO law ('WTO+'/'WTO-'MAS), the multilateral trading system may be at risk. In addition, new forms of bilateral (interim-)settlements not foreseen in the DSU have recently emerged which currently escape multilateral disciplines. This article assesses how well the DSU balances the competing interests involved in amicable settlements, preserving the contractual flexibility of disputants while safeguarding multilateral interests. Contributing to current DSU reform debates, the article rejects the need for greater MAS enforceability, endorses the strengthening of procedural and substantive safeguards protecting collective stakeholders in settlements, and calls for new DSU disciplines on interim-settlements.","Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies IHEID, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Alschner, W (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies IHEID, Geneva, Switzerland.",wolfgang.alschner@graduateinstitute.ch,,,,,,,0,13,13,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2014,13.0,1,,,,,65,102,,10.1017/S1474745613000165,0.0,,,38,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AC4RL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332508300003,0

Instead, this paper focuses on forecasting and predictive models of renewable energy and also on financial simulations performed in order to determine the profitability of investments.","[Bara, Adela; Lungu, Ion; Oprea, Simona-Vasilica; Botha, Iuliana; Chinie, Alexandra] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Bâra, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",bara.adela@ie.ase.ro; ion.lungu@ie.ase.ro; simona.oprea@csie.ase.ro; iuliana.botha@ie.ase.ro; Alexandra.chinie@gmail.com,"Oprea, Simona/AAF-1475-2019; Bara, Adela/D-7762-2015; Chinie, Catalina/GNP-4906-2022; Botha, Iuliana/AAP-3825-2021; Bara, Adela/AAF-1472-2019","Botha, Iuliana/0000-0002-2200-9263; Bara, Adela/0000-0002-0961-352X",NASR [49/2014],NASR,"Sections 2-4 of this paper presents some results of the research project PN II TE Program, Code 332: Informatics Solutions for decision making support in the uncertain and unpredictable environments in order to integrate them within a Grid network and section 5 presents some results of the research project Intelligent System for prediction, analysis and monitoring of performance indicators of technological and business processes in the field of renewable energies (SIPAMER), PNII - PCCA 2013, code 0996, no. 49/2014 funded by NASR.",,22,0,0,0,16,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In an ordinary society, rewards usually stimulate competent individuals, regardless of their social background, both from an economic point of view (through money and goods), but also symbolically (through respect). Instead, the chance to penetrate a world dominated by a variety of crises is inevitably determined by social hierarchy. This paper presents the poverty impact on economic development, both in Europe and in Romania, in the last years, marked by poverty risk and social exclusion. Our primary objective concerns the estimation of poverty, in its absolute but also relative line. Finally, we draw the conclusion that the complexity of the current issues is triggered by three main elements namely: the headcount index, the poverty gap and the squared poverty gap. Any pattern used in order to quantify the differences caused by poverty, concentrates on a single aspect: how to reduce the impact of this phenomenon on economies. (C) 2014 The Authors.
