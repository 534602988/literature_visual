J,"Besley, T; Persson, T",,,,"Besley, Timothy; Persson, Torsten",,,Why Do Developing Countries Tax So Little?,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TAXATION; CORRUPTION; GOVERNMENT; AFRICA; SIZE,"Low-income countries typically collect taxes of between 10 to 20 percent of GDP while the average for high-income countries is more like 40 percent. In order to understand taxation, economic development, and the relationships between them, we need to think about the forces that drive the development process. Poor countries are poor for certain reasons, and these reasons can also help to explain their weakness in raising tax revenue. We begin by laying out some basic relationships regarding how tax revenue as a share of GDP varies with per capita income and with the breadth of a country's tax base. We sketch a baseline model of what determines a country's tax revenue as a share of GDP. We then turn to our primary focus: why do developing countries tax so little? We begin with factors related to the economic structure of these economies. But we argue that there is also an important role for political factors, such as weak institutions, fragmented polities, and a lack of transparency due to weak news media. Moreover, sociological and cultural factors-such as a weak sense of national identity and a poor norm for compliance-may stifle the collection of tax revenue. In each case, we suggest the need for a dynamic approach that encompasses the two-way interactions between these political, social, and cultural factors and the economy.","[Besley, Timothy] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Persson, Torsten] Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Besley, Timothy; Persson, Torsten] Canadian Inst Adv Res CIFAR, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Stockholm University; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"Besley, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England.",t.besley@lse.ac.uk; Torsten.Persson@iies.su.se,,,,,,,42,209,233,4,32,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We analyze alternative multidecade growth trajectories from 2015 to 2105 for major global economies with carbon tax rates designed to stabilize emissions in the presence of both continued country growth and autonomous energy use efficiency improvement. In our central case analysis, revenues from globally internalizing carbon pricing rise to 8 % and then fall to 6 % of gross world product. High growth in India and China reduces global inequality and poverty strongly over time, but important incremental redistributive effects can be achieved using global carbon pricing revenues. Taking into account both between-country effects and previous literature estimates of within-country effects, a global carbon tax alone tends to be regressive in its global incidence. However, if its revenues are redistributed globally via equal per capita transfers, in our central case the Gini coefficient for world income falls by about 3 % and the share of the bottom decile rises by 81 % on average from 2015 to 2105. The population living in poverty falls by 16 % in 2015. Going further, global poverty could be eliminated entirely by 2015 according to our calculations if one third of global carbon tax revenues were redistributed directly to the poorest individuals.","[Davies, James B.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Shi, Xiaojun] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, Ctr Int Governance Innovat, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Natl Bur Econ Res, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Renmin University of China; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Shi, XJ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",sxjstein@gmail.com; jwhalley@uwo.ca,,"Shi, Xiaojun/0000-0002-3676-7786",,,,,36,12,12,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The basic controversy harks back to Harrod's investment function, in which the only long-term equilibrium is u = (u) over bar.

Second, we allow public capital to shift the productivity of private factors. We provide an identification analysis that supports the strategy adopted for estimating the parameters governing these two channels. On one hand, private and government consumption are robustly estimated to be substitute goods. Because of substitutability, labor supply reacts little to a government consumption shock, so the estimated output multiplier is much lower than in models with separabilities.

We control for unobserved heterogeneity by applying fixed-effects methods and furthermore use a subsample of constantly employed individuals plus lagged debt variables to reduce problems of reverse causality. We apply different measures of household indebtedness, such as the percentage shares of household income spent on consumer credit and home loan repayments (which indicate the severity of household indebtedness) and a binary variable of relative overindebtedness (which indicates a precarious debt situation). We find all debt measures to be strongly correlated with health satisfaction, mental health, and obesity. This relationship vanishes for obesity after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity while it stays significant with respect to worse physical and mental health.","[Keese, Matthias; Schmitz, Hendrik] Univ Duisburg Essen, D-45117 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Schmitz, H (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissensch, Schutzenbahn 70, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",hendrik.schmitz@uni-due.de,,"Schmitz, Hendrik/0000-0002-0253-102X",,,,,40,53,58,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

A test of inequality aversion in individual preferences that draws on the Fehr and Schmidt (1999) specification of inequality aversion is proposed, and the difficulties of implementing it in a non-experimental setting are discussed. Estimates based on this model confirm aversion to inequality among individuals both in the pooled sample and separately among the EU and non-EU countries. The Gini index, on the other hand, is unable to capture this negative effect of inequality on well-being. Notably, inequality aversion is not intrinsic. Rather, it appears to be tied to a concern with the fairness of the institutions underlying the distribution of fortunes in society. The evidence is suggestive of inequality of opportunity driving attitudes toward overall inequality. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (3) (2014) 590-608.

This paper provides the first estimates of the long-term impact of the famine 20 years later, on the height of young adults aged 19-22 years who experienced this severe shock as infants during the crisis. An innovative feature of the analysis is that famine intensity is measured at the household level, while impacts are assessed using a difference-in-differences comparison across siblings, and compared with an IV cross-section, using rainfall as an instrument for the shock. We find that by adulthood, affected children who were aged of 12-36 months at the peak of the crisis are significantly shorter than the older cohort, and their unaffected peers, by at least 5 cm. There are no significant effects on those in utero during the crisis, although we cannot rule out that for this cohort, the selection effect dominates scarring. Indicative calculations show that for the affected group such height loss may lead to income losses of around 5% per year over their lifetime. The evidence also suggests that the relief operations at the time made little difference to those who survived.","[Dercon, Stefan] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Porter, Catherine] Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Oxford; Heriot Watt University,"Dercon, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",stefan.dercon@qeh.ox.ac.uk; Catherine.Porter@hw.ac.uk,,"Porter, Catherine/0000-0002-8578-1744",,,,,30,79,86,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Firms must invest in a continuum of tasks to bring a product to market. Each firm possesses a core competency in the task space, but the firms are otherwise identical. For acquisitions and joint ownership, a multinational enterprise (MNE) must match with a local partner that may provide complementary expertise within the task space. However, under joint ownership, investment in tasks is shared by multiple owners and, hence, is subject to a holdup problem that varies with contract intensity. In equilibrium, ex ante identical multinationals enter the local matching market, and, ex post, three different types of heterogeneous firms arise. Specifically, the worst matches are forgone and the MNEs invest greenfield; the middle matches operate under joint ownership; and the best matches integrate via full acquisition. We link the firm-level model to cross-country and industry predictions and find that a greater share of full acquisitions occur between more proximate markets, in hosts with greater revenue potential and within contract-intensive industries. Using data on partial and full acquisitions across industries and countries, we find robust support for these predictions.

We include time varying uncertainty (i.e. risk shocks) in the technology shocks that affect housing production and provide estimates of the time-series properties of risk shocks by using firm level productivity data. The analysis demonstrates that risk shocks to the housing production sector are a quantitatively important impulse mechanism for understanding housing price movements. Specifically, the model can match the volatility of housing prices observed in the data. It is also demonstrated that adjustment costs are important in replicating the contemporaneous correlation of housing prices with GDP and residential investment. Critically, bankruptcy costs act as an endogenous markup factor in housing prices and are an important determinant of house price volatility. However, in comparison to housing demand shocks, risk shocks have low explanatory power for real quantities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using matched employer-employee data for the universe of German workers over the period 1975 to 2008,1 show that there is substantial ethnic segregation across both workplaces and residential locations and that the extent of segregation has been relatively stable over the last 30 years. Workplace segregation is particularly pronounced in agriculture and mining, construction, and the service sector, and among low-educated workers. Ethnic minority workers are segregated not only from native workers but also from workers of other ethnic groups, although less so if they share a common language. From a dynamic perspective, for given cohorts of workers, the results show a clear pattern of assimilation, reminiscent of typical wage assimilation profiles, with immigrants being increasingly less likely to work in segregated workplaces with time spent in the host country.

This cooperation divergence may be explained by a behavioral asymmetry between the warm-glow of doing something good and the cold-prickle of doing something bad (Andreoni, 1995). However, recent research suggests that behavior is qualitatively similar across payoff equivalent public good and common pool resource experiments (Apesteguia & Maier-Rigaud, 2006). This paper reports on an experiment designed to test the robustness of the cooperation divergence. The analysis quantifies the cooperation across payoff equivalent public good and common pool resource experiments that explicitly inform subjects how their allocation decisions effect group earnings. Results suggest that the level of cooperation is equivalent across treatments. This research suggests that the observed cooperation divergence is caused, in part, by variation in the experimental parameters employed rather than from a behavioral regularity unexplained by standard theory.

High school admission had traditionally been exam based in South Korea. However, between 1974 and 1980 the central government shifted several cities to a school district based admission system. I estimate the impact of this reform on the intergenerational income elasticity. Results indicate that the reform increased the intergenerational income elasticity from 0.15 to 0.31. Furthermore, I find that district assignment increases the impact of parental income on migration to reform cities. The probability of migration associated with a 10% increase in parental income increased by 1.7 percentage points after the reform. In sum, I find that the shift from a merit to a location based student assignment rule decreases intergenerational mobility and promotes selective migration by higher income households.

In this paper, we develop a Bayesian model of belief formation in which individuals use (irrelevant) information on others' observable type to bias their beliefs.

J,"Simbanegavi, W; Arndt, C",,,,"Simbanegavi, Witness; Arndt, Channing",,,Climate Change and Economic Development in Africa: An Overview,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Recent studies indicate that climate change will negatively impact Africa's growth and development prospects, particularly in the absence of adaptation and mitigation. Losses of up to 4% of Africa's gross domestic product (GDP) are projected, and agriculture is a major economic impact channel given the high share of Africa's GDP accounted for by rain-fed agriculture. This calls for concerted efforts by African policy-makers and development partners to help Africa build adaptive capacity to reduce vulnerability. Climate finance is a critical ingredient in the efforts to build Africa's adaptive capacity and also in mitigation. Climate funding pledges made by the developed countries have not been realised however, with a large variance between pledges and actual contributions. On the other hand, the uptake of available climate funding for Africa has been slow, in part due to week capacity of African countries to develop and execute adaptation measures. Another important contribution from the papers in this supplement is the treatment of uncertainty in the assessment of economic impacts of climate change. Two of the complicating factors in the assessment of economic impacts are (i) uncertainty associated with climate change and (ii) the fact that climate can be very localised, with different climates for proximate localities. A methodological approach for handling these two challenges is developed and applied to the country of Malawi.

The assessment is based on a model in which external tariffs and the decision to form an FTA are endogenously determined. The findings demonstrate that, in the presence of an organized lobby group in a prospective partner country, an FTA may initiate an increase in the level of protection against imports from third countries and impede trade with non-member countries. Further, this study finds that a foreign lobby may encourage the local government to enter a welfare-reducing trade-diverting FTA. Finally, this paper shows that an FTA increases the lobbying power of the organized lobby groups of the member countries, which can potentially obstruct the viability of welfare-improving multilateral trade liberalization.","York Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Liberal Arts & Profess Studies, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Stoyanov, A (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Liberal Arts & Profess Studies, 1084 Vari Hall,4700 Keele St, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",andreyst@yorku.ca,,,,,,,15,4,4,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Cultural heritage is an important example, and substantial investments are needed to keep ancient inner cities and characteristic monumental buildings in good shape. The costs of these policies are usually clear, and the benefits are often much more difficult to assess. This paper attempts to fill part of this gap by studying the destination choices of urban recreation trips that have urban recreation as the main travel motive. We estimate a discrete choice model for destination choice that takes into account the potential importance of unobserved characteristics. The model allows us to compute the marginal willingness-to-travel for destinations offering more cultural heritage, which we measure as the area of the inner city that has a protected status because of the cultural heritage that is present there.","[van Loon, Ruben; Gosens, Tom; Rouwendal, Jan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-108 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rouwendal, Jan] Tinbergen Inst, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Rouwendal, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Room 4A-11,De Boelelaan 1105, NL-108 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",R.R.van.loon@vu.nl; T.Gosens@vu.nl; J.Rouwendal@vu.nl,"Rouwendal, Jan/G-2478-2011","Rouwendal, Jan/0000-0003-0070-086X",,,,,45,7,7,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The aim of this paper is to analzye to what extent an evolutionary outlook supports libertarian paternalism. I will put forward three arguments in favour of libertarian paternalism and six objections that strongly oppose it. While evolutionary economists should take seriously the contention that our positive knowledge of real-world decision-making will have to influence our normative assessment of these decisions, the objections against libertarian paternalism brought forward in this paper serve as a cautionary note. Contrary to the claims of its proponents, libertarian paternalism is neither inevitable, nor does it provide an adequate measuring rod of normative rationality. It is prone to abuse by anchoring its standard of rationality pragmatically to norms and can thus promote conservative bias and stifle innovative exploration. It also presents the policy-maker with a compounded Hayekian knowledge problem. Finally, from a dynamic point of view, libertarian paternalism's manipulative shaping of preferences might lock-in individuals into heteronomous preference learning paths without them being even aware of it.","[Binder, Martin] Univ Sussex, Sci & Technol Policy Res Unit, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Binder, Martin] Max Planck Inst Econ, Evolutionary Econ Grp, Jena, Germany",University of Sussex; Max Planck Society,"Binder, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sci & Technol Policy Res Unit, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",M.Binder@sussex.ac.uk,"Binder, Martin/AAF-6448-2020","Binder, Martin/0000-0002-5053-3804",,,,,96,11,12,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In particular, we aim at describing the relationship between oil production levels and changes in the world oil demand and prices. Intertemporal production decisions by a representative oil producer are modeled by means of a partial equilibrium model. In this theoretical model, oil producers are subject to exogenous shocks in world oil consumption and prices. Oil companies can change output levels only by incurring a fixed cost. Results from the simulation of this model show a strong relationship between oil production and changes in world oil consumption. On the contrary, the effects of changes in real oil prices on oil production decisions seem to be much lower. Results from the simulation of the theoretical model are then empirically investigated using time-series econometric techniques. The empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that oil producing countries are characterized by different responses to changes in world oil demand and in real oil prices. For many countries, production rapidly adjusts to changes in consumption whereas responses of oil production to innovations in real oil prices are found to be not statistically significant. In addition, when non-linearities in the relationship between world oil demand, prices and output levels are allowed for, evidence of asymmetric effects of shocks to exogenous variables on output levels is found for some countries.

In this paper we derive and analyze Bayesian confidence sets for quantifying uncertainty in the determination of willingness to pay for carbon dioxide abatement. We use two empirical case studies: household decisions of energy-efficient heating versus insulation, and purchase decisions of ultra-low-emission vehicles. We first show that deriving credible sets using the posterior distribution of the willingness to pay is straightforward in the case of deterministic consumer heterogeneity. However, when using individual estimates, which is the case for the random parameters of the mixed logit model, it is complex to define the distribution of interest for the interval estimation problem. This latter problem is actually more involved than determining the moments of the heterogeneity distribution of the willingness to pay using frequentist econometrics. A solution that we propose is to derive and then summarize the distribution of point estimates of the individual willingness to pay under different loss functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

I analyse a game in which firms make multiple discrete product choices, and tackle challenges such as partial identification and sample selection. Estimation results demonstrate that the demand for PCs is highly segmented, and that fixed costs consume a substantial portion of the per-unit producer profit. The estimated model implies that Intel's introduction of its Pentium M chip contributed significantly to the growth of the mobile PC segment and to consumer welfare. The lion's share of the benefits to consumers was enjoyed by the 20% least price-sensitive consumers. I also find that the Pentium M crowded out the Pentium III and Pentium 4 technologies, and that the benefits to consumers from keeping those older products on the shelf would have been comparable to the added fixed costs. While total welfare cannot be increased by keeping older technologies on the shelf, such a policy would have allowed the benefits from innovation to trickle down to price-sensitive households, improving their access to mobile computing.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Eizenberg, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",,,"Eizenberg, Alon/0000-0002-7639-2384",,,,,50,64,113,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The information structure allows explicit calculation of an alternative equilibrium in which naive bidders do not correctly discount the value of the prize; contingent on winning, and thus they suffer the winner's curse. Subjects in a laboratory experiment clearly fall prey to the winner's curse; the data conform most closely to the predictions of the naive model.

Based on Swiss micro-data, we apply a 3-SLS system estimation. The findings confirm a robust inverted-U relationship, in which a rise in the number of competitors at low levels of initial competition increases the firm's research effort, but at a diminishing rate, and the research effort ultimately decreases at high levels of competition. When we split the sample by firm types, the inverted-U shape is steeper for creative firms than for adaptive ones. The numerical solution indicates three particular configurations of interest: (i) an uncontested monopoly with low innovation; (ii) low competition with high innovation; and (iii) a 'no innovation trap' at very high levels of competition. The distinction between solution (i) and (ii) corresponds to Arrow's positive effect of competition on innovation, whereas the difference between outcomes (ii) and (iii) captures Schumpeter's positive effect of market power on innovation. Simulating changes of the exogenous variables, technology potential, demand growth, firm size and exports have a positive impact on innovation, while foreign ownership has a negative effect, and higher appropriability has a positive impact on the number of competitors.","[Peneder, Michael] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Woerter, Martin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Econ Inst KOF, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Peneder, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Obj 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",Michael.Peneder@wifo.ac.at; woerter@kof.ethz.ch,"Woerter, Martin/E-6186-2010","Woerter, Martin/0000-0003-4467-9134",,,,,78,34,38,3,52,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Using an open-economy search model with multiple competing currencies, the value of each currency is determined without requiring agents to use a particular currency to purchase a country's goods. Strategic complementarities in portfolio choices and information acquisition decisions generate multiple equilibria with different types of payment arrangements. While some inflation can benefit the country issuing an international currency, the threat of losing international status puts an inflation discipline on the issuing country. When monetary authorities interact in a simple policy game, the temptation to inflate can lead optimal policy to deviate from the Friedman rule. The calibrated model can produce a welfare cost of losing international status for the issuing country larger than previous findings, though estimates depend critically on inflation rates and information costs.

In the process of identifying the effect of institutional quality, the roles of other factors such as ownership types and market structures are revealed, which provides interesting insight into firms' R&D behavior. The key findings suggest that institutional quality positively affects the decision of firms to engage in R&D activities. Once firms start to engage in R&D, the subsequent expansion of firm-level R&D intensity depends on factors such as market structure. Therefore, strengthening domestic institutional quality is the first critical step towards the goal of building a knowledge-intensive economy in China. Efforts to nurture market development are also important for achieving this goal.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Zhou, YX (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",yixiao.zhou@anu.edu.au,,"Zhou, Yixiao/0000-0003-2962-9841; Zhou, Yixiao/0000-0001-7712-2776",,,,,29,16,17,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2014,22.0,4,,,,,60,82,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12075.x,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AN4YU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340596700004,0

This article uses the framework of fractional integration to test the persistence of price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios in a sample of 16 OECD countries spanning four decades. The results indicate that the ratios are highly persistent. The possibility that persistence estimates may be affected by structural breaks in the series is also considered, but evidence of such breaks is found only in a very limited number of cases.

I consider whether public investments in children can potentially offset the inequality of private investments. Specifically, examining changes in public spending in 25 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries over the period 2000-2009, I find that increases in spending on health are most strongly associated with reductions in the importance of family background and declines in inequality in the production of child human capital as measured by the Program for International Student Assessment test scores among 15-year-olds. Public spending on family support, housing, and education are also moderately related. In contrast, increased spending on the elderly is associated with increases in the importance of parental background and inequality of child test scores. These results suggest that public investments in child human capital have the potential to offset the potentially negative impact of increasing income inequality on intergenerational mobility and inequality of the next generation.

Our main contribution to the literature on Indian studies lies in the investigation of the causes of carbon emissions by taking into account the role of financial development and using single country data. The results suggest that there is evidence on the long-run and causal relationships between carbon emissions, financial development. income, energy use and trade openness. Financial development has a long-run positive impact on carbon emissions, implying that financial development improves environmental degradation. Moreover. Granger causality test indicates a long-run unidirectional causality running from financial development to carbon emissions and energy use. The evidence suggests that financial system should take into account the environment aspect in their current operations. The results of this study may be of great importance for policy and decision-makers in order to develop energy policies for India that contribute to the curbing of carbon emissions while preserving economic growth.

J,"Buddelmeyer, H; Peyton, K",,,,"Buddelmeyer, Hielke; Peyton, Kyle",,,How Windfall Income Increases Gambling at Poker Machines,ECONOMIC RECORD,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MECHANICS,"In December 2008 and March-April 2009, the Australian Government used fiscal stimulus as a short-run economic stabilisation tool for the first time since the 1990s. In May-June 2012, households received lump-sum cheques as compensation for the introduction of the Carbon Tax scheduled for 1 July 2012. This article examines the relationship between these financial windfalls and spending at electronic gaming machines (EGMs) using data from 62 local government areas in Victoria, Australia. The results show large increases in spending at EGMs during the periods when Australian households received economic stimulus cheques. We estimate increased spending at EGMs in December 2008, for example, amounted to 1 per cent of the total stimulus for that period. These findings are consistent with behavioural models of consumption and demonstrate the relative power of framing windfall income as a bonus rather than rebate, especially when targeted at particular sociodemographic subpopulations. Our analysis also calls into question the conventional wisdom that large portions of government payments end up in poker machines.","[Buddelmeyer, Hielke; Peyton, Kyle] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Buddelmeyer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Level 5,Fac Business & Econ Bldg,111 Barry St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",hielkeb@unimelb.edu.au,"Peyton, Kyle/AFC-3915-2022","Peyton, Kyle/0000-0003-4845-5760",,,,,38,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Given the intensity and scope of technical measures imposed by China, the directional impacts of technical barriers to trade (TBTs) on bilateral Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-China exports are investigated empirically using an augmented gravity model. The results imply that Chinese TBTs do have some trade depressing effects from the ASEAN perspective. However, sectoral trade effects of TBTs are important as dual effects exist even within some TBT intensive product groups. This informs the policy debate on the effects of NTMs from the ASEAN-China perspective more specifically, and the South-South context more generally on two fronts. First, the identification of specific trade restricting measures for the affected sectors will assist in determining policy priorities within the ASEAN-China context. Second, trade facilitation measures that increase the business costs to the ASEAN exporters also warrant attention in addressing the scale of market access issues in China.","[Devadason, Evelyn S.; Chenayah, Santha] Univ Malaya, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Devadason, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",evelyns@um.edu.my,"Chenayah, Santha/B-9693-2010; Devadason, Evelyn/B-5329-2010","Devadason, Evelyn/0000-0003-0697-0190",,,,,44,10,10,2,36,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

However, in practice, neoliberal policies have increased the incidence of economic marginalization among lower and middle socio-economic classes in Europe, and have contributed to growing tensions between cultural majorities and ethnic minority groups. While similar sentiments associated with the rise of nationalism in nineteenth century Europe clearly predate the neoliberal era, in this paper I argue that neoliberal policies, backed by European Union institutions, have created material conditions which have exposed and widened structural incompatibilities between the notions of state and nation. Since the 1990s, these incompatibilities have legitimized the resurgence of radical nationalist sentiment within European nation-states, creating a favorable terrain for the populist rise of far-right factions. In lieu of promoting ethno-cultural neutrality, neoliberal policies have weakened liberal and social principles of inclusion, and have eroded welfare state provisioning systems in European democracies. They have fueled what Thorstein Veblen (1923, 28) referred to as unreasoning habits of national conceit, fear, hate, contempt, and servility.","Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA",University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Duroy, Q (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",,,,,,,,31,9,11,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The author argues that after 1989 the natural desire to remove the lies and fill in the blanks has also led to an excessively one-sided view of the Polish People's Republic (PRL) as a structure that was solely repressive, implementing aims imposed by the Communist Party (the Polish United Workers Party PZPR) and behind it, the CPSU, which remained in unrelenting and unmitigated conflict with society. This tendency has found expression primarily in the selection of research topics, especially at the beginning of the 1990s, concentrating on the repression and crimes of the Stalinist system on the one hand, and social resistance and political opposition on the other. The author (along with some Polish sociologists) considers that while the communist system in Poland could be rejected in the axiological sense, it was accepted or tolerated as a fact in the sphere of 'daily interests'. To demonstrate this he uses the category of 'small individualism' proposed by the Polish sociologist Winicjusz Narojek and applies it to the analysis of housing policy in the 1970s.","Polish Acad Sci, Hist Inst, Warsaw, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences,"Jarosz, D (通讯作者)，Polish Acad Sci, Hist Inst, Warsaw, Poland.",darjarosz@wp.pl,,"Jarosz, Dariusz/0000-0002-7882-8532",,,,,37,2,2,0,4,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

This is problematic for an oil-dependent economy facing the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and declining energy return on investment in domestic oil production. The collapse of the U.S. housing bubble in 2007 has left a substantial excess housing stock in car-dependent outer suburbs. A suburban retrofit strategy is identified that establishes sustainable common carrier transport corridors, with reorientation of suburban trips to local, multi-use center at the corridor point of access. The policy aims to thread the needle between increased labor employment and improved strategic resource efficiency. The principle obstacle to the policy is the accommodation of existing institutions of residential zoning and transport corridor funding to the previous growth regime of extensive single-use property development. Accordingly, this paper identifies institutional reforms in support of the policy.","Fortis Coll, Ravenna, OH 44266 USA",,"McFarling, BR (通讯作者)，Fortis Coll, Ravenna, OH 44266 USA.",,,,,,,,18,1,2,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We compare the dynamic equilibrium of an economy with wage inertia with the equilibrium of an economy without it. We show that wage inertia affects the long run employment rate and that the transitional dynamics of the main economic variables will be different because wages are a state variable when wage inertia is introduced. In particular, we show that the model with wage inertia can explain some growth patterns that cannot be explained when wages are flexible. We also study the growth effects of permanent technological and fiscal policy shocks in these two economies. During the transition, the growth effects of technological shocks obtained when wages exhibit inertia may be the opposite of those obtained when wages are flexible. These technological shocks may have long run effects if there is wage inertia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The study finds that the energy intensity of the industry during the decade of domestic and global economic turbulent time in the 2000s fluctuated. The intensity declined immediately after recovering from the 1997 financial and currency crises but moved in an inverted U-shaped curve when the industry went through the various changes of production structure during 2003 to 2010. The decomposition analysis based on the logarithmic mean Divisia index method finds that the source of the changes of the energy intensity of the industry was dominated by the structural change effect. The fluctuation of the energy intensity was found despite a persistent decline, albeit relatively small, in the energy intensity of individual subsectors. This calls for the need to strengthen the effect of subsector energy intensity changes to help reduce the energy intensity of the industry in the long term. The study results imply four policy measures the government should use to induce steel firms to reduce their energy intensity and thus use the energy in the most efficient way.","[Wiboonchutikula, Paitoon] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Chaivichayachat, Bundit] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Chontanawat, Jaruwan] King Mongkuts Univ Technol, Sch Liberal Arts, Dept Social Sci & Humanities, Bangkok, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Kasetsart University; King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok; King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi,"Wiboonchutikula, P (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",Paitoon.W@chula.ac.th,"Chontanawat, Jaruwan/AAJ-1160-2021",,,,,,21,7,8,1,9,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Transition costs consist of transaction costs, fiscal costs, and the cost of uncertainty. Their size depends crucially on whether the politics of the transition are cooperative. Game theory, however, shows that there are incentives for threats of non-cooperation and for the exercise of such threats. These considerations are applied, briefly, to the debate about Scottish independence. This includes a short analysis of how transition costs can be reduced.

An analytical model is presented here explaining this productivity using salesforce workers per hour as the factor of production (the explanatory variable) and sales transactions per hour as the level of production (the explained variable). The model incorporates self-service transactions, controls for various seasonal effects (time of day, day of the week, month of the year) and generates solutions for in-store salesforce assignment across opening hours and sales points. To control for possible endogeneity between the transactions and salesforce size variables, instrumental variables are employed in the calibration process. The model is calibrated using data from a major retail chain based in Latin America both at the storewide level and for groups of individual store departments. The results corroborate the existence of diminishing returns to scale for the workers per hour factor and a significant level of self-service transactions in the total number of sales. The application of the model to the stores supplying the data confirms the systematic understaffing reported in the literature for the retail industry.","[Troncoso, Gonzalo; Carlos Munoz, Juan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Santiago, Chile; [Carlos Ferrer, Juan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile; [de Grange, Louis] Diego Portales Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"de Grange, L (通讯作者)，Diego Portales Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Vergara 432, Santiago, Chile.",louis.degrange@udp.cl,"Munoz, Juan Carlos/D-2604-2011; Ferrer, Juan-Carlos/J-5995-2012","Ferrer, Juan-Carlos/0009-0008-6275-3856",,,,,31,1,2,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We employ the open economy model by de Melo and Robinson to identify the core parameters of the real, trade side of the economy driving the unemployment effects of bilateral exchange rate realignment. A small open economy version of the model is explored analytically and a large multicountry version numerically. Analytics in the small open economy model show that unemployment effects of adjusting of a bilateral peg hinge on the fraction exported to and imported from the trading partner. A larger fraction exported to and a smaller fraction imported from the trading partner make it more likely that revaluation of a trading partner's currency has beneficial effects. Numerics in the large economy model show that Chinese revaluation can generate both positive and negative unemployment effects depending upon underlying parameter values. Adverse unemployment effects can go along with an improving trade balance.","[Bekkers, Eddy] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Francois, Joseph] Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Francois, Joseph] CEPR, London, England",Johannes Kepler University Linz; University of Bern; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Bekkers, E (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",eddy.bekkers@jku.at,"Francois, Joseph/B-6108-2017","Francois, Joseph/0000-0002-4686-7780",,,,,44,0,0,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Spillovers may attenuate with distance and the overall externality could contain positive and negative components with the overall effect being positive. We show that when the spatial externality is not internalized by firms, spatial agglomerations may emerge endogenously in a competitive equilibrium. The result does not require increasing returns at the private or the social level, increasing marginal productivity of private capital with respect to the externality, or location advantages. In fact agglomerations may emerge with decreasing returns to scale, declining marginal productivity of private capital with respect to the externality, and no location advantage. The result depends on the interactions between the structures of production technology and spatial effects as shown in the paper. No agglomerations emerge at the social optimum when spillovers are internalized and diminishing returns both from the private and the social point of view prevail. Numerical experiments with Cobb-Douglas and CES technologies and an isoelastic demand confirm our theoretical predictions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using unique data on political participation and initial public offerings by entrepreneurial firms, we find that firms controlled by entrepreneurs who participate in politics exhibit superior post-IPO performance. We also find that firms characterized by political participation are subject to less underpricing. Furthermore, the superior performance is concentrated among firms that operate in an environment characterized by rich rent-seeking opportunities instead of abundant business opportunities, suggesting that political participation is facilitating rent seeking rather than serving simply as a proxy for political recognition for entrepreneurship.

In our panel of 38,427 subnational regions from 126 countries with yearly observations from 1992 to 2009, we find that subnational regions have more intense nighttime light when being the birth region of the current political leader. We argue that this finding provides evidence for regional favoritism. We explore the dynamics and the geographical extent of regional favoritism and show that regional favoritism is most prevalent in countries with weak political institutions and poorly educated citizens.

Adoption of a new technology raises not only the productivity but also the bargaining position of the future generations, creating a bias for the current generations to preserve the current technology. Economic integration (i.e., the sharing of frontier technology among countries) promotes growth if there is a diversity in human capital distribution or a coordination failure across countries. On the other hand, political integration (i.e., the merging of countries into a single bargain) promotes stagnation as it eliminates the diversity and coordination failures.

The appreciation of house value could relax credit constraint and thus encourage entrepreneurship. However, a house serves as both an important investment channel and a prerequisite for marriage in China. The continuous high return of investment in housing and intensified marriage market competition make house purchase a priority for young people and their parents, which would crowd out entrepreneurial activities. Using two large datasets, we find that high housing price in general discourages entrepreneurial activities for urban adults. For house owners, while house value appreciation has a positive wealth effect, the ratio of mortgage over income has a negative effect. For non-owners, a higher ratio of housing price over income corresponds to a lower probability of entrepreneurship. This study highlights the negative consequences of surging housing price on entrepreneurship in developing countries. (C) 2013 Association for Comparative Economic Studies Published by Elsevier Inc.

This principle requires that restrictions of freedom and, by extension, privacy be revocable.

Under the most generous assumptions regarding the homogeneity of human capital, my analysis shows that eliminating wedges between wages in different sectors leads to gains in output of less than 5% for most countries. These estimated gains of reallocation represent an upper bound as some of the observed differences in wages are due to unmeasured human capital. Under reasonable assumptions on the amount of unmeasured human capital the gains from reallocation fall well below 3%. Compared to similar estimates made using data from the U.S., developing countries would gain more from a reallocation of human capital, but the differences are too small to account for a meaningful portion of the gap in income per capita with the United States.

Because the introduction of more liberal divorce laws permanently reduces the value of marriage relative to divorce, these permanent shocks should also affect the fertility decisions of individuals, to the extent that children are considered marriage-specific capital. Our results suggest that divorce liberalization has a negative and permanent effect on fertility. Divorce reforms have decreased the Total Fertility Rate by about 0.2. The magnitude of the effect is sizable, taking into account that the average Total Fertility Rate declined from 2.84 in 1960 to 1.66 in 2006. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and controls for observed (the liberalization of abortion and the availability of the birth-control pill, among others) and unobserved country-specific factors, as well as time-varying factors at the country level. Supplemental analysis, developed to understand the mechanisms through which divorce law reforms affect fertility, shows that both marital and out-of-wedlock fertility decline, but that the impact on marital fertility varies, depending on whether couples are married prior to or after the divorce law reforms, pointing to a selection effect on the composition of marriages.

We find that the channel through which inflation affects economic growth in the search-and-matching model is different from the traditional cash-in-advance model. To facilitate the calibration, we obtain an empirical estimate of the effects of inflation on economic growth using panel regressions. In the simulation analysis, we quantitatively evaluate the welfare effect of inflation in the search-and-matching endogenous growth model and compare it to a search-and-matching exogenous growth model.

Optimists underestimate their own probability of becoming dependent but know the average probability, while myopics underestimate both. Sophisticated procrastinators attain the first-best allocation, while myopics and optimists insure too little and save too much.

And if the answer is the second, have some other European countries been cheated? Germans think they made a big sacrifice by going into the single currency. But the reality is different. Between 1999 and 2012 the cumulative bilateral trade surpluses of Berlin with the five main Southern European Countries (the SEC: France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece) came to about (sic) 840 bn. It is thanks to that booty that Germany's net foreign financial position grew to 41.5% of GDP by 2012. There is another figure which is never discussed, because it would be most embarrassing for Germany. It is the increase between 2008 and 2012 in total foreign-held government debt of the 20 EU countries (apart from Italy) reported by Eurostat: an overall growth of (sic) 1,084 bn, while Italy's foreign-held government debt rose by only 24 bn in the same period. Germany's, by contrast, swelled by no less than (sic) 345 bn in those four years, funded with cheap interest rates at a historic low. Between 2010 and 2012 in particular, Germany's foreign-held government debt grew by (sic) 120 bn while Italy's shrank by (sic) 104 bn. If foreign investors had not turned their backs on Italy in 2011, Germans would never have found enough money on the international markets to finance all of their public debt, and would have had to keep it afloat to a large extent with their own resources. Germany which is draining southern Europe of resources, which opposes Draghi and eurobonds and is unwilling to allow a European banking supervisor to stick its nose into its own rickety local banks must finally be faced with its responsibilities and its total lack of solidarity.","[Fortis, Marco] Fdn Edison, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Fortis, Marco] Univ Cattolica Milano, Fac Sci Polit, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Fortis, M (通讯作者)，Fdn Edison, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",marco.fortis@edison.it,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

It applies a systems-based capital-theoretic perspective to explain the formation and transformation of property rights structures. The approach emphasizes how entrepreneurs create capital combinations by connecting capital goods-defined widely to include property rights, such as patents-in their production plans. Their actions change complementarity relations between property rights as used in production. We treat the property rights structure as a complex adaptive system that exhibits increasing structural complexity as it evolves. Entrepreneurs discover gaps in the property rights system. As they organize production to exploit profit opportunities, entrepreneurs regroup existing intellectual property rights (IPR) into new modules, such as patent pools, that encapsulate more complex combinations of basic building blocks of intellectual property. A patent pool constitutes an interpolation of a new meso level within the macro IPR structure. We apply our framework to the first of the patent pools for digital video compression technology used in digital television and DVDs.","NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Harper, DA (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",david.harper@nyu.edu,"Harper, David A/U-3706-2018","Harper, David A/0000-0002-4716-3638",,,,,46,14,17,1,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In this paper, I assess the quantitative effect of incomplete tax enforcement on aggregate output and productivity using a dynamic general equilibrium framework. I calibrate the model using data for Mexico, where the informal sector is large. I then investigate the effects of improving enforcement. I find that under complete enforcement. Mexico's labor productivity and output would be 19% higher under perfect competition and 34% higher under monopolistic competition. The source of this gain is the removal of the distortions induced by incomplete enforcement of taxes. These distortions affect the economy in three ways: by reducing the capital-labor ratios of informal establishments; by allowing low-productive entrepreneurs to enter; and by misallocating resources towards low-productive establishments. As a result, TFP and capital accumulation are reduced, and hence output. I decompose the gains following the guidelines of five leading papers in the literature of resource misallocation across plants. I isolate the effects of pure factor misallocation, distorted occupational choices, capital accumulation, and complementarities. I also study marginal improvements in enforcement and find that there is an inverted-U relationship between the size of the informal sector and output. This reflects the fact that improving enforcement entails a tradeoff: more taxes vs. fewer distortions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

By considering an international Cournot-Nash oligopoly with unionised home firms and non-unionised foreign firms producing substitute goods, the paper shows that the relative size of the home and foreign markets matters for the effects of a bilateral reduction in trade barriers. If the home market size is relatively larger than the foreign market size, a reduction in trade barriers, by lowering the sharable surplus for home firms and unions in the global market, gives unions incentives to choose more decentralised wage bargaining institutions. This industry-level mechanism, however, works in the opposite direction when the foreign market size is sufficiently large, including the reciprocal dumping symmetric market size model. In this case, cutting trade barriers raises the global sharable surplus and encourages domestic wage-setters to choose more centralised institutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Yet there has been a small explosion in use of quantitative approaches in the past 10-15 years, including 'mixed-methods' projects which use qualitative and quantitative methods in combination. This paper surveys the growing use of qualitative methods in economics and closely related fields, aiming to provide economists with a useful roadmap through major sets of qualitative methods and how and why they are used. We review the growing body of economic research using qualitative approaches, emphasizing the gains from using qualitative- or mixed-methods over traditional 'closed-ended' approaches. It is argued that, although qualitative methods are often portrayed as less reliable, less accurate, less powerful and/or less credible than quantitative methods, in fact, the two sets of methods have their own strengths, and how much can be learned from one type of method or the other depends on specific issues that arise in studying the topic of interest. The central message of the paper is that well-done qualitative work can provide scientifically valuable and intellectually helpful ways of adding to the stock of economic knowledge, especially when applied to research questions for which they are well suited.","Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Starr, MA (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,,,,,,115,89,167,7,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

What are the Consequences for Stability?,ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Welfare; post-transition economies; crisis; stability,DEMAND,"This paper discusses the underpinnings of the financial crisis of the last decade in post-transition countries. It explores the endogenous reasons of this crisis, and in particular a possible link between delayed and unequal growth of household incomes on the one hand and the instability of the growth and depth of recession after the financial crisis on the other. It indicates possible factors underpinning the rapidly growing indebtedness of households, enabling faster, but unsustainable growth in consumption. Furthermore, it claims also that the artificially boosted growth of consumption and a favourable proportion between wages and profits could attract investment (also FDI), possibly searching for short-term gains. It underlines that while the inflow of financial funds was the major reason for unstable growth in this region, endogenous factors also contributed.","[Lissowska, Maria] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Lissowska, Maria] Commiss European Communities, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Lissowska, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",lisso@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,6,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 18,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201413.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-13,0.0,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1ML,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339610200002,0

Workers with relatively low incomes experience envy, whereas those with relatively high incomes experience guilt. The former seek to raise their income and the latter seek to reduce it. The greater the inflation rate, the greater the degree of wage dispersion under Calvo wage contracts, and thus the greater the degree of envy and guilt experienced by the workers. Since the envy effect is stronger than the guilt effect, according to the available empirical evidence, a rise in the inflation rate leads workers to supply more labor over the contract period, generating a significant positive long-run relation between inflation and output (and employment), for low inflation rates. Provided that wage adjustments are costly, this tradeoff remains significant even once the degree of wage stickiness adjusts to the inflation rate. This Phillips curve relation, together with an inefficient zero-inflation steady state, provides a rationale for a positive long-run inflation rate. Given standard calibrations, optimal monetary policy is associated with a long-run inflation rate around 2%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting behavior tends to be biased towards simplicity: decision makers choose models that are statistically simple, in a sense we make precise.

But the gold standard was a contingent rule - in the case of an emergency like a major war or a serious financial crisis - a country could temporarily devalue its currency. The EMU has no such safety valve. Capital flows in both regimes fueled asset price booms via the banking system ending in major crises in the peripheral countries.

The higher amounts of aid attracted, however, benefit representatives only. At the same time, representatives do care about fairness.

Under strong, but standard, assumptions regarding marriage market equilibria, marital sorting patterns can be used essentially as out of sample information that allows us to assess whether household behavior is efficient or not.

These political divides involve a double invisibilization of power within economics: an invisibilization both of the political purposes served by a profession whose leading models deny the relevance of social and political power, and of the ideational barriers to entry into 'mainstream' departments.

Import demand is non-homothetic and the implications of an import price shock depend on the full distribution of firm-level adjustments. An import price shock generates a significant decline in productivity.","[Gopinath, Gita] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 206, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neiman, Brent] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Harvard University; University of Chicago,"Gopinath, G (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 206, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gopinath@harvard.edu; brent.neiman@chicagobooth.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1061954] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,41,89,103,8,52,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We develop an optimization model to assess the economic potential of dedicated energy crops when profit-maximizing farmers allocate croplands of varying quality toward biomass in response to multi-year contracts. We evaluate the economic competitiveness of perennial grasses with traditional commodity crops, in a case study of switchgrass production in Tennessee. Assuming short-term contracts, we consider the importance of payment structure, land quality, energy crop yield and projected commodity crop returns on a farmer's decision to accept a contract for biomass production. We find that a wholesale contract, in which the farmer is guaranteed a price per unit biomass, is most effective on the highest quality of land, while a contract in which the farmer is guaranteed a price per acre is most effective on lower quality land. From the biorefinery perspective, a wholesale contract is most effective for short-term contracts while an acreage contract is most effective for long-term contracts. Breakeven pricing will only secure feedstock from farmers who produce commodity crops with unfavorable price outlooks on lower quality land; therefore, the contract price must include a premium in order to compete for space in the crop mix. The yield profile of energy crops has a significant effect on the terms at which short-term contracts will be accepted and land allocated toward feedstock production. The extent to which energy crop yields observed in field trials can be maintained at commercial scale also has a substantial effect on the scale at which farmers would be willing to participate in energy crop production.

We find that the majority of China's export-embodied CO2 is associated with production of machinery and equipment rather than energy-intensive products, such as steel and aluminum. In 2007, the largest net recipients of embodied CO2 emissions from China include the EU (360 million metric tons, mmt), the US (337 mmt) and Japan (109 mmt). Overall, annual CO2 emissions embodied in China's net exports totaled 1177 mmt, equal to 22% of China's total CO2 emissions. We also develop a global general equilibrium model with a detailed treatment of energy and CO2 emissions. We use the model to analyze the impact of a sectoral shift in the Chinese economy away from industry and towards services, both without and with a decrease in China's trade surplus, and a tax on energy-intensive exports, which reflect policy objectives in China's Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011-2015). We find that without a decrease in the trade surplus, both policies will have a limited impact on China's net exports of embodied CO2 emissions. The policies have an even smaller effect on global emissions, as reduced production in China is partially offset by increased production elsewhere. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; DAMAGES; SCALE,"A balance between industrial pollution prevention and economic growth becomes a world-wide issue to develop a sustainable society in many industrial nations. To discuss the issue, this study proposes a new use of DEA environmental assessment to determine how to effectively allocate capital for developing regional industries. The amount of capital is used to invest for technology innovation for both local economic growth and environmental protection. In this study, the proposed approach separates outputs into desirable and undesirable categories. Inputs are also separated into two categories, one of which indicates an amount of investment on capital assets. The other category is used for production activities. The proposed approach unifies them by two disposability concepts. This study has evaluated the performance of manufacturing industries in 47 prefectures (local government units in Japan) by Unified Efficiency under Natural disposability (UEN), Unified Efficiency under Managerial disposability (UEM) and Unified Efficiency under Natural and Managerial disposability (UENM). The UENM is further separated into its two cases: with and without a possible occurrence on desirable congestion, or technology innovation, on undesirable outputs. This study has empirically confirmed that Japanese manufacturing industries need to make their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution substances by investing in technology innovation. Furthermore, most of economic activities are currently located at metropolitan regions (e.g., Tokyo) in Japan. To develop a sustainable society, Japan needs to allocate capital into regions with a high level of investment effectiveness by shifting the manufacturing industries from the metropolitan regions to much promising local areas identified in this study. Such a shift, along with technology innovation, makes it possible to reduce air pollutions in the entire Japan by balancing economic growth and pollution prevention. This empirical study confirms that the proposed approach is useful in both guiding regional planning and developing a sustainable society. It is easily envisioned that the proposed approach is useful for not only Japan but also the other industrial and developing nations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our results reveal that lower final government consumption increases private consumption in three out of the four approaches, when a fiscal consolidation occurs, and the debt ratio is above the cross-country average. The magnitude of these coefficients is higher for countries with lower debt levels, implying more successful consolidations associated with reduced crowding-out effects. There is some evidence of non-Keynesian effects for both private consumption and private investment and the effects of social transfers on private investment tend to be negative, both in the short and long run. In a financial crisis, such effects are also more prone to happen. Finally, raising long-term interest rates reduces per capita private investment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

There are two informal sectors which obtain production loans from a monopolistic moneylender and employ labour from the informal labour market On the other hand, the formal sector employs labour at an institutionally fixed wage rate and takes loans from the competitive formal credit market. We show that an inflow of foreign capital and/or an emigration of labour raises (lowers) the informal (formal) interest rate but lowers the competitive wage rate in the informal labour market when the informal manufacturing sector is more capital-intensive vis-a-vis the informal agricultural sector. International factor mobility, therefore, raises the degrees of distortions in both the factor markets in this case. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The manufacturer acts as the Stackelberg leader who specifies wholesale price for each retailer. The two retailers compete with each other in advertising and they have different sales costs. The manufacturer uses one of the following two pricing strategies: (i) setting the same wholesale price for both the retailers irrespective of the difference in their sales costs: (ii) setting different wholesale prices for the retailers depending on their sales costs. Two models are developed. In the first model, the manufacturer shares a fraction of each retailer's advertising cost while in the second model, the manufacturer does not share any retailer's advertising expenses. In both the models, we derive the retailers and manufacturer's optimal strategies. A numerical example is given to illustrate the theoretical results developed in each model Computational results show that it is always beneficial for the manufacturer to adopt different wholesale pricing strategy for the retailers.

The task of optimizing highly evolved supply chains is not easy, especially when it is particularly sensitive to unexpected disruption. This paper presents a newly developed real-time recovery mechanism for a two stage serial supply chain system, consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer, where the production is disrupted for a given period of time during the production up time. The model is capable of determining the recovery schedule for the manufacturer and the retailer, and ensuring that the total relevant costs are minimized, while seeking to recover the original schedule by the end of the recovery time window. The model was solved using an efficient heuristic developed in this paper, which performed well in giving quality solutions within reasonable time. It can be shown that the optimal recovery schedule is dependent on the shortage cost parameters, as well as on the extent of the disruption. The presented model is useful to assist decision makers to take a pro-active approach for maintaining business continuity in the event of a disruption in the supply chain system.

The only positive and statistically significant effect of grants is that on administrative personnel.","[Lundqvist, Helene] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lundqvist, Helene] UCFS, CESifo, Uppsala, Sweden; [Lundqvist, Helene; Dahlberg, Matz; Mork, Eva] UCLS, Uppsala, Sweden; [Dahlberg, Matz] Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res IBF, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Dahlberg, Matz; Mork, Eva] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Dahlberg, Matz] UCFS, Inst Evaluat Labour Market & Educ Policy IFAU, CESifo, IEB, Uppsala, Sweden; [Mork, Eva] UCFS, CESifo, IEB, Inst Study Labor IZA, Uppsala, Sweden",Stockholm University; Uppsala University; Uppsala University,"Lundqvist, H (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",helene.lundqvist@ne.su.se; matz.dahlberg@nek.uu.se; eva.mork@nek.uu.se,"Mörk, Eva/ITV-6744-2023","Mörk, Eva/0000-0002-3944-603X; Berg, Helene/0000-0002-4015-8780",,,,,39,20,26,1,11,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

According to the proximity-concentration trade-off argument, a surge in FDI in times of decaying international transportation costs seemingly represents a paradox. Besides transportation costs, other factors have contextually changed: in particular, the uncertainty that firms bear has increased. Enriching the classical choice problem of a multinational firm with insights from the literature on investment under uncertainty, we illustrate how different types of uncertainty determine the timing and optimal entry mode (i.e. FDI or export) of a multinational enterprise into a new market.","[Yalcin, Erdal] CESifo, Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Sala, Davide] Univ Southern Denmark, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark",Ifo Institut; University of Southern Denmark,"Yalcin, E (通讯作者)，CESifo, Inst Econ Res, Poschinger Str 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",yalcin@ifo.de,,"Yalcin, Erdal/0000-0001-9459-1718",,,,,25,5,6,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This study examines what factors influence the enactment of laws using a data set of the 90 laws enacted over 2001-2010 in 30 states. Odds of enacting laws are mostly unrelated to state variation in education, population density, income, political party structure and obesity prevalence. Factors that significantly influence number of laws include education, black and Hispanic percentages of population and age. Examination of categories of laws indicates cases where political party structure and obesity prevalence influence cumulative numbers of laws, but often in conflicting directions. The negative but weak (p=0.054) effect of obesity prevalence on the cumulative number of all laws also suggests that state governments that enact most laws are those with relatively low obesity prevalence. This study indicates opportunities for future research to examine which laws addressing obesity are most effective among the diverse experiments taking place across the states.","Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Marlow, ML (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",mmarlow@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,7,4,11,0,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Sellers cannot observe a potential buyer's remaining time until deadline nor her quote history, and hence post prices that weigh the probability of sale versus the profit once sold.

We analyze with various estimators how these relationships are affected by foreign aid flows by focusing on 78 developing countries for 1984-2008. Both types of terrorism are found to depress FDI. Aggregate aid mitigates the negative consequences of domestic and transnational terrorism, but this aid appears more robust in ameliorating the adverse effect of domestic terrorism. However, when aid is subdivided, bilateral aid is effective in reducing the adverse effects of transnational terrorism on FDI, whereas multilateral aid is effective in curbing the adverse effects of domestic terrorism on FDI. For transnational terrorism, there is evidence in the literature that donor countries earmark some bilateral aid to counterterrorism. Aid's ability to curb the risk to FDI from terrorism is important because FDI is an important engine of development.","[Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO USA; [Sandler, Todd] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Younas, Javed] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; American University of Sharjah,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO USA.",tsandler@utdallas.edu,"Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/I-5739-2016","Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/0000-0003-1626-6543",,,,,31,111,128,0,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

An objective of this paper is to analyze moments of the estimator in the first-order autoregressive model with a unit root and nonnormal errors. In particular, we develop new analytical approximations for the first two moments in terms of model parameters and the distribution parameters.

In our model, a bank can increase the risk of its asset portfolio (risk shift), convert bank assets to the personal benefit of the bank manager (loot), or do both. A regulator has three policy tools: it can restrict the bank's investment choices; it can make looting more costly; and it can force banks to hold more equity. Capital regulation may increase looting, and in extreme cases even risk shifting. Looting penalties reduce both looting and risk-shifting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The estimated results and significant tests indicate that a certain degree of urban-rural income polarization is beneficial to economic growth at the provincial level in both stages for China as a whole, though the contribution of urban-rural income polarization to economic growth is relatively small. Aggravating urban-rural income polarization has a negative impact on economic growth in China. Based on a cluster analysis of regional economic growth at the provincial level, the authors carried out the same analysis separately for two categories of regions too. The results for those two categories of regions show that positive correlations also exist between urban-rural income polarization and economic growth in both stages, which are very similar to the analysis for the whole of China. In addition, a meaningful finding can be derived that the contribution of consumption growth rate to economic growth rate in the second stage is smaller than that in the first stage obviously.","[Chen, F.; Sun, X.] Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Nanchang 330031, Peoples R China",Nanchang University,"Chen, F (通讯作者)，Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Nanchang 330031, Peoples R China.",chenfei@ncu.edu.cn,"Chen, Fei/JQV-7806-2023","Sun, Xiangwei/0000-0002-7942-4142",,,,,39,9,10,3,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Most of that work has focused almost exclusively on developed economies. In what we believe to be a first effort, our emphasis is solely on developing economics, which we classify as high-income and low-income developing countries (HIDC and LIDC). We make such distinction on theoretical and empirical grounds. Empirically, the World Bank has classified developing economies in this manner since 1978. The data in our sample are also supportive of such classifications. We provide theoretical scaffolding that uses asymmetric credit constraints as a premise for separating developing economies in such a way. We find strong evidence of a negative relationship between income inequality and economic growth in LIDC to be in stark contrast with a positive inequality-growth relationship for HIDC. Both correlations are statistically significant across multiple econometric specifications. Using international data from 1960 to 2010, this article explores the effect of income inequality on economic growth using dynamic panel technique, such as system generalized method of moments (GMM) that is believed to mitigate endogenous problem. These results are strikingly contrasting to the previous estimation results of Forbes (2000) displaying significant positive correlation between two variables in the short to medium term.","[Fawaz, Fadi] Univ Jamestown, Dept Econ, Jamestown, ND 58405 USA; [Rahnama, Masha; Valcarcel, Victor J.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Fawaz, F (通讯作者)，Univ Jamestown, Dept Econ, Jamestown, ND 58405 USA.",ffawaz@uj.edu,"Valcarcel, Victor/H-5590-2017","Valcarcel, Victor/0000-0002-6642-3239",,,,,32,23,28,5,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It earned scientific attention more than 20 years ago, and at present is increasingly establishing itself in public sector as a measure to reduce operation costs and provide qualitative services. This article presents the analysis of the field that has earned little scientific attention - the factors of employment outsourcing. That is why the aim of the article is to establish the factors determining the choice of employment outsourcing in both public and private sectors. With reference to the results of expert evaluation, the main differences and similarities buying employment services from outside in public and private sectors have been identified. In private sector, the factor that has a positive impact on employment outsourcing is absence of personnel department while in public sector, competences of the companies that provide employment services and available database resources are considered to be the most influential factors. The experts from both sectors were unanimous appointing it is the factors having the impact while choosing an outsourcing service provider. Employment outsourcing in public sector is negatively influenced by reluctance to dismiss long-term employees as well as poor quality of the service and increased costs. The latter factors also determine the actions in private sector to refuse a current outsourcing supplier and switch to another.","[Gaspareniene, Ligita; Remeikiene, Rita; Startiene, Grazina] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Gaspareniene, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves St 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ligita.vasiliauskiene@ktu.lt; rita.remeikiene@ktu.lt; grazina.startiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,25,1,1,2,25,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Such an issue is especially relevant for these countries insofar as they tend to be more unstable than developed countries. In addition, they suffer from larger cumulative output losses that have long-lasting negative effects on growth. If the earlier literature has suggested that emerging countries conduct pro-cyclical policies that exacerbate the impact of shocks, recent findings drawn from the experience of the global financial crisis show that they tend to more frequently adopt counter-cyclical monetary policies. However, even in the last crisis, all countries did not conduct expansionary monetary policies. Among the factors explaining such a behavior, the literature identifies the currency mismatch. This paper is related to this literature. It analyzes monetary policy responses to common financial shocks over the period 1995-2010 for a sample of ten emerging European countries. Emerging Europe has especially suffered from the global financial crisis. Three monetary instruments are analyzed: the nominal short-term interest rate, the real exchange rate, and the foreign exchange reserves. Our empirical methodology used structural Bayesian vector autoregressive (SBVAR) models over two crises periods (1995Q1-2001Q4 and 2002Q1-2010Q4). Our main findings are the following. First, common international financial shocks lead to different monetary policy responses. Second, countries with high currency mismatch ratios suffer from both fear of floating and fear of losing international reserves. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

They present special features that differentiate them from other investment funds, in which the most important are their traded shares. Their share prices are market oriented and are not necessarily strongly correlated with the value of their portfolio, i.e, their Net Asset Value (NAV). Then, the relationship between share return, net asset value variation and market return goes beyond the understanding of traditional models, like CAPM, puzzling investors. Hence, the objective of this paper is to analyze the dynamics of share return and NAV variation of Brazilian ETFs and how they behave in relation to the Brazilian Market. We use the Dynamic Conditional Correlation of Engle (2002) to analyze these dynamics. Our results point that the correlation between Share and Market returns were higher that the correlation between NAV variation and Market return, indicating that an investor who buys ETF share is more exposed to Market risk than the risk of the ETF fund portfolio. Another important issue regarding the crisis periods is that the DCC between Share and Market return showed that before the subprime crisis, there was a correlation drop, indicating that ETF market suffers some kind of effect that could be a crisis forecast. But during the Euro zone debt crisis, the correlation drop happened concomitantly with the volatility increment, i.e., with the crisis. That can be because of different natures of the crises, since the former was a financial crisis and the latter an economic crisis. We also find that when not in a financial crisis period, the ETF's returns are more linked with the overall market, but during financial crisis periods, investors seek to trade ETF shares by their NAV value. During the economic crisis, however, the opposite effect seems to occur: the correlation between Share and Market return remains higher than 0.95, but the correlation between Share return and NAV variation drops to very low standards.","[Milani, Bruno; Ceretta, Paulo Sergio] Univ Fed Santa Maria, BR-97119900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"Milani, B (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Maria, Ave Roraima 1000,Predio 74C, BR-97119900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",milani_bruno@yahoo.com.br; ceretta@smail.ufsm.br,"Ceretta, Paulo/AAK-3382-2020","Ceretta, Paulo Sergio/0000-0001-8264-0439",,,,,35,2,2,0,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, this power can also be used by managers to exploit their subordinates for their own benefit. We examine the relationship between the power to coerce and exploitation in a laboratory experiment where a senior and a junior player interact repeatedly for a finite number of periods. We find that senior players try repeatedly to use their power to exploit junior workers. These attempts are successful only when junior workers have incomplete information about how their effort impacts on the earnings of senior players, but not when they have complete information. Evidence from an incentive-compatible questionnaire indicates that the social acceptability of exploitation depends on whether the junior worker can detect she is being exploited. We also show how a history of exploitation affects future interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

If all births take place in the late reproduction period, there exists no stable stationary equilibrium and the economy exhibits cyclical dynamics due to labor growth fluctuations. We characterize the long-run social optimum and show that optimal consumptions and capital depend on the optimal cohort growth factor, so that there is no one-to-one substitutability between early and late fertility.

Twenty-eight transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States are investigated over 1991-2007, and three systems for classifying de facto exchange rate regimes are considered. As in the empirical literature, the exchange rate regime effect on growth initially differs depending on the classification system. However, further investigation suggests that the three classification systems differ with respect to some inherent characteristics of the transition process, like the increased trade openness of the countries, episodes of high inflation, banking system reform, and interest rate liberalization. This study's results indicate that high inflation likely caused the disagreement as to how to classify different regimes in the early transition period, while trade openness and interest rate liberalization caused such disagreement in the late transition period. After these points of disagreement are cleared up and potential selectivity bias is corrected for, the final results suggest that in all three classification systems, both pegs and intermediate regimes significantly outperform floats in terms of economic growth-the average effect being slightly lower for pegs.","[Petreski, Marjan] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Petreski, Marjan] Amer Univ, Coll Skopje, Sch Business Econ & Management, Skopje, Macedonia",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Petreski, M (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Petreski, Marjan/A-6336-2018","Petreski, Marjan/0000-0002-2675-8325",,,,,37,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

By contrast, this paper's contribution is to develop a theoretical concept for which the focus is upon the sizes of welfare gains accruing from policy reforms rather than upon their signs. In undertaking this task, and by focusing on tariff reforms, we introduce the concept of a steepest ascent policy reform, which is a locally optimal reform in the sense that it achieves the highest marginal gain in utility of any feasible local reform. We argue that this reform presents itself as a natural benchmark for the evaluation of the welfare effectiveness of other popular tariff reforms such as the proportional tariff reduction and the concertina rules, since it provides the maximal welfare gain of all possible local reforms. We derive properties of the steepest ascent tariff reform, construct an index to measure the relative welfare effectiveness of any given tariff reform, determine conditions under which proportional and concertina reforms are locally optimal and provide illustrative examples.","[Raimondos-Moller, Pascalis] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Woodland, Alan D.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Copenhagen Business School; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Woodland, AD (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",A.Woodland@unsw.edu.au,"Woodland, Alan/AAG-6239-2020; Woodland, Alan/J-9157-2012","Woodland, Alan/0000-0003-0523-6517; Woodland, Alan/0000-0003-0523-6517; Raimondos, Pascalis/0000-0002-8580-3595",,,,,29,2,2,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The study relies on a sample of 2678 individual faculty, from five Spanish universities, who have been recipients of publicly funded grants or have been principal investigators in activities contracted by external agents over the period 1999-2004. By implementing a propensity score matching estimator method, we show that engaging in consulting activities has an overall negative relationship with the average number of ISI-publications. However, the effect of consulting on the scientific productivity of academic scientists depends on the scientific fields and the intensity of engagement in consulting activities. Academic consulting is found to be negatively correlated with the number of publications in the fields of 'Natural and Exact Sciences' and 'Engineering', but not in the case of 'Social Sciences and Humanities'. When the intensity of consulting activity is taken into account at the discipline level, we find that engaging in consulting activities is negatively correlated with scientific productivity only for high levels of involvement in consulting activities, but not for moderate ones.

It generates destruction costs. These costs have an important effect on individuals' decisions to cooperate or conflict. We develop two models of conflict: one in which conflict's destruction costs are independent of individuals' investments in arms the tools of conflict and another in which conflict's destruction costs depend on those investments. Our models demonstrate that when conflict's destruction costs are arms-dependent, conflict is more costly, making cooperation more likely. We test this prediction with a laboratory experiment in which subjects first choose how heavily to invest in arms and then choose whether to cooperate or conflict in an environment where interaction is repeated. In one set of treatments conflict's destruction costs are arms-independent. In another they are arms-dependent. Our experimental results support our models' predictions. Compared to when conflict's destruction costs are arms-independent. when those costs are arms-dependent, cooperation increases by nearly a third. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The USA, Switzerland, Australia, South Korea and Russia are of particular significance in the interbank lending market. Switzerland, the UK, Poland, Australia and Canada play a pivotal role in the public debt market. The analysis under the multivariate framework reveals substantial heterogeneity in the network structure of both markets. Only 12% of causal relationships coincide, which may fuel financial contagion. Volatility spillovers underlie the causal linkages. They are estimated by means of dynamic volatility indices based on rolling correlation matrices and help identify the transformation of the international banking turmoil into the sovereign debt crisis.","Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Dept Appl Econ, Moscow, Russia",MGIMO University,"Stolbov, M (通讯作者)，Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Dept Appl Econ, Moscow, Russia.",stolbov_mi@mail.ru,"Stolbov, Mikhail/O-9503-2015","Stolbov, Mikhail/0000-0002-2066-7633",,,,,38,2,2,0,17,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2014,61.0,3,,,,,331,348,,10.2298/PAN1403331S,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AK0HG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338092900005,0

The process continues until the prevailing status quo is no longer challenged. We impose a one-time deviation restriction on the feasible policy processes, reflecting the farsightedness of voters. The key feature of the solution is history dependence. The existence of the solution is proven by iterating a version of the uncovered set. We show that the resulting fixed point is the largest set of outcomes that can be implemented via any policy process that meets the one-deviation restriction. Finally, we relate our solution to a concrete noncooperative model and show that it can be interpreted as a refinement of the solution of Bernheim and Slavov (2009) in the context of repeated voting, and of the solution of Konishi and Ray (2003) and Vartiainen (2011) in the context of coalition formation.","Univ Helsinki, Helskinki Ctr Econ Res, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Vartiainen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Helskinki Ctr Econ Res, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",hannu.vartiainen@helsinki.fi,,,,,,,34,6,7,0,15,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the VTE when the stationary distribution of the GARCH process has infinite fourth moment. Existing studies of historical asset returns indicate that this may be a case of empirical relevance. Under suitable technical conditions, we establish a stable limit theory for the VTE, with the rate of convergence determined by the tails of the stationary distribution. This rate is slower than that achieved by the QMLE. The limit distribution of the VTE is nondegenerate but singular. We investigate the use of subsampling techniques for inference, but find that finite sample performance is poor in empirically relevant scenarios.","[Vaynman, Igor; Beare, Brendan K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Vaynman, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,"Beare, Brendan/GYJ-4599-2022","Beare, Brendan/0000-0001-9146-131X",,,,,45,9,10,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0731-9053,,978-1-78441-182-4; 978-1-78441-183-1,ADV ECONOMETRICS,,,2014,33.0,,,,,,639,672,,10.1108/S0731-905320140000033018,0.0,,,34,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360559300019,0

This procedure comprises the selection of the optimum alternative with respect to the evaluation criteria under consideration, in particular to select the strategy of investing. However, the selection of the investment strategy is difficult on account of considering the numerous quantitative and qualitative parameters like benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks. However, it is possible that these parameters have a significant influence on each other. A decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), used to define the influential network of elements, can be employed to construct a network relationship map (NRM). On the other hand, according to whether the information is incomplete or unavailable, uncertainty is an inseparable part of making decision for solving the MCDM problems. Therefore, this article proposes a new hybrid model based on analytic hierarchical process (AHP), DEMATEL, and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) techniques under fuzzy environment to evaluate the problem of the selection of the investment strategy. To achieve the aim, a three-step process is presented to solve a sophisticated problem. First, the AHP method is employed to break down the investment problem into simple structure and calculate the importance weights of criteria by using a pair-wise comparison process. Second, the DEMATEL technique is applied for considering interdependence and dependencies and computing the global weights of benefit, opportunities, cost, and risk (BOCR) factors. Finally, the fuzzy TOPSIS methodology is used for prioritising the possible alternatives. To demonstrate the potential application of the proposed model, a numerical example is illustrated and investigated. The results show that the proposed model has a high ability to prioritise the strategies of investing.","[Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza] Islamic Azad Univ, Young Researchers & Elite Club, South Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Shariati, Shahram] Islamic Azad Univ, Sari Branch, Dept Geol, Sari, Iran; [Yakhchali, Siamak Haji] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Vilnius, Lithuania",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University; University of Tehran; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Vilnius, Lithuania.",edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza/ABH-5851-2020; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza/0000-0001-5594-7726; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X",,,,,88,26,26,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

If proposers, learnt fast that low offers are doomed to be rejected and adjusted their offers accordingly, pressure, would be lifted from responders to learn to accept such offers. Play would thus converge toward equal, sharing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that it is regret both material and strategic which determines, how players adapt their behavior. We conducted a repeated ultimatum game experiment with, randomly changing strangers. One treatment offers players only feedback about the outcome of their, play. Another treatment offers additional information about the median outcomes in the population. We find that regret is a good predictor of the dynamics of play, in particular of proposer behavior., Except for a very short endgame phase, in which more tolerance of less equitable sharing surfaced, behavior converges toward equal sharing.

The purpose of this empirical analysis is to determine the influence of price, income, and spatial spillovers on residential electricity demand in Spain. We are particularly interested in analyzing the impact of household disposable income variation across provinces observed during the economic crisis period 2009-2010.

The YP4 trial, conducted from 2005 to 2009, sought to evaluate, by randomised control method, an approach proposed by Campbell etal. (2003) for integrating delivery of employment, housing, health and other services for young homeless jobseekers. Rather than providing extra access to services or utilisation of different services, the YP4 trial involved assignment of a case manager to tailor and coordinate available services to reflect the specific circumstances of young homeless jobseekers. We find that the YP4 program did not have a significant effect on economic or psychological well-being, a finding that is robust to application of experimental and quasi-experimental methods.

In particular, we discuss the difficulties of analytically addressing his theory and the new scientific frontiers opened by agent-based modeling. Hyman Minsky's work is known as the reference point for several critical strands of standard economic theory. Through these strands, he tries to provide a financial interpretation of Keynes's General Theory. Minsky's main research findings converge into the financial instability hypothesis (FIH), according to which in a system based on capitalistic dynamics and characterized by growing and complex financial relations, the economy tends to move from a stable system to a frail one. What causes the economy to become more fragile is derived endogenously from inherent speculative behavior of a financial nature. However, it is not easy to formalize the FIH into a rigorous analytical model. In this regard, we present a survey of Minsky's unorthodox contribution and the recent development of simulation-agent-based models as a new research agenda that can help to model his FIH.","[Bucciarelli, Edgardo; Silvestri, Marcello] Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Philosoph Pedag & Econ Quantitat Sci, Chieti, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Bucciarelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Philosoph Pedag & Econ Quantitat Sci, Chieti, Italy.",,,,,,,,91,4,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

In some regions of Russia and in some types of production these co-operatives are strong. Since production co-operatives constitute a type of vertical integration, the present study uses transaction cost theory to explore the worker-members' preference for production co-operatives. Our data originate from a survey of 1,401 co-operative members in Kurgan region. Findings indicate that the workers would face enormous transaction costs if they were to choose another organisational form, and are in effect locked into the co-operatives just as workers used to be locked into the kolkhozy and sovkhozy. The most reasonable explanation for this is that workers have motivational factors that link them to their co-operatives. In addition, the powerful leaders of the co-operatives have an interest in the workers remaining members of the co-operatives.","[Golovina, Svetlana] Kurgan State Agr Acad, Kurgan, Russia; [Nilsson, Jerker] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; [Wolz, Axel] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany",Kurgan State Agricultural Academy; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Nilsson, J (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala, Sweden.",Jerker.Nilsson@ekon.slu.se,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Golovina, Svetlana/D-2949-2014","Golovina, Svetlana/0000-0002-1157-8487",,,,,46,9,9,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,DEC 1,2013,25.0,4,,,,,465,491,,10.1080/14631377.2013.844929,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,267OT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328107900003,0

Students in Norway who completed certain graduate study programs between autumn 1990 and 1995 on stipulated time were entitled to a restitution of approximately 3000 USD from the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund. Comparing treated and untreated (control) programs in a difference-in-differences framework, we find that the average delay in the treatment group decreased by 0.8 semester during the reform period, and by 1.5 semesters in the following two years. Number of years treated matters strongly, with delays reduced by 0.23 semesters per year treated. Furthermore, there is some indication that it is important that treatment starts before the final part of the educational programs. The share of on-time graduation increases by 3.8 percentage points per year treated, from a pre-reform level of about 20%. Thus, a large share of the restitutions given will be for students who would otherwise not have graduated on time.

For aggregate analyses, it may suffice to use traditional trip assignment approaches. However, investigations of drivers' choices with respect to network infrastructure changes require disaggregate and behavioural approaches. It is often crucial to investigate the effects of critical infrastructure elements in the network on drivers' route choice behaviour. The case of Montreal is of particular interest because the city, an island, is completely separated from the rest of the region by two important rivers. Consequently, drivers have to select one of the available bridges to reach their destination. A large-scale travel survey conducted in Montreal in 2008 is used for empirical investigations. It is a one-day trip diary of approximately 4% of the city's population and includes the bridge chosen in the itinerary for car driver trips. An advanced discrete choice model that jointly models choice set formation and final choice is then formulated and estimated using the observed trips. The empirical model correctly identifies the effects of travel time interacting with time of day and destination trip purpose. Empirical results show that age, gender and household auto ownership explain the variation of scale parameters of route/bridge choice. A discussion of the model's performance is provided along with further result analysis and perspectives for further work. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The fuel price scenarios are based on forecasts by the US Department of Energy (DOE-US) and the International Energy Agency (IEA-OECD) and represent a wide range of projections for absolute and relative fossil fuel prices. In terms of the long term economic impact, our results suggest a 1.9 % drop in GDP in the DOE-US scenario and 1.6 % in the IEA-OECD scenario. As to the budgetary impact, higher fuel prices lead to lower tax revenues, which, coupled with a reduction in public spending, translate into lower public deficits. Accordingly, increasing fuel prices create an important policy trade off in that they can contribute to reducing the public deficit while hindering economic growth. We find that fairly strong incentives for wind energy can reduce the economic impact of fuel prices by 14.2 % in the DOE-US price scenario and 18.5 % reduction in the IEA-OECD price scenario. Finally, our results highlight the importance of public sector spending decisions and the mechanisms of endogenous growth in understanding the impact of fossil fuel prices. Indeed, a scenario of higher fuel prices would, with exogenous public decisions and exogenous economic growth assumptions, result in substantially smaller economic effects and yield adverse budgetary effects.","[Pereira, Alfredo Marvao; Pereira, Rui Marvao] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Pereira, AM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",pereira770@aol.com; rmpereira@wm.edu,,"Pereira, Alfredo Marvao/0000-0003-1381-0937",Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/ECO/72065/2006] Funding Source: FCT,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),,,36,3,3,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

The intensity principle allows comparing the intensity of precaution incentives under different damages regimes, such as strict liability, proportional liability, and the negligence rule.

However a majority of respondents were willing to allow government authorities to withhold information about the details of threats to the financial system and to buildings if revealing the information might compromise future investigations. While the public generally recognizes the importance of keeping some information secret, a democratically elected government should seek to understand the preferences of its citizens on important policy issues related to public safety and security.

The situation is illustrated in a game theoretical model, with a manager, donor, certifier, and the charity providing a charitable good: for simplicity, charity is either good or bad: A good charity spends all the resources on the charitable good, and a bad one diverts all resources to the private consumption of its manager (for-profit in disguise). We show that for a wide parameter range and for two different disclosure rules, the presence of a certifier in the market increases the incentives for managers to choose good charities, leading to an improvement in the market as the share of good charities increases.","Anglo Amer Univ, Prague 11800, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University,"Svítková, K (通讯作者)，Anglo Amer Univ, Lazenska 4, Prague 11800, Czech Republic.",katarina.svitkova@aauni.edu,,,,,,,17,1,1,1,12,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

To analyse this in a systematic way, different time series sample periods are constructed from annual data for 17 OECD countries covering the overall period 1960 to 2008. The specific price decomposition under consideration, often used to estimate asymmetric price response models of energy demand, separates the impact of prices above the previous maximum, of a price recovery below the previous maximum and of a price cut. Therefore, the analysis does not just involve using different time periods; instead, for each time period investigated, a new dataset is constructed and for each dataset, the price variable is decomposed in this way. An energy demand relationship allowing for asymmetric price responses is therefore estimated for each different sample period and the results suggest that recalculation of the decomposed price variables for each different period does affect the stability of the estimated energy demand responses. In contrast, a similarly estimated energy demand relationship with symmetric price responses for each different sample period is found to have less instability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By structurally relying on debt for the funding of their operations, firms operating in externally dependent (ED) sectors in OECD countries benefit from the tax shield provided by the tax-deductibility of debt interest payments. We conjecture that this tax advantage is likely to make them less sensitive to changes in home and host countries' corporate tax rates than firms in non-ED sectors when engaging in FDI. Using a new proprietary data on bilateral greenfield manufacturing FDI in OECD countries over the period 2003 to 2010, we find empirical support for this hypothesis as firms operating in externally dependent sectors appear to be much less sensitive to home and host corporate tax rates than firms operating in nonexternally dependent sectors.","[Azemar, Celine] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Desbordes, Rodolphe] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow; University of Strathclyde,"Azémar, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Main Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",celine.azemar@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Azemar, Celine/0000-0002-0560-8934; Desbordes, Rodolphe/0000-0002-9190-7331",,,,,14,1,1,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This article aims to contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of this process through the use of an agent-based model. Simulations show a plausible dynamics of the process of technological innovation as generated by consumption of positional nature. An interpretation of the results in the scope of the policy discussion in question is provided. The influence of key factors such as income inequality, the materialization of the Hirsch conjecture, and characteristics of the network of relative preferences, is analised.

To study whether a worker's own promise of effort level governs his real choice of effort in a gift exchange game, we implement four treatments in our experiments by varying two factors: (1) who (the firm or the worker) takes the position of the proposer to propose the contract and (2) whether the proposed contract includes a nonbinding specification of the worker's effort level. Our key finding is that when it is the worker who proposes the contract and the contract includes the worker's promised effort level, both the worker's actual effort choice and the aggregate profits are significantly higher than in each of the other three treatments (and there is little difference in worker effort otherwise).

Women who bear a male first child in countries dominated by traditional, patrilocal households are shown to have substantially lower subsequent fertility from those whose first child is female. Where households are generally nuclear, male first borns do not reduce subsequent fertility. Middle-aged women in more patrilocal contexts often work less if their first child is male, despite reduced fertility and being more likely to reside with a daughter-in-law. In more nuclear contexts, they tend to work more. These findings suggest that household formation rules are strongly related both to women's demand for sons and to the direction of intergenerational transfers.

We find that some regions of the world have fully converged, but the advanced economies and Sub-Saharan Africa are not converging. In addition, while most countries have fully converged within their own region, notable exceptions are also identified.

The most important EUA price drivers are changes on the stock market and energy prices. The gas price and a broad European equity index affect the EUA price positively in both regimes, while the coal price and the oil price have a significant, but also positive impact only during the high and the low volatility regime, respectively. The high volatility regime is predominant in phases when economic activities are on a decrease or when institutional changes harm the confidence in the stringency of the EU ETS.

To tackle this issue, this paper examines the diversity of the roles and goals of ODA. The ODA paradigm has evolved from an economic view (1950s-60s), poverty reduction (1960s-70s) and social development (1970s-90s) to sustainable development (1990s-2000s). This paper focuses on examining the effects of ODA in terms of changing goals at different times. To do so, a panel data analysis was conducted for countries receiving ODA and categorized by the OECD DAC from 1960 to 2011(sometimes 1980-2011). The results of analysis show that the diverse effects of ODA on developing countries vary depending on the political (e.g., national transparency) or economic (e.g., income level) conditions of individual countries. For example, ODA is effective for certain countries in poverty reduction (as explained by the integrated development model), while for others, it is more effective in economic growth. Interestingly, national transparency and income level moderate ODA effectiveness and sometimes change the roles and goals of ODA. Furthermore, strategic ODA implementation is expected to enable developing countries to move toward sustainable national development, and make the concept of ownership and ODA for trade more important. Trade can be a powerful engine for growth and development in ODA recipient countries. ODA for trade, accordingly, is expected to help recipient countries use trade more effectively to promote growth and poverty reduction as well as achieve their development objectives. To this end, they need to get ownership from donor countries. To build up ownership, donors need to give ODA to countries with conditions that require improving national transparency or good governance.","[Oh, Cheol H.] Soongsil Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Soongsil University,"Oh, CH (通讯作者)，Soongsil Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,75,1,1,0,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

These results suggest that the share of the working-age population relative to the total population does not have a strong influence on GDP per capita. Therefore, the contribution of the working-age population to economic growth might not be as large as previously assumed.

Several new emissions multipliers are proposed to measure sectoral carbon efficiency. These principles are used in an empirical analysis of carbon emissions in China, and differences between the principles are compared. The results indicate that all principles considered can prevent double-counting of emissions but that different principles may lead to significantly different attributions of responsibility for carbon emissions and to different multiplier values for particular sectors. Electricity and heat supply is found to be the sector with the highest emissions responsibility under all but the consumer responsibility principle, as well as the highest carbon multiplier under all principles. However, this sector's responsibility under producer responsibility principles is greater than that under other principles. Basic metals and transportation and post and telecommunication are among the top five sectors with the greatest responsibilities under all but the consumer responsibility principle, whereas construction has the highest consumer responsibility among all sectors.

There is a critical level of export concentration beyond which increasing export specialization leads to higher growth. Below this critical level, diversification of exports matters for gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Growth of high technology exports also contributes tothe output growth; the relationship becomes stronger for countries that have share of manufacturing exports in their total exports greater than the world average.

We wanted to see whether leadership by example, in the form of one player acting publicly before the rest of the group, could help groups do better. Our results suggest that leadership can increase efficiency but is far from being a guarantee of success. Specifically, in a significant number of groups we observed successful leadership and increased efficiency, but in most groups efficiency was low despite the efforts of leaders. We did not find any difference between voluntary leaders and leaders that are randomly assigned.

The proximate reasons have to do with weak capacity, inadequate funding, and a lack of coordination of statistical activities. But the underlying cause may be the political sensitivity of these statistics, and some donors' tendency to go around countries' own National Statistical Development Strategies (NSDS).

In these games, trustees made nonbinding promises of investment-contingent returns, then investors decided whether to invest, and finally trustees decided how much to return. After an unexpected second game was announced, but before it commenced, trustees could send a one-way message. This design allowed us to observe the endogenous emergence and natural distribution of trust-relevant behaviors and focus on naturally occurring remedial strategies used by promise-breakers and distrusted trustees, their effects on investors, and subsequent outcomes. In the first game 16.6% of trustees were distrusted and 18.8% of trusted trustees broke promises. Trustees distrusted in the first game used long messages and promises closer to equal splits to encourage trust in the second game. To restore damaged trust, promise-breakers used apologies and upgraded promises. On average, investments in each game paid off for investors and trustees, suggesting that effective use of cheap signals fosters profitable trust-based exchange in these economies.

The informed player, who knows the exact return from contributing and whose contribution is unobserved, can send a message about the return or her contribution. Theoretically, messages can elicit the uninformed player's contribution, and allow the informed player to free-ride. The exact language used is not expected to matter. Experimentally, however, we find that free-ride depends on the language: the informed player free-rides less-and thereby lies less frequently-when she talks about her contribution than when she talks about the return. Further experimental evidence indicates that it is the promise component in messages about the contribution that leads to less free-ride and less lying.","[Serra-Garcia, Marta] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, San Diego, CA USA; [van Damme, Eric; Potters, Jan] Tilburg Univ, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Damme, Eric; Potters, Jan] Tilburg Univ, TILEC, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Potters, Jan] Tilburg Univ, Tiber, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Potters, Jan] Tilburg Univ, Netspar, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Serra-Garcia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, San Diego, CA USA.",mserragarcia@ucsd.edu; eric.vandamme@uvt.nl; j.j.m.potters@uvt.nl,"Serra-Garcia, Marta/AAA-3340-2020","Serra-Garcia, Marta/0000-0002-5875-4986; POTTERS, Jan/0000-0003-3670-4512",,,,,45,23,27,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The models are applied to test the effectiveness of fiscal policy actions in an economic environment with existing structural supply constraints versus demand-side constraints and also to detect which components of the fiscal would be more effective in stabilising the economy. Based on the structure of the South African economy and the framework presented, the study concludes that the South African economy can be characterised as one which is embedded with structural supply constraints. Thus, a model which is suitable for policy analyses of the South African economy needs to capture the long-run supply-side characteristics of the economy. A price block is incorporated to specify the price adjustment between the supply-side sector and real aggregate demand sector. The models are estimated with time-series data from 1970 to 2011, capturing both the long-run and short-run dynamic properties of the economy. The results from the series of fiscal policy scenarios suggest that fiscal policy actions are more effective in an economic environment with limited or no supply constraints. Fiscal expansion or consolidation that comes more from government spending changes will be more effective in an economic environment where structural supply constraints are absent while tax revenue changes will be more effective in an economic environment where there exist major structural supply constraints.

We apply the model to the Spain-China trade relationship as it existed in 2005, finding a PHH of 29,667 KtCO(2). If this trade had not existed (so each country had met its demand for intermediate and final goods), global emissions would have been reduced by these 29,667 KtCO(2). Of this PHH, 43.5% corresponds to imports of final goods; 32.4% is related to imports of intermediate goods for the last stage of production; the remainder, 24.1%, is caused by global value chains (GVC) between the countries. Only 3229 KtCO(2) of PHH emissions are linked to domestic emissions from the sector in which the imports are produced; the rest is explained by domestic linkages or successive rounds of domestic production, which supports the existence of an indirect PHH. Together with a trade growth in the last years, the fall of trade barriers would have implied a transformation of global production chains that have boosted global emissions. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using difference-in-differences, panel, and censored regression models (to control for maximum allowable thermostat settings), we find that a 1 degrees C decrease in the default caused a reduction in the chosen setting by 0.38 degrees C, on average. Sixty-five percent of this effect could be attributed to office occupant behavior (p-value = 0.044). The difference-in-differences models show that small decreases in the default (1 degrees) led to a greater reduction in chosen settings than large decreases (2 degrees). We also find that office occupants who were more apt to adjust their thermostats prior to the intervention were less susceptible to the default.

The preschools proposed by the initiative share many characteristics with the universal preschools that have been offered in Georgia and Oklahoma since the 1990s. This study draws together data from multiple sources to estimate the impacts of these model state programs on preschool enrollment and a broad set of family and child outcomes. We find that the state programs have increased the preschool enrollment rates of children from lower- and higher-income families alike. Among lower-income families, our findings also suggest that the programs have increased the amount of time mothers and children spend together on activities such as reading, the likelihood that mothers work, and children's test performance as late as eighth grade. Among higher-income families, however, we find that the programs have shifted children from private to public preschools, resulting in less of an impact on overall enrollment but a reduction in childcare expenses, and that they have had no positive effect on children's later test scores.","[Cascio, Elizabeth U.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Schanzenbach, Diane Whitmore] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Dartmouth College; Northwestern University,"Cascio, EU (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",,,,,,,,5,59,83,1,39,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The premium in this model reflects diminishing returns-to-scale and the fact that equity shares are equal claims to firm output. In the bond market, the risk-free rate reflects trade in assets at marginal rates of return with a linear technology and thus the equity premium in excess returns reflects a comparison of average returns with marginal returns. In the model, credit constraints lower the equity premium and, absent such constraints, the equity premium would roughly double. Since the model may be interpreted as a model of entrepreneurship, this paper also presents estimates from a structural model of entrepreneurship using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances and also finds only a modest level of risk aversion is sufficient to replicate entrepreneurial returns.

The basic model has two types of projects: the Good and the Bad. The Good projects rely on the inputs supplied by others who could undertake investment in the future, thereby improving their net worth. The Bad projects are independently profitable so that they do not improve the net worth of other borrowers. Furthermore, they are subject to the borrowing constraint due to some agency problems. With a low net worth, the agents cannot finance the Bad, and much of the credit goes to finance the Good, even when the Bad projects are more profitable than the Good projects. This overinvestment to the Good creates a boom, leading to an improvement in borrower net worth. This makes it possible for the agents to finance the Bad. This shift in the composition of credit from the Good to the Bad at the peak of the boom causes a deterioration of borrower net worth. The whole process repeats itself. Endogenous fluctuations occur, as the Good breed the Bad and the Bad destroy the Good. The model is then extended to add a third type of projects, the Ugly, which are unproductive but subject to no borrowing constraint. With a low net worth, the Good compete with the Ugly, which act as a drag on the Good, creating the credit multiplier effect. With a high net worth, the Good compete with the Bad, which destroy the Good, creating the credit reversal effect. By combining these two effects, this hybrid model generates intermittency phenomena, i.e., relatively long periods of small and persistent movements punctuated intermittently by seemingly random-looking behaviors. Along these cycles, the economy exhibits asymmetric fluctuations; it experiences a slow process of recovery from a recession, followed by a rapid expansion, and possibly after a period of high volatility, plunges into a recession.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Matsuyama, K (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",k-matsuyama@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,20,29,30,0,12,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

More specifically, we prove (i) that there exists a unique steady state equilibrium that is globally asymptotically stable and (ii) that along every equilibrium the most patient household owns the entire capital of the economy after some finite time. Furthermore, we prove that despite the presence of the no-borrowing constraints all equilibria are efficient.

Then, we use our results to study information acquisition prior to an all-pay auction. If the decision to acquire information is observable, but not the information received, one-sided asymmetric information can occur endogenously in equilibrium. Moreover, the cut-off values of the cost of information that determine equilibrium information acquisition are higher than those in the first best. Thus, information acquisition is excessive.

A dynamic optimization model of the profit maximizing decisions of a hydro operator is solved for various restrictions on water flow, using data for a representative hydro operation in Ontario. Profits are negatively affected, but for a range of restrictions the impact is not large.

However, spatial filtering faces computational challenges for large n as the current method requires order of n(3) operations. This manuscript demonstrates how using iterative eigenvalue routines on sparse weight matrices can make filtering feasible for data sets involving a million or more observations and empirically estimates an operation count on the order of n(1.1). Moreover, we show that filtering performs better, both statistically and numerically, for spatial weight matrices with more neighbours. Finally, we show that although filtering out spatial aspects of the data reduces bias in parameter estimates for the spatially lagged dependent variable DGP, it also filters out spatial aspects of interest such as spillovers.","[Pace, R.

Moreover, it is able to deal with uncertain environments where the information is very imprecise and can be assessed with interval numbers. We study some of its main properties and particular cases such as the uncertain maximum distance, the uncertain minimum distance, the uncertain normalized Euclidean distance (UNED), the uncertain weighted Euclidean distance (UWED) and the uncertain Euclidean ordered weighted averaging distance (UEOWAD) operator.

In the extension, players communicate repeatedly through a detail-free mediator that has been studied in Lehrer (1991) and in Gossner and Vieille (2001). The extension captures situations in which people can observe the opponent's face during the conversation. While Gossner and Vieille (2001) prove that no correlation can be securely implemented by using only this mediator, we prove a result closer to Lehrer (1991), namely, that the Nash equilibrium payoffs of the extended game essentially coincide with the correlated equilibrium payoffs of the underlying game. The contrasting results can be explained with our additional assumptions that the players can also communicate directly and, more importantly, the private messages sent to the mediator can be recorded and revealed later in the conversation.

We first show a strong relation between food security and road infrastructures after controlling for other factors known to affect food security, including climate and land productivity. To trace a potential mechanism by which political marginalisation impacts on food security, we then look at its relation with the allocation of roads within countries. We find support for the argument that political factors affect the location of roads after controlling for the economic importance of the areas, as well as many other factors. This finding is robust to a number of alternative specifications. We conclude that politically marginalised areas have significantly fewer roads, thus supporting our claim that political marginalisation indirectly affects food security, by undermining the quality and the allocation of transport infrastructures.

To exploit them, one has to use the entire spectrum of labour market policies: earlier labour market entry, later retirement age, higher female labour force participation, and lower unemployment. Lesson number two is that there is a positive and enforcing effect of pension reform. A pension regime that alleviates the tax burden of the younger generation creates higher productive capacity. The third lesson is on behavioural effects. Some strengthen reform but they are dominated by opposition effects, such as taking advantage of loopholes, withdrawal of labour supply, or simple within-household substitution. Negative behavioural effects can be minimised by informing people better about the chances and challenges of population ageing, and by de-mystifying false beliefs about ageing.","Max Planck Inst Social Law & Social Policy, Munich Ctr Econ Ageing MEA, Munich, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Börsch-Supan, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Social Law & Social Policy, Munich Ctr Econ Ageing MEA, Munich, Germany.",axel@boersch-supan.de,,,,,,,0,11,11,4,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2013,40.0,3,,,SI,,397,407,,10.1007/s10663-013-9216-0,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,181KH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321666000002,0

For a given number of distributed copies, depending on the type of audience (favorable or unfavorable), the newspaper may either have a large readership or a small readership. A large readership provides a greater return to advertisers, because ads are visualized by more people. A favorable audience has also the advantage of requiring a lower distribution cost (for a given number of distributed copies), because readers are willing to exert more effort to obtain a copy of the free newspaper and are less likely to reject a copy that is handed to them. We find that when the audience is unfavorable, the number of distributed copies and the price of ad-space coincide with those of the perfect information scenario. In contrast, if the audience is favorable, the newspaper prints extra copies to send a credible signal to the advertisers that the audience is favorable.

The ideal-but-unavailable emissions tax would encourage drivers to abate emissions through many behaviors, some of which involve market transactions that can be observed for feasible market incentives (such as a gas tax, subsidy to new cars, or tax by vehicle type). Our model can calculate behavioral effects of each such price and thus calculate car choices, miles, and emissions. A nested logit structure is used to model discrete choices among different vehicle bundles. We also consider continuous choices of miles driven and the age of each vehicle.

We apply this approach to an investment that increased the shipping capacity of a thousand-mile-long railroad in western China. The event was quasi-experimental: before the expansion, the railroad was congested in one direction, but not the other. We find that, after the investment, (1) the between-destination price differences of goods shipped in the congestion direction dropped by about 30% and (2) shipping volume increased by around 40%. In contrast, those of goods in the other direction were not affected. These estimates imply a sizable social return to this particular investment: 10% per year in the most conservative case considered. Journal of Comparative Economics 41 (3) (2013) 669-683.

Countries are integrated through trade but trade is not costless and geographic position matters. We use a number of analytical examples and a multi-country calibration to explain two important empirical regularities: (i) there is a strong positive correlation between proximity to large markets and levels of manufacturing activity; (ii) there is a positive correlation between the ratio of agricultural to manufacturing productivity and shares of manufacturing in GDP. Our calibrated model replicates these facts and also provides a better fit to cross-sectional data on manufacturing shares than frameworks which ignore the role of trade costs or non-homotheticity. We use the calibrated model to quantitatively analyze the effect of increases in agricultural productivity and a further lowering of trade barriers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We utilize the staggered board (or classified board) to test this hypothesis. The staggered board is a powerful takeover defence that enables inefficient managers to evade the discipline of the takeover market, thereby exacerbating managerial entrenchment (Bebchuk and Cohen, 2005). We find that managers entrenched by the staggered board adopt significantly less risky strategies, consistent with the quiet life hypothesis. In particular, the presence of a staggered board reduces the volatility of stock returns by 4.46%. We also show that our conclusion is unlikely affected by the presence of endogeneity.","[Chintrakarn, P.] MUIC, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Jiraporn, N.] SUNY Coll New Platz, Sch Business, New Paltz, NY 12561 USA; [Jiraporn, P.] Penn State Univ, Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Jiraporn, P (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA USA.",pjiraporn@gmail.com,,,,,,,4,11,12,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Classical theories of out-of-equilibrium adjustment are intuitive but implausibly centralized. Further, standard restrictions on individual preferences place little structure on aggregate excess demand functions. Amongst other issues, this fact implies that economies can be unstable under classical dynamics, and thus instability appears to be an unavoidable feature of GE theory. This paper recounts laboratory studies of GE environments which reveal that classical theories of dynamics do, in fact, organize market activity surprisingly well. These experiments suggest that the Walrasian auctioneer, for example, appears to be a constructive abstraction, and that instability should be accommodated within theory rather than circumscribed. Laboratory applications of GE theory focused on issues beyond stability and dynamics are also briefly surveyed.","CUNY, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Crockett, S (通讯作者)，CUNY, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",,,,,,,,76,6,6,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In this paper, we discuss a dynamic duopoly game with heterogeneous players by assuming that one of them imposes an upper limiter on output, and the other one imposes a lower limiter. We analyze how the limiter affects the dynamics of output and the performance of players, and explore the number of the equilibrium points and the distribution of conditioned equilibrium points of the model. We then discuss the stable region of conditioned equilibrium. The theoretical results and numerical experiments show that adding appropriate limiter can make the system more robust, and even get rid of its chaos. The numerical results show that chaotic output dynamics can be beneficial to one firm but harmful to the other, and can also be harmful to both of them, and also show that adding appropriate limiter can improve the performance of the player.

Another reason one might suspect is uncertainty, surrounding most environmental problems, and in particular climate change. This provides often an excuse for remaining inactive. Paradoxically, some recent papers have concluded just the opposite: the veil of uncertainty can be conducive to the success of international environmental cooperation. In this paper, we explain why and under which conditions this can be true. However, we argue that those conditions are the exception rather than the rule. Most important, we suggest a mechanism for those conditions where learning has a negative effect on the success of cooperation which removes this effect or even turns it into a positive effect Our results apply beyond the specifics of climate change to similar problems where cooperation generates positive externalities.

The model is estimated using Bayesian techniques on data from the period 1980Q1 to 2003Q2, and then used to forecast output, inflation and nominal short-term interest rate for one-to eight-quarters-ahead over an out-of sample horizon of 2003Q3 to 2010Q4. When the forecast performance of the SOENKDSGE-VAR model is compared with an independently estimated DSGE model, the classical VAR and six alternative BVAR models, we find that, barring the BVAR model based on the SSVS prior on both VAR coefficients and the error covariance, the SOENKDSGE-VAR model is found to perform competitively, if not, better than all the other VAR models.

(2010) (AAV). We find that, compared with single-agent search, the search duration is longer for committee search under the unanimity rule, but is shorter for committee search in which at least one vote is required to stop searching. In addition, according to estimates from round-based search decisions, subjects are more likely to vote to stop searching in committee search than in single-agent search. This confirms that agents are less picky in committee search. Overall, the experimental outcomes are consistent with the implications suggested by the AAV model. However, despite the prediction from the AAV model, we could not obtain a significant outcome in relation to the size order of the probabilities of voting to stop searching in committee search for the various plurality voting rules.

The population distribution of preferences is unknown and has to be estimated, based on answers from the respondents. The decision maker cannot identify the true distribution of preferences even if the sample size becomes arbitrarily large, since the respondents have incentive to exaggerate their preferences especially as the sample size becomes larger and each respondent has weaker influence on the decision. The quality of communication with each respondent may improve as the sample size becomes smaller, and thus we identify the trade-off between the quality and quantity of communication. We show that the decision maker may prefer to sample a smaller number of individuals when the prior is weaker. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First, we capture the importance of the spatial dependence on homicide rates within large urban center neighborhoods. Second, we measure the influence of spatial dependence more precisely by calculating the total, direct, and indirect effects of neighborhood characteristics on homicides. The results show that areas with low homicides rates are surrounded by neighborhoods with high murder rates, and that, despite the significant positive effect of inequality on criminality, this influence is mitigated by the nature of the spatial dependence of criminality among the neighbors.

The empirical exercise estimates AIDS models for refrigerators, washing machines. TVs, and light bulbs. Results indicate that market barriers are crucial in the demand for energy efficient options, and consumer response to changes in appliance prices, total expenditures, and energy prices depends on the possibility of behavioural adjustments in consumption. In contrast with the induced innovation hypothesis, current electricity prices can fail to induce innovation because of their short-term impact on disposable income, while consumers invest in energy efficiency when expecting electricity prices to rise in the future.

The effects of this regulatory shock on pharmaceutical firms' trade mark application strategies are studied using Difference-in-Differences and bias adjusted matching estimators.

Unlike existing empirical research on these topics, we use a structural vector auto-regression that relaxes the restrictions commonly imposed in earlier studies and identify monetary policy shocks by exploiting the conditional heteroskedasticity of the structural innovations. Applying this method to US data, we find that the interaction between monetary policy and stock returns is much weaker than suggested by earlier empirical studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

While a firm cannot sell open source software, and so loses potential sales revenue, the open source software development process can have a substantial positive impact on the quality of a software, its diffusion, and, consequently, the demand for a complementary product from which the firm does profit. Previous papers have considered the firm's option to release software under a closed or open source license as a simple once and for all binary choice. We extend this research by allowing for the possibility of keeping software proprietary for some optimally determined finite time period before making it open source. Furthermore, we study the impact of switching costs. We show that in case of high in-house R&D costs, the firm always makes the software open source at some point (unless switching itself is too expensive). The timing, however, depends on the initial software quality. On the other hand, when R&D is inexpensive, the firm opens the source code only when the initial level of software quality is low. For intermediate R&D costs, the firm might have the choice between opening the code immediately, opening it at some subsequent and optimally determined time, or keeping it closed forever. Finally we find that whereas high switching costs might prevent firms from adopting an open source business model, low switching costs mainly affect the timing of the opening of the source code.

Two sets of panel models of exports are estimated for 16 regions of Poland in the years 19992008. Model I shows that regional export performance is positively dependent on labour productivity, share of foreign-owned companies in employment, education level of population, location in the country's border region and access to the sea, and negatively on the importance of agriculture in the region's economy and labour costs. Model II indicates that exports of agricultural and food products are positively correlated with the importance of agriculture, labour productivity in agriculture and the economy of the region as a whole, availability of employees with an appropriate level of practical skills and access to the sea, and negatively with population density and location in the country's border region.

Misalignments, defined as the difference between the current real exchange rate and its equilibrium counterpart, are derived from the behavioural equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) approach. Our estimate relies on recent panel cointegration techniques that allow for heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependencies. We also control for the presence of structural breaks. Our findings show that our misalignments index plays a key role in the reversal of trend growth. Although the undervaluation of their currency acts positively on their growth, emerging countries cannot base their strategy on this finding to promote growth. We relate this result to the adverse effects of depreciation, as in original sin. The implications of our findings, in terms of economic policy, clearly emphasise the economic leverage role of undervaluation: it remains a powerful cyclical instrument but has to be, nevertheless, employed with precautionary to be globally and internationally consistent.

I estimate a simple model developed in the seminal paper by Feldstein and Horioka (1980). I construct a panel of 6 countries of the Caucasus - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey - and employ a panel cointegration approach. To that end, I make use of the Dynamic OLS (DOLS), Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS), and Pooled Mean Group (PMG) techniques for heterogeneous panels. Preliminary cross-dependency tests reject the presence of cross-sectional dependence. Panel unit root and cointegration tests confirm that investment and saving are non-stationary and cointegrated. The estimated long-run saving retention ratios using DOLS, FMOLS, and PMG are 0.90, 0.73, and 0.83, respectively. These results suggest that capital mobility in the Caucasus is very low. I put these findings in an international context and confirm that the Caucasus is considerably financially restrained compared to other regions. I also look at the country ratings of the Index of Economic Freedom (IEF) and find that my results work well in predicting the IEF rank. Finally, I discuss some implications for the region's policy-relevant issues such as financial integration, human capital mobility, cross-border trading, fiscal and monetary policy, solvency management, responsive consumption smoothing, and recession resistance.

I show that in a standard DSGE model RWR is mainly affected by the interaction of the two nominal rigidities and not by other structural parameters. The degree of RWR is, however, considerably influenced by the modelling assumption about the structure of wage contracts (Calvo vs. Taylor) and about other institutional characteristics of wage-setting (clustering of contracts, heterogeneous contract length, indexation). I use survey evidence on price- and wage-setting for 15 European countries to calculate the degrees of RWR implied by the theoretical model. The average level of RWR is broadly in line with empirical estimates based on macroeconomic data. In order to be able to also match the observed cross-country variation in RWR it is, however, essential to move beyond the country-specific durations of price and wages and to take more institutional details into account.

Building on a model of skill obsolescence, we assess the long-term adjustment process following a sudden change in skills needed in production that severely worsened older workers' labor market situation. The model implies that (a) the devaluation of skills should affect highly educated older workers more severely, (b) the disadvantage should disappear over time as newer cohorts acquire more suitable human capital, and (c) the timing should differ among firm ownership types, reflecting the inflow of modem technologies and practices. Rather than focusing on wage differentials, we estimate the firm-level productive contribution of older relative to younger workers differentiated by education level. To assess long-run trends, we adapt the augmented production function methodology developed in international literature and apply it to a linked employer-employee dataset from Hungary covering from before (1986) to 20 years after (2008) the economic transition. The results suggest that - in line with the model - the within firm productivity differential between older and younger workers following the transition was largest among the highly skilled. The fall in relative productivity followed the inflow of modern capital: the gap was largest in 1992-1995 in foreign-owned firms, while it appeared gradually and was smaller in domestic firms. The magnitude and the negative effects of the adjustment period witnessed in Hungary highlight the importance of policies aimed at providing core competencies and adult training that enable older workers to adjust to sudden economic and technological changes.

Previous studies have looked at the role of backward linkages with domestic suppliers and their effects on domestic competitors. In this paper, we study how these externalities are affected by technological incompatibilities between foreign and domestic technologies. When foreign technologies require specialized inputs, some local suppliers self-select into production for multinational firms. A decrease in the cost of inputs compatible with the foreign technology has heterogeneous effects. It benefits foreign firms and the most productive downstream domestic firms that adopt the foreign technology, and negatively affects firms using the domestic technology. Technological incompatibilities reduce the welfare gains from openness to FDI, but this negative effect can be overcome by domestic technology adoption.

The analysis is unique in two ways: first, it separates unfinished (low value-added) textile exports from finished ( high value-added) textile exports; second, it separates out the impact of aggregate exchange rate changes with respect to trading 'partners' from aggregate exchange rate changes with respect to trading 'competitors'. We find that unfinished, or low value-added, Pakistani textile exports were positively impacted by the aggregate consumption of trading partners while finished, or high value-added, textile exports were negatively affected by these shocks. Also, a real depreciation of the Pakistani exchange rate leads to temporary increases in unfinished textile exports but sustained increases in the level of finished textile exports. Finally, positive shocks in the textile exports of competitor countries lead to temporary decreases in both unfinished and finished Pakistani textile exports, but these falls were followed by eventual increases in the exports of both.

Fertility is endogenized so that immigrants and natives can have different fertility rates, which provides a more realistic view of policy effects. Fertility is an important determinant to the tax burden of social security since it affects the quantity and quality of future tax payers. We find that introducing immigrants into the economy can reduce the tax burden of social security. If the survival probability of young agents to old age (or the replacement ratio) is high enough, the growth rate of GDP per worker for an economy with international migration will be higher than for a closed economy. Regarding migration policies, our numerical results indicate that economic growth rate of GDP per worker will first decrease then increase as the flow of immigrants increases. Attracting more skilled immigrants will enhance economic growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Always viewed from the perspective of the seller's delivery obligation, Incoterms focus on the responsibility for the risk of loss or damage to the goods sold, division of transportation and customs-related costs between the seller and buyer, and the obligation to execute certain functional activities related to the movement of the goods. The ICC has consistently attempted to update Incoterms in a way that keeps pace with the evolution of business practices. The ICC recently published the new listing of terms, which hints at some of the significant changes ahead in the new publication. It is not certain how the Incoterms 2010 have been used in practice, so it is difficult to find out related problems. Therefore, those who are unwilling to use Incoterms 2010 are free to choose Incoterms 2000 or other trade terms. However, this kind of practice can cause a conflict because of differences in the interpretation of trade terms in international trade. It would be desirable to use Incoterms 2010 based on the revised Incoterms 2000. It is still unclear how predominantly Incoterms 2010 will be used in international trade. Of course, it is necessary to keep updating trade terms based on a deeper analysis on the matters associated with the Incoterms rules, and maintain an understanding of contemporary changes. In this context, this thesis aimed to investigate the historical background of the Incoterms rules and find out how they have been revised depending on changes in the global economic environment.","[Chung, Jae-Hwan] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Leeb, Bong-Soo] Dankook Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Dankook University,"Chung, JH (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",jj11888@hanmail.net; leebongsoo@dankook.ac.kr,,,,,,,22,2,3,2,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Transmission of energy requires balancing the grid to guarantee system security, which is performed by the (independent) system operator (SO). When the SO faces stochastic demand, grid balancing has sizeable consequences on current and future profits, and hence, on firm value and firm risk We explore these value and risk consequences with and without an investment option to expand transmission capacity. We show that firm value consists of the value of the transmission capacity in place plus the value of a short put and a short call option that are the result of the SO's balancing actions. Firm risk without investment option is non-linear and determined by the short option positions. It is decreasing with increasing energy demand.

We show that cross-shareholdings may paradoxically create a pro-competitive effect and elicit more effort than a standard contest without cross-ownership. This observation runs in contrast to the anti-competitive effect that cross-shareholdings usually create in standard oligopolistic settings (such as Cournot or Bertrand competitions). Both bidding costs and the sizes of cross-shares affect the resultant total effort non-monotonically. Neither a cross-share nor a higher bidding cost necessarily decreases effort supply. A complete account of equilibrium bidding behaviors is provided and the necessary and sufficient conditions under which cross-shareholdings lead to higher or lower levels of overall effort are identified. However, the pro-competitive effect comes at a loss of efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

According to our data, the increase in off-farm employment that China experienced during the 1980s and 1990s continued during the 2000s. Our analysis shows that migration has become the most prevalent off-farm activity, although the destination of migrants is shifting from outside of one's province to destinations closer to home. The present paper finds that large shares of male and female individuals, especially those under 40 years, are working off the farm. These findings represent an important contribution to the labor economics field. First, the results of the present paper reveal that the labor transition from the agricultural sector to the non-agricultural sector for key segments of China's rural labor force is nearly complete. Second, although a large share of China's rural labor force work in agriculture, most of these workers are older men and women (and likely would not be willing to take low-wage, labor-intensive jobs). Third, the rising unskilled wage rate in China is partially a result of the tightening of the labor force in the young age cohorts. Finally, due to factors associated with the one child policy and other demographic transition forces, successive age cohorts will continue to fall in absolute number in the coming decade. Assuming China's growth continues, we expect to see further wage increases since it will take higher wages to coax more workers to work off the farm.","[Li, Qiang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun; Luo, Renfu; Liu, Chengfang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing Forestry University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Luo, RF (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qiangli@bjfu.edu.cn; jkhuang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; luorf.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; cfliu.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023",,,,,,37,52,56,6,98,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2013,21.0,3,,,SI,,4,24,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12019.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,148AB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319212800002,0

The method involves incorporating uncertainty into the model by formulating different states of the world or paths that the economy may take. The risk then is that on one or more of the paths, there may be an external demand shock, for example, an exogenous shock in tourism demand. The multi-sector forward-looking CGE model with risk shows the impact of uncertainty on the economy and how households and industry respond to the presence of uncertainty. The results show that, where there is an asymmetric shock, the possibility of a future tourism demand shock creates a welfare loss. The welfare gains along the non-shocked path are a result of household's risk aversion and their substituting resources away from the shocked path. The difference in the monetary values of the welfare on the different paths can be interpreted as the 'price' of the risk. It is the price households would pay to remove the possibility of the tourism shock. Therefore, this research was able to quantify the monetary value of the risk. This method can be used in scenario modelling for other adverse contingent events, such as the uncertainty of climate change impacts, and agriculture production risks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of a behavioral microsimulation model we show that this new system slightly increases employment but reduces incomes for the poorest households remaining unemployed. As an alternative, we analyze a budgetary neutral reform proposal which reduces financial incentives for marginal employment and provides a wage subsidy rewarding working longer hours. This alternative reform would yield larger positive employment effects, but more households would suffer from income losses.

In the pre-AFC period, bank capital holdings are positively associated with bank revenue risk, which is attributed to a combination of regulatory laxity as well as laxity of enforcement. In the post-AFC period, capital is found to reduce bank risk in a non-linear manner. Franchise value is associated with lower bank risk, but in a non-linear manner; low levels of franchise value are associated with increased bank risk, while higher levels of franchise value result in lower bank risk. It is also concluded the low-to-medium levels of bank loan growth are associated with lower bank risk; however, high levels of loan growth are risk increasing. These results point to the importance of enforcement of regulatory oversight in reducing bank risk.","[Williams, Barry] Bond Univ, Sch Business, Globalisat & Dev Ctr, Southport, Qld 4229, Australia",Bond University,"Williams, B (通讯作者)，ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.",bwilliam@bond.edu.au,"Williams, Barry/F-5491-2010","Williams, Barry/0000-0001-8751-1003",,,,,64,7,7,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The magnitude of the correlation between the trade balance and output, however, differs from country to country. In particular, the trade balance ratio is more negatively correlated with output in emerging economies than in developed economies, suggesting that the trade balance is more sensitive to output changes in the former than in the latter. This paper explores whether this difference is caused by international borrowing constraints imposed on emerging economies. By modeling borrowing constraints as conditional on macroeconomic performance, this paper shows that when there is a positive shock takes place in an emerging economy, GDP increases and the borrowing constraint becomes less binding, resulting in a decreased incentive to accumulate foreign assets. When there is a negative shock, by contrast, GDP falls, and the representative household must increase the trade balance to avoid possible binding borrowing constraints. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We assess whether this shift contributed to the decline in U. S. output volatility over the period 1949-2005 and provide an estimate of its relative importance. Growth rates of GDP by industry are analyzed in a seemingly unrelated multivariate autoregression framework with time-varying innovation covariance matrices. These changing unobserved covariance matrices are modeled as a Wishart autoregressive process of order one, which results in a nonlinear state-space system. The particle filter is used to obtain estimates of the innovation covariance matrix at each point in time. Several counterfactual experiments make it possible to apportion the decline in output volatility between the shift in the sectoral composition and changes in innovations. Our main finding is that the shift into the service sector can explain about 30% of the decline in GDP's volatility, despite the fact that some sectors became even more volatile. This result is robust across a wide variety of alternative specifications.","[Burren, Daniel; Neusser, Klaus] Univ Bern, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Neusser, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1,POB 8573, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland.",klaus.neusser@vwi.unibe.ch,,,,,,,22,7,7,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

To do so, we develop an economic model and use a sample of Spanish households to analyze the housing tenure choice (ownership or rental of the house) and the demand for housing in relation to family labor decisions. We have gone beyond previous studies by incorporating the discrete decisions of tenure choice and the participation of women in the labor market, proving that these decisions are interrelated and broadening the scope of our findings and conclusions. We obtained an important description of the effect of economic factors on housing and labor decisions and demonstrated that a change in a family's employment decisions affects housing decisions and vice versa. In addition, we determined to what extent housing and labor decisions are affected by changes in the wife's educational level and changes in family composition. Our findings show that the labor decisions have more sensitivity than housing decisions to these changes.","[Consuelo Colom, M.; Cruz Moles, M.] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Valencia 46021, Spain",University of Valencia,"Molés, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46021, Spain.",cruz.moles@uv.es,,Colom Andres/0000-0002-1923-7273; Moles Machi/0000-0003-3828-2237,,,,,30,8,8,5,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We are able to evaluate whether the predictive power is concentrated at the slowly fluctuating components or at the quickly fluctuating components. Using 1991Q1-2010Q2 quarterly data, for the G-7 countries, we found that the slowly fluctuating components of the stock prices have large predictive power for the future GDP, while this is not the case for the quickly fluctuating components. This finding holds both in a single-country setting and in a multi-country setting. Therefore, macro-economic policy makers could use the slowly fluctuating components of the stock prices to improve their predictions of the future GDP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A cross-section analysis on individual-level survey data is conducted here over 33 democracies to highlight the link between the economic position of agents and their specific demand for redistribution. Controlling for a number of factors usually found to affect individual preferences in the literature, this article focuses on the role played by the occupational status of individuals in shaping their preferences. Individual labour market position, as well as family income, is shown to outweigh all other factors shaping preferences for redistribution. The odds of a manager to oppose redistributive policies are increased by 40%, as compared to those of an office clerk, for instance. Moreover, individuals' perception of personal mobility plays an important role: the odds of holding more positive attitudes towards redistribution are up by 32% for people who think they experienced a downward mobility within the last ten years. Evidence is also found for the fact that the political regime may have a long lasting effect on collective preferences: living in former-East Germany doubles the odds of holding positive attitudes towards redistribution, as compared to living in West Germany. Finally, the research presented here identifies which socio-political groups may be formed on the basis of their preferences for redistribution.","Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75013 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Guillaud, E (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",elvire.guillaud@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,41,91,101,1,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Compared with previous studies, the novel aspect of this work is the use of a rich dataset at provincial level, which allows the high level of regional heterogeneity to be taken into consideration. The unbalanced regional growth has been translated into differences in the need for energy resources across the vast territory of China. A detailed analysis of these issues may provide new insights into the energy situation in this country. The analysis is also disaggregated by type of energy: coal, electricity and petroleum. We estimate the models by panel-corrected standard errors, developed by Beck and Katz (1995), over the period 1985-2008. Results obtained confirm the hypothesis that both foreign and non-state investments play a leading role in the decline of energy intensity across Chinese regions, whereas there is no evidence of a positive contribution of state investment. The findings also reveal differences in energy intensity across regions, thus confirming the importance of accounting for the regional dimension when analyzing energy consumption in China.

In our model, entrepreneurs optimally decide the precision of their earning reporting by trading off the possibility of expropriating profits against the capacity to attract external funding. We find that information is only valuable if enough quality of it is disclosed. Otherwise, the entrepreneur will always pretend to be unsuccessful and the capital market will break down. If, by contrast, a minimum precision level is ensured, fund diversion will be zero but full disclosure is still not achieved. We show that an important driving force behind governance transparency is product market competition. Tougher competition leads to more firms competing for funding, which in turn changes how resources are allocated since each individual firm becomes less important in the portfolio choice. Firms react to this loss of market power by increasing transparency. Furthermore, firms characterized by low corporate profits or firms in a country with a strong legal system will be more likely to avoid voluntary disclosure regimes.","Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal Econ Theory & Hist, Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Hidalgo-Cabrillana, A (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal Econ Theory & Hist, Madrid, Spain.",ana.hidalgo@uam.es,"Hidalgo-Cabrillana, Ana/L-2456-2013","Hidalgo-Cabrillana, Ana/0000-0001-5387-608X",,,,,43,1,1,0,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Moreover, we find that continuously committing just one period ahead is sufficient to capture all the gains from commitment, though this is only feasible with inflation-targeting. The adaptability of short-term commitments to changes in our models and understanding of the economy should arguably make these more credible than once-and-for-all commitments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We demonstrate that, under informational barriers due to economic uncertainties, a slight negative change in economic fundamentals as well as the signals about the economic fundamentals can lead to the collapse of free trade regimes. Moreover, the fear of a trading partner's deviation to protectionist policies might trigger preemptive protectionist measures resulting in a trade war when trade policies show strategic complementarity. However, a free trade regime is more likely to be sustained when it is commonly known that each country has strong symmetric retaliatory tendencies in case trade friction occurs. Nonetheless, if the asymmetry in retaliatory tendencies of trading countries increases the preemptive incentive, a free trade regime is more likely to collapse to a trade war. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal incentive scheme resembles what is commonly regarded as a sweat equity contract, with all rents back loaded.

Running for office necessitates resources. But students of democracy have had almost nothing to say about how much money should be spent by candidates or where that money should come from. As a result, there is a gaping void in the theory of democracy. Joseph A. Schumpeter used a market analogy in his discussion of the electoral process, but even he did not discuss how electoral campaigns are to be paid for. In fact, the few citizens who largely fund campaigns for office in the United States purchase non-rivalrous influence. They obtain the ability to shape the policies that affect all citizens. In this way, political equality is undermined. The paper concludes that achieving a more representative political system can best be attained by treating political campaigns as a public good.","Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Mandle, JR (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This ontological dimension can be best understood through Sraffa's critique of the principle of continuity. The principle of continuity was used by Marshall as a methodological justification for the use of partial equilibrium methods in the analysis of supply and demand, in a context where different causes are deeply interconnected. Sraffa acknowledges the existence of interconnectedness, but rejects Marshall's methodology, which is based on the principle of continuity, as it becomes clear in his unpublished manuscripts, which are examined here.","[Martins, Nuno Ornelas] Univ Azores, Dept Econ & Business, P-9700042 Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal",Universidade dos Acores,"Martins, NO (通讯作者)，Univ Azores, Rua Capitao Joao D Avila, P-9700042 Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal.",nmartins@uac.pt,"Martins, Nuno/B-6012-2009","Martins, Nuno/0000-0001-7966-6435",,,,,38,7,8,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The model has a system of differential equations for the rate of utilization, profit share, and rate of employment. We show that there exist limit cycles that depend on the sizes of the reserve-army effect and reserve-army-creation effect. This implies that there exists a situation in which the economy experiences endogenous and perpetual growth cycles. Moreover, we show that if the stable long-run equilibrium corresponds to the profit-led growth regime, an increase in the bargaining power of workers increases the rate of unemployment; conversely, if the equilibrium corresponds to the wage-led growth-regime, an increase in the bargaining power of workers decreases the rate of unemployment.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Kyoto University,"Sasaki, H (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Honmachi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",sasaki@econ.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Sasaki, Hiroaki/GXG-5024-2022",,,,,,55,28,30,2,24,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

First, I show that upon the formation of a bilateral CU, the non-member firm has greater incentives to engage in FDI. However, when FDI becomes a feasible entry option for the non- member firm under a CU, member countries have incentives to strategically induce export over FDI by lowering their joint external tariff. When fixed set-up cost of FDI is sufficiently low, this tariff falls below KempWan tariff and CU leads to a Pareto improvement relative to no agreement. Moreover, using an infinite repetition of the one-shot tariff game under a CU, I show that the presence of FDI incentive of the non-member firm makes the member countries more willing to cooperate multilaterally over free trade while the opposite is true for the non-member country. Finally, I find that, unless fixed cost of having an additional plant is sufficiently low, multilateral cooperation over free trade is easier to sustain when FDI incentive is present.","Ryerson Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University,"Yildiz, HM (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",hyildiz@ryerson.ca,,,,,,,40,0,0,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Based on the 2007 social accounting matrix (SAM) for Xinjiang, constructed by ourselves, this paper takes a regional perspective on China's resource tax reform to quantitatively calculate its degree of influence and qualitatively analyze its mechanism of influence by adopting an energy computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and a SAM price model. The results show that the main significance of the reform lies in bolstering local government finances rather than energy conservation or carbon reduction. This is because revenue will be transferred from resource enterprises and the central government to the local government, while simultaneously the low tax rate, narrow tax scope and unreasonable price mechanism will combine to prevent the reform from reaching its environmental goals. Promoting resource price mechanism reform and deepening resource tax reform will be two key elements of China's future energy strategies. Because resource enterprises will bear the increased burden caused by the reform, the degree of sectoral price increases will be limited; therefore, the fear that resource tax reform will push up inflation is unnecessary and should not be a barrier to reform.

However, the resources saved by a government that does not finance the upfront investment are offset by giving up future revenue flows to the concessionaire. If a PPP can be justified on efficiency grounds, the PPP contract that optimally balances demand risk, user-fee distortions, and the opportunity cost of public funds has a minimum revenue guarantee and a revenue cap. The optimal contract can be implemented via a competitive auction with reasonable informational requirements. The optimal revenue guarantees, revenue sharing agreements, and auction mechanisms are different from those observed in the real world. In particular, the optimal contract duration is shorter in demand states where the revenue cap binds. These results also have implications for budgetary accounting of PPPs, as they show that their fiscal impact resembles that of public provision, rather than privatization.","[Engel, Eduardo] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Engel, Eduardo; Fischer, Ronald] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Galetovic, Alexander] Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile",Yale University; Universidad de Chile; Universidad de los Andes - Chile,"Engel, E (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",emraengel@gmail.com; rfischer@dii.uchile.cl; alexander@galetovic.cl,"Fischer, Ronald D/H-3871-2013",,,,,,45,123,139,2,136,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

A symmetric interdependent values model with a risk neutral seller and either risk averse or risk neutral buyers is considered, along with the second price and English auctions. The properties of those PSCs in which either positive profits or both profits and losses are split according to a fixed fraction are studied.

First, we observe an inverted U-shaped age-quality of work profile similar to the conventional age-wage profile. Second, we find that the degree of concavity increases for those with higher native ability. Third, we find that working for a patron rather than selling directly to the market is associated with a flatter age profile.

We first study the impact of a classic import tax decrease and find that this policy harms upstream firms and may decrease domestic fiscal revenues. We then examine the effect of an increase in non-tariff barriers, which reduce the degree of substitutability between domestic and imported goods. This results in an improvement in each agent's situation, as international competition becomes less fierce. Finally, we show that market conditions may exist such that a coupled policy (import tax decrease and non-tariff barrier increase) makes all agents better off. This can explain the proliferation of domestic standards at national level in order to counterbalance the effect of lower tariffs negotiated by governments.","[Berges, Fabian] Toulouse Sch Econ Gremaq Inra, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Berges, Fabian] IDEI, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Monier-Dilhan, Sylvette] INRA, ODR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE; INRAE,"Bergès, F (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ Gremaq Inra, MF 217,21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",Fabian.Berges@toulouse.inra.fr; Sylvette.Monier@toulouse.inra.fr,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,13,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

We trace it to productivity growth within large plants (200 workers or more), as opposed to reallocation across such plants. As many economists believe Indian reforms during this era improved resource allocation, the absence of a growth pickup from reallocation is surprising. Moreover, when we look across industries we fail to robustly relate productivity growth to prominent reforms such as industrial de-licensing, tariff reductions, FDI liberalization, or lifting of small-scale industry reservations. Even under a generous reading of their effects, these reforms (at least as we measure them) account for less than one-third of the rapid productivity growth in Indian manufacturing from 1980-2007.

Spending does not necessarily translate into production, however, especially when inventories are involved. We look at the cash-for-clunkers program that helped finance the purchase of nearly 700,000 vehicles in 2009. An analysis of auto sales and production movements reveals that the program did prompt a large spike in sales. But the program had only a modest and fleeting impact on production, as inventories buffered the movements in sales.

On the contrary, in states where the degree of co-movement between state and national employment is low -as it is the case in northwest-central, southern, and east-southern states, the source of state employment fluctuations seems to be mainly associated with regional or state factors-.

Nevertheless, this view is hardly sustainable within the context of sophisticated markets. This paper puts forward an alternative interpretation of the off-balance sheet market, the so-called adverse selection hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, an adverse selection problem characterizes the relation between banks and their counterparties in off-balance sheet deals. Empirically, this implies that off-balance sheet activity is expected to be negatively related to failure risk, whereas it is expected to be positively related to the quality of the assets used for off-balance sheet operations. We test the adverse selection hypothesis for a sample of banks in the 27 member countries of the European Union during the pre-crisis period 1996-2006 and the crisis period 2007-2009. In addition, we check for possible differences between banks in the first 15 members of the European Union and those in the 12 new members. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We identify two waves of service sector growth: a first wave in countries with relatively low levels of per capita GDP; and a second in countries with higher per capita incomes. The first wave is made up primarily of traditional services, the second of modern services. In addition, there is evidence of the second wave occurring at lower income levels after 1990, especially so in democracies, in countries that are open to trade, and in countries close to global financial centres. This points to both political and economic conditions that can help countries capitalize on the opportunities afforded by a globalized post-industrial economy.","[Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gupta, Poonam] Natl Inst Publ Finance & Policy, Special Inst Area, New Delhi 110067, India",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Institute of Public Finance & Policy (NIPFP),"Eichengreen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",eichengr@econ.berkelely.edu; pgupta@nipfp.org.in,,,,,,,21,71,82,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Assuming immigrants bear the cultures of their birth place, comparison of revealed entrepreneurial propensities of US immigrant groups in 1910 and 2000 reflected these backgrounds. Two measures of entrepreneurial culture are employed; the first is simply the chance that a member of the migrant group will be an employer and the second is the origin country effect on this probability, conditional upon personal characteristics. The preferred second measure shows persistence of some cultures and change of others over the twentieth century. Among the more stable cultures North-western Europe, where modern economic growth is widely held to have originated, did not host unusually strong entrepreneurial propensities.

While the traditional empirical technique applied to such cases is maximum likelihood estimation of a Tobit (censored regression) model, recent debate has questioned whether linear models estimated via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) are preferable. On the one hand, Tobit models are deemed necessary to address the significant censoring (i.e. large numbers of zeroes) typically found in time-use data, in the face of which OLS estimators would be biased and inconsistent. Yet, optimization occurs over a longer period than that covered by the typical time diary (often a day), and thus some argue that reported zeroes represent a measurement problem rather than true nonparticipation in the activity, in which case OLS would be preferred. We provide direct empirical evidence on this question using the Australian Time Use Surveys, which record time-use information for two consecutive diary days, by estimating censored and linear versions of a parental child care model for both 24-hour and 48-hour windows of observation in order to determine the empirical consequences of estimation technique and diary length.","[Foster, Gigi] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, Athens, OH 45701 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Foster, G (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Level 4,Bldg E12 ASB, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",gigi.foster@unsw.edu.au,"Kalenkoski, Charlene/M-1967-2019; Foster, Gigi/D-5297-2019; Foster, Gigi/A-6631-2008","Foster, Gigi/0000-0002-1588-0202;",,,,,17,88,98,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the pre-announcement period after Reg FD, the volume of public option information contains less information about subsequent stock price movements. Although the quantity of public information may be higher after Reg FD, the inferior quality of publicly available option information dominates the higher quantity. Thus, the predictive power of option information decreases. In the post-RFD pre-announcement period, the volume of public option information is more informative than the volume of stock private information. It indicates that although the quality of private stock information is superior to that of public option information, the much lower quantity of stock information results in a lower predictive power of private stock information than that of public option information.","[Huang, H.

We show that the market is always inefficient, but the magnitude of inefficiency converges to zero at a high rate as competition intensifies.","McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",McMaster University,"Ivanov, M (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Kenneth Taylor Hall,1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",mivanov@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,30,15,17,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

First, it sets up a model which combines efficiency as well as political economy aspects in explaining the degree of fiscal decentralization. It innovates in making explicit the benefits from better informed politicians and policy makers (Von Hayek effect) and the potential cost push effect on public services and public goods (Scale Effect) resulting from decentralization. It takes advantage of previous literature in recognizing the extent of the ideological distance between the local and the national median voter as a third factor worth considering in the social cost benefit analysis of decentralization. Second, the aforementioned effects are put into the context of specific functional areas of government, each of them having a particular set of characteristics which lead to a different degree of decentralization. The net outcome will be the result of combining the rent seeking orientation of the central government with the particular median voter demand for each different public good.","[Leonardo Letelier, S.] Univ Chile, Inst Publ Affairs, Santiago, Chile; [Sez Lozano, Jose Luis] Univ Granada, Dept Int & Spains Econ Tenured, Granada, Spain",Universidad de Chile; University of Granada,"Letelier, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Inst Publ Affairs, Santiago, Chile.",lletelie@iap.uchile.cl; josaez@ugr.es,,,,,,,37,1,2,0,9,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

This article extends the previous literature using a dataset that covers 800?000 years, as well as a shorter dataset, and examines the interaction between temperature and CO2 emissions. Unit root tests reveal a difference between the two datasets. For the long dataset, all tests support the view that both temperature and CO2 are stationary around a constant. For the short dataset, temperature exhibits trend-stationary behaviour, while CO2 contains a unit root. This result is robust to nonlinear trends or trend breaks. Modelling the long dataset reveals that while contemporaneous CO2 appears positive and significant in the temperature equation, including lags results in a joint effect that is near zero. This result is confirmed using a different lag structure and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. A Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach to account for endogeneity suggests an insignificant relationship. In sum, the key result from our analysis is that CO2 has, at best, a weak relationship with temperature, while there is no evidence of trending when using a sufficiently long dataset. Thus, as a secondary result we highlight the danger of using a small sample in this context.","[McMillan, David G.] Univ Stirling, Accounting & Finance Div, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Omaha, NE 68182 USA",University of Stirling; University of Nebraska System,"McMillan, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Accounting & Finance Div, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",david.mcmillan@stir.ac.uk,"McMillan, David/H-5211-2019","McMillan, David/0000-0002-5891-4193",,,,,33,9,9,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Fresh apple imports in the United Kingdom provide a perfect case of this particular problem due to periodic trade. In this study, the differenced version of the almost ideal demand system is employed for estimating import demand by source and an iterative procedure is developed for deriving choke prices (prices at which imports are zero) and import demand estimates. The appeal of this procedure is that the final estimates and choke prices are not sensitive to the starting values used for the initial estimation. When comparing the results of the choke price procedure to a more traditional approach of eliminating zeros by aggregating across countries, significant differences emerge. Results clearly show that the aggregate estimates do not adequately reflect the pattern of UK imports from seasonal suppliers.","Econ Res Serv, Markets & Trade Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Muhammad, A (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, Markets & Trade Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC USA.",amuhammad@ers.usda.gov,,"MUHAMMAD, ANDREW/0000-0002-4825-9324",,,,,12,6,8,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Three of the most important theories that explain the nature and the causes of inflation are: the Keynesian approach that considers inflation as an effect of higher costs or as one of the demand side (an increase in money supply, according to Keynes, will lead to an increase in the volume of transactions due to an extra demand that will push the economy closer to full employment); the monetarist approach (starting with Fisher) that approximates inflation through an index of prices and considers it a result of changes in the velocity of money, transactions volume and the money supply (M x V = p x T); and the Austrian approach that defines inflation exclusively as a monetary phenomenon and a result of expansionary monetary policies of the Central Banks.

Therefore, the research problem is structured as a question, i.e. what is the impact of corporate reputation on customer's confidence in the organization? The proposed hypothetic model of corporate reputation management embeds customer-characteristic factors of corporate reputation perception, qualities that are inherent in the efficient management of integrated communication and reputation, and consequences of corporate reputation management in relationship to specific changes of customer behavior. The model illustrates the following assumption. The positive experience of a customer that was obtained by means of the perceived economic and social value during the development of relationship, conditions the basic outcome of positive corporate reputation, i.e. consumer advocacy which becomes evident through: increasing customer loyalty to the organization; public representation, i.e. declared confidence of the customers and their commitments in respect of the organization; increasing need for cooperation, i.e. the wish of customers to share information, participate in conflict solving and seek for mutually favorable possibilities of relationship with the organization. The information, acquired during the empirical research, yields the conclusion that all customer perception-based reputation factors, i.e. quality of goods and services, emotional appeal, vision, leadership and social responsibility, have to be strengthened in communication practices.","[Petrokaite, Karolina; Stravinskiene, Jurgita] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Petrokaite, K (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",karolina.petrokaite@yahoo.com; jurgita.stravinskiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,26,7,11,19,63,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this paper, we show that using both structural and reduced form estimates simultaneously can lead to more accurate policy predictions. Our findings are based on new information criteria that allow us to pick for both estimates impulse responses that are valid and relevant for prediction. We illustrate our findings in the context of analyzing the monetary transmission mechanism for Armenia. Based on picking valid and relevant information from both structural and reduced form matching estimation, our findings suggest that the interest rate targeting and the exchange rate channel are well specified and strongly reinforce each other in promoting the recent double-digit growth Armenia experienced before the crisis.

Both production and R&D have a positive effect on a country's human capital stock. While all countries typically grow at the same rate in the long run, they differ in their levels of human capital, per capita output, and the quality of the technologies that are used in production. A country's relative position in terms of productivity is history dependent.

Moreover, oil prices have been following an ascending trend in the last few years due to global expansion and diminishing oil reserves. In this context, it is interesting to study the impact of unexpected oil price changes on stock returns. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to investigate the impact of the unexpected change in the WTI crude oil on a set of excess stock returns of four major Romanian oil companies and on an equally weighted portfolio comprised of these stocks. Employing a monthly data frequency for the excess returns we find that a two-factor model, which includes unexpected oil price changes and the excess returns of the BET index as macroeconomic factors, is suitable to assess the influence of the crude oil market over the Romanian stock market.","[Predescu (Popescu), Oana Madalina; Constantin, Alexandra Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,predescu_oana85@yahoo.com; stelians@ase.ro; constantin_alexandra_maria@yahoo.com,"Popescu, Oana Madalina/F-4437-2015; STANCU, Stelian/HRB-5488-2023",,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2013,,,,,,,489,495,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BGV43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324282200088,0

We study the development of educational mobility after the fall of the iron curtain in East Germany and compare the relevance of parental educational background for secondary schooling in East and West Germany. Based on the data from the German Mikrozensus we find that educational mobility is lower in East than in West Germany and that it has been falling in East Germany after unification.

A comprehensive model has the advantage of providing more reliable estimates of the attributes' implicit prices thereby facilitating firms' pricing and improving effectiveness of wine production and marketing decisions. We utilize two different datasets of Sicilian wines collecting data from influential wine guides. Our results suggest that wine price strongly depends on objective features such as vintage, alcoholic content, geographical origin, grape variety, producer size and cellaring potential. In addition, use of containers like tonneaux and barrique positively affects prices, whereas use of concrete containers has a negative influence. No univocal indications emerge with regard to the effect of the type of company, type of viticulture and firm age. As for sensorial characteristics, our analysis provides novel evidence of the importance of olfactory variables such as aroma intensity and the presence of particular smells in the wine. Finally, current guides' grades and firm reputation play a crucial role in determining wine prices as well.","[Roma, Paolo; Di Martino, Giuseppe; Perrone, Giovanni] Univ Palermo, DICGIM Management Res Grp, Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Roma, P (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, DICGIM Management Res Grp, Palermo, Italy.",p.roma@dtpm.unipa.it,"Perrone, Giovanni/AAB-6818-2021; Di Martino, Giuseppe/J-5528-2019","Perrone, Giovanni/0000-0002-9336-8810; Di Martino, Giuseppe/0000-0001-7047-7611",,,,,59,32,37,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using linear regression I analysed banks' long term liquidity and leverage ratios and profitability in 12 emerging market, new member, countries and in 15 developed, old member, countries of the EU between 2008 and 2010. I point out that in EU12 there is negative relationship between profit and interbank market dependence in 2010, while positive correlation between profit and funding base stability ratio. In the case of EU15 there is a negative correlation between solvency and profitability in 2008, while the relationship is positive between capital quality - more Tier 1 capital - and profitability. Furthermore, I have tested the Myers-Majluf theory with monthly aggregated equity issue and the Dow Jones financial institutions index changes relating to the eurozone between 1990 and 2011. According to this theory, equity issue leads to lower equity prices. I point out that on an aggregated level (eurozone) the theory cannot be proved. Myers-Majluf theory is particularly important in the process of banking recapitalisation, since it is this theory that dictates slower banking capitalisation.

This paper analyzes the impact of the distribution of land on household welfare by using subjective well-being data from a rural household survey in Moldova, the poorest country in Europe. The recent land reform in Moldova provides a natural experiment on the impact of land ownership distribution on subjective well-being. We find that household land holdings have a positive effect on subjective well-being, but neighbors' average land holdings have a negative effect on subjective well-being. People, regardless of the land distribution and even given the relatively low living standards of these households, rate their welfare by looking at how much other people possess.","[Van Landeghem, Bert] Univ Maastricht, Res Ctr Educ & Labour Market ROA, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Van Landeghem, Bert; Swinnen, Johan; Vranken, Liesbet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Louvain, Belgium; [Swinnen, Johan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Louvain, Belgium; [Vranken, Liesbet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Bioecon, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Louvain, Belgium",Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); KU Leuven; KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Van Landeghem, B (通讯作者)，Univ Maastricht, Res Ctr Educ & Labour Market ROA, Maastricht, Netherlands.",,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021; Vranken, Liesbet/Q-1710-2018","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978; Vranken, Liesbet/0000-0003-1170-1139",,,,,64,6,6,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

In addition to regulation, providing better road infrastructure is an essential strategy to promote road safety. This paper investigates the relationships between different types of road quality and their impact on national safety outcomes using an international (European) panel data. Since European countries have different motorway network funding strategies-free motorways funded by the budget and tolled motorways funded by users-we pay special attention to the type of funding chosen and consider whether it has any consequences for safety. Our results suggest that extending the motorway network is associated with a reduction in fatality rates, while the rest of road types do not have the same positive effects. However, this virtue is only statistically significant for free motorways; tolled motorways do not provide any significant impact, probably due to socially inefficient pricing and investment policies currently in force.","[Albalate, Daniel; Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Bel, Germa] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Bel, G (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",gbel@ub.edu; albalate@ub.edu,"Albalate, Daniel/N-8124-2019; Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008","Albalate, Daniel/0000-0002-4940-4589; Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085",,,,,23,32,33,1,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

However, most of the debate has involved the measurement of the correct consumer price index at the national level. Much less analysis has been carried out on the distributional consequences of inflation on every household. The paper addresses this issue by performing a microsimulation analysis of the impact of inflation on Italian households in the period 19972007. It is shown that the impact of inflation has an ambiguous path over the period, with a large concentration of welfare losses around the introduction of the Euro currency. In particular, it is found that poorer and larger households are severely hurt by inflation and that the prices of gas and gasoline are largely responsible for determining the living conditions of Italian households.","[Liberati, Paolo] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Econ, Rome, Italy; [Cepparulo, Alessandra] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England; [Gastaldi, Francesca] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University; University of Exeter; Sapienza University Rome,"Liberati, P (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, Rome, Italy.",paolo.liberati@uniroma3.it,"Cepparulo, Alessandra/GNN-0407-2022","Cepparulo, Alessandra/0000-0001-7706-3868; LIBERATI, Paolo/0000-0002-6317-9701",,,,,66,2,2,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In a recent paper, Benzoni et al. (J Finance 62:2123-2167, 2007) claim that, as a result of cointegration, the optimal weight in stocks may be smaller for young investors than for older investors. This contradicts the traditional life-cycle models which typically imply portfolio weights that decrease with age. This paper shows that when stock returns are affected by other factors than dividend growth, for example due to time-varying discount rates, the portfolio implications of cointegration are much less severe. In a realistically calibrated model, the life-cycle pattern for the portfolio weight of stocks is flat, except for very young investors.","Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"de Jong, F (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",f.dejong@uvt.nl,,,,,,,9,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2012,160.0,4,,,,,397,412,,10.1007/s10645-012-9195-8,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,018PC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309672700004,0

By using the principal component analyses, the two common components of the hospitality industry price behaviours are identified: the general level of prices and the bipolar component of demand for services in hospitality industry. The econometric tests confirmed that the non-stationary sequences in time-series data are integrated of the same order and the residuals contain a stochastic trend. The first difference is stationary. The results indicate that the hospitality industry prices are significantly positively associated with domestic consumer prices and hospitality industry prices in the euro zone. The regression equation in the first differences also confirmed that the hospitality industry prices are significantly negatively associated with the fuel prices and with the dummy variable, which captures the time period after the Euro adoption in Slovenia in 2007.","[Gricar, Sergej; Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Koper 6104, Slovenia",University of Primorska,"Gricar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Cankarjeva 5, Koper 6104, Slovenia.",sergej.gricar@gmail.com; stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si,"Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Gricar, Sergej/K-3473-2014","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372; Gricar, Sergej/0000-0001-7704-5483",,,,,18,3,3,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Multinational enterprises (MNEs) benefit from an international outside option during wage bargaining, leading to a decrease in average wages. However, a strategic incentive to hire extra workers in a foreign (home) plant in order to reduce wages in the home (foreign) plant has an indirect positive effect on wages due to spillovers resulting from an increased demand for labour. In a framework of frictional unemployment. permitting MNEs leads to a decrease in unemployment. Abstracting from transport and plant fixed costs, MNEs lead to higher wages. Including transport and plant costs generally leads to lower wages, though the effects are small. The strategic hiring effect is important in mitigating the fall in wages. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The decision on how much to charge for a good or service is fundamental in social business planning. The higher the fee paid by the recipient, the more people in need can be served by the additional revenues. However, charging a fee simultaneously excludes the very poor from consumption. This paper argues that the entrepreneur's trade-off between both effects is governed by her level of poverty aversion, i.e., her preference intensity for the service of needy people with different incomes. Additionally, we account for the possibility of excess demand for the provided good and assume that applicants are rationed by non-price-allocation mechanisms. We therefore contribute to the extensive literature on the pricing and rationing behavior of nonprofit firms. Within our theoretical model, we find ambiguous reactions of the entrepreneur to a cut in donations. Given a sufficiently low level of status-quo donations, entrepreneurs with relatively high poverty aversion tend to increase the project volume, whereas those with relatively low poverty aversion do the opposite.","Otto Von Guericke Univ, Dept Econ & Management, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany",Otto von Guericke University,"Starke, C (通讯作者)，Otto Von Guericke Univ, Dept Econ & Management, POB 4120, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany.",christoph.starke@ovgu.de,,,,,,,27,3,3,2,31,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Quantity is affected if corporate taxes reduce the equilibrium stock of foreign capital in a given country. Quality effects arise if taxes decrease the extent to which investment contributes to the corporate tax base and the capital intensity of production. Depending on the sign of the quality effects, the detrimental welfare effects of corporate taxation are either mitigated or aggravated. We derive a number of hypotheses about how corporate tax changes may affect the quality of investment. Our hypotheses are then tested using data from a large sample of European multinationals. With regard to corporate tax effects on the corporate tax base, we find that quality effects account for up to 40% of the total effect. With regard to corporate tax effects on labour income, our results suggest that quality effects mitigate the negative quantity effect by nearly 60% (as corporate taxes strongly increase the labour intensity of production). An important implication is that governments should not exclusively care about the size of inbound FDI flows but also about their specific characteristics, i.e. their quality. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The first main result is that, despite the feasibility of general supply contracts which are functions of own quantity (but cannot be contingent on the rival's quantity), the first contracting parties have incentives to manipulate their contract to shift rent from the second contracting retailer and these incentives distort the industry profit away from the fully-integrated monopoly outcome. The second main result is that if the contract terms between the manufacturer and the first retailer can be renegotiated from scratch in the event that the second retailer has no agreement, then the monopoly outcome can be achieved, often with full rent extraction from the second retailer. Moreover, there are conditions under which renegotiation from scratch yields higher joint profit for the firstly contracting parties than no renegotiation. These results do not depend on the type of retail competition, the level of differentiation between the retailers, the order of sequential negotiations, the level of asymmetry between the retailers in terms of their bargaining power vis-a-vis the manufacturer, or their profitability from being the monopoly retailer.

We find a compensation premium of about 30 log points for professional (not controller-related) CEOs working in firms controlled by a family compared to firms controlled by other large shareholders. The premium cannot be explained away by standard firm characteristics, observable executive skills (e.g., education or tenure), or the compensation of the CEO in her former job.

This article shows that economic disturbances blur competence signals, dampening political budget cycles. Economic disturbances can be construed at the aggregate level as economic volatility which is a consequence of decisions taken by diverse economic actors. The more actors that are not elected at the national level have an impact on economic performance, the more difficult it will be for voters to disentangle government-specific competence shocks. Fiscal decentralisation increases policy leverage of governing bodies that are not elected at the national level; economic openness affects the number of foreign economic actors that cannot be held locally accountable. These two factors therefore limit voters' ability to disentangle individual shocks to government competence, dampening strategic borrowing. The predictions receive empirical support from a time series-cross section analysis between 1980 and 2008.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Hanusch, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Off J9-175,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",m.hanusch@worc.oxon.org,,,,,,,40,3,4,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

The methodology followed stems from the need to meet several key concerns: (i) the identification of which panel members are stationary; (ii) the presence of cross-sectional dependence among the countries in the panel; and (iii) the identification of potential structural breaks that might have occurred at different points in time. To address these concerns, we employ a recent test that examines the time series properties of the data within a panel framework, namely the Hadri and Rao (Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 70: 245-269, 2008) panel stationarity test. The real exchange rates of the 26 OECD countries are found to be stationary when considered as a panel, but only after allowing for endogenously-determined structural breaks and cross section dependence. We also find that once these structural breaks are removed from the underlying series, the half-life of shocks to the real exchange rate is much shorter than has been calculated in earlier studies.","[Holmes, Mark J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Otero, Jesus] Univ Rosario, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia; [Panagiotidis, Theodore] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Waikato; Universidad del Rosario; University of Macedonia,"Holmes, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",holmesmj@waikato.ac.nz; jesus.otero@urosario.edu.co; tpanag@uom.gr,"Panagiotidis, Theodore/C-2282-2014; Holmes, Mark/A-4117-2010; Otero, Jesus/G-1038-2011","Panagiotidis, Theodore/0000-0002-5328-3054; Holmes, Mark/0000-0002-1771-9324; Otero, Jesus/0000-0002-2551-0053",,,,,46,13,14,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Using Toda-Yamamoto (TY) procedure. it has been found that there was no relationship between these variables except the causality effect that runs from urban population to energy consumption. The absence of these linkages suggests that energy conservation strategies in Indonesia may not produce desirable effect on emission reductions, and Indonesia does not have to relinquish economic growth. However, the results may not be sufficient to warrant Indonesia's choice of specific policies and strategies to limit carbon emissions in the context of combating global climate change. This is because the study does not take into account net carbon release from deforestation and forest degradation. There seems to be substantial scope for Indonesia to limit her CO2 emission via reducing deforestation and improved forest management through the REDD Plus framework.

Externalities of their activities affect the economy deeply. Therefore, regulation of their behavior is of utmost importance for the general public. In addition, national and supranational prudential authorities request various forms and extents of mandatory disclosure. Nevertheless, voluntary disclosure is being recognized by the banks as a mechanism of asymmetric expectations' reduction and confidence enhancement of current and potential both shareholders and stakeholders. Upgrading information availability and updating its quality might be a useful way of reducing the probability of systemic banking crisis as well as a useful tool for improving market discipline. However, the causes and consequences of banks' disclosure of accounting and other information are still challengeable issues in financial literature. In that regard, the purpose of the paper is to explore the determinants of Croatian banks' online disclosure of financial information. Bank specific and industry specific factors of disclosure are being empirically examined using univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Further research objective is to compare the volume and the structure of mandatory disclosed information using content analysis. It is expected that banks with higher transparency achieve significantly better financial performance.

This study assesses the extent to which the movements in exchange rate affect domestic consumer prices in Pakistan by analyzing quarterly data from 1982 Q1 to 2010 Q4. The structural VAR (WAR) model is used to estimate the exchange rate pass-through to inflation in Pakistan. Further, impulse response function and variance decomposition are used to measure the exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices. The major findings of this study are as follows: (i) the exchange rate movements have only a moderate effect on domestic prices, (ii) for consumer prices, ERPT elasticity is around 0.042 in the short run and 0.137 in the long run, (iii) up to 90% of the price level changes are explained by its own shocks in the long run. The study concludes that the effect of an exchange rate shock on domestic prices is quite gradual, taking about 14 quarters to arrive at the full impact. The immediate effect of a structural one standard deviation shock to the exchange rate (which is 0.045 increase, or 4.5% appreciation) is about 0.001 (or 0.1%) decrease in the price level. This entails an impact elasticity of 0.042. The full effect of this shock, realized after about 14 quarters, is about 0.0062 (or 0.62%) decrease in the price level. This implies a dynamic pass-through elasticity of 0.137. The result highlights the importance of other factors that play significant roles in the Pakistan's inflationary process, e.g. supply shocks.

Our results indicate that both capital controls and FX-related prudential measures are associated with a lower proportion of FX lending in total domestic bank credit, and with a lower proportion of portfolio debt in total external liabilities. Other prudential policies appear to help restrain the intensity of aggregate credit booms.

It presents a linear production model where a banking industry is introduced and argues that changes in the size of the financial industry can change the distributive shares even if the rates of profit and wage remain constant. An increase in the new loans to workers can increase the profit share and reduce the wage share through an increase in effective demand and the level of production. The analysis can support the contention that the process of financial deregulation, with the consequent explosion of the financial system and the rise of systemic risk, is at the basis of the increase in income inequality observed in recent years.","[Panico, Carlo] Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Econ, I-80134 Naples, Italy; [Pinto, Antonio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Stat, I-80134 Naples, Italy; [Puchet Anyul, Martin] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Panico, C (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Econ, Via Mezzocannone 16, I-80134 Naples, Italy.",panico@unina.it,,,,,,,64,23,26,3,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Based on tests of equality of the estimated Markov chains across countries as well as the expected times to switch between different states, we find evidence that (i) the developed and emerging economies are de-coupled from each other in terms of their cyclical dynamics, and (ii) the behavior of industrial production and employment growth are de-coupled for the emerging economies.

We find that deregulation and consolidation are associated with a 10 percent increase in operating performance, achieved primarily by reducing the duration of reactor outages.

As compared to models that rest on steady-state analysis, we show that the welfare gains of a public debt increase are substantially higher when transitional dynamics are accounted for. The additional debt issue allows for a temporary reduction in the income tax rate, which stimulates labor supply and generates an overshooting of the interest rate. The short-run gains create a temptation to deviate toward higher levels of debt.

To confirm his theoretical prediction, Carpenter developed an experiment showing that free riding actually grows faster when agents have the information necessary to conform. The model and the experiment are, however, inherently different, for the time scales of the model are not able to capture the short run convergence of behavior in the experimental laboratory. We here present a model of conformity which offers the same laboratory results as Carpenter without resorting to evolutionary models, and also gives agents the chance to adopt different strategies implying various levels of cooperation.

The analysis covers the 15 OECD countries whose banking sectors were most severely hit by the crisis and that provided the largest public bailouts relative to their national gross domestic product (GDP). We show that the design of the interventions varied considerably across banks and countries. Larger and higher loss-absorbing capital injections were targeted at weaker banks and at banks of systemically relevant size, when the state of public finances allowed. Our results encourage theoretical research with respect to non-linear and potentially adverse effects of bailouts, as well as further investigation into the link between the loss absorbing properties of bank capital and loan growth. With respect to bank lending, we find that only large recapitalizations and infusions of common equity are associated with higher total regulatory capital ratios and sustained loan growth.

This article examines a non-constant-sum version of the Colonel Blotto game that relaxes this use it or lose it feature. We find that if the level of asymmetry between the players' budgets is below a threshold, then there exists a one-to-one mapping from the unique set of equilibrium univariate marginal distribution functions in the constant-sum game to those in the non-constant-sum game. Once the asymmetry of the players' budgets exceeds the threshold, this relationship breaks down and we construct a new equilibrium.","[Roberson, Brian] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Kvasov, Dmitriy] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Adelaide,"Roberson, B (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",brobers@purdue.edu; dmitriy.kvasov@adelaide.edu.au,,"Kvasov, Dmitriy/0000-0002-2580-6137",,,,,36,45,49,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

With such a realistic market microstructure, the model is able not only to obtain the results of the CHH model but also to characterize most of the stylized facts including volatility clustering, insignificant autocorrelations (ACs) of returns, and significant slowly decaying ACs of the absolute returns.

As foreign capital occupies a high proportion of the total capital of FIEs, most FIEs' capital gains are foreign factor income. Although these gains are calculated as a part of China's GDP, they do not belong to China's national income. To determine the real contribution of exports to China's welfare, the present paper analyses the impact of exports on China's national income using a non-competitive inputoutput model capturing processing trade. The results show that every US$1000 of China's exports generates US$506.8 of national income. The real contribution of exports to China's welfare is much smaller than what we expected. This suggests that China should endeavor to improve the gains from international markets or find another engine to maintain its economic growth.","[Duan, Yuwan; Yang, Cuihong; Zhu, Kunfu; Chen, Xikang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS","Duan, YW (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ywduan@amss.ac.cn; chyang@iss.ac.cn; zhukunfu@amss.ac.cn; xkchen@iss.ac.cn,"liping, sun/AAW-1808-2021; Duan, Yuwan/AAP-3781-2020","liping, sun/0000-0002-4711-3518;",,,,,24,13,15,4,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2012,20.0,5,,,,,83,102,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01303.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,014SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309395400005,0

We argue this is the consequence of pursuing procyclical fiscal policies. We add a fiscal rule, which varies public spending with the cycle, to an otherwise standard RBC model of a small open economy. This procyclical reaction of fiscal policy to output distorts intertemporal allocation decisions. Procyclical spending generates very volatile cycles in investment and the current account. Our model is able to replicate the relationship between the degree of cyclicality of fiscal policy and the volatility of consumption, investment and the current account we observe in OECD countries. A policy that let automatic stabilisers work can effectively smooth economic fluctuations, especially after structural reforms that raise the responsiveness of the economy.

In particular, the theory is unable to accommodate readily the opposite signs for occupation (positive) and education (negative), assuming the wage rate is directly correlated with both variables. This paper provides a new interpretation of Fair's estimates that accounts for the unexpected education result in terms of the association between schooling and the discount factor applied to expected future sanctions for sexual cheating. Three data sets from the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom are investigated to check the robustness of the partial correlations between infidelity and economic incentives. Taken together, the results across different countries and infidelity measures are substantially in agreement, especially for men. In a novel contribution, this study distinguishes between one off encounters, and irregular and regular forms of infidelity and finds that these are differentially related to occupation and education, consistent with theoretical predictions.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Smith, I (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",is@st-and.ac.uk,,"Smith, Ian/0000-0002-4795-056X",,,,,33,10,11,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We thus develop a new policy stance index, and examine it in an ordered probit model, which follows the studies by Gerlach (2004) and He and Pauwels (2008). The empirical results show that in a backward-looking model, monetary policy reacts to actual output growth; one the other hand, when deviations from trend levels are considered, the PBC concerns inflation most seriously. In a forward-looking model, when we examine the PBC's statements in its quarterly Monetary Policy Executive Report from 2001Q1 to 2010Q3, it seems that the PBC's assessment of the prospects for inflation plays a key role determining the PBC's monetary policy stance.

To that end we compare the current sample distribution of Dow Jones Industrial Average Index returns for a 769-day period (from 15 September 2008, the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, to 30 September 2011), with all historical sample distributions of returns computed using a moving window of 769 days in the 2 January 1900 to 12 September 2008 period. Using a chi(2) homogeneity test, we find that the stock market returns distribution during the current crisis would be similar to several past periods of severe financial crises that evolved into intense recessions, being the sub-sample from 22 September 1937 to 16 October 1940 the most analogous episode to the current situation. Furthermore, when applying the procedure proposed by Diebold et al.

Shedding Further Light on the Causes of Current Account Reversals,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ADJUSTMENT,"Large shifts in countries' external current account positions can be disruptive, often reflecting sudden stops in the flows of external finance and leading to exchange rate and banking crises. As a result, an empirical literature has emerged on the sustainability of, and the determinants of large swings in, current account positions. Further light is shed on this issue by testing for the presence of unit roots in the current account balance-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios of a large set of mature and emerging-market economies using a methodology that allows for structural breaks in levels and trends. A chronology is constructed of current account reversals that is consistent with sustainability of external positions and it is used to estimate the factors explaining the likelihood and magnitude of such reversals by utilising a selection model with ordered probit in the selection stage. It is found that most of the factors that explain the probability of reversals, such as trends in capital flows, in the budget balance and in external positions, also influence their magnitude, but there are a few exceptions. For instance, the stance of monetary policy and the magnitude of external imbalances prior to a reversal seem to be more powerful predictors of the probability of reversals than of their magnitude.",,,,,,,,,,,27,7,8,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Is There a Delayed Overshooting Puzzle?,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MODEL SELECTION PROCEDURES; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; SHOCKS; ECONOMY,"The determination of the US dollar/UK pound sterling exchange rate is studied in a small symmetric macroeconometric model including UKUS differentials in inflation, output gap, and short- and long-term interest rates for the four decades since the breakdown of Bretton Woods. The key question addressed is the possible presence of a delayed overshooting puzzle in the dynamic reaction of the exchange rate to monetary policy shocks. In contrast to the existing literature, we follow a data-driven modeling approach combining (i) a vector autoregression (VAR)-based cointegration analysis with (ii) a graph-theoretic search for instantaneous causal relations and (iii) an automatic general-to-specific approach for the selection of a congruent parsimonious structural vector equilibrium correction model. We find that the long-run properties of the system are characterized by four cointegration relations and one stochastic trend, which is identified as the long-term interest rate differential and that appears to be driven by long-term inflation expectations as in the Fisher hypothesis. It cointegrates with the inflation differential to a stationary real long-term rate differential and also drives the exchange rate. The short-run dynamics are characterized by a direct link from the short-term to the long-term interest rate differential. Jumps in the exchange rate after short-term interest rate variations are only significant at 10%. Overall, we find strong evidence for delayed overshooting and violations of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) in response to monetary policy shocks.","[Heinlein, Reinhold; Krolzig, Hans-Martin] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Heinlein, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",rh341@kent.ac.uk; hm.krolzig@gmail.com,,"Heinlein, Reinhold/0000-0002-3389-9230",,,,,38,11,11,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Still, while they may be privileged witnesses of the democratic process, real-world politicians typically act upon imperfect information. Using a large scale survey among (498) Belgian local politicians we analyse whether and to what extent politicians are informed on public opinion. More precisely, we analyse their predictions of the electoral result of their own party in an upcoming election. The focus is on the impact of the electorate's complexity on this prediction accuracy. Complexity is defined in terms of the size and heterogeneity of the electorate. Complexity is found to affect both cognitive (prediction accuracy becomes smaller) and affective (predictions are biased through wishful thinking) processes underlying the politician's prediction. The empirical results show that smaller electorates have better informed politicians (with smaller prediction errors and less subject to wishful thinking), offering a case for decentralized government. Heterogeneity has a bearing on prediction accuracy and wishful thinking. Interestingly, the effects differ between politicians in power and those in opposition.","[Jottier, Dimi; Heyndels, Bruno] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Econ, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Ashworth, John] Univ Durham, Dept Econ, Durham DH1 3HY, England",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Durham University,"Jottier, D (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Econ, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",dimi.jottier@vub.ac.be; john.ashworth@durham.ac.uk; bruno.heyndels@vub.ac.be,,"Heyndels, Bruno/0000-0003-0721-1364",,,,,44,15,15,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2012,65.0,3,,,,,340,370,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2012.00542.x,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,969TN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306081600004,0

Mendoza / Marco E. Terrones What are the stylized facts that characterize the dynamics of credit booms and the associated fluctuations in macro-economic aggregates? This paper answers this question by applying a method proposed in our earlier work for measuring and identifying credit booms to data for 61 emerging and industrial countries over the 1960-2010 period. We identify 70 credit boom events, half of them in each group of countries. Event analysis shows a systematic relationship between credit booms and a boom-bust cycle in production and absorption, asset prices, real exchange rates, capital inflows, and external deficits. Credit booms are synchronized internationally and show three striking similarities in industrial and emerging economies: (1) credit booms are similar in duration and magnitude, normalized by the cyclical variability of credit; (2) banking crises, currency crises or sudden stops often follow credit booms, and they do so at similar frequencies in industrial and emerging economies; and (3) credit booms often follow surges in capital inflows, gains in total factor productivity, and financial reforms, and are far more common with managed than flexible exchange rates.","[Mendoza, Enrique G.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Mendoza, Enrique G.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Terrones, Marco E.] Fondo Monetario Int, Washington, DC USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mendoza, EG (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",mendoza@econ.bsos.umd.edu; mterrones@imf.org,"Terrones, Mauricio/B-3829-2014","Terrones, Mauricio/0000-0003-0010-2851",,,,,43,54,71,0,8,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

Building on the unresolved tension between Marx's concept of value and the specific character of the labour constituting itself as value in his theory of commodity production, it is argued that Marx's is actually a theory of the mercantile form of value. Thus, it becomes evident that the process of realisation of material production in commodity production and the process giving rise to money are the same, and that they are only the material manifestation of the process of realisation of private and independent work as social labour. This characterises commodity production as the unity-in-difference of a material and a social moment, showing that Marx's mercantile form of value is the conceptualisation of Adam Smith's invisible hand. The paper also argues that Marx's is not the theory of a money commodity.","Lincoln Univ, Fac Commerce, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand",Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Ahumada, P (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Fac Commerce, POB 84, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand.",pablo.pahumada@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,4,5,1,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

However, much of the current debate regarding energy efficiency in the housing market focuses on the physical and technical determinants of energy consumption, neglecting the role of the economic behavior of resident households. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which the use of gas and electricity is determined by the technical specifications of the dwelling as compared to the demographic characteristics of the residents. Our analysis is based on a sample of more than 300,000 Dutch homes and their occupants. The results indicate that residential gas consumption is determined principally by structural dwelling characteristics, such as the vintage, building type, and characteristics of the dwelling, while electricity consumption varies more directly with household composition, in particular income and family composition. Combining these results with projections on future economic and demographic trends, we find that, even absent price increases for residential energy, the aging of the population and their increasing wealth will roughly offset improvements in the energy efficiency of the building stock resulting from policy interventions and natural revitalization.

This is done by matching individual level data with group specific cumulative AIDS mortality rates. Exploiting the panel nature of the data, I remove individuals whose productivity is most likely impacted by HIV/AIDS, and find evidence that cumulative AIDS mortality has led to reductions in wages of between 3 and 6% for the African population group (Black South Africans). Furthermore, I also find evidence that the epidemic has lowered employment in South Africa. This result is concentrated among those with the lowest levels of education and employment. Although not large in magnitude, these effects are widespread across a significant portion of the population, contributing to a substantial loss of income throughout the South African economy.

We test the applicability of this result in an environment that contains some of the key contextual issues that are usually excluded from more abstract games, but which might be important in situations involving income redistribution. Our general finding is that votes for a redistributive tax are almost entirely in accordance with self-interest: above-average earners vote for low tax rates and below-average earners vote for high tax rates. A measure of subjects' preferences for fairness or equality, their self-reported economic ideology, is not directly related to their voting behavior in this experiment. Because the ideology measure should be correlated with any intrinsic preferences regarding inequality aversion, we conclude that any preferences for fairness or inequality that our subjects possess are not strong enough to overcome self-interest in this context. We do, however, find evidence for a possible indirect effect of ideology on choice behavior in that more conservative subjects tend to be more responsive to their self-interest than the more liberal subjects.

J,"Lewis, MS",,,,"Lewis, Matthew S.",,,Price leadership and coordination in retail gasoline markets with price cycles,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Price leadership; Coordination; Gasoline; Edgeworth Cycle,,"This study examines the coordination mechanism used by gasoline stations in the midwestern United States where prices exhibit highly cyclical fluctuations known as Edgeworth cycles. Stations in these markets repeatedly coordinate large marketwide price increases following periods of aggressive price undercutting. By studying these periodic price jumps both over time and across cities, I find that a particular retail chain in each city acts as a price leader initiating each price restoration. The leader signals the new price level to competitors by simultaneously jumping prices at all its stations to a single price. Competitors follow quickly with a large majority of stations jumping to the exact same price within a 24 hour period. The characteristics of the leading firms and the nature of observed price coordination suggest that successful price jumps may be facilitated by the existence of a retailer controlling the prices of a significant number of stations in a city. Identifying the important role of these firms in the market contributes to a broader understanding of price leadership and coordination and highlights another potential reason why price cycles exist in some in retail gasoline markets and not others.

We show that these previous interim results are not robust to the introduction of (weak) priorities. However, we partially restore the earlier results by showing that from an ex-ante utility perspective, the Boston mechanism Pareto dominates any strategyproof mechanism (including DA), even allowing for arbitrary priority structures. Thus, we suggest ex-ante Pareto dominance as a relevant criterion by which to compare school choice mechanisms. This criterion may be of particular interest to school districts, as they can be thought of as social planners whose goal is to maximize the overall ex-ante welfare of the students.

To analyze the impact of alternative imbalance pricing mechanisms on balancing market performance, an agent-based model has been built, in which the BRPs are the agents that decide autonomously in each round on their balancing strategy based on results in past rounds. Six alternative mechanisms are analyzed. It is concluded that aiming for a small long position is generally the preferable BRP strategy. Different imbalance pricing mechanisms lead to comparable system imbalances, but single pricing results in the lowest imbalance costs for the BRPs and for the market as a whole.

To insure against the revenue risk, the producer can purchase a coinsurance contract with an endogenously chosen coinsurance rate. Regret-averse preferences are characterized by a utility function that includes disutility from having chosen ex-post suboptimal alternatives. We show that the regret-averse producer never fully insures against the revenue risk even though the coinsurance contract is actuarially fair. When the producer is sufficiently regret averse and the loss probability is high, we further show that the regret-averse producer chooses not to purchase the actuarially fair coinsurance contract. Even when purchasing the actuarially fair coinsurance contract is optimal, we derive sufficient conditions under which the regret-averse producer reduces the optimal output level as compared to that without the coinsurance contract. These results are distinct from those under pure risk aversion, thereby making the consideration of regret aversion crucial. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The findings suggest that external habit formation models, face a challenge in producing two robust facts in aggregate data, namely, that stock market returns lead consumption growth, and that the correlation between returns and consumption growth is higher at low frequencies. To reconcile these facts with a consumption-based model, I demonstrate the need for focusing on models that contain a forward-looking consumption component, i.e., models that allow for both trend and cyclical fluctuations in consumption, and that link returns to cyclical fluctuations in consumption. Long-run risk models provide examples of models that contain this consumption component. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

These flows are constrained by the employment protection gap between open-ended and fixed-term contracts. We explore a reform that increased the employment protection of open-ended contracts and generated a quasi-experiment. The causal evidence points to an increase in the share and in the excess turnover of fixed-term contracts in treated firms. The excess turnover of open-ended contracts remained unchanged. This result is consistent with a high degree of substitution between open-ended and fixed-term contracts. At the firm level, we also show that excess turnover is quite heterogeneous and quantify its association with firm, match, and worker characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Robust evidence is obtained that domestic firms displayed significant productivity gains (losses) upon export entry (exit), whereas foreign affiliates showed no evident TFP changes. Moreover, the productivity gains for domestic export starters were more pronounced in high- and medium-technology industries than in low-technology ones.

In research on households, and the distribution of income within them, studies have typically focussed on women. When it comes to over-indebtedness, women are also more likely than men to seek debt advice. This article reports on a UK study of men and over-indebtedness that focused on the dynamics of couple relationships. The research used in-depth interviews with menin partnerships and living alone after family breakdown to explore how gender relations and gendered identities figure in men's acquisition and management of problematic personal debt, including their orientation towards and experiences of debt advice. It was undertaken when a period of readily available credit and soaring levels of borrowing had been followed by the 'credit crunch', when recession had left many families struggling with problematic debt and when debt advice services were coping with increasing levels of demand. In this context, there were some signs that the effects of the recession were leading men to seek debt advice more than had been the case in the past. Findings illustrate the dynamics of male control of household expenditure and the acquisition of problematic debt. They also suggest that when men have sole responsibility for managing incomes constrained by over-indebtedness, they experience the anxiety and depression more typically reported by women; but 'male pride' in relation to financial matters that forms a significant component of their identities acts as a barrier to seeking advice.

It has been argued that the recent economic situation in Tunisia is the culmination of three decades of neoliberal economic policies that have contributed to the rise in income inequality, the lack of upward mobility for educated youth, and the removal of social safety nets for the working class. This paper argues that the economic success of post-Ben Ali Tunisia must do away with neoliberal economic policies and focus instead on direct job creation through public sector spending. A six-year full employment program is proposed for Tunisia in the Post Keynesian Institutionalist tradition of Hyman Minsky. The main purpose of this paper is to address the technical question of financial affordability of direct job creation, rather than focusing on the logistical aspects of the program. The paper demonstates that this program can create full employment, contribute an additional 4.8 percentage points to GDP growth, and cost 3.36 percent of GDP.","Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43025 USA",University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Kaboub, F (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, 227 Higley Hall,100 W Coll St, Granville, OH 43025 USA.",kaboubf@denison.edu,,,,,,,19,10,10,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

In the first phase, large capital outflows led to a severe liquidity strain in the foreign exchange market, resulting in a rapid depreciation of the exchange rate. Then, in the second phase, the contraction of global demand led to a collapse of exports and a sharp decline in economic activity, raising concerns about a full-fledged financial crisis in Korea. This paper describes how the global financial crisis spilled over into the Korean economy and how the Korean government responded to the financial turmoil. It also provides the background and rationale for the Korean government's decisions to adopt specific policy measures.

The setup is a neoclassical growth model augmented with a relatively rich public sector. The model is calibrated to the Greek economy. The results suggest that, if the goal of fiscal policy is to stimulate the economy and increase welfare by changing the tax mix, then it should decrease the tax rate on labour income and increase the consumption tax rate. While higher public investment spending is good for the economy, it is lower public consumption spending that is found to be expansionary. The results also suggest that both tax- and expenditure-based debt consolidation policies lead to worse economic activity in the short run, but they have strong beneficial effects in the medium and long run when the consolidation period finishes.

Consistent with Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) and most of the more recent research, we find that public debt overhang episodes are associated with lower growth than during other periods. The duration of the average debt overhang episode is perhaps its most striking feature. Among the 26 episodes we identify, 20 lasted more than a decade. The long duration belies the view that the correlation is caused mainly by debt buildups during business cycle recessions. The long duration also implies that the cumulative shortfall in output from debt overhang is potentially massive. These growth-reducing effects of high public debt are apparently not transmitted exclusively through high real interest rates, as in eleven of the episodes, interest rates are not materially higher.","[Reinhart, Carmen M.] Harvard Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA USA; [Reinhart, Carmen M.; Rogoff, Kenneth S.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Reinhart, Carmen M.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England; [Reinhart, Vincent R.] Morgan Stanley, New York, NY USA; [Rogoff, Kenneth S.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Morgan Stanley; Harvard University,"Reinhart, CM (通讯作者)，Harvard Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA USA.",Carmen_Reinhart@harvard.edu; vincent.reinhart@morganstanley.com; krogoff@harvard.edu,"Rogoff, Kenneth/G-1894-2018",,,,,,26,187,210,2,44,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Reflecting longer term structural problems, this employment loss translated into a much larger rise in the number of discouraged individuals rather than those defined as onarrowly' unemployed. Drawing on estimates using the micro-data, this paper shows that this state of non-searching unemployment or discouragement has increased more during the recent crisis for uneducated African males. Moreover, individuals who have given up job search during the recession are statistically different than those who continue searching. At the same time, searching is a transitory state for some of the jobless with considerable movements between the two categories of unemployment. These findings from the first post-Apartheid recession underscore the importance in the South African context of analysing a broad measure of unemployment, which includes discouraged workers. In response to these labour market challenges, the government should further reduce barriers to job search through such measures as training for the low-skilled and transport subsidies, along with other interventions that boost demand and job creation in rural areas.","[Verick, Sher] ILO, New Delhi, India; [Verick, Sher] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Verick, S (通讯作者)，ILO, New Delhi, India.",verick@ilo.org,,,,,,,39,27,32,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

J,"Wozniak, D",,,,"Wozniak, David",,,Gender differences in a market with relative performance feedback: Professional tennis players,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gender; Feedback; Competition,INCENTIVES,"Recent studies have found that females are less competitive than men. These studies have all relied on a similar framework where individuals have little information about their relative abilities compared to other potential competitors. It has also been found that performance feedback leads to more efficient choices for students and in experimental settings. Professional athletes competing in individual sports typically have access to performance feedback and good information about the quality of their potential competitors when choosing to enter competitive tournaments. In this paper, I use data from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) on tournament entry decisions by professional players to study gender differences in tournament entry and preferences in this competitive labor market. I find that even among this highly competitive population, gender differences exist in performance and tournament entry. In terms of performance I find that men exhibit a hot hand effect that can last for multiple periods while females are affected by only their performance in their last tournament. This effect is obvious in tournament entry where both men and women are more likely to enter tournaments after doing well, but women are affected by their last tournament while men's previous performance can affect entry beyond the next tournament. The gender difference from feedback is more striking when taking into account whether individuals actually played in a tournament. In that case, higher ability females respond positively to performance from their last tournament while males do not. But both genders see similar effects from previous performance in the short-term and the effects are larger for worse ranked individuals. Thus, in very competitive settings of same-sex tournaments, females and males respond differently to performance feedback information suggesting that information has very different, gender-specific effects for competitions and may be largely dependent on the length of time that has elapsed from the competition that the feedback is coming from.

By making use of panel data over the period 1970 to 2009, this paper focuses on the impact of the interaction of (i) financial development and foreign direct investment and (ii) financial development and the quality of governance on economic growth in South Asia. Our empirical analysis, suggests that financial development has contributed to an increase in the benefits of FDI in South Asia. In addition, improvement in political rights and civil liberties has also enhanced the benefits of financial development in South Asia. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Reciprocity is most powerful when output is a poor signal of effort and when the agent is highly reciprocal and/or productive. Similarly, reciprocal incentives are attractive when firm managers have strong incentive pay and discretion over employee compensation. While reciprocal incentives can be optimal even when identical firms compete, a reciprocity contract is most likely when one firm has a match-specific productivity advantage with the agent.

The production of these sophisticated inputs requires greater collaboration between suppliers and final good producers, with suppliers developing relationship-specific inputs, and final good producers customizing their production processes to incorporate them. In countries with poor legal institutions, the relationship-specific investments needed to achieve strong collaboration, and by extension more sophisticated inputs and higher quality outputs, will arguably be hard to achieve. As the incomplete contracts literature suggests, doubts over contract enforcement will render the return on relationship-specific investments less certain, rendering both suppliers and final good producers less willing to undertake the customization necessary to improve quality. Employing a difference-in-difference methodology on highly disaggregated US import data, this paper studies the impact of legal institutions on product quality. It finds that poor contracting institutions substantially impede a country's ability to produce high quality final goods: in industries where the potential use of customizable inputs is extensive, countries with weaker contract enforcement regimes produce lower quality final goods.

Unless the intermediate country is very small, in a relative sense, it will gain industry when relocation costs are reduced, but lose industry when trade costs are reduced. The smallest country loses industry in both cases, but only experiences lower welfare in the case of lower relocation costs.

First, we suppose that the SOE is under pressure to provide employment, and therefore has an employment goal, as well as the traditional profit and consumer surplus objectives. Assuming that the SOE has difficulty committing to current buyers with respect to its profit and employment motives, we find that as the employment burden increases, the SOE tends to move further away from the efficient durability and provides a lower durability level than a pure profit maximizer. Additionally, we show that a durable-goods SOE without commitment power, will wish to partially privatize to help mitigate its commitment problem with buyers and increase social welfare. Both of these findings provide economic rationale for the partial privatization of SOEs in transitioning economies that have not been identified in the literature prior to this.

We first study the impact of a negative shock to entrepreneurs' net worth and a positive monetary policy shock on business cycle fluctuations. We then look at the impact of a negative net worth shock on business cycle fluctuations when the minimum capital requirement increases from 8 percent to 12 percent. Our comparison studies between the augmented BGG model with Basel I bank regulation and the one with Basel II bank regulation suggest that, in the presence of credit market frictions and bank capital regulation, the liquidity premium effect further amplifies the financial accelerator effect through the external finance premium channel, which, in turn, contributes to the amplification of Basel II procyclicality. Moreover, under Basel II bank regulation, in response to a negative net worth shock, the liquidity premium and the external finance premium rise much more if the minimum bank capital requirement increases, which, in turn, amplify the response of real variables. Finally, small adjustments in monetary policy can result in stronger response in the real economy, in the presence of Basel II bank regulation in particular, which is undesirable.

Due to the time constraint in chess, it is possible to study performance and choices related to time preferences. The results suggest that men play shorter games on average and pay a higher price to end the game sooner. They also perform worse in shorter game compared to women but better in longer games. Furthermore, women perform worse in time pressure (the 40th move time control). The results are consistent with the interpretation that men are more impatient (with a lower discount factor) but also more inconsistent in the sense that they tend to be too impatient. Women, on the other hand, are more inconsistent as they tend to over-consume reflection time in the beginning, leading to time pressure later. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this environment we ran an experiment to explain why prices are interdependent even when preferences are independent. We compare our results to previous theoretical and laboratory experimental literature on price fairness. We find that even in the absence of interaction among subjects, price fairness/unfairness does play a major role in the decision to accept or reject a deal. Subjects tend to be more resistant to a price increase and reject a deal when the preferred product is not referenced to price increases of not substitute products, if these products are considered to be a benchmark for fair conduct. Thus demand cross elasticity can arise between products that are not substitutes. This result has important implications for antitrust policy. In delineating a market perimeter, fairness concerns suggest that products that are similar but not interchangeable should be included in the relevant antitrust market. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The main conclusion of this article is that the entrant's efficient make-or-buy decision is always socially optimal in the case of the Hotelling model, is socially optimal for the set of input prices that induce the entrant to undertake the efficient decision in the case of Cournot competition and is not necessarily socially optimal in the Bertrand vertical differentiation model. Last, this article examines the conditions under which the efficient and/or socially optimal make-or-buy decision undertaken by an entrant fulfills the regulatory two-fold goal of promoting service-based competition and encouraging facilities-based competition. Therefore, this article also provides the optimal access pricing policy that results in the best feasible outcome in terms of social welfare, productive efficiency, competition level and investment level for a given downstream competition model.","[Tselekounis, Markos; Varoutas, Dimitris; Martakos, Drakoulis] Univ Athens, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Athens 15784, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Varoutas, D (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Athens 15784, Greece.",D.Varoutas@di.uoa.gr,"Varoutas, Dimitris/D-5536-2013; Tselekounis, Markos/I-5158-2014","Varoutas, Dimitris/0000-0002-9101-6221; Tselekounis, Markos/0000-0003-0014-6053",,,,,15,4,4,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Secondly, we solve the case where there are only good and neutral elements. In both instances the evaluation of the sets is purely additive. Lastly, we show that dropping one of the axioms in our general characterization produces an axiomatization of the more general class of evaluations where good and bad elements are weighted differently.

This paper investigates whether technology spillover effects are greater for high-technology exports than for primary manufactured goods exports. We present a generalized multi-sector spillover model to identify both between-spillover effects from exports towards non-exporters and within-spillover effects among export sectors. Using panel data for 31 provinces in China over the period from 1998 to 2005, we find that although high-technology export sectors have higher productivity compared with other sectors, this productivity advantage does not lead to technology spillover to both domestic sectors and other export sectors, and export technology spillover mainly derives from traditional export sectors rather than high-technology export sectors. As such findings can be largely attributed to the fact that China's high-technology exports depend significantly on processing trade by foreign-invested firms, policy implications are discussed in relation to how to best promote the role of China's high-technology exports during economic expansion.","[Bao, Qun; Sun, Puyang; Su, Li] Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University,"Bao, Q (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",baoqun@yeah.net; puyangsun@nankai.edu.cn; lisu@nankai.edu.cn,,,,,,,29,4,4,5,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2012,20.0,2,,,,,1,22,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01277.x,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,919TT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302352700001,0

The welfare analysis is based on two alternative scenarios, a hypothetical percentage increase in the price of the commodity and a hypothetical percentage decrease in the amount of subsidy. The latter is considered to be a simultaneous problem in which the exact price of the commodity that reduces consumption, and subsequently the subsidy to the specific target level needs to be determined first. As a case study, the paper utilizes the most recent Household Expenditure Survey in the State of Kuwait to estimate residential electricity demand for different household groups (i.e., low-, middle-, and high-income), and employs a partial equilibrium model to measure the welfare implications that may result from a reduction in the electricity subsidy rates. The empirical findings show that a small increase in the price of electricity would reduce annual consumption by 4741 million kWh and annual subsidy by US$734 million. The results also show that the loss in consumers' welfare is approximately US$145 million, while the financial and environmental benefits to the society ranges between US$658 million and US$889 million. The magnitude of these welfare gains suggests that electricity price reforms combined with a rebate scheme to compensate households for their welfare loss, offsetting any political resistance to reform, is a win-win situation.

Results indicate that poverty in Spain has two important characteristics: a small group of individuals is persistently poor while those in transitory poverty experience a high probability of recurrence. Thus, in the case of Spain, in contrast with other European Union countries, it is particularly relevant to make a further distinction within the transitory poor: those with recurrent poverty spells versus those that experience once in a lifetime poverty. Chronic poverty has a stronger effect on households whose head is over 65 or has a low level of education, and whose members are less likely to be wage earners. Transitory and recurrent poverty is linked to the self-employment of the head and to the presence of children in the household.","[Canto, Olga; Gradin, Carlos; del Rio, Coral] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,,,"GRADIN, CARLOS/E-8046-2016; Cantó, Olga/E-7883-2016; GRADIN, CARLOS/AAH-9326-2019; del Rio, Coral/M-5560-2019","Cantó, Olga/0000-0003-0780-3212; GRADIN, CARLOS/0000-0001-7744-0707; del Rio, Coral/0000-0002-3173-3624",,,,,33,6,6,1,20,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

In this paper, we use a dynamic panel data model to examine the economic growth of the PPRD economies from 1985 to 2009. Our analysis confirms the existence of regional growth spillover effects in the PPRD area. Our results also show that economic growth spillover effects of non-PPRD regions on the PPRD regions are greater than those among the PPRD members themselves. These findings imply that economic integration between Chinese provinces has generated considerable spillover effects on regional growth. However, the anticipated benefits of the implementation of the PPRD agreement have not been realized thus far. Therefore, greater effort should be made to promote further economic integration among these members so that their local economies can benefit from the positive spillover effects.","[Chen, Yu] Univ Macau, Dept Econ, Taipa, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanrui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",University of Macau; University of Western Australia,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Dept Econ, Taipa, Peoples R China.",yuchen@umac.mo; yanrui.wu@uwa.edu.au,"Wu, Yanrui/C-2458-2013","Wu, Yanrui/0000-0002-8966-1459",,,,,28,12,15,2,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2012,20.0,2,,,,,80,97,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01281.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,919TT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302352700005,0

There are three primary factors: capital, skilled labour and unskilled labour. Industrial sector producing a traded good uses capital, intermediate goods and skilled labour as inputs. Intermediate goods producing sector also uses capital and skilled labour. Public input producing sector and the agricultural sector producing the other traded good use capital and unskilled labour as inputs. It is shown that, if production technologies are the same for the agricultural sector and the public input producing sector and if the scale elasticity of output is very low, then an increase in capital stock (unskilled labour endowment) raises (lowers) the skilled-unskilled wage ratio. However, an increase in skilled labour endowment does not produce any unambiguous effect. On the other hand, an increase in the tax rate on industrial output and/or an increase in the price of the agricultural product, armed with the same set of assumptions, lowers the skilled-unskilled wage ratio.

I find that the prominence of disclosure of a software license agreement has little effect on readership.

More precisely, it asks how reality in the form of empirical evidence does or does not influence economic thinking and theory. In particular, which role do calibration, statistical inference, and structural change play? What is the current state of affairs, what are the successes and failures, what are the challenges? I shall tackle these questions moving from general to specific. For the general perspective, I examine the following four points of view. First, economics is a science. Second, economics is an art. Third, economics is a competition. Forth, economics is politics. I then examine four specific cases for illustration and debate. First, is there a Phillips curve? Second, are prices sticky? Third, does contractionary monetary policy lead to a contraction in output? Forth, what causes business cycles? The general points as well as the specific cases each have their own implication for the central question at hand. Armed with this list of implications.

Simultaneously, it is expected that households in rural areas will face energy shortages and additional environmental problems unless they have more access to renewable energy technologies. However, little is known about (i) the transition of energy use patterns and (ii) whether introduced technologies have been effective. To analyze these issues, we estimated the energy demands of rural households by using survey data taken from Beijing's ten suburban districts. The data contain information on both non-commercial and commercial energy use, key characteristics of the households and several renewable energy technologies. Our empirical analysis yielded three main results. First, the per capita income is a key factor in the per capita energy consumption. More specifically, the marginal increase (or marginal change) in per capita coal consumption strongly diminishes (or declines) as per capita income increases. Second, coal and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices do not exhibit substitution effects, but an increase in these prices has strong negative effects on the use of these energy resources. Third, renewable energy technologies are identified to reduce coal consumption and to improve energy efficiency. Overall, these findings suggest a positive perspective: if the Chinese government were to design appropriate policies associated with renewable energy technologies and related energy prices, then coal consumption can be reduced in the near future. and the substitution to cleaner energy use will accelerate. Therefore, a smooth energy transition in rural China could be made in a more environmentally sustainable manner. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, the existing ETR measures are based on rather simplifying assumptions. In particular, they disregard the existence of different kinds of debt and hybrid securities. In this paper, we use contingent-claim analysis to calculate the ETR. We will therefore deal with both pure debt and two of the most well-known hybrid securities, that is, convertible and reverse convertible bonds. We will show that effective taxation crucially depends on the characteristics of debt and that the existing measures of ETR can be dramatically biased, since they account neither for default risk nor for the ability to convert debt into equity.","[Panteghini, Paolo M.] Univ Brescia, CESifo, I-25122 Brescia, Italy",University of Brescia,"Panteghini, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, CESifo, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy.",panteghi@eco.unibs.it,"Panteghini, Paolo/P-4581-2015","Panteghini, Paolo/0000-0001-6564-0816",,,,,43,3,3,1,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

While extensive research examines the relationship between military expenditure and economic growth, little attention has been paid to the effect of military expenditure on economic inequality. Studying inequality in MENA countries provides an opportunity to assess factors that shape the countries' level of economic well-being, which has greater public policy implications in terms of how society allocates its scarce resources among competing needs. This paper examines two important issues. In the first part of the paper, we examine the relationship between military spending and inequality in MENA countries using a panel regression for country-level observations over the period 1987-2005. The empirical results indicate that military spending has a strong and negative effect on inequality. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, in MENA countries a systematic increase in military spending could reduce the level of inequality. In the second part of this paper, we examine the demand for military expenditure; we find that factors such as inequality level and per capita income negatively affect military expenditure.","Amer Univ Cairo, Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, New Cairo 11835, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); American University Cairo,"Ali, HE (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Cairo, Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, Box 74, New Cairo 11835, Egypt.",hali@aucegypt.edu,,,,,,,25,30,31,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

For a relative poverty measure, it is possible to characterize conditions under which both rich and poor agents face either positive, negative or zero marginal tax rates. There is distortion at the top as long as the rich can influence the welfare of the whole society through a measure of poverty and a distortion might be optimum to reduce aggregate poverty. Those that declare to be rich can be audited randomly, similar to their counterpart poor ones. Lastly, honesty may be punished as well as rewarded.

Is it because industries need to stay close together to interact or, conversely, because they concentrate in certain portions of space to exploit favourable conditions like public incentives, proximity to communication networks, to big population concentrations or to reduce transport costs? This is a fundamental question and the attempt to answer to it using empirical data is a challenging statistical task. In economic geography scientists refer to this dichotomy using the two categories of spatial interaction and spatial reaction to common factors. In economics we can refer to a distinction between exogenous causes and endogenous effects. In spatial econometrics and statistics we use the terms of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity. A series of recent papers introduced explorative methods to analyse the spatial patterns of firms using micro data and characterizing each firm by its spatial coordinates. In such a setting a spatial distribution of firms is seen as a point pattern and an industrial cluster as the phenomenon of extra-concentration of one industry with respect to the concentration of a benchmarking spatial distribution. Often the benchmarking distribution is that of the whole economy on the ground that exogenous factors affect in the same way all branches. Using such an approach a positive (or negative) spatial dependence between firms is detected when the pattern of a specific sector is more aggregated (or more dispersed) than the one of the whole economy. In this paper we suggest a parametric approach to the analysis of spatial heterogeneity. based on the so-called inhomogeneous K-function (Baddeley et al., 2000). We present an empirical application of the method to the spatial distribution of high-tech industries in Milan (Italy) in 2001. We consider the economic space to be non homogenous, we estimate the pattern of inhomogeneity and we use it to separate spatial heterogeneity from spatial dependence. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The implicit hypotheses of the paper are therefore related, first, to the question of sustainability of the global model of development, and second, to the sustainability of the economic model of development of the southeast European countries in which overall weak export orientation is a constant problem. The first sign of economic recession in the southeast European countries was a significant reduction of exports, which was the consequence of a strong decline in foreign demand. The stagnation and reduction of activities in other sectors, especially in trade, construction, and industry, soon followed. A reduction in personal consumption and the need to curtail the growth of government spending indicate that in the following period the only, and major, sources of economic growth are an increase of investments and exports. The results confirm the possibilities of strengthening mutual economic cooperation in the market of the region and on the international markets, especially in the circumstances of the global recession. It is necessary to review the existing economic models based on export orientation, especially export of manufacturing.","[Buturac, Goran; Teodorovic, Ivan] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Buturac, G (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.",gbuturac@eizg.hr,"Buturac, Goran/Y-6211-2019","Buturac, Goran/0000-0002-0903-4587",,,,,14,7,7,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

I use the fiscal plans reported at the time of budgeting, together with other information available to fiscal policy-makers in real time. Indeed, fiscal plans might be significantly different from ex post outcomes because governments do not have complete control over their implementation, which is influenced by several exogenous factors. When fiscal-policy rules are estimated using real-time data, I show in this paper that OECD countries have often planned a counter-cyclical fiscal stance, especially during economic expansions. This contrasts with conventional findings based on actual data, which tend to point towards a-cyclicality or pro-cyclicality. Forecast errors for the government structural balance and the output gap play a central role in explaining the differences between estimates based on ex ante and ex post data.","European Cent Bank, DE-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Cimadomo, J (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, DE-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",jacopo.cimadomo@ecb.int,,,,,,,32,46,47,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

We find that high-quality firms value more the technology than low-quality firms. A direct implication of this result is that the market value of the new technology can be maximized while serving only the highest quality firms.

South Africa's current legislation on plastic-bags came into effect on 7 May 2003. It increased the thickness of the plastic used, charged a small levy and required that bags be sold rather than distributed gratis. These regulations sharply reduced consumption of plastic bags in the short term, but unlike the Irish and Danish levies have failed to curb their use meaningfully in the long run. It is suggested that the initial sharp fall in use of bags was a result of loss aversion rooted in an endowment effect (the bags having long been a free good).

Gay and bisexual men are found to receive significantly lower monthly wages than heterosexual male workers after accounting for demographic and occupational characteristics. The estimations reveal that educated gay and bisexual workers face lower wage differentials than less-educated gay and bisexual workers, which is consistent with the statistical theory of discrimination. However, wage gaps are significant at all educational attainment levels, suggesting that these workers face strong prejudices in the Athenian labour market. The same pattern holds also across all occupations and sectors. Furthermore, to better understand the determinants of the wage gaps, we compare gay/bisexual men with both married and unmarried heterosexual men. By making these comparisons, we are able to disentangle the penalty associated with being unmarried from other human-capital explanations for the wage gap.","Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Rion 26504, Greece",University of Patras,"Drydakis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Rion 26504, Greece.",ndrydakis@econ.soc.uoc.gr,"Drydakis, Nick/AAI-1102-2021","Drydakis, Nick/0000-0001-9827-6678",,,,,41,23,25,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We introduce a framework to capture the fiscal policy stance in a way that brings together automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal policy. We show that, for most countries, automatic changes in the budget balance play a stronger role in stabilizing output than discretionary fiscal policy. When compared across countries, changes in fiscal policy stance are predominantly linked to differences in government size. Tax revenues are close to being proportional to GDP and, combined with a relatively stable government spending, this leads to a countercyclical budget balance, which in turn helps stabilize aggregate demand. Furthermore, countries with less responsive automatic stabilizers, like the United States, tend to use countercyclical discretionary fiscal policy more aggressively.

It accounts for the observed cross-country dispersion in prices of goods, based on retail price survey data, by focusing on two sources of goods market segmentation - (i) international trade costs, and (ii) non-traded input costs of distribution. I find that a multi-sector Ricardian trade model, ala Eaton-Kortum, augmented with a distribution sector, can account for the average price dispersion for a basket of goods fully and generates 70% of the variation in price dispersion across goods within the basket. While tradability of goods is important in explaining the average price dispersion for the basket of goods, distribution costs are important in explaining why, within the basket, some goods show more price dispersion than others.

In particular, we see how well those theoretical results match the process when it is simulated on empirically observed high school friendship networks. This tests whether a parsimonious random network model mimics real-world networks with regard to predicting properties of a class of behavioral processes. It also tests whether our theoretical predictions for asymptotically large societies are accurate when applied to populations ranging from thirty to three thousand individuals. We find that the theoretical results account for more than half of the variation in convergence times on the real networks. We conclude that a simple multi-type random network model with types defined by simple observable attributes (age, sex, race) captures aspects of real networks that are relevant for a class of iterated updating processes.","[Golub, Benjamin] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Golub, Benjamin] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jackson, Matthew O.] Stanford Univ, Santa Fe Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jackson, Matthew O.] CIFAR, Toronto, ON, Canada",Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Stanford University; The Santa Fe Institute; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"Golub, B (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Golub, Benjamin/AAA-1451-2020","Jackson, Matthew O./0000-0001-9846-4249","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0961481] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,27,19,19,0,21,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

We propose an evolutionary algorithm that augments the original graph while aiming for minimal total cost. Individual solutions are represented as directed multigraphs.

Forty percent of households who said that they received a payment reported having spent it. This is a higher spending rate than has been recorded in surveys assessing the 2001 and 2008 tax rebates in the United States. One possible explanation for this is that individuals are more likely to spend bonuses (as the Australian payments were described) than rebates (as the US payments were described). Using an approach for converting spending rates into an aggregate marginal propensity to consume (MPC), the Australian results are consistent with an aggregate MPC of 0.41-0.42. Since this estimate is based largely on first-quarter spending, it may understate the longer-run impact of the package on consumer expenditure.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Leigh, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",andrew_leigh@ksg02.harvard.edu,"Leigh, Andrew/AAV-1366-2020","Leigh, Andrew/0000-0002-5639-0509",,,,,22,19,20,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

I establish a two-sector OLG model in which capital goods can be produced by two technologies. One is a safe technology with a publicly known constant return. The other is a risky technology exhibiting technological externalities with an uncertain return about which economic agents have heterogeneous private information. I find that coordination failure arises, and is most severe when the returns of the safe and risky technologies are close. I also find that more precise private information does not necessarily improve social welfare, while more precise public information can unambiguously improve social welfare. Moreover, risk attitudes of economic agents can affect the economy, inducing a positive relationship between economic growth and volatility. Last, I find that a subsidy on the risky technology investment can greatly alleviate coordination failure and improve social welfare.","Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Li, M (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",mli03@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

However, economists have found little evidence that such an effect is present. Motivated by models of momentum from psychology, this study examines hole-by-hole performances of four types of professional golfers, which is perhaps the ideal environment to evaluate whether such an effect exists. The results show that evidence consistent with the existence of hot hand and cold hand can be masked by looking only at overall mean impacts because the existence and magnitude of the effects can vary with the player's experience.

Taking a factor demand approach, we measure the elasticity of firm R&D capital accumulation to its user cost. Econometric models are estimated using a rich unbalanced panel of firm data covering the period 1996 to 2004 with firm specific R&D user costs varying with tax incentives. Using the estimated user cost elasticity, we perform a cost-benefit analysis of the R&D incentive programme. We find some evidence of additionality suggesting that the level based programme of R&D incentives in the Netherlands is effective in stimulating firms' investment in R&D. However, the hypothesis of crowding out can be rejected only for small firms. The analysis also indicates that the level based nature of the fiscal incentive scheme leads to a substantial social deadweight loss.","[Lokshin, Boris] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Org & Strategy, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Lokshin, Boris] UNU MERIT, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Mohnen, Pierre] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Quantitat Econ, UNU MERIT, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Mohnen, Pierre] CIRANO, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Lokshin, B (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Org & Strategy, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",b.lokshin@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Mohnen, Pierre/ACL-4047-2022","Mohnen, Pierre/0000-0002-2289-7379; Lokshin, Boris/0000-0002-6524-6621",,,,,24,79,84,5,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main questions asked are: why and how can a strong external financial orientation lead to amplified external shocks in a small open economy; and whether the shocks could have been better absorbed or dampened with some foresight? Our answer is in the affirmative as we indicate that the dangers of extended foreign currency exposure were known from the literature and from other small countries' experience. However, we argue that for Hungary a fully effective defence, let alone full absorption of the shocks, was not possible by any measure; nor was it offered by any known policy measures of standard theories. The article outlines the general world economic conditions during the crisis period and follows with Hungary-specific features and vulnerabilities in order to identify crucial points of crisis management and economic policy formation. Data series cover 2004-10, with expectations for 2011. This six-year period represents Hungary's economic development path after EU accession. We demonstrate that the capacity of a non-eurozone small open economy for external shock absorbing, and for applying standard crisis-dampening instruments, fiscal or monetary, was very limited. Successful external shock absorption, with large foreign debt exposure, is more challenging than the profession or the general public might think.","Budapest Corvinus Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Magas, I (通讯作者)，Budapest Corvinus Univ, Budapest, Hungary.",,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24.0,1,,,,,1,14,,10.1080/14631377.2012.647626,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,918PH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302262100001,0

Our results indicate that trust is significantly improved by the introduction of a reputation feedback system. However, such mechanisms are far from being perfect and are vulnerable to strategic ratings and reciprocation. Our findings indicate that some changes in rating rules may significantly improve the efficiency of feedback systems, by avoiding strategic rating or reciprocation, and hence stimulate trust and trustworthiness among traders. In particular, a system in which individuals are not informed of their partner's rating decision before making their own decision provides better results, both in terms of trust and earnings.","[Masclet, David; Penard, Thierry] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, F-35014 Rennes, France; [Masclet, David] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes; Universite de Montreal,"Masclet, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, F-35014 Rennes, France.",David.Masclet@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,56,25,29,2,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A natural assumption of the proportionate economic development is a protection of the economic competition. Conditions of the economic competition in the world developed countries and the European Union countries as well are maintained and controlled institutionally, and this systemic element of economic development is of a great importance. In Slovakia the realization of tasks related to the protection of the economic competition is carried out by the Antimonopoly Office.

Each signal has an underlying accuracy (how precisely it identifies the state) and a clarity (how easy it is to understand). The unique linear equilibrium has interesting properties: the signals which receive attention are the clearest available, even if they have poor underlying accuracy; the number of signals observed falls as the complementarity of players' actions rises; and, if actions are more complementary, the information endogenously acquired in equilibrium is more public in nature.

A total of 20 empirical papers published in 1994-2010 are reviewed and the original members of ASEAN are found to be commonly indicated as relatively feasible candidates for a monetary union. In addition, common threads are observed. First, in the selection of country samples for analysis, recent developments could have played a more important role than the traditional theory. Second, unlike the early intellectual work which had been molded by the debate on external and internal adjustment mechanisms, current empirical literature appears to be driven largely by the enthusiasm to identify homogenous economies. Third, there is a reason to believe that very few have reflected on the endogeneity argument of OCA-related convergence in the Asian context.

The main finding is that while monetary policy reacts significantly to stock price drops, no significant reaction to stock price increases is found. This result is obtained by applying the method of identification through heteroskedasticity to a daily dataset covering the period 1998-2008. The result is confirmed in an estimated, augmented Taylor rule based on monthly data for the same period. The size of the estimated, asymmetric reaction is modest. The study constitutes an empirical contribution to the debate about the role of asset prices in monetary policy, which has seen a revival in the aftermath of the crisis. In particular, the results lend empirical support to recent claims that the pre-crisis approach to monetary policy implied an asymmetric policy stance towards stock price movements.","[Ravn, Soren Hove] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Ravn, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",shr@nationalbanken.dk,,"Ravn, Soren Hove/0000-0002-6495-5100",,,,,48,9,10,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Clubs spend different amounts of money on their players and use different incentive devices to achieve their aims for each season. Our first aim is to find out whether clubs are spending more money than they need to. Evidence shows that this is the case for several clubs, suggesting that buying players solely with a view to selling them on for future financial gain can seriously damage clubs' accounts and efficiency. This is all the more remarkable as the competitive level is increasing and Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is issuing more stringent financial stability conditions. Our second aim is to ascertain the relationship between the players' wage distribution and the clubs' efficiency. We demonstrate that a higher wage spread tends to be associated with an increase in efficiency. The implication is that clubs should structure wages so as to have the optimal pay ranking for inducing players' effort.","[Lima, Francisco] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Dept Engn & Management, Lisbon, Portugal; Univ Tecn Lisboa, CEG IST, Inst Super Tecn, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Lima, F (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Lisboa, Dept Engn & Management, Lisbon, Portugal.",francisco.lima@ist.utl.pt,"Ribeiro, Antonio Sergio/AAF-3809-2021; Lima, Francisco/B-7822-2009","Ribeiro, Antonio Sergio/0000-0002-8894-2742; Lima, Francisco/0000-0001-6854-5910",,,,,15,27,34,6,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

It is shown in this article that the widely analysed time series of hours worked per capita in the US business sector evolves around a broken linear trend. When this fact is taken into account, the unit root null is rejected by recently proposed tests. Therefore, it can be stated that empirical specifications with hours in first differences are not recommended. It seems more appropriate to control for the presence of this shift in the deterministic component. We also draw this conclusion from a bivariate model for both productivity growth and hours worked. Our results suggest that technology improvements have a negative but nonsignificant effect on hours only in the very short run. This impact later becomes positive and statistically significant after five periods.","Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",,"Sanso-Navarro, M (通讯作者)，Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Anal Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",marcossn@unizar.es,"Sanso-Navarro, Marcos/H-1029-2015","Sanso-Navarro, Marcos/0000-0002-5926-2166",,,,,34,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Among many industries related to tourism, four sectors (accommodation, transport, retail trade and recreational services) across six states and two territories from 1997 to 2007 are studied as they contribute nearly 70% of tourism output in Australia. By comparing regression results from the Cobb-Douglas (C-D) production function and the translog production function, we find that there is evidence of increasing returns in transport, retail trade and recreational services at the industry level. However, accommodation is characterized by constant returns to scale at the industry level. As accommodation is responsible for the biggest share of tourism output, this suggests that overall the tourism sector is not characterized by increasing returns. We also find that the degrees of returns to scale from the C-D and translog production functions are different and that the imposition of input share also influences the empirical results. Both of these factors stress the importance of model specification to the measurement of economies of scale.","[Shi, Hui] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Smyth, Russell] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University; Monash University,"Shi, H (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",hui.shi@buseco.monash.edu.au,"Smyth, Russell/AAE-1492-2019; Shi, Hui/C-7361-2011","Smyth, Russell/0000-0001-6593-5462;",,,,,46,3,6,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We replace the standard rational expectations assumption in the Smets and Wouters (2007) model by a constant-gain learning mechanism. If agents know the correct structure of the model and only learn about the parameters, both expectation mechanisms produce very similar results, and only the transition dynamics that are generated by specific initial beliefs seem to improve the fit. If, instead, agents use only a reduced information set in forming the perceived law of motion, the implied model dynamics change and, depending on the specification of the initial beliefs, the marginal likelihood of the model can improve significantly. These best-fitting models add additional persistence to the dynamics and this reduces the gap between the IRFs of the DSGE model and the more data-driven DSGE-VAR model. However, the learning dynamics do not systematically alter the estimated structural parameters related to the nominal and real frictions in the DSGE model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the significant reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 45% in 1992 to 16% since 2005 has not been accompanied by a comprehensive broadening of the corporate income tax base as it has been in many longstanding member states of the EU and the OECD.

A substantial number of firms does not invest in fixed capital or invests little relative to sales revenue. Using a multilevel probit model we study what factors trigger investment, and using a multilevel Heckman selection model we study what factors influence a firm's investment-to-sales ratio. We find that firms' investment behaviour has relatively little dependency on a country's macroeconomic setting. Additionally, we find that, on average, firms that are completely foreign-owned have a relatively lower investment-to-sales ratio. Finally, we find evidence which suggests that the probability of investing is higher for firms located in countries with more control of corruption and we find some evidence which suggests that partially foreign-owned firms located in countries with relatively less corruption have a relatively higher investment-to-sales ratio.","Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT Maastricht Grad Sch Governance, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Farla, K (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT Maastricht Grad Sch Governance, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands.",farla@merit.unu.edu,,,,,,,31,9,13,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It also indirectly attempts to account for the effect of a recent recession on gambling behaviour by examining gambling behaviour when the economy was growing versus the period immediately after a major recession. The aim of the article is to analyse the factors influencing gambling decisions. This is done using the double-hurdle method adjusted for the problems of heteroscedasticity and nonnormality using an approach that can handle extreme values and address skewness. The empirical results ruled out Tobit-type models and normally distributed double-hurdle models. The pattern on income elasticities across income classes implies that implicit Swedish gaming taxes are regressive. Income elasticities become smaller after the recession and the decision to participate changed with respect to the several of the demographic variables.","[Rude, James] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Surry, Yves] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Kron, Robert] IVBAR AB, S-11221 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Alberta; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Surry, Y (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",Yves.Surry@slu.se,,,,,,,42,13,14,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We unbundle liberalization and privatization reforms and study their simultaneous determination in a two-equation model. Unlike previous studies, we account for cross-effects between the two pro-market measures. Our findings unveil that both right-wing and left-wing governments implement liberalizations and privatizations, showing a common trend under the so-called neo-liberalism wave. However, although the privatization rate is higher than liberalization in right-wing environments, the opposite occurs under left-wing governments. We argue that ideological cleavages still affect pro-market reforms, particularly the combination of privatization and liberalization policies. We conclude that different deregulation patterns should be expected under governments characterized by different political ideologies. Our results shed new light on the literature investigating the political-economic rationale underpinning pro-market choices. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (4) (2014) 1033-1051.

We consider first a public relief fund to cover these 'collective risks'. We analyse the underinvestment problem stemming from the moral hazard of Local administrations, when investments are defined at the local level and are not observable by the Central government that manages the relief fund. We then examine the potential role of private insurers in solving the underinvestment problem. Our analysis shows that the public fund is almost always a better institutional arrangement with respect to the private insurance solution, but competitive private insurers can improve social welfare in the presence of Central government's soft budget constraints problems, especially when the number of Local administrations is large.","[Buzzacchi, Luigi] Polytech Univ Torino, DIST, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Turati, Gilberto] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat ESOMAS, I-10134 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; University of Turin,"Buzzacchi, L (通讯作者)，Polytech Univ Torino, DIST, Viale Pier Andrea Mattioli 39, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",luigi.buzzacchi@polito.it; gilberto.turati@unito.it,,"Buzzacchi, Luigi/0000-0001-7670-6665",,,,,34,0,0,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

Agriculture's decline was matched by an increase in services and non-manufacturing industry, with manufacturing remaining low and stagnant throughout the post-colonial period. To what extent do these patterns of structural change account for the weak growth dynamics observed in the continent? We provide evidence that what is damaging for growth in Africa is not the expansion in services, but rather the reallocation of economic activity from agriculture to non-manufacturing industry.

Wages and the labor share of income fall, unemployment increases, the power of labor declines, and income inequality and poverty increase. Capital, on the other hand, recovers quickly and gains more ground. Second, government policies favor capital, especially financial capital, at the expense of the larger public. Crises also present opportunities for further deregulation and liberalization in financial markets and the rest of the economy. Third, following financial crises, foreign capital inflows may increase as international capital seeks to take advantage of the crisis and acquire assets at fire-sale prices. The 2008 U.S. financial crisis provides an opportunity to extend this analysis to a leading high-income country. By examining the experience of the United States after the financial crisis in terms of the questions and issues typically raised in examinations of low- and middle-income countries, this paper makes an original contribution, while, at the same time, contributing to the gradually emerging literature on the consequences of the U.S. financial crisis. We first look at the distributional effects of the financial crisis and compare this with the impacts of the crisis on capital. Then, we investigate the changes in income shares of labor and capital before shifting our attention to changes in inequality and poverty. Next, we focus on the role of government policies through an analysis of government taxation and spending policies. Finally, we examine the changes in capital inflows before concluding with a discussion of our overall findings and further research areas.","[Dufour, Mathieu] CUNY John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, New York, NY 10019 USA; [Orhangazi, Ozgur] Kadir Has Univ, TR-34083 Istanbul, Turkey",City University of New York (CUNY) System; John Jay College of Criminal Justice (CUNY); Kadir Has University,"Orhangazi, Ö (通讯作者)，Kadir Has Univ, TR-34083 Istanbul, Turkey.",ozgur.orhangazi@khas.edu.tr,"Orhangazi, Özgür/D-7311-2019","orhangazi, ozgur/0000-0002-3122-8206",,,,,26,7,7,2,54,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

While some authors have found success with various indicators, Rose and Spiegel (2009a,b) find that almost no indicators are robust. We employ Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to verify Rose-Spiegel's conclusions under model uncertainty, confirming their findings. We then employ latent class models (LCM) to check the data for parameter heterogeneity. We find that there is substantial evidence of heterogeneity in the relationship between various indicators and crisis impact, both across individual indicators as well as across financial crisis episodes. In particular, when using de-trended growth rates, a similar model fits the 1997 Asian financial crisis, although the coefficients change qualitatively in some cases. These results highlight the difficulty in employing simple linear models for early warning purposes, but demonstrate that there are robust indicators of cross-country variation in crisis impact across episodes, such as the pre-crisis growth in banking credit. A 2-class model explains the variation in crisis impact, where pre-crisis level of per-capita income assists in the prediction of membership in a particular class. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Individuals finance their investments in higher education through income-contingent education loans as well as subsidies from the government. The subsidy is tax-financed. We compare an egalitarian subsidy scheme, which reduces by a uniform amount the tuition charged to students, with a student loan subsidy which is proportional to the student's debt service obligation. We show that both types of subsidies reduce the economy-wide underinvestment in higher education and lead to a more equal income distribution. Furthermore, according to some social welfare criterion, the student loan subsidy regime dominates the tuition subsidy regime if the subsidy level is predetermined, while the converse is true if the subsidy level constitutes a choice variable of the government.","[Eckwert, Bernhard] Univ Bielefeld, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Zilcha, Itzhak] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Zilcha, Itzhak] Coll Management Acad Studies, Tel Aviv, Israel",University of Bielefeld; Tel Aviv University; College of Management Academic Studies,"Eckwert, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",beckwert@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de; izil@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,25,1,2,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Nearly 80 000 elected local VF committees administer loans that reach 30 percent of all households. The value of VF loans has remained steady since 2006, even without new infusions of government funds, and loans go disproportionately to the poor. Based mainly on a custom-built survey of over 3000 local VFs conducted in 2010, we evaluate the performance of the VF. As expected, profit rates are hard to model, but our regression analysis shows that loan recovery rates, total lending and the proportion of loans going to the poor are all higher when a VF borrows additional funds from a formal bank and on-lends to households, as done by one in five VFs. An economic analysis suggests, tentatively, that VF benefits exceed the costs. A financial analysis shows that VFs more than break even, with receipts covering their cash costs. Most VFs are social rather than financial intermediaries; they have little incentive to take risks or to innovate, which explains why VF lending has not kept pace with the growth of the Thai economy.","[Haughton, Jonathan] Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Khandker, Shahidur R.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Rukumnuaykit, Pungpond] Chulalongkorn Univ, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Suffolk University; The World Bank; Chulalongkorn University,"Haughton, J (通讯作者)，Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Ashburton Pl, Boston, MA 02108 USA.",jhaughton@suffolk.edu,,,,,,,18,4,5,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Recent studies have highlighted the potential importance of initial occupational choice on subsequent outcomes pertaining to morbidity. This study is the first to assess the existence and strength of a causal relationship between initial occupational choice at labor entry and subsequent health behaviors and habits. We utilize the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to analyze the effect of first occupation, as identified by industry category and blue collar work, on subsequent health outcomes relating to obesity, alcohol misuse, smoking, and physical activity in 2005. Our findings suggest blue collar work early in life is associated with increased probabilities of obesity, at-risk alcohol consumption, and smoking, and increased physical activity later in life, although effects may be masked by unobserved heterogeneity. The weight of the evidence bearing from various methodologies, which account for non-random unobserved selection, indicates that at least part of this effect is consistent with a causal interpretation. These estimates also underscore the potential durable impact of early labor market experiences on later health.","[Kelly, Inas Rashad] CUNY Queens Coll, NBER, Dept Econ, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Dave, Dhaval M.] Bentley Univ, Dept Econ, NBER, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Sindelar, Jody L.] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, NBER, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gallo, William T.] CUNY Hunter Coll, Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10010 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); Bentley University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY),"Kelly, IR (通讯作者)，CUNY Queens Coll, NBER, Dept Econ, 65-30 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, NY 11367 USA.",Inas.Kelly@qc.cuny.edu; ddave@bentley.edu; jody.sindelar@yale.edu; william.gallo@hunter.cuny.edu,,,NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG027045] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,79,34,36,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

To do this, firstly we estimate a common cyclical factor by means of an unobserved component model with the common factor located in variations in the underlying growth rates, that is, accelerations and decelerations of the variables. The variables mentioned share a significant cyclical factor being all procyclical except for narrow money. Finally we offer an explanation of this empirical finding based on the monetary policy strategy of interest rate pegging followed by the European Central Bank. In this regard, the shared cyclical information suggests (a) that inflation should be considered as a phenomenon that affects the whole economy, and therefore all prices, and (b) that monetary indicators such as monetary aggregates may contribute to the assessment of inflationary risks throughout the cycle.

We show that under the time-consistent Markov policy the economy lacks any transitional dynamics and there is local and global determinacy of equilibrium. For empirically plausible parameter values we find that the Markov-perfect policy implies a higher tax rate and a larger proportion of government spending allocated to consumption than those chosen under a commitment constraint. As a result, economic growth is slightly lower under the Markov-perfect policy than under the Ramsey policy, with growth under lump-sum taxes being highest. The implication of our results is that if the private sector is aware of the government's inability to pledge future policy decisions, then the government should impose a slightly higher tax rate and devote a higher share of public resources to consumption, with a relatively low cost in terms of growth.

All of the net jobs displaced were due to growing trade deficits with Mexico. The number of US jobs displaced by trade deficits with Canada declined slightly between 1993 and 2013. Prominent economists and US government officials predicted that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would lead to growing trade surpluses with Mexico and that hundreds of thousands of jobs would be gained. The evidence shows that the predicted surpluses in the wake of NAFTA's enactment in 1994 did not materialize. Growing trade deficits and job displacement, especially between the United States and Mexico, were the result of a surge in outsourcing of production by US and other foreign investors. The rise in outsourcing was fueled, in turn, by a surge in foreign direct investment into Mexico, which increased by more than 150 percent in the post-NAFTA period.","Econ Policy Inst, Washington, DC 20005 USA",,"Scott, RE (通讯作者)，Econ Policy Inst, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",,,,,,,,23,1,2,2,57,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In a short-run dynamic model, we correct for deviations from the long-run path using three feedback coefficients capturing different disequilibria. This enables us to test for both amount and adjustment asymmetries by considering the size and direction of any deviations. We use this model to examine the relationship between the official cash rate (set by the Reserve Bank of Australia as a monetary policy tool) and the standard variable mortgage rates of Australian Big-4 banks using weekly data from 2001 to 2012. The evidence indicates both types of asymmetries along with synchronized rate-setting behavior. Overall, the banks immediately pass on 120% of any rate rise, but only 85% of any rate cut. Further, when mortgage rates are substantially above the equilibrium path, we find no significant attempt to lower rates, but faster adjustment when rates are below equilibrium values. This finding has importarit implications for the RBA's monetary policy transmission mechanism and the effectiveness of the expansionary versus contractionary policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Bordo, MD",,,,"Bordo, Michael D.",,,Tales from the Bretton Woods,OPEN ECONOMIES REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bretton Woods; TARGET balances; Payments system; Liquidity demands,,"An analogy has been made between the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 and the recent Eurozone crisis. The build up of TARGET balances in the Eurosystem of Central Banks after 2007 with the GIPS (deficit countries having large liabilities) and Germany (a surplus country) with large claims is seen as similar to the rising and persistent balance of payments deficits and declining gold reserves by the United States as center country of the BWS gold dollar standard in the 1960s. This paper argues that a better Bretton Woods analogy is between the UK which ran persistent balance of payments deficits reflecting low productivity growth and overly expansionary financial policies (an analogy to the GIPS) countries with West Germany which ran persistent balance of payments surpluses reflecting high productivity and conservative financial policies (analogous to Germany today). However Bretton Woods is very different from the Eurozone in many dimensions. An even better analogy than BWS is a comparison of the clearing mechanism in the U.S..--The Gold Settlement account-with the Target payments mechanism for the Eurozone. In the early 1930s massive gold flows from the interior, hard hit by banking panics, to New York City were similar to the payments imbalances within the Eurozone in the recent crisis. The Federal Reserve did little to accommodate the demands for liquidity leading to a collapse of the payments system in March 1933. By contrast the build up of TARGET reflected full accommodation of the liquidity demands of the member states. TARGET represented an institutional innovation that prevented a repeat of the 1930s payments crisis.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08542 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Bordo, MD (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08542 USA.",bordo@fas-econ.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,9,2,3,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

But the latter effect can be harmful: shrinking the field increases not only the likelihood that future voters vote for one's favorite candidate, but also that they vote for an opponent. Specifically, if one's favorite candidate is significantly better than all others, then early voting is disadvantageous and all equilibria are equivalent to simultaneous voting. Conversely, when some other candidate is almost as good, then any Markov, symmetric, anonymous equilibrium involves sequential voting (and differs from simultaneous voting).","[Dekel, Eddie] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Dekel, Eddie] Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Berglas Sch Econ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Piccione, Michele] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",Northwestern University; Tel Aviv University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dekel, E (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",dekel@northwestern.edu; m.piccione@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,13,7,7,0,5,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

Without additional assumptions (such as zero correlation) the decomposition of shocks into a persistent and transitory component is indeterminate. The assumption that is conventional in the earnings literature is that there is no correlation. The Beveridge-Nelson decomposition that is widely used in time series analysis assumes a perfect correlation. Without restrictions on the correlation, the persistent-transitory decomposition is only set-identified. For reasonable autoregressive moving average (ARMA) parameters the bounds for widely used objects of interest are very wide.

We contribute to this debate by exploring how prepayment affects financial decisions. In one set of experiments, we show that when faced with a tradeoff between post- and prepayment, participants overvalue prepaid money, and sometimes even prefer it over objectively higher gains. Importantly, this effect was more pronounced when prepayment was more distant from its pure representation in dollars and cents (Experiment 1A), as well as when potential losses were directly linked to specific options (Experiment I B). As far as the processes involved, our results suggest that prepayment leads to increased personal commitment to prepaid options (Experiment 1C). In a second set of experiments, we show that even when the tradeoff element is eliminated, participants are more motivated and engaged in a task that is prepaid rather than post-paid (Experiments 2A and 2B). Based on our findings, we discuss how firms can use prepayment mechanisms to get more out of their agents, and how individuals can be motivated to better utilize their money. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using data on realized individual incomes and individual expectations of future incomes from the Survey of Italian Households' Income and Wealth, I find that permanent and transitory shocks are negatively correlated. Relaxing the assumption of no correlation between the shocks, I explore the effects of correlated income shocks on the estimated consumption insurance against permanent and transitory shocks, and consumption smoothness using a life-cycle model with self-insurance calibrated to U.S. data. Negatively correlated income shocks result in smoother consumption, and upward-biased estimates of the insurance against transitory (and permanent when borrowing constraints are not tight) income shocks. While the life-cycle model with negatively correlated shocks fits well the sensitivity of consumption to current income shocks observed in U.S. data, it falls short of explaining the sensitivity of consumption to income shocks cumulated over a longer horizon.

Trade diversion is the shift in trade from named countries in an AD investigation to non-named countries. Previous studies have concluded that AD action causes a considerable drop in exports from named countries, however the extent to which trade is diverted to non-named countries is still an open debate. This paper examines to see whether AD action on named countries can have signaling effects on non-named countries. To examine the trade effects on non-named countries, a time series data at an 8-digit product level is constructed for all cases initiated between 1997 and 2003 in the European Union. The paper provides evidence that antidumping policy has signaling effects on non-named imports. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Consumer adoption of these platforms can often hinge on the presence and magnitude of indirect network effects the positive feedback loop where a larger base of adopters of a primary product (hardware) creates a larger market for complementary goods (software), which in turn increases the value of the primary good. Prior work attempting to measure indirect network effects often uses aggregate counts of software variety to do so. In this paper, we illustrate the importance of accounting for variation in software quality a feature present in many markets when conducting this measurement, and provide the conditions under which not doing so results in over- or underestimation of the actual indirect network effect. We apply our framework to the 7th-generation video game console market with quality-differentiated titles and show that in this market the use of aggregate software measures underestimates the indirect network effects by approximately 30%.

We show that this problem can be solved by local competition (such as bribery, lobbying, rent seeking, competition at the patent office) among players who apply the same search strategies or develop the same design. Such competition can restore full efficiency in the non-cooperative equilibrium. Local competition interacts with the choice of whether to cluster or diversify, and rather than adding a further inefficiency to the existing ones, it eliminates inefficiency. The results are robust and hold under simultaneous search strategy choices as well as for sequential choices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Integrating large amounts of electricity generated by variable renewable resources, such as from wind and sunlight, into electricity systems may require energy storage technologies to synchronize electricity production with electricity demand. Electricity markets compensate the performance of these energy storage technologies for the services they provide, and these markets are often operated by regional independent system operators (ISOs) that specify the market rules for this compensation. To examine how different ISO rules can affect the operation and profitability an energy storage technology, we develop a dynamic programming model of pumped hydroelectric storage (PHES) facility operation under the market rules from the Midcontinent ISO and ISO-New England. We present how differences in rules between these ISOs produced different operational strategies and profits, and how important they are for PHES profitability.

PSTR models can capture the heterogeneity of any individual country, provide more detailed information for policy makers of an individual government, and resolve the insufficient observations problem that frequently appears in annual country-level data. Our empirical results indicate that the relationship between HCE and its determinants, including income, time (trend), and age structure variables, is nonlinear and varies with time and across countries. The time (trend) variable-a proxy for technical progress in health care-has a non-linear impact on HCE. Ignoring the variables-technological change of health care and age structure of population-will result in over-estimates of the income elasticities of HCE. Moreover, HCE behaves as a necessity good, and the income elasticity increases when the five-period lagged ratio of public expenditures on health increases. Clearly, the ratio of government financing on health plays an important role in influencing HCE.","[Wu, Po-Chin; Liu, Shiao-Yen] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, Chungli 320, Taiwan; [Pan, Sheng-Chieh] China Univ Technol, Dept Tourism & Leisure Management, Hukou Township, Hsinchu County, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University,"Wu, PC (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Chungli 320, Taiwan.",pochin@cycu.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,9,9,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2014,41.0,4,,,,,713,729,,10.1007/s10663-013-9233-z,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS6BC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344348900006,0

The quantitative relevance of each wedge and its robustness in generating fluctuations in macroeconomic aggregates is assessed. The efficiency wedge proves to be determinant in enabling models to replicate movements in output and investment, while the labor wedge is important to predict fluctuations in hours worked. Modeling distortions to the savings decision holds little quantitative or qualitative relevance. Also, investment seems to be the hardest aggregate to replicate, as prediction errors concerning output and hours worked are typically one order of magnitude smaller. These conclusions are statistically significant across the countries in the sample and are not limited to output drops. Finally, the geographical distance between countries and their degree of openness to trade are shown to contain information with regard to the wedges, stressing the importance of international mechanisms of transmission between distortions to the equilibrium conditions of the neoclassical growth model.

A key feature of our model is that education acts simultaneously as a signaling device and as a method for workers to enhance their productivity. We show that when firms can only imperfectly screen workers, the result is an economy in which too many workers purchase schooling and too few workers devote sufficient effort to their coursework to qualify for the high skill labor pool. We then examine how greater openness to international markets alters the skill mix of the domestic workforce and show that greater openness usually eases one labor market distortion while making the other distortion worse. Globalization impacts educational behavior and labor market outcomes differently as the extent of firms engaged in international markets varies, and affects wage inequality both within and across educational groups.

I find that historical Scots-Irish presence is associated with higher contemporary homicide, particularly by white offenders, and that a culture of violence was transmitted to subsequent generationsbut only in the South and, more generally, where historical institutional quality was low. The interpretation is that the Scots-Irish culture of honor prevailed and persisted as an adaptive behavior to weak institutions. As institutional quality converged between the South and North over the last 200 years, the influence of the culture of honor has been fading over time. The results are robust to controlling for state fixed effects and for a large number of historical and contemporary factors, as well as to relying on instrumental variables for historical settlements.

We find substantial deviation from the protocol, i.e., cheating. We study the mis-allocation of the vouchers to gain some insight into motivations for dishonesty. In our main result we find that the field staff were significantly more likely to allocate the higher value vouchers (those representing a greater subsidy) to the poorest beneficiaries. While we are not able to definitively establish the motivations for this observed pro-social behavior, we argue that this result is consistent with a model of social preferences and less consistent with a pure self-interest motive.

Applying an event study to 511 additions, between February 2010 and August 2013, of individual stocks to the list of securities qualified for short sale, we find that short sale constraints cause individual stocks to be overpriced and that such overvaluation is exclusively related to distortions associated with pessimistic beliefs. In addition, we observe lower volatility, skewness and extreme value frequency of stock returns after short sale constraints are lifted. This implies the emergence of a more appropriate distribution of returns and improved market efficiency at the individual stock level as the range of securities qualified for short selling expands.

Each team can freely discuss its strategies in the game and decisions must be made via majority rule. Team discussions are recorded and their content analyzed to detect evidence of strategy co-evolution among teams playing together. Our main results show no evidence supporting the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium solution, and provide evidence more consistent with reinforcement learning models than with belief-based models. Exhibiting level-2 rationality (i.e., reasoning about others' beliefs) is positively and significantly correlated with higher than average earnings in the game. In addition, teams that are more successful tend to become more self-centered over time, paying more attention to their own past successes than to the behavior of other teams. Finally, we find evidence of mutual adaptation over time, as teams that are more strategic induce competing teams to be more self-centered instead. Our results contribute to the understanding of coordination dynamics resting on heterogeneity and co-evolution of decision rules. In addition, they provide support at the decision process level to the validity of modeling behavior using reinforcement learning models.","[Devetag, Giovanna] Luiss Guido Carli, Rome, Italy; [Pancotto, Francesca] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; [Brenner, Thomas] Univ Marburg, Marburg, Germany",Luiss Guido Carli University; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Philipps University Marburg,"Devetag, G (通讯作者)，Luiss Guido Carli, Rome, Italy.",mdevetag@luiss.it; francesca.pancotto@unimore.it; thomas.brenner@staff.uni-marburg.de,", Francesca/AFN-2311-2022",", Francesca/0000-0002-4670-0673",,,,,29,2,2,2,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Defined as the undiscounted sum of future principal repayments, face values are misleading when debts are issued with different contractual forms or maturities. In this paper, we construct alternative measures of the stock of external sovereign debt for 100 developing countries from 1979 through 2006 that correct for differences in contractual form and maturity. We show that our alternative measures: (1) paint a very different quantitative, and in some cases also qualitative, picture of the stock of developing country external sovereign debt; (2) often invert rankings of indebtedness across countries, which historically defined eligibility for debt forgiveness; (3) indicate that the empirical performance of the benchmark quantitative model of sovereign debt deteriorates by roughly 50% once model-consistent measures of debt are used; (4) show how the spread of aggregation clauses in debt contracts that award creditors voting power in proportion to the contractual face value may introduce inefficiencies into the process of restructuring sovereign debts; and (5) illustrate how countries have manipulated their debt issuance to meet fiscal targets written in terms of face values.

Initially focusing on Tobin's Q, we document a 'hedging discount' in periods of increasing oil and gas prices, while there is some evidence that hedging leads to an increase in firm value in periods of decreasing prices. In the companion time-series tests our core finding indicates that hedger portfolios underperform compared to non-hedger portfolios i.e. confirming a hedging discount. We extend these time series tests to provide a range of conditional analyses exploring the circumstances in which this discount manifests. Here we find that the hedging discount is specifically related to periods of elevating oil and gas prices, especially if the price is high. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a framework to guide government policy in response to crises in cases when government may intervene to support distressed mortgages. Our results emphasize three aspects of efficient mortgage modifications. First, when households are constrained in their borrowing, government resources should support household liquidity up-front. This implies modifying loans to reduce payments during the crisis rather than reducing payments over the life of the mortgage contract, such as via debt reduction. Second, while governments will not find it efficient to directly write down the debt of borrowers, in many cases it will be in the best interest of lenders to do so, because reducing debt is an effective way to reduce strategic default. Moreover, the lenders who bear the credit default risk have a direct incentive to partially write down debt and avoid a full loan loss due to default. Finally, a well-designed mortgage contract should take these considerations into account, reducing payments during recessions and reducing debt when home prices fall. We propose an automatic stabilizer mortgage contract which does both by converting mortgages into lower-rate adjustable-rate mortgages when interest rates fall during a downturn reducing payments and lowering the present value of borrowers' debt.","[Eberly, Janice] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Krishnamurthy, Arvind] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Northwestern University; Stanford University,"Eberly, J (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Eberly, Janice/KCY-3297-2024","Eberly, Janice/0000-0001-9305-0944",,,,,44,42,53,1,14,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We estimate hurdle negative binomial models for count data on survey data allowing for analyses of the extensive as well as intensive margins of firms' innovation activities. Innovation is measured both by the number of ongoing projects and new commercialized products. The results show that higher R&D employee turnover is associated with a higher probability of being innovative, but decreases the intensity of innovation activities in innovating firms. Innovating firms are more likely to have adopted high performance HRM practices, and the impact of employee turnover varies with the number of HRM practices implemented by the firm.

We develop a statistical decision model in which a firm updates its prior belief about demand in a foreign market based on several factors, including the number of neighbors currently selling there, the level and heterogeneity of their export sales, and the firm's own prior knowledge about the market. A positive signal about demand inferred from neighbors' export performance raises the firm's probability of entry and initial sales in the market but, conditional on survival, lowers its post-entry growth. These learning effects are stronger when there are more neighbors to learn from or when the firm is less familiar with the market. We find supporting evidence for the main predictions of the model from transaction-level data for all Chinese exporters over the 2000-2006 period. Our findings are robust to controlling for firms' supply shocks, countries' demand shocks, and city-country fixed effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the absence of government intervention this system admits, among others, two locally stable equilibria: one with a finite level of debt and nonzero wages and employment rate, and another characterized by infinite debt and vanishing wages and employment. We show how the addition of a government sector, modelled through appropriately selected functions describing spending and taxation, prevents the equilibrium with infinite debt. Specifically, we show that, by countering the fall in private profits with sufficiently high government spending at low employment, the extended system can be made uniformly weakly persistent with respect to the employment rate.

The second section formulates a categorization of social processes, and locates a consumption process within a system of culture-nature life processes. The rest of the article delineates the elements of the consumption process, providing illustrations based on literature from various disciplines. Specifically, the third section discusses consumption activities. The fourth section discusses institutions and systems of provision of goods and services. The fifth section applies the concept of habits of life and thought to the consumption process.

Using cross-country data and two alternative indicators of corruption, we find corruption to be a significant driver of heteroscedasticity in total productivity.

We model young and innovative enterprises which face the possibility of making irreversible investments in R&D with uncertain returns, financed through risky debt. Uncertainty comes from two different sources: the technological success of the project and the return from investment. In an optimal investment setting, where uncertainty creates an incentive to delay investment decisions, we find the optimal threshold of entry (invest) and exit (bankruptcy), investigating both the case of infinite and finite debt maturity We show that the potential loss of the investment option in the event of default, reduces the value of waiting and provides equity holders with an incentive to accelerate the investment. Thus the results of the model here presented seem to imply an active role for financial institutions but traditional loans may not be the most suitable solution to finance risky investment. In line with recent recommendations of the European Investment Bank (EIB, 2013), traditional bank lending might need to be reinforced through further instruments, such as loan guarantees and securitisation.","[Bragoli, Daniela; Marseguerra, Giovanni] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Fac Sci Polit & Sociali, I-20100 Milan, Italy; [Cortelezzi, Flavia] Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Diritto Econ & Culture, I-22100 Como, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Insubria,"Bragoli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Fac Sci Polit & Sociali, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20100 Milan, Italy.",daniela.bragoli@unicatt.it; flavia.cortelezzi@uninsubria.it; giovanni.marseguerra@unicatt.it,"BRAGOLI, Daniela/N-6608-2015","BRAGOLI, Daniela/0000-0002-3448-6083; Cortelezzi, Flavia/0000-0001-7481-1541",,,,,25,2,2,0,23,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

This functional form has been generally considered a reasonable approximation for a more general one and has the advantage of providing closed form solutions for both short-run investment rule and long-run rate of capital accumulation. In this paper, we consider the profit function for the case of a monopolistic firm facing a linear demand function with additive shocks. Under this assumption, analytical solutions, for both short-run investment rule and long-run rate of capital accumulation, are not available. We then 1) propose an analytical approximation of the short-run investment rule and 2) show how such approximation can be used in order to derive the corresponding i) steady-state distribution of the optimal stock of capital and ii) the long-run average rate of capital accumulation. Finally, we compare the long-run rates of capital accumulation calculated under both profit function specifications. We find that, within a plausible range of parameter values, the two rates are significantly different. Hence, we conclude that the choice of a log linear functional form has a non-trivial impact on the magnitude of the long run rate of capital accumulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find the program did not reduce test scores; likely, it increased them, with positive effects most pronounced in lower SES schools.","[Fitzpatrick, Maria D.; Lovenheim, Michael F.] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Fitzpatrick, Maria D.; Lovenheim, Michael F.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Fitzpatrick, MD (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, 103 Martha Van Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",maria.d.fitzpatrick@cornell.edu; mfl55@cornell.edu,"Fitzpatrick, Maria Donovan/A-7099-2012; Lovenheim, Michael F/K-7260-2012","Fitzpatrick, Maria/0000-0001-5341-1629",NIA NIH HHS [T32 AG000186] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,30,22,29,0,10,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

The model contemplates the possibility of different assumptions on returns to scale and is calibrated in a simple manner that closely resembles the usual technical coefficient calibration procedure. Multiplier calculations under this nonlinear version offer appropriate interval estimates that provide information on the effectiveness and variability of demand-driven induced changes in equilibrium magnitudes. In addition, and unlike linear multipliers, the nonlinear model allows us to distinguish between physical and cost effects, the reason being that the traditional dichotomy between the price and quantity equations of linear models no longer holds. We perform an empirical implementation of the nonlinear model using recent interindustry data for Brazil, China and United States. When evaluating the robustness of the derived marginal output multipliers and the induced cost effects under the nonlinear approach, the results indicate that marginal indicators in physical terms can be perfectly used to infer average impacts; this is not the case, however, for the derived cost effects where average measures are seen to be more adequate. At the computational level, the analysis proves the operational applicability of the nonlinear system while at the methodological level shows that scale effects are relevant in determining sectoral multipliers.

We consider both traditional antitrust policy (without a leniency program) and modern antitrust policy (with a leniency program). In EN, neither antitrust policy has a significant effect on cartel deterrence, cartel stability, cartel recidivism, and winning bids. In FP, traditional antitrust policy deters cartel formation, destabilizes cartels, decreases cartel recidivism, and reduces the average winning bid. The leniency program has two perverse effects in FP: cartels become more stable and the average winning cartel bid decreases. At the same time, in both auctions the leniency program triggers many more cartels to be revealed. This suggests that it is misleading to use the number of revealed cartels as a measure of the effectiveness of the leniency program. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The introduction of a new GPT (product innovation) as well as increasing productivity within a GPT-sector (as a consequence of process innovations) affect the economy in several ways. First, a new GPT offers the opportunity to produce goods by means of cheaper processes; secondly, technical change within the GPT sector influences productivity gains in related sectors. Also social consequences such as changing wage share, technical unemployment and transitional wage inequality can be observed. Finally, the emergence of a GPT often coincides with output decline, preceding economic growth. This paper introduces a multi-sector diffusion model to study these effects by combining classical economics and replicator-dynamics.

Positive assortative matching between worker skill and firm technology generates an employer size-wage premium and an exporter wage premium. Fixed export costs cause the selection of advanced technology, high-skill firms into exporting, and trade shifts the firm technology distribution upwards. Consequently, trade increases skill demand and wage inequality in all countries, both on aggregate and within the upper tail of the wage distribution.

This paper introduces, apart from the customary real trade costs (i.e. iceberg and fixed export costs), two revenue generating trade barriers (i.e. an ad valorem tariff and a trade license) into a standard heterogeneous-firms-trade model with Pareto distributed productivities. We derive analytical welfare rankings of all four liberalization channels for an equal effect on two openness measures, for any trade cost level and while all four barriers are simultaneously present, i.e. for any initial equilibrium. We show that when openness is measured at retail prices, not border prices, the welfare rankings are sensitive to the degree of efficiency in revenue redistribution, e. g. the share of tariff revenues wasted on rent-seeking activities. As a result, multilateral tariff reductions can switch from the least to the most preferred mode of liberalization. Among the other three barriers we establish a universal welfare ranking for any strictly positive level of revenue redistribution and for either measure of openness.","[Schroder, Philipp J.

Standard trade models are essentially static and do not explain these elementary facts about exporting, which can bias the estimation of trade patterns. This paper proposes a model that endogenously generates the timing of entry to new export markets. The timing results from a learning mechanism. More productive firms are less sensitive to the learning effect and therefore (1) enter markets more quickly and (2) enter larger markets earlier and smaller markets later.

Also, steep per unit penalties for excess emissions prompt early investments in irreversible abatement technologies.

In this respect, the purpose of the article is to review some previous studies on measuring the efficiency of public (secondary) education sector as well as some conceptual and methodological issues of a non-parametric approach. Most importantly, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique is presented and then applied to a wide range of EU and OECD countries, including Slovenia and Croatia, to evaluate the technical efficiency of secondary education. The empirical results show that technical efficiency in secondary education varies significantly across the great majority of EU and OECD countries. Both Slovenia and Croatia show a relatively high level of technical inefficiency in their secondary education as they respectively only rank in the third and fourth quartiles among selected countries. Therefore, rationalising public secondary education spending is strongly recommended with possible redirecting of some excessive resources to the tertiary education sector.","[Aristovnik, Aleksander] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Dept Publ Sect Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Obadic, Alka] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Macroecon & Dev, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; University of Zagreb,"Aristovnik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Dept Publ Sect Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",aleksander.aristovnik@fu.uni-lj.si,"Aristovnik, Aleksander/B-4642-2010; Obadić, Alka/H-9836-2018","Aristovnik, Aleksander/0000-0003-1345-9649; Obadić, Alka/0000-0002-8915-8853",,,,,29,33,33,2,30,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

One region is larger than the other region in terms of its endowment of creative capital. Each region produces a single final good with inputs 1 and 2 that are traded. There is learning by doing only in the sector producing input 1. Our primary objective is to study the impacts of this sector specific learning by doing and trade on the economies of the two regions under consideration. Our analysis leads to two salient results. First, when a specific condition holds, the smaller region specializes completely in the production of input 1 but there is incomplete specialization in the larger region. In particular, at time t = 0, not all creative capital in the larger region is employed in sector 2 and there is some learning by doing in this larger region as well. Second, in the long run, the smaller region continues to specialize completely in the production of input 1 but the larger region specializes completely in the production of input 2.","[Batabyal, Amitrajeet A.] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Batabyal, AA (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",aabgsh@rit.edu; Hamid.Beladi@utsa.edu,,"Batabyal, Amitrajeet/0000-0001-7813-1519",,,,,21,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This article provides an explanation for this puzzling entry restriction by modeling the inventory-management decisions of a firm. If an automobile dealer has more vehicles in inventory than is optimal, it cannot reduce its inventory by selling directly to consumers without impacting the demand for the automobiles that remain. However, if the dealer sells his/her excess inventory to a competitor, the demand for his/her remaining vehicles increases as the competitor responds by acquiring fewer additional vehicles. We demonstrate that for any market demand function and any cost of the competitor acquiring additional vehicles, a dealer with excess inventory does better by selling a subset of its vehicles to a competitor rather than directly to consumers. We discuss the market for wholesale automobiles in relation to other markets where goods are also auctioned but where entry is not restricted to qualified dealers. Doing so allows us to compare our inventory-management explanation to common explanations provided by industry practitioners. We find that intuitive alternative stories do not consistently explain practices across markets.

Our results show that risk attitudes have a nonlinear effect on the likelihood of being entrepreneurs. Risk neutral people are most likely to be entrepreneurs, while both risk averse and risk seeking people prefer to work for wages. When we further divide entrepreneurs into necessity and opportunity entrepreneurs, we find only a marginal difference in risk attitudes between wage workers and necessity entrepreneurs, while less risk averse individuals tend to be opportunity entrepreneurs.

China has jumped to first place as an export destination for many countries, and it is a major source of imports for all countries in the Latin America/Caribbean region. While not a major source of foreign direct investment overall, China has built a strong investment presence in certain countries, particularly in the natural resource and infrastructure sectors. China's influence in Latin America has presented a great opportunity for many countries, but it has also brought new risks. Three main challenges face the region: how to mitigate the impacts of increased commodity concentration as a result of China's strong demand for natural resources; how to avoid other natural resource curse effects; and how to manage the tapering of this growth.

A subject encounters an object (x, y). She observes the first component, x, and has to predict the second component, y. The space of objects is partitioned into categories. The subject determines what category the new object belongs to on the basis of x, and predicts that its y-value will be equal to the average y-value among the past observations in that category. The optimal categorization minimizes the expected prediction error. The main results are driven by a bias-variance trade-off: The optimal size of a category around x, is increasing in the variance of y conditional on x, decreasing in the variance of the conditional mean, decreasing in the size of the data base, and decreasing in the marginal density over x.

In this paper, we address this issue using a structural VAR analysis. Our findings indicate that the responses of agricultural commodity prices to oil price changes depend greatly on whether they are caused oil supply shocks, aggregate demand shocks or other oil-specific shocks mainly driven by precautionary demand. Oil shocks can explain a minor friction of agricultural commodity price variations before the food crisis in 2006-2008, whereas in post-crisis period their explanatory abilities become much higher. After crisis, the contributions of oil-specific factors to variations in agricultural commodity prices are greater than those of aggregate demand shocks.

The question addressed in the present paper is how much aging contributes to the rising disparity in consumption. Based on the model established by Ohtake and Saito (1998), our study shows that cohort effects contribute close to 60 percent of the rising consumption inequality, while approximately 10 percent is the result of aging. The growth of aggregate consumption inequality caused by the cohort effect has various implications. Strengthening the redistribution system, especially the tax system, may enable the economy to avoid further increases in income inequality.","[Zhang, Juwei; Xiang, Jing] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Zhang, JW (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangjw@cass.org.cn; xiangjing19850726@126.com,,"Xiang, Jing/0000-0002-8223-0461",,,,,26,4,4,4,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2014,22.0,3,,,,,79,100,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12069.x,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AH6ZI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336281000004,0

We first investigate the development of inequality over time before analysing the question of whether governments can effectively reduce inequality. Different identification strategies, using fixed effects and instrumental variables models, provide some evidence that governments are capable of reducing income inequality despite countervailing behavioural responses.

Using member records and survey data from a large Australian superannuation fund, we test the relationship between attitudes towards retirement savings and observable levels of non-default activities (such as making voluntary contributions, choosing or changing investment options and changing insurance cover). Additional retirement savings contributions by permanent staff are more likely if the staff member is very likely to recommend their superannuation fund. Individuals who rate their own personal interest in superannuation affairs as very high are more likely to be active online. This, however, does not extend to choosing a non-default investment or purchasing additional insurance, where we find no differences between the highly interested and the disengaged. These findings, together with several other differences related to demographics and employment conditions, show that non-default activity is not a reliable proxy for member engagement.","[Bateman, Hazel] Univ New S Wales, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Deetlefs, Jeanette] Univ New S Wales, Sch Mkt, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Dobrescu, Loretti I.] Univ New S Wales, CEPAR, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Dobrescu, Loretti I.; Ortmann, Andreas] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Newell, Ben R.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Thorp, Susan] Univ Technol Sydney, Finance Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Bateman, H (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",h.bateman@unsw.edu.au,"Ortmann, Andreas/H-2907-2014","Dobrescu, Loretti Isabella/0000-0003-4533-9561; Thorp, Susan/0000-0003-3462-0876; Newell, Benjamin/0000-0003-1898-205X",,,,,32,26,28,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

For example, many organizations use outsourcing or business process reengineering (BPR) to improve or upgrade their objective and technological coefficients to achieve better performance. Hence, traditional MOP models should be extended from the concept of fixed to changeable parameters, called changeable space, which includes decision space and objective space.

We argue that entrepreneurship is about experimentation; the probabilities of success are low, extremely skewed, and unknowable until an investment is made. At a macro level, experimentation by new firms underlies the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction. However, at a micro level, investment and continuation decisions are not always made in a competitive Darwinian contest. Instead, a few investors make decisions that are impacted by incentive, agency, and coordination problems, often before a new idea even has a chance to compete in a market. We contend that costs and constraints on the ability to experiment alter the type of organizational form surrounding innovation and influence when innovation is more likely to occur. These factors not only govern how much experimentation is undertaken in the economy, but also the trajectory of experimentation, with potentially very deep economic consequences.","[Kerr, William R.; Nanda, Ramana; Rhodes-Kropf, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Harvard Business Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kerr, William R.; Nanda, Ramana; Rhodes-Kropf, Matthew] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kerr, WR (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Harvard Business Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",wkerr@hbs.edu; RNanda@hbs.edu; mrhodeskropf@hbs.edu,,,,,,,86,228,271,1,74,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The effect materialized in the days following the announcement of the Swiss National Bank's intention to buy bonds issued by private sector borrowers, as markets learned that covered bonds were being bought. The specification of the bond spreads used allows us to identify this effect as a discounted portfolio balance effect of the expected purchases, as distinct from policy signaling.

The purpose is to compare the obtained country groupings with the countries that have adopted the euro in practice. This exercise is performed using fuzzy cluster analysis and is carried out for pre- and post-euro periods. Knowing that the recent global and euro zone crisis might impact the post-euro findings, the analysis for the post-euro period is done with and without the crisis period. In the second part of the analysis, a discriminant technique is applied to the clustering findings to ascertain the GDP component whose cycle synchronicity contributes most to the partitioning obtained in the cluster analysis. In a nutshell, findings indicate a significant divergence within EU27 and EA12 in the post-euro period and that business cycle symmetry concerning the GDP component of capital investment as a more significant determinant to country partitions.","Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Quah, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",quahch@um.edu.my,"QUAH, CHEE-HEONG/B-7754-2010",,,,,,36,13,14,0,11,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

This work necessitates, beforehand, a conceptual and terminological framework. Researchers have different ideas about how to study emigration and do not share a view of how this phenomenon fits into Russian history. Furthermore, their interpretations of fundamental concepts, such as emigration (emigracija) and foreign (zarube'e), russkij and rossijskij, diverge. Deploring the conceptual vacuum in emigration studies, several historians insist on the need to review and overhaul preceding approaches to analyzing Russian emigration (russkaja emigracija). Given this vacuum, broader questions arise about how to define this field of study. What terms and categories are to be used to describe the cultural and historic phenomenon of the diaspora a national history and/or a collective memory, in common or in parallel, or the transnational history currently being written?","Maison Etranger Russe Alexandre Soljenitsyne, Sect Hist, Paris, France",,"Sorokina, M (通讯作者)，Maison Etranger Russe Alexandre Soljenitsyne, Sect Hist, Paris, France.",sorokina61@gmail.com,,"Sorokina, Marina/0000-0003-2672-4966",,,,,61,2,2,0,9,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Households show a tendency to hold onto substantial savings to cope with possible negative shocks, and are predisposed to specialize in low-risk low-return agriculture under ex ante credit constraints and the fear of low welfare outcomes if production plans should be unsuccessful. Overall, households' responses to uninsured shocks and risk cause inefficiencies and deficiencies of investment in agricultural asset accumulation. Multiple equilibria in the dynamics of household agricultural assets as well as under-investment as a response to risk make some households less able to earn income above the poverty line and keep them trapped in long-term low-equilibrium asset poverty.

It is essential for emergent social phenomena, such as the formation of families, groups, and societies. However, evolutionary forces counter cooperation. The trait of supporting others is dominated by selfish behavior. In the last few decades scientists, in particular biologists, achieved extraordinary progress regarding the question of how cooperation is possible despite of evolutionary forces. This produced an enormous amount of literature. This paper identifies and reviews the known solutions explaining cooperation under evolutionary forces. Using bibliometric methods in combination with extant review articles and traditional reviewing of original literature, it is possible to isolate 11 mechanisms of cooperation under the conditions of evolution. Developing a categorization of the mechanisms according to shared characteristics establishes a fundamental framework for institutional and mechanism design activities. Implications for future research paths are identified, in particular for the mechanism of indirect reciprocity.","Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Zaggl, MA (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",michael.zaggl@tum.de,"Zaggl, Michael/M-4877-2019; Zaggl, Michael/AHC-8709-2022","Zaggl, Michael/0000-0002-7119-7061;",,,,,120,16,19,1,46,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

We show that the designer of a voting rule can achieve Pareto improvements over random dictatorship by choosing rules in which voters' behavior can depend on their beliefs. The Pareto improvement is achieved for all possible beliefs. The mechanism that we use to demonstrate this result is simple and intuitive, and the Pareto improvement result extends to all equilibria of the mechanism that satisfy a mild refinement.

We propose a firm dynamics model where firms face capital market imperfections and costs of operating in the formal sector. Formal firms have a larger set of production opportunities and the ability to employ skilled workers, but informal firms can avoid the costs of formalization. These firm-level distortions give rise to endogenous formal and informal sectors and, more importantly, affect the demand for skilled workers. The model predicts that countries with a low degree of debt enforcement and high costs of formalization are characterized by relatively lower stocks of skilled workers, larger informal sectors, low allocative efficiency, and measured TFP. Moreover, we find that the interaction between entry costs and financial frictions (as opposed to the sum of their individual effects) is the main driver of these differences. This complementarity effect derives from the introduction of skilled workers, which prevents firms from substituting labor for capital and in turn moves them closer to the financial constraint.

A stochastic mechanism returns lotteries over deterministic assignments, and mechanisms are compared according to first-order stochastic dominance. I show that non-wasteful strategy-proof mechanisms are not dominated by strategy-proof mechanisms, however non-wastefulness is highly restrictive when the mechanism involves randomization. In fact, the Random Priority mechanism (i.e., the Random Serial Dictatorship), and a recently adopted school choice mechanism, Deferred Acceptance with Random Tie-breaking, are wasteful. I find that both these mechanisms are dominated by strategy-proof mechanisms. In general, strategy-proof improvement cannot be due to merely reshuffling objects, and therefore must involve assigning more objects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate the strategic foundations of stability in a decentralized matching market. Towards this end, we embed the standard marriage markets in a search model with random meetings. We study the limit of steady-state equilibria as exogenous frictions vanish. The main result is that convergence of equilibrium matchings to stable matchings is guaranteed if and only if there is a unique stable matching in the underlying marriage market. Whenever there are multiple stable matchings, sequences of equilibrium matchings converging to unstable, inefficient matchings can be constructed. Thus, vanishing frictions do not guarantee the stability and efficiency of decentralized marriage markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Two alternative formulations of technical change measured by the time trend and the general index approaches are estimated with panel data models assuming flexible functional forms. Several extensions of each approach are also considered and their benefits and limitations are discussed. In addition to making estimates of the TFP growth and its decomposition, the paper compares the parametric TFP growth measure with the non-parametric Solow residual serving as a benchmark. Several hypotheses related to technology level, firm sizes, industrial sectors, skill biased technological change and macroeconomic and industrial policies are tested to explain the growth patterns and heterogeneity in technical change, input biases and TFP growth rates. Using second regression analysis, the paper explores the determinants of TFP growth and their policy implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Tying two products of unequal value makes them equally valuable as they become inseparable for purchase. Consequently, firms can charge a higher price for the bundled products than before. If foreclosure is not the main purpose of bundling, firms would prefer strategic alliances to mergers because mergers only intensify competition by internalizing the complementarities of two products. In equilibrium, bundling occurs only through strategic alliances.

The enduring inter-industry wage differentials (IIWD) and employer-size wage differentials (ESWD) present a challenge. Data from the Jamaican private sector reveal that ESWD could be the impetus for IIWD. After accounting for labour quality and other characteristics, employers with 10 to 49 employees and 50 or more employees pay estimated premiums of 14.3% and 22.9%, respectively. After estimating the differences in tenure profiles, the premium associated with the largest employer size was reduced to 15.9%, while the premium associated with establishments of 10 to 49 workers was unchanged. Notwithstanding the partial explanation provided by tenure profile differences, the bulk of the ESWD appears to be explained by other theoretical constructs.","Market Sci Co, Tokyo, Japan",,"Mounsey, A (通讯作者)，Market Sci Co, Tokyo, Japan.",almoonzie@yahoo.com,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,4,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2014,,112,,,,,75,88,,,,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM7VG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340076200004,0

Public provision-in a median voter framework with proportional taxation-generally exceeds private provision. This paper compares private and public provision of public goods in a dynamic setting. In a dynamic setting, voluntary donations can result in efficient provision. Also, majority-rule solutions exist even when taxes are not proportional to income. At low discount factors, public provision tends to exceed private provision. As patience increases, however, private provision may exceed public provision. This occurs because many outcomes with a low level of public good provision-and potentially large targeted transfer payments to particular individuals-become sustainable under public provision. Under private provision, however, large targeted transfers are unsustainable. To finance the public good, private provision tends to result in benefit taxation, and public provision tends to result in progressive taxation.","Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Slavov, SN (通讯作者)，Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, 1150 Seventeenth St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",sita.slavov@aei.org,,,,,,,28,8,10,0,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

These vouchers could be used for participation in a restricted number of training courses, which all aim to stimulate employees to develop a more active attitude towards their own employability. Using data from two surveys of one firm's workforce, we find that voucher use is related to various personality traits and personal characteristics. In particular, a worker's ambition, goal setting and education level are positively related to voucher use. In addition, workers with longer tenure spend their vouchers more often. Conversely, workers with a more positive self-image as well as those who are negatively reciprocal spend their vouchers less often. The negative relation between voucher use and negative reciprocity suggests that workers who are more negatively reciprocal perceive the voucher as an HR tool for outplacement. Further, we find that voucher use positively affects worker employability awareness and willingness to train. Remarkably, participation in non voucher training shows little relation to personality traits. From a human resources (HR) perspective, this finding suggests that by employing a voucher scheme, the firm makes training participation more dependent on employee personality and individual characteristics instead of the HR development strategy of the firm.","[Gerards, Ruud] Maastricht Univ, ROA, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Gerards, Ruud; de Grip, Andries] Maastricht Univ, NSI, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Gerards, Ruud] Maastricht Univ, CofFEE Europe, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [de Grip, Andries] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, ROA, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [de Grip, Andries] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Witlox, Maaike] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Maastricht University,"Gerards, R (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, ROA, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",r.gerards@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"De Grip, Andries/A-6021-2009; Gerards, Ruud/J-6280-2019","Gerards, Ruud/0000-0001-7570-8298",,,,,49,10,10,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, the conditional term spread captures a significant positive return indicating that the degree of decline in the short rate relative to the long rate is of more importance than the term spread alone.","[Volkman, David A.; Laforge, Olivier J.

The social and evolutionary usage of things and thoughts are at the center of Veblen's approach. In his studies, he dealt with psychological, social, anthropological and economic issues. The psychological content of Veblen's writing takes instinctive and habitual issues into consideration. The proposal of this paper is to revisit the psychology of Veblen's conspicuous consumer. In such a task, this paper discusses the role of observation and cognition in habit building, and their influence on the conspicuous consumer. It also introduces a psychological explanation of the importance of the leisure class to the conspicuous consumer. In order to build the analysis, this paper takes into account elements of Albert Bandura's vicarious learning.

The macroeconomic doctrine of the new consensus macroeconomics completely ignores bank credit. However, the Great Recession has highlighted the importance of bank credit. The purpose of this article is to revisit this important macroeconomic variable. Consequently, we propose to endogenize the volume of bank credit by paying special attention to those variables that are related to the real estate market, which can be considered as key to the evolution of bank credit. Our theoretical hypothesis is tested by means of a sample of nine economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) from 1970 to 2011. For this purpose, we apply the cointegration technique, which permits the modeling of the long-run equilibrium relationship and the short-run dynamics along with an error-correction term.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Arestis, Philip] Univ Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain; [Rosa Gonzalez, Ana] Cambridge Econometr, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge; University of Basque Country,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,"Gonzalez-Martinez, Ana Rosa/0000-0002-1198-9681",,,,,53,8,9,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.
