A drawback of this approach is that dispensing physicians or prescribing pharmacists may be incentivized to increase their own profits through the prescription of cost-inefficient drug packages, leading to an increase in pharmaceutical spending. Switzerland constitutes an interesting example of where dispensing and non-dispensing physicians coexist, permitting a comparison of their prescribing behavior. The present study shows that drug margin optimization is possible under the current drug price regulation scheme in Switzerland. Using drug claims data, empirical findings indicate a 5-10 % higher margin per dose for dispensing physicians compared to pharmacists. Cost per dose is 3-5 % higher when dispensed by physicians instead of pharmacists.","Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Rischatsch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.",maurus.rischatsch@econ.uzh.ch,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In contrast to recent studies, we do not find a significant effect on aggregate enrollment rates. Our study differs from previous studies in three important ways. First, we take full account of the fact that tuition fees were both introduced and abolished in the German states at different points in time. Second, we consider control variables, which are absent in previous studies but turn out to have a significant impact on the evolution of enrollment rates. Third, we allow for state-specific effects of tuition fees on enrollment rates.

We test Portuguese insights, using time series data from 1960 to 2005, taking into account different variables (life expectancy, labour, capital, infant mortality) and considering the years that included major events on the political scene, such as the dictatorship and a closed economy (1960-1974), a revolution (1974) and full democracy and an open economy (1975-2005), factors that influence major economic, cultural, social and politic indicators. Therefore the analysis is carried out adopting Lucas' (J Monet Econ 22(1):3-42, 1988) endogenous growth model that considers human capital as one factor of production, it adopts a VAR (vector autoregressive) model to test the causality between growth and health.

This article tests six hypotheses within an Olsonian framework for corporate donations to political parties with new data from the 100 largest German firms between 1984 and 2005. The findings reveal that only a minority of firms donate, and donation amounts are surprisingly small given the financial assets of these companies, which suggests the presence of a collective action dilemma with small selective and arguably larger collective benefits. Management ties between firms are an important way of making firms overcome the collective action dilemma. Firms distribute their donations if any - mainly on the right side of the political spectrum, particularly if the firms are personally interwoven with other large companies or if they are family owned. However, some firms, particularly those belonging to the automobile sector, donate across the political spectrum.","[Goerres, Achim] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Polit Sci, Essen, Germany; [Hoepner, Martin] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Max Planck Society,"Höpner, M (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany.",hoepner@mpi-fg-koeln.mpg.de,"; Goerres, Achim/D-4849-2014","Hopner, Martin/0000-0002-7996-1618; Goerres, Achim/0000-0002-6065-6613",,,,,56,8,8,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The data set follows students from kindergarten to grade 5, a period during which racial gaps in test scores increase rapidly. Teacher assessments comprise up to twenty items measuring specific skills. Using a unique within-student and within-teacher identification and while controlling for subject-specific test scores, I find that teachers do assess same-race students more favorably. Effects appear in kindergarten and persist thereafter. Robustness checks suggest that: student behavior does not explain this effect; same-race effects are evident in teacher assessments of most of the skills; grading on the curve should be associated with lower assessments; and measurement error in assessments or test scores does not significantly affect the estimates.","INSEAD, Dept Econ, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France",INSEAD Business School,"Ouazad, A (通讯作者)，INSEAD, Dept Econ, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France.",amine.ouazad@insead.edu,"Ouazad, Amine/AFB-9027-2022","Ouazad, Amine/0000-0002-7079-7778",,,,,49,54,93,0,30,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The carbon balance module simulated changes in the carbon storage in living biomass, dead organic matter and products. Carbon releases from timber harvesting, transporting and manufacturing were included in the carbon balance, as well as the substitution, recycling and reuse effects of different types of wood products (avoided releases from fossil fuels due to the use of wood). Prediction models were developed for the initial pools of wood products and dead organic matter. The results show that collecting branches, stumps and coarse roots for bioenergy improves the carbon balance very little during the first 30 years of biofuel harvesting. This is because decreased carbon balance of forest soil partially cancels the positive substitution effects of fuel feedstock harvesting. Using high thinnings and continuous cover management instead of low thinnings, clear felling and artificial regeneration have an immediate positive effect on the carbon balance.

We use variation in the timing of MTBE bans across states to identify their effects on gasoline prices. We find that state bans increased reformulated gasoline prices by 3-6 cents in non-Midwestern states for which the bans were binding, with larger impacts during times of high ethanol prices relative to MTBE and crude oil. We find qualitatively similar, yet smaller effects for conventional gasoline. We argue on the basis of a simple conceptual model and supporting empirical evidence that these bans functioned as implicit ethanol blending mandates in areas that were previously using MTBE to comply with strict environmental constraints. Overall, our results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that mandating a minimum market share for a more costly alternative fuel either directly, or implicitly through a ban on the preferred conventional fuel will inevitably increase fuel prices in a competitive market.

Participant choices result in an endogenous distribution of success rates over gambles that reflects tradeoffs between the relative desirability of the available goods and the probability of winning. When lottery winnings are multi-attribute goods, lottery outcomes provide sufficient information to estimate hedonic prices, marginal utility, and marginal rates of substitution among attributes. We develop a model for characterizing preferences from this information set. We apply our model to Idaho's Four Rivers Whitewater Recreation Lottery, which allows applicants to apply for one permit among a large set of alternative river/day combinations that provide varying river and weather characteristics.

Data/methods Using Austrian health insurance administrative panel data linked to the Austrian birth register, we estimate the effects of LBW and VLBW in comparison to normal birth weight (NBW) on the number of days spent in the hospital and on expenditures for medical assistance and medical drugs among children and young adults between birth and 21 years of age. To account for the time-invariant heterogeneity of mothers, we control for sibling fixed effects. Results We find that, in comparison to their NBW counterparts, LBW infants spend more days hospitalized and more is spent on medical drugs (particularly on antiinfectives) for them in their first year of life. Although the absolute differences in health service utilization between NBW and LBW groups diminish over time, LBW newborns still spend more days hospitalized, and their medical drug and medical assistance expenses are significantly higher in early childhood. During compulsory schooling, we observe a shift toward diseases of the nervous system and mental and behavioral disorders among children born with LBW. Some of these effects persist until early adulthood. Conclusions We argue for further counseling efforts for expectant mothers on the determinants and risk factors of LBW. Moreover, pre-school screenings especially tailored to LBW infants with a particular focus on mental health and behavioral disorders can be easily integrated in the existing postnatal mother-child care program in Austria to mitigate the consequences of negative conditions during pregnancy.","[Hummer, Michael; Lehner, Thomas; Pruckner, Gerald] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Hummer, Michael; Pruckner, Gerald] Austrian Ctr Labor Econ & Anal Welf State, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Hummer, M (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Altenberger Str 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",michael.hummer@jku.at,,,,,,,30,11,14,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Owing to the lack of relevant data on health human resource (HHR) migration for the continent, the subject matter has remained empirically void over the last decades despite the acute concern about health professional emigration. Using quantile regression, the following findings have been established. (1) The effect of HHR emigration is positive (negative) at low (high) levels of economic growth. (2) HHR emigration improves (mitigates) human development (GDP per capita growth) in low (high) quantiles of the distribution. (3) Specific differences in effects are found in top quantiles of human development and low quantiles of GDP per capita growth where the physician (nurse) emigration elasticities of development are positive (negative) and negative (positive), respectively. As a policy implication, blanket health-worker emigration control policies are unlikely to succeed across countries with different levels of human development and economic prosperity. Hence, the policies should be contingent on the prevailing levels of development and tailored differently across the most and least developed African countries.","Univ Liege, HEC Management Sch, B-4000 Liege, Belgium",University of Liege,"Asongu, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Liege, HEC Management Sch, Rue Louvrex 14,Bldg N1, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",asongusimplice@yahoo.com,"Simplice, Asongu/K-3436-2014","Simplice, Asongu/0000-0001-5227-5135",,,,,35,31,31,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The analysis is based on a Norwegian case of AR on regional foresight. The article reflects upon and develops the concept of action research (AR) as it relates to regional-foresight practices in connection with regional planning strategies (policies), according to Norway's new Planning and Building Act (PBA, 2008). Both AR and regional foresight are broad terms within a number of domains, and several contributions have sought to show how these are interlinked Ramos (2006). The focus is on how AR and action researchers both contribute to the co-creation of regional and subregional formulation of planning by regional-foresight processes, which are driven by decision-making regional bodies. This article contributes to the understanding of how an AR strategy of 'strategic facilitation' may improve the overall foresight capacity of all regional actors, both in concert and as single stakeholders. Also it furthers the understanding of how an AR approach may assist in transforming the foresight practices and the strategic decision-making into a more transparent process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the past decade the term discourse has entered the field. Discourse analytical approaches and methods have become increasingly popular among scholars dealing with forests and their governance. When consulting the growing literature, one quickly notes the inconsistent use of the terms discourse and discourse analysis. On this basis, this paper will provide (1) an overview of discourse approaches in international social and political science literature on forests, (2) identify existing trends and gaps in the literature, and (3) critically assess deficits and opportunities of existing discursive perspectives on forests and their governance. The article is based on a comprehensive survey of sixty-six journal articles, book chapters, books and online publications referring to the terms forest and discourse in the title or key words. The results suggest that forest-related discourse research may benefit from a stronger emphasis on the politics of discourse. In particular, questions of where and by whom discourses are circulated and institutionalised could provide valuable insights into forest governance. In order to arrive at these insights, however, more theoretical and methodological rigour and innovation seem to be required. Consequently, this review suggests that forest-related discourse research would benefit from (1) relating new work to the most recent discourse research conducted in different disciplines and specialisations, (2) boldly testing different available discourse lenses from political science as well as other disciplines, and (3) getting creative in adjusting those lenses (theoretically and methodologically).

However, economic integration and globalization in the global macroeconomic environment has led to sharp increase of the dynamic of foreign flows between the countries, both commercial and financial flows. This paper aims to highlight that, during the current economic and financial crisis, financial globalization can cause a raise of capital flows volatility, which can have disturbing effects on the economic growth. The results will show the fact that, in times of macroeconomic imbalances, financial globalization is not a blessing for the economy, stimulating capital flows volatility and negatively influencing the economic development of the countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEECs).

In particular, a supervised three layers MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) ANN is adopted, which is trained using information from previous customers' reservations. Performances of our ANNs are analyzed: they behave in a quite satisfactory way in managing the (simulated) booking service in a hotel. The customer requires single or double rooms, while the system gives as a reply the confirmation of the required services, if available. Moreover, in the case rooms or services are not at disposal, we highlight that using our approach the system proposes alternative accommodations (from two days in advance to two days later with respect to the requested day).

Taking into account the most important changes in agricultural support, the authors focus on three issues: direct payment scheme, rural development, and market intervention. In this context, there will be an assessment of the new CAP from the point of view of Polish agricultural sector. General conclusion is that, in terms of the amount of support, Poland has received slightly higher budget than in the current perspective but which is far from the expectations of Polish farmers.

To assess the effects of changes in the burden of labour taxes, the scientific literature was analysed and various research findings were examined and compared in the paper. The present research found that labour taxes can affect wages, the extent of engagement of employees in the labour market, the number of hours worked and labour costs, and the rates of unemployment and employment in the country. However, research works of many authors give evidence that changes in labour taxes may have different effects depending on the particular situation.

A question which arises here is how social processes of learning with Information Technology (IT) are affected by a student's gender. Data were gathered from a questionnaire-based survey, through personal interviews with all students enrolled in Year 2 of the Higher Diploma in Applied Statistics and Computing (HDASC) course offered by the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education. This cohort of HDASC students was selected because Regression Modelling is a module taught in the second year. Web resources and Excel are utilised with an emphasis on social processes of learning. The results of the survey indicated that they had positive perceptions of learning with IT that were associated with social interaction and communication, irrespective of gender of students.

This article develops a general invasive species impact model to capture explicitly both the ecological and economic effects of invasive species, especially escaped farmed fish, on native populations and harvests. First, the possible effects of escaped farmed fish on the growth and stock size of a native fish are examined. Next, a bioeconomic model to analyze changes in yield, benefit distribution, and overall profitability is constructed. Different harvesting scenarios, such as commercial, recreational, and joint commercial and recreational fishing are explored. The model is illustrated by a case study of the interaction between native and farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway. The results suggest that both the harvest and profitability of a native fish stock may decline after an invasion, but the total profits from the harvest of both native and farmed stocks may increase or decrease, depending on the strength of the ecological and economic parameters.","[Liu, Yajie] SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Olaussen, Jon Olaf] Sor Trondelag Univ Coll HiST, Trondheim Business Sch, Trondheim, Norway; [Skonhoft, Anders] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, DELATE Ctr Econ Res, Dept Econ, Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Liu, YJ (通讯作者)，SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, Postboks 4762, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway.",yajie.liu@sintef.no,,,Research Council of Norway through program of Norwegian Environmental Research Towards 2015 (Miljo),Research Council of Norway through program of Norwegian Environmental Research Towards 2015 (Miljo),"The research is funded by the Research Council of Norway through the program of Norwegian Environmental Research Towards 2015 (Miljo 2015).

Increased burden of the sovereign debt was followed soon by intention of governments to provide an effective timetable of crucial and inevitable fiscal consolidation procedures. In the paper we provide an overview of main trends in public budgets and sovereign debts in European economies from the past Eastern block of countries during last two decades. We identify episodes of successful and unsuccessful (cold showers versus gradual) fiscal (expenditure versus revenue based) consolidations by analyzing effects of improvements in the cyclically adjusted primary balance on the sovereign debt ratio reduction. Effects of fiscal consolidating adjustments are evaluated for pre-crisis and crisis periods to reveal crisis effects on fiscal consolidation efforts. We also provide ideas about a feasibility of expenditure versus revenue based fiscal consolidation episodes (i. e. side effects on the macroeconomic performance). (C) 2014 The Authors.

Although the biophysical impacts of aquaculture on biodiversity have been examined, there is only limited understanding of the social and economic impacts of aquaculture on biodiversity, and especially the impacts of the shift from intensive to semi-intensive systems. The purposes of this article are twofold: (1) to identify and discuss the social and economic impacts of aquaculture on biodiversity, and (2) to examine the impacts while moving from intensive to semi-intensive systems. After discussing the findings of our study, we provide some recommendations as to how to minimize social and economic impacts of aquaculture on biodiversity by moving to a lower intensity aquaculture system. The integrated agriculture-aquaculture farming systems, stakeholder involvement in management, and well defined basic rights are aquaculture systems that contribute to conservation of biodiversity.","[Pomeroy, Robert] Univ Connecticut, Agr & Resource Econ CT Sea Grant, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Dey, Madan M.] Univ Arkansas Pine Bluff, Aquaculture Fisheries Ctr, Pine Bluff, AR USA; [Plesha, Nataliya] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA",University of Connecticut; University of Arkansas System; University Arkansas Pine Bluff; University of Connecticut,"Pomeroy, R (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Agr & Resource Econ CT Sea Grant, 380 Marine Sci Bldg,1080 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA.",robert.pomeroy@uconn.edu,,"Dey, Madan/0000-0001-5273-2789",AquaFish Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP),AquaFish Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP),We wish to acknowledge support from the AquaFish Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP).,,41,10,12,2,56,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The original SSTQUAL scale, as developed by Lin and Hsieh in 2011, is intended to measure the quality of services offered via alternative distribution channels across contexts. One year later, Radomir and Nistor adapt the scale to the banking context and argue that the revised SSTQUAL scale may better reflect Romanian customers' perceptions regarding the quality of services offered through delivery channels such as ATMs, Internet Banking or Mobile Banking. Hence, this paper is organized in five main sections. The introduction only briefly underlines the differences in the two scales under comparison. The second section describes the questionnaire design, data collection and data analysis processes. The results section presents arguments in favour of the refined version of the revised SSTQUAL scale and is followed up by the discussion and conclusion section.

Before the change, GPs received a capitation fee for publicly insured patients and fee for service (FFS) for privately insured patients. In 2006, a combined system was introduced for all patients, with elements of capitation as well as FFS. This created a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of the change in the remuneration system on contact type and consultation length. Our hypothesis was that for former publicly insured patients the change would lead to an increase in the proportion of home visits, a decrease in the proportion of telephone consultations and an increase in consultation length relative to formerly privately insured patients. Data were used from electronic medical records from 36 to 58 Dutch GP practices and from 532,800 to 743,961 patient contacts between 2002 and 2008 for contact type data. For consultation length, 1,994 videotaped consultations were used from 85 GP practices in 2002 and 499 consultations from 16 GP practices in 2008. Multilevel multinomial regression analysis was used to analyse consultation type. Multilevel logistic and linear regression analyses were used to examine consultation length. Our study shows that contact type and consultation length were hardly affected by the change in remuneration system, though the proportion of home visits slightly decreased for privately insured patients compared with publicly insured patients. Declaration behaviour regarding telephone consultations did change; GP practices more consistently declared telephone consultations after 2006.","[van Dijk, Christel E.; Verheij, Robert A.; Spreeuwenberg, Peter; Groenewegen, Peter P.; de Bakker, Dinny H.] Netherlands Inst Hlth Serv Res, NIVEL, POB 1568, NL-3500 BN Utrecht, Netherlands; [te Brake, Hans] Dutch Knowledge & Advice Ctr Postdisaster Psychos, IMPACT, Diemen, Netherlands; [Groenewegen, Peter P.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Groenewegen, Peter P.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [de Bakker, Dinny H.] Tilburg Univ, Sci Ctr Transformat Care & Welf TRANZO, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research; Utrecht University; Utrecht University; Tilburg University,"van Dijk, CE (通讯作者)，Netherlands Inst Hlth Serv Res, NIVEL, POB 1568, NL-3500 BN Utrecht, Netherlands.",c.vandijk@nivel.nl,"Groenewegen, Peter P./I-1574-2013","Groenewegen, Peter/0000-0003-2127-8442",,,,,34,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

One model targets resource usage directly to assess production efficiency, while the other model incorporates financial results to assess economic efficiency. Performance analysis of these models was conducted in two stages. In stage one, we utilized data envelopment analysis to obtain the efficiency score of each hospital, while in stage two we took into account the influence of the operational environment on efficiency by regressing those scores on explanatory variables that concern the performance of hospital services. We applied these methods to evaluate 96 general hospitals in the Greek national health system. The results indicate that, although the average efficiency scores in both models have remained relatively stable compared to past assessments, internal changes in hospital performances do exist.

To analyze optimal trade credit management, an existing bioeconomic model of a semi-intensive shrimp farm (139 hectares with 44 earthen ponds) located in Sinaloa, Mexico, was extended to create a framework that assesses the decision-making problem related to funding from input suppliers (feed and postlarvae) during one culture cycle, integrating stochastic factors like shrimp mortality and pond water temperature. Through the application of Monte Carlo simulation and genetic algorithm-based optimization techniques, results show that the minimum funding cost is US$15,710 (for an operation budget of US$603,790), 27% lower than alternative funding scenarios (P-value <0.001). Although framed at the firm level, this approach optimizes any funding planning scenario in short-term credit management, particularly in funding schemes involving input suppliers.

J,"Nelson, RH",,,,"Nelson, Robert H.",,,Multiple-use forest management versus ecosystem forest management: A religious question?,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forest Service; Multiple-use management; Ecosystem management; National forests; Forest values; Secular religion,,"Traditionally, forestry professionals in the United States have believed that forest management is a scientific discipline that should be undertaken by value-neutral experts. This understanding originated in the progressive era, typically dated from 1890 to 1920, as part of a wider progressive belief in the scientific management of American society. The U.S. Forest Service was created in 1905 to advance this mission, including on the national forests directly managed by the Forest Service itself. In the last few decades of the twentieth century, however, such core tenets of professional forestry came under increasing challenge from the environmental movement. Instead of seeing a forest as a natural resource to be used to advance the economic progress of American society, environmentalists now saw forests as having an intrinsic value independent of human welfare. By the early twenty-first century, reflecting such new thinking in American society, the old idea of multiple-use management of the national forests (and other natural systems) had lost out to ecosystem management. This article finds that this shift in forest management philosophy reflected new (secular) religious directions in American society, as the progressive gospel of efficiency increasingly lost out to a new environmental gospel of naturalness.

As a rapidly emerging source of labour and settlers for Australia's immigration programme, temporary skilled migration will have a major and potentially long-lasting impact on Australia. Since the mid-1990s, temporary skilled migration (under the subclass 457 visa programme) has overtaken permanent migration to Australia. India is now the largest and fastest growing source of temporary skilled migrants. This is a major new development in Australian migration history; yet, to date, there has been little qualitative research into the subjective experiences, motivations and settlement patterns of Indian temporary skilled migrants in Australia, from the perspective of the migrant. This article presents findings from a 3-year qualitative study on the experiences of temporary skilled migrants from India living and working in Australia. It argues that many of the quantitative studies on this topic fail to offer a nuanced reading of these workers' experiences in Australia, in particular, their situations of vulnerability engendered by the recruitment process, visa conditions, unlawful employment practices and living arrangements.","[Velayutham, Selvaraj] Macquarie Univ, Dept Sociol, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Velayutham, S (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Balaclava Rd, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",selvaraj.velayutham@mq.edu.au,,"Velayutham, Selvaraj/0000-0003-3360-177X",,,,,27,43,46,0,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

As an MRA is concluded to reduce entry costs of exporting, multinationals (MNEs) derive more benefits from economies of scale than from tariff-jumping strategies, implying that they have more incentive to export than to perform horizontal FDI. In order to prove the above argument, the article introduces MRA and FDI into Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004)'s framework of international trade, analyses the relationship between exports and horizontal FDI sales in response to MRA and then tests empirically the theoretical results, utilizing data from US multinational affiliate sales and exports. The empirical results show that MRAs have positive effects on the US exports relative to horizontal FDI, bringing the results in line with the theoretical model.","Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, Seoul 130701, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Jang, YJ (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",yjjang@khu.ac.kr,"Jang, Yong Joon/AAJ-8754-2020","Jang, Yong Joon/0000-0001-5338-9804",,,,,25,4,4,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We empirically address two important questions. First, if the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff for a product is higher, does it lead to a higher or lower preferential tariff? Second, the US being a large trading partner in such agreements, does reciprocity matter for giving meaningful preferential access? For a given MFN tariff we model the preferential tariff with a simple linear functional form. We take the US MTL as known to the world by the end of Uruguay Round in 1994 and estimate the impact of MTL on prefrential tariff negotiations of the US during 1995 to 2007. Here use a three-dimensional panel data, which takes into account the partner, product and time variation of the data-set. To complete our data-set, we codify eight Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) legal agreements. We draw three important conclusions. First, the products that are highly protected do not get high preferential access even at the regional level. Second, reciprocity plays only a limited role in granting better preferential access. Third, irrespective of development level of the partner, the non-reciprocal Generalized System of Preference (GSP) preferences always matter.","Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland",,"Joshi, V (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Ave Paix 11A, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland.",vivek.joshi@graduateinstitute.ch,"Joshi, Vivek/A-7874-2013",,"Centre for Trade and Economic Integration (CTEI), the Graduate Institute, Geneva","Centre for Trade and Economic Integration (CTEI), the Graduate Institute, Geneva","Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Avenue de la Paix 11A, CH-1202 Geneva, E-mail: vivek.joshi@graduateinstitute.ch.

While this pluriformity in specifications advances the understanding of TTO from a methodological point of view, it also results in incomparable health state values. Health state values are applied in health technology assessments, and in that context comparability of information is desired. In this article, we discuss several alternative specifications of TTO presented in the literature. The defining elements of these specifications are identified as being either methodological, procedural or analytical in nature. Where possible, it is indicated how these elements affect health state values (i.e., upward or downward).

The rise in unpaid work time for women is approximately four times more than that for men. These differences between women and men are much sharper in urban areas than in rural ones. Results support the argument that economic crises reinforce the preexisting gender gap in work time.

Trend analysis shows that the recession narrowed the disparity in both paid and unpaid work hours, as mothers substituted paid work for unpaid work and fathers' paid work hours declined. If the jobless recovery after June 2009 is included in the recessionary period, hardship in the labor market for fathers brought greater gender equality only in paid work. Relative to mothers and in an absolute sense, fathers' paid work hours and total workload declined and their personal care and leisure time increased. These findings suggest an alternative path for moving toward equality in workloads that entails gender-equitable job creation, living wage, and work-life balance policies.","[Berik, Guenseli] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Kongar, Ebru] Dickinson Coll, Dept Econ, Carlisle, PA 17103 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Dickinson College,"Berik, G (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, 260 South Cent Campus Dr,Rm 343, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",berik@economics.utah.edu; kongare@dickinson.edu,,,,,,,43,50,58,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

It aims to facilitate a conversation between macroeconomic theorists of crises and instability and feminist economists and scholars of intergroup inequality. Macroeconomic analyses of the Great Recession have centered on the causal role of financial deregulation, capital flow imbalances, and growth of income and wealth inequality. That work tends to be divorced from research that analyzes broader distributional impacts, prior to the crisis and subsequently, transmitted through economic channels and government responses. This study's framework emphasizes the role of stratification along multiple trajectories - race, class, and gender - in contributing to economic crises and in shaping their distributional dynamics.

The wage gap between regular employees and temps widened after the reform, showing that firms use agency work to reduce labour costs.

Our findings show that DSMs frequently refer to 14,70 rules and case law not only on matters of procedure but also on various substantive aspects of trade law and general international law. The 150 identified references vary in their quality and importance for the rationale of the DSM. They range from a footnote en passant to being at the core of the solution for a particular legal problem that the adjudicator or arbitrator faces. We cluster our findings into four major categories of circumstances under which other DSMs deem it appropriate to cite the WTO (factual determinations, procedural aspects, general principles of international law or the rules on treaty interpretation, and substantive rules). A more difficult task has been to draw tentative conclusions as to the reasons that motivate DSMs to look specifically into WTO rules and case law. In most instances, this is due to the fact that the terms or their context in a given applicable law of a regional trade mechanism resemble those of the WTO disciplines. However, the use of the WTO precedent for purposes of procedure and clarification of general principles of international law or the rules on treaty interpretation show a broader influence of the WTO on international dispute settlement.","[Marceau, Gabrielle] World Trade Org, Legal Affairs Div, Geneva, Switzerland; [Marceau, Gabrielle] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Izaguerri, Arnau] UNCTAD, Competit & Consumer Policies Branch, Geneva, Switzerland; [Marceau, Gabrielle; Lanovoy, Vladyslav] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",World Trade Organization; University of Geneva,"Marceau, G (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,96,19,20,0,7,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The common resources usually used in wildfire detection are lookout towers, terrestrial mobile brigades, aerial reconnaissance and the general public. The objectives of this paper are (i) to analyse the relative importance of the different detection systems in Portugal and Spain, according to their spatial and temporal patterns, (ii) to assess the territorial variables related to the performance of fire detection systems in the Iberian Peninsula, and (iii) to develop an explanatory model aiming to inform fire detection policies. Pursuing this aim, a common wildfire and territorial database for the whole Iberian Peninsula was developed, thus enabling common cartographic and statistical. analyses. Results show the importance of land cover variables and population density on the proportion of fire detections made by the different systems in both countries. Despite certain national specificities, many common features were found, allowing the identification of general patterns of fire detection distribution and performance for the Iberian Peninsula. Models developed at the regional and sub-regional levels indicate that high population density and high proportion of forestlands are associated with higher proportion of detection by population, whereas higher proportion of shrublands corresponds to higher proportions of detections by other systems, particularly lookout towers. The conclusions obtained and the approaches applied could be used with similar objectives in other countries and regions to inform policy decisions regarding the allocation of resources for wildfire detection.

Presently applied to activities concerning medicine, surgery and obstetrics, the pricing for these activities was developed using the National Costs Study. The considerable differences observed between costs in the private sector and those in the public sector are in part justified, by the latter, by caring for patients with social deprivation. The goal of this study is to measure the influence of social deprivation on the length of hospitalisation. A survey on inpatient social deprivation was carried out from November to December 2008 by the French Ministry of Health (Department of Research, Study, Evaluation and Statistics-DREES, and technical agency of Hospital information-ATIH). Four dimensions of social deprivation were taken into consideration after a previous qualitative study: social isolation, quality of housing, level of income and access to rights. The sample is based on 27 hospitals, including public and private (for-profit and not-for-profit), representing 57,175 stays, 6,800 of which were patients with social deprivation. After multivariate analyses adjusted for age, severity of illness and DRG, we found that there was a longer length of stay for inpatients with social deprivation (+16%), and in particular for patients living in social isolation (+17%) and for patients with inadequate housing (+17%). The impact of low income on the length of stay is less important. However, low income associated with inadequate housing significantly increases lengths of stay (+24%).","[Yilmaz, Engin; Raynaud, Denis] French Minist Hlth, Dept Res Study Evaluat & Stat DREES, F-75350 Paris 07, SP, France",,"Yilmaz, E (通讯作者)，French Minist Hlth, Dept Res Study Evaluat & Stat DREES, 14 Ave Duquesne, F-75350 Paris 07, SP, France.",Engin.yilmaz@sante.gouv.fr; Denis.raynaud@sante.gouv.fr,,,,,,,21,17,17,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, these large beneficial effects declined with increases in the transfer amount offered to the parents conditional on regular school attendance by the adolescent girls. Improved physical health, increased school attendance, personal consumption, and leisure contributed to the effects. There was also strong evidence of increased psychological distress among untreated baseline schoolgirls in treatment areas.

Using an index of dissimilarity based on data from the Annual Survey of Industries for 1989/90 and 2000/01, the authors find that sex segregation across India's so-called factory sector decreased over this period. Most of the apparent improvement, however, was due to changes in the industrial structure of employment, not desegregation per se. The index is also sensitive to the number of industries in the underlying classifications. At the national and state levels, formal job opportunities for women are effectively very limited: they are highly concentrated in a small number of traditional women's manufacturing industries, such as food, tobacco, apparel, weaving and spinning.","[Chattopadhyay, Molly; Chakraborty, Sonali] Indian Stat Unit, Sociol Res Unit, Kolkata, India; [Anker, Richard] Univ Massachusetts, Polit Econ Res Inst PERI, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",Indian Statistical Institute; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Chattopadhyay, M (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Unit, Sociol Res Unit, Kolkata, India.",molly@isical.ac.in; csonali60@hotmail.com; marthaandrichard@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,2,2,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

Given the peculiarities of services trade, the Agreement contains a variety of conceptual innovations, including its extension to transactions (modes of supply), beyond conventional cross-border trade, and various types of non-tariff restrictions. In turn, the new concepts needed time to be absorbed by the ministries and agencies involved, many of which might have been surprised by 'their' sectors being covered by a trade agreement and the ensuing government-internal coordination needs. Thus, understandably, the schedules that emerged from the Uruguay Round, which still account for the majority of current commitments, contain a variety of ill-specified entries. Such entries undermine the transparency and predictability of market conditions, thereby affecting trade and investment decisions in services. Poorly specified commitments also give rise to trade disputes. While the scheduling conventions agreed for the Doha Round provided for technical refinements that would leave the substance of commitments unchanged, this possibility was used far more sparingly than could have been expected. Moreover, additional flaws would have been introduced if some of the (preliminary) offers had entered into effect. The following discussion tries to explain the scope for refinements and develop a clearer picture of the commitments warranting correction - whether in the form of a final Doha Round outcome or through negotiation-independent action by WTO Members.","[Adlung, Rudolf; Morrison, Peter; Roy, Martin; Zhang, Weiwei] WTO Secretariat, Trade Serv Div, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Adlung, R (通讯作者)，WTO Secretariat, Trade Serv Div, Geneva, Switzerland.",rudolf.adlung@wto.org,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2013,12.0,1,,,,,1,27,,10.1017/S1474745611000486,0.0,,,27,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,076TB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313979800001,0

Also technological innovation impact reflects quicker in industry and services than agriculture. The economic activity which produces major variations in employment is industry, for example agro-food industry, while agriculture and services relates more with the capacity to retain population. The spatial effect over rural territories regulates the employment as much as other production, factors for the industry. In our current research, we are considering the formulation of direct relation between employment, spatial distribution and endowment of industrial sites within a geographical territory. The model includes local employment, workers commuting from other towns (employment spill) caused by the spatial distribution, industry distribution and the technology-economy external change impact. Of course the change in the industry local capacity is the result of technological evolution and product demand, and the economic cycle situation (contraction or expansion), for which consideration of time has to be brought into the model to allow for the external factors changes. The econometric model used is based on the Spatial SUR (Seemingly Unrelated Regression), allowing the analysis with temporal series of data relevant to the towns and the spatial distribution in the rural territory, to estimate the parameters of the employment-industry model for every period of observation. As the actual objective of the research is proof of concept about the model and its prediction power, with this particular study we have used a reduced territory. The results produced appear to be quite positive, which will lead to a more extensive study, which will be carried out in the near future including a much larger territory with over a hundred villages, and over a longer period of time for this observations.","[Calzadilla, J.; Villa, A.; Lopez, J.

Companies and governments are using leverage at large scale. In had times, it is busting the losses. Companies and governments will have to deleverage. This paper aims to present in brief the concepts of leveraging and deleveraging, to explain why companies, banks and governments are using the leverage, and what are the consequences of using it? The high degree of leverage is one cause of a financial crisis and therefore deleveraging is usually following a financial crisis. We will address the issues of leverage and deleverage both on micro and macro level. Deleveraging entails not only risks, but also opportunities, notably the chance to strengthen financial stability. The opportunities at both macro and micro levels are more likely to materialize if the deleveraging process unfolds in an orderly manner and not in the context of increased stress and risk aversion.

This work aims to determine the economic efficiency of OSR hybrid and line varieties growing at three agricultural holdings in the Czech Republic in 2009/10 and 2010/11. In total 107 fields of winter oilseed rape were included in experiment, with total area of 1,982.05 ha. There were sown 25 different varieties of oilseed rape at these fields, 12 lines and 13 hybrids. On basis of the agronomical and primary economical evidence obtained from agricultural holdings was calculated evaluation for each of the crop management intervention, from which were obtained direct costs incurred on each field. After determining the production and multiplying by the average price were obtained the sales from each field. Monitoring costs were deducted from sales, and thus was obtained a contribution to the refunding at individual fields. After comparing these data it was found, that hybrid varieties gave by 25.49 EUR more value per hectare compared to line varieties, what is a difference of about 5.4 %. The benefits were achieved despite the higher costs. The costs by hybrids were about 17.6 % higher, or 98.82 EUR per hectare, mainly due to more expensive seed. This result complies with the hypothesis that hybrid varieties should bring economical effect of about 5 % and speaks in favor of hybrids, which are constantly gaining more and more importance in the Czech Republic.","[Krcek, V; Baranyk, P.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Crop Prod, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Krcek, V (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Crop Prod, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",krcekv@af.czu.cz,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,89,93,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800013,0

The experiment was conducted on five clinically healthy heifers. Heifers were crossbred Holstein and Czech Pied. Their mammary glands were experimentally infected by bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Bacterial suspension was applied in amout of 5 ml and the concentration was 800 CFU/ml. Application of inoculum was designed after control lavage with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Samples of cell populations were obtain by lavage of the mammary gland in 4 intervals (24, 48, 72 and 168 hrs) after initiation of experirimental infection. Percentage of lymphocytes and subpopulation gamma delta T-lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry. Stimulation of mammary gland by S. aureus led to percetnage increase of lymhocytes from 9.62% detected in 24 hrs to 27.36% in 168 hrs after aplication of inoculum. Percentage increase of gamma delta T-lymphocytes was detected too. 24 hrs after stimulation by S. aureus there was 10.5% gamma delta T-lymphocytes detected out of the total number of lymphocytes. Proportion of gamma delta T-lymphocytes continually increased up to 16.46% in 168 hrs. The results show that gamma delta T-lymphocytes play an important part in inflammatory response to Gram positive bacteria in heifers's mammary gland.","[Sustrova, T.; Slama, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Morphol Physiol & Anim Genet, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Sustrová, T (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Morphol Physiol & Anim Genet, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",terez.sustrova@seznam.cz,"Slama, Petr/L-3576-2018",,,,,,15,2,2,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,788,792,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800138,0

The analysis is based on cross sectional regressions. The capital structure ratios are long-term debt, short-term debt, total debt and total equity, while return on assets and return on equity are the performance proxies. Previous research shows that asset tangibility, tax, risk, liquidity and inflation determine the capital structure in Romanian manufacturing companies, and thus they will be included in the analysis. Results indicate that debt ratios have a negative impact on corporate performance, although long-term debt was not statistically significant, while equity induces a positive effect on the profitability of Romanian manufacturing companies. This research is the first one to examine the relationship between capital structure and financial performance in Romanian listed companies operating in one industry only, which makes its findings more reliable.","[Vatavu, Sorana] West Univ Timisoara, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,,sorana.vatavu@yahoo.com,"Vatavu, Sorana/HDN-2055-2022",,,,,,14,0,0,1,6,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-1-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,97,107,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336025300009,0

Being an extension of the crisp MULTIMOORA method, the MULTIMOORA-HF is designed to facilitate group decision making with uncertain information. The proposed methods consists of the three parts the Ratio System, the Reference Point, and the Full Multiplicative Form. The proposed method thus provides the means for multi-criteria decision making related to uncertain and complex assessments.

In the Slovak Republic, households with children confront with higher risk of long-term poverty than rest of the households. The average poverty rate for the years 2005 to 2011, according to EU-SILC methodology, for the childless households is 7.67 %, and for households with children 14.66 %. However, households with three or more children show the highest average poverty risk rate of 28.87% for the years 2005 to 2011. The paper assumes that response of households with higher risk of poverty will be more elastic to the change in the food market compared to rest of the households in the economy. More elastic is expected for the whole food market. For in-depth and detailed analysis, the food market is divided into seven basic foodstuff categories. Bread and cereals, milk and dairy products, fruits and vegetables, meat and meat products, fats and oils, sweets, fish. Data for the analysis is drawn out from National Accounts of Statistics Office of the Slovak Republic, years 2005 to 2011. Household expenditure on selected foodstuff categories has an upward trend during this period. Expenditures of childless households are higher for all mentioned foodstuff groups. The minor differences in expenditures in both households with children and without children are eminent in the basic foodstuffs category which consists of bread market, market for cereals and dairy products. Markets with fish, fruit, vegetables and meat are dominated considerably disparity between spending of households with children and households without children. Regression analysis is used to determine the impact of changes in income on expenditures on individual foodstuff categories. Estimated regression coefficients are used to calculate the elasticity. The coefficients confirmed assumptions about elasticity and greater impact of changes in income on expenditures of household with children, especially expenditures on bread, milk and dairy products, fruits and vegetables and meat. However, assumptions are not confirmed about expenditures on fats, oils and sweets. Households without children responded with higher elasticity in these markets. The results display that households without children consider these goods as less essential than households with children, thus trying to consume rationally. It might be caused by constant children activities resulted into higher calorie intake, which is also used. This situation is not ideal, as the basic eating habits are formed in childhood. It is therefore important to promote awareness of appropriate eating and the principles of rational nutrition that can be practiced in the majority of households in Slovakia.","[Zentkova, Iveta; Hoskova, Elena; Cvengrosova, Eva] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra 94901, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,,iveta.zentkova@uniag.sk; elena.hoskova@uniag.sk; eva.cvengrosova@uniag.sk,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,617,629,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600057,0

To date, evidence on whether P4P itself is an efficient method has not been systematically analyzed. Objective To identify and analyze the existing literature regarding economic evaluation of P4P. Data sources English, German, Spanish, and Turkish language literature were searched in the following databases: Business Source Complete, the Cochrane Library, Econlit, ISI web of knowledge, Medline (via PubMed), and PsycInfo (January 2000-April 2010). Study selection Articles published in peer-reviewed journals and describing economic evaluations of P4P initiatives. Full economic evaluations, considering costs and consequences of the P4P intervention simultaneously, were the prime focus. Additionally, comparative partial evaluations were included if costs were described and the study allows for an assessment of consequences. Both experimental and observational studies were considered. Results In total, nine studies could be identified. Three studies could be regarded as full economic evaluations, and six studies were classified as partial economic evaluations. Based on the full economic evaluations, P4P efficiency could not be demonstrated. Partial economic evaluations showed mixed results, but several flaws limit their significance. Ranges of costs and consequences were typically narrow, and programs differed considerably in design. Methodological quality assessment showed scores between 32% and 65%. Conclusion The results show that evidence on the efficiency of P4P is scarce and inconclusive. P4P efficiency could not be demonstrated. The small number and variability of included studies limit the strength of our conclusions. More research addressing P4P efficiency is needed.","[Emmert, Martin; Kemter, Heike; Schoeffski, Oliver] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, Inst Management IFM, Chair Hlth Business Adm, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Eijkenaar, Frank] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Esslinger, Adelheid Susanne] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Chair Strateg Management, Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Emmert, M (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, Inst Management IFM, Chair Hlth Business Adm, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",Martin.Emmert@wiso.uni-erlangen.de,,,,,,,104,61,71,4,79,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In the aquaculture industry, three important biological productivity factors are growth, survival and feed efficiency. The profitability of improving productivity factors, especially growth, is highly dependent upon the cost factor structure, production system, its constraints and other factors within the supply chain. Therefore we present a number of different bio-economical models that can be used to robustly assess the economic impacts in different production environments. These models are introduced with case examples across a range of aquaculture species and production systems. We calculate changes in profitability through a reduction in production costs and any potential increases in product price premiums via the use of weight dependent unit profit as the outcome in cost-benefit analysis, so that results may be expanded to cover different volumes.","[Kankainen, Markus; Setala, Jari] Turku Game & Fisheries Res, Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, Turku 20520, Finland; [Berrill, Iain K.] Univ Stirling, Inst Aquaculture, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Ruohonen, Kari] EWOS Innovat, Dirdal, Norway; [Noble, Chris] Nofima, Tromso, Norway; [Schneider, Oliver] IMARES, Yerseke, Netherlands",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Stirling; Nofima; Wageningen University & Research,"Kankainen, M (通讯作者)，Turku Game & Fisheries Res, Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, Itainen Pitkakatu 3, Turku 20520, Finland.",Markus.Kankainen@rktl.fi,"Schneider, Olivier P/R-9566-2018; Noble, Chris/HKM-9975-2023",,European Union [044118],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The authors would like to express special thanks to Bob Waller (Freedom Food Ltd.), Ian Michie (Marine Harvest Ltd.), Alan Dykes (The Scottish Salmon Company Ltd.), and Jouni Vielma and Kaija Saarni (Finnish Game and Fisheries Research) for assistance with the design of the bio-economic models, practical interpretation of aquaculture industry practices, exploiting data from industry and for comments on earlier versions of the article.

This study analyses interlocking contracts in gum arabic production in Senegal. Gum arabic is a natural exudation of Acacia senegal trees that grow in the semi-arid lands of Africa. Gum arabic is widely used as a food additive, including in soft drinks, among others, and as an emulsifier and coating agent in industries. World demand is high, but smaller producer countries including Senegal struggle to organize a stable export flow. The producer incentives to collect gum from the forests seem to be problematic. In this paper we analyse whether interlocked contracts could contribute to a conducive market environment that stimulates producers to collect and market gum. We collected data of 422 gum producers in Senegal. Results suggest positive effects of interlocking relationships as producers with interlocked contracts are found to collect larger quantities of gum and obtain larger economic returns.

The Menominee selection of a green golden rule path has been made through consistent and long-standing efforts to reject the analysis provided by industrial forestry. The choices made by the Menominee Tribe in managing its forest are also an empirical application of the Chichilnisky criterion, which seeks to balance the interests of the present generation with those of future generations. The Menominee state that they are borrowing the forest from their grandchildren, and hence reject the tyranny of the present. They also reject the tyranny of the future, because they harvest from the forest in the present and do not spend all resources saving for the future. They emphasize the long term and multiple forest outputs; they limit harvest while using the forest for current generations with a lumber mill. When their system was displaced by the US Government management and by Congressional efforts to terminate the tribe's reservation status, the Menominee utilized judicial alternatives and social movements in order to return to their concept of sustainable forest management.

Adaptation to climate change is conceptually closely linked to the reduction of the risk of disasters. Based on contemporary theory in behavioural risk research, the aim was to improve the knowledge on the process of adaptation of forest management to climate change among Swedish private individual forest owners. The responses from two questionnaires from 1999 to 2004, respectively, were analysed. Adaptation of forest management to climate change by private individual forest owners in what is currently the hemiboreal bio-climatic zone of Sweden was quantified and shown to increase over the five year period. In 2004 adaptive measures had been taken on a limited fraction of the forest land owned by private individuals in three study areas located along a latitudinal gradient ranging from the nemoral to the boreal bio-climatic zones in Sweden. Adaptive measures were more frequent in two southern study areas than in a northern study area. Measures taken to adapt were similar in all three study areas, except for those strongly conditioned by the current local climate. Among forest owners who had taken measure to adapt, perceptions of much higher risk due to climate change was more frequent for the risk of damage by wind, drought, fungi, and insects than for other risk factors. Further improvement of the knowledge on how the individual forest owners' learn and perceive of climate change, its impacts on risks and options for adaptation is required to develop and successfully implement adaptive climate change policies.

Firms may engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) to maintain community support and/or to regain the support of a community where it has been lost. It has been conjectured that such 'informal regulation' could effectively replace formal intervention in some settings, and usefully complement it in others. We explore these conjectures with mixed results. Informal regulation is necessarily less efficient than a well-designed formal alternative and the pattern of green behavior induced by the threat of community hostility may increase or decrease welfare. The existence of community pressure may increase or decrease the optimal calibration of a formal intervention (in this case an environmental tax) and may complement or detract from the incentives generated by an optimally calibrated tax.

The impact of climate change brings to the fore deep-seated socio-cultural values, which add to the already complex and uncertain biophysical changes that challenge our preparations for future climate change. Our research aims to examine the role of worldviews and deep seated values in decision-making in response to climate change. The objective is to show how a multi-layered discourse analysis using causal layered analysis (CIA) can provide a powerful means of revealing the underlying social and cultural influences on decision-making and provide more insight into potential pathways for more effective responses to complex phenomena such as climate change. A case study of coastal governance in the south west of Western Australia, which is highly vulnerable to sea-level rise, provides the context of the research. We have found that CIA as a critical research tool has proven to be a useful method in uncovering the dominance of the administrative rationalist worldview on coastal governance. In our view, future coastal governance would benefit from a shift towards greater participatory governance and the incorporation of more reflexive practice so that the deeper emotional and relational aspects of decision-making balance out the dominant problem-solving discourse.

Controls for a variety of factors including ideology, race, campaign contributions, and the inclusion of votes specifically on Cuba fail to diminish the effect. While economics majors are more likely to take a free trade position, not every vote that presupposes a free trade outcome is supported by economics majors.

We study in the first place the Borlaug/land sparing hypothesis, according to which an increase in agricultural productivity per hectare leads to reduced cultivated areas, or at least is a prerequisite for such an outcome, but we find serious limitations when translated in economic terms. Further confrontation with empirical results from case-studies confirms the lack of robustness of the land sparing hypothesis: various kinds of changes in agricultural technologies in various contexts generate various types of impacts on forest cover. Increasing productivity per hectare can be done in many ways and has uncertain consequences on forest cover. Public support policies need to be funded in priority to guarantee that agricultural land reforms work in favour of reducing deforestation. Subsequently, we study the strategies that were elaborated by five countries in the framework of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, which is a prominent supporter of REDD+-readiness. Their analysis shows the poor reflection in these national strategies of the academic debate/research results on the impact of agricultural technologies on deforestation. This gap between science and policy making deserves recognition for improvement, if one wishes most effective use of this new and unprecedented source of finance for reversing the tropical deforestation. But the extremely complex relations between agricultural technologies and deforestation also plead for the promotion and financing of public support policies as one promising way to secure positive outcomes of agricultural technologies.

This paper uses data from a nationally representative survey to examine the impact of students beginning their college career at a two-year college instead of a four-year college. Treatment effects are estimated using both standard regression techniques as well as propensity score matching. As these estimates may be contaminated because of selection on unobservable characteristics this paper will also employ a number of sensitivity analyses to consider the potential bias. The results show large negative impacts on both educational attainment and labor market outcomes for men and women who begin at a two-year college, even for those students who expect to complete a bachelor's degree. The evidence from the sensitivity analyses suggest that to eliminate these large effects there would need to be substantial, and arguably implausible, selection on unobservable characteristics.

Since 2000, every FTA the US has signed has contained a chapter on e-commerce. These chapters have included important protections for the digital economy (e.g., no tax on digital goods, transparency in regulation, and free flow of information). Yet, these chapters have often taken a very narrow view of the issues that they have sought to tackle. It is worthwhile, a decade after these provisions were first written, to revisit and update them to better reflect the nature of modern e-commerce. There are a number of additional issues that are imperative to e-commerce that have not been addressed in past trade regulation. E-commerce often results in the cross-border transfer of digital services. These digital services must be protected against trade-distortive and domestic discriminatory preferences. Moreover, nation-states often rely on narrow interpretations of intellectual property law to restrict the cross-border transfer of e-commerce products and services. These non-traditional barriers to trade must be broken down. Internet intermediaries provide essential services that drive e-commerce. Strong limitations on liability must be guaranteed for these intermediaries. Finally, small businesses are only starting to engage in e-commerce. Future trade regulation should facilitate the growth of small businesses engaged in e-commerce. This article begins by describing the rapid growth of the e-commerce economy. It then reviews the history of past US free-trade agreement e-commerce provisions and suggests how to improve and update these provisions. The document then describes a host of additional e-commerce related issues that should be addressed in trade policy moving forward.","[Bieron, Brian] St Josephs Univ, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Ahmed, Usman] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Saint Joseph's University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Bieron, B (通讯作者)，St Josephs Univ, Philadelphia, PA USA.",,,,,,,,108,25,27,4,135,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This paper compares national approaches in policy and research on ethnic minority groups' access to natural areas in four Western-European countries: the United Kingdom (UK), The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark It shows that powerful linkages exist between immigration history, national research traditions and national policy regarding the attention given to this-issue, the topics of interest and the ethnicity categories used. The main forest and nature policy documents in The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark address issues of access to nature generally, while in the UK reducing discrimination of ethnic minority groups in access to nature is a formalised objective to be addressed by public bodies. Research in the UK focuses on evidences of under-representation, discrimination and barriers to access. In turn, German and Danish research emphasises different recreational uses of ethnic groups and is less oriented towards the implementation of targeted management objectives. The Netherlands occupy an intermediary position. We argue that international exchange of scientific results and cross-national studies could improve our understanding of cultural differences in recreational patterns, experiences, barriers, images of nature, and planning and design strategies.

A one-standard-deviation increase in the network employment rate reduces unemployment duration by about 8%; the effect is magnified if contacts recently searched for a job and if their current employer is spatially and technologically closer to the displaced worker; stronger ties and lower competition for information favor reemployment.

Hawaii presents an interesting case study as per capita seafood consumption is around three times the national average and 75% of seafood products are imported either from the U.S. mainland or foreign sources. For this study, questionnaires were administered both in-person and online. Conjoint analysis of four different fish species (tuna, salmon, tilapia and moi pacific threadfin), measured consumer willingness to pay for species-specific attributes including both hypothetical and actual attributes available on the market. The results indicate Hawaii consumers are willing to pay more for wild-caught fish than farm raised and mare for fresh than previously frozen fish with the degree of preference varying across species. This research can be used to better target markets and facilitate policy decisions pertaining to the fisheries, aquaculture and seafood industries.","[Davidson, Kelly] Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI USA; [Pan, Minling] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Hu, Wuyang; Poerwanto, Devie] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Kentucky,"Davidson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, 267 Brehm Hall, Martin, TN 38238 USA.",kdavid13@utm.edu,,,,,,,30,69,86,1,83,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

We suggest that one of the reasons for this is the dominance of a structural view of strategy and competition. Alternative views, such as the Austrian school or those that stress the Red Queen effect, emphasize the process-based nature of competition. In fast-changing environments, speed and reaction are central attributes, which render the traditional separation between planning and execution untenable. In these contexts, improvisation, the convergence of planning and execution, becomes a paradoxical form of real time foresight: organizations screen trends, spot opportunities, actively wait and/or act with speed to seize the moment.

At first sight, these centrally formulated plans seem to run counter to the current trend towards less central steering and more participation (and deliberation). However, closer scrutiny in two cases of green structure planning in the Netherlands and Flanders - Balij-Biesland forest and Park forest Ghent - reveals that we are facing a seemingly contradictory image of central steering on the one hand and openness to various actors and ideas on the other. This paper takes a closer look at this ambivalent situation using the two theoretical perspectives of deliberative governance and a discourse analysis. Although the green structure planning exercises did not intentionally have a deliberative character, we argue that such a perspective can and should be put on situations where new local coalitions challenge the centrally formulated plans, and try to start deliberations about their ideas In order to become more specific about the 'deliberative incompleteness' of the two Flemish and Dutch processes, a discourse-analytical focal point needs to be taken as well. Normatively, the paper first addresses the diversity of viewpoints and openness to preference shifts in the Dutch and the Flemish cases. It concludes that in the course of both processes, a high diversity of viewpoints surfaced, as well as a certain degree of openness to preference shifts. When the two processes are subjected to discourse analysis, it becomes evident however that the preference shifts occurring as a result of the input of a greater diversity of viewpoints did not bring about changes in some vital discursive practices that had been connected to the green structure planning and implementation processes. It was suggested, therefore, that combining the two theoretical perspectives gives a good insight into 'deliberative incompleteness' and highlights persistent institutional obstacles to come to more inclusive green structures in urbanized areas.

We interviewed managers of 190 randomly selected manufacturing plants in the UK and matched their responses with official business microdata. We find that climate friendly management practices are associated with lower energy intensity and higher productivity. Firms that adopt more such practices also conduct more climate friendly R&D which will sustain future growth in energy efficiency. Our findings are akin to the energy efficiency paradox and highlight the linkages between particular management practices and firm-level energy efficiency. We also find a strong empirical link between climate friendly management practices and organizational structure. Firms are more likely to adopt such practices if climate change issues are managed by the environmental or energy manager, and if this manager is close to the CEO. Adoption is less likely when the CEO is in charge of climate change issues. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Throughout the 20th century, significant developments can be mapped in most, if not all, of the major academic disciplines. Secondly, the move to transcend disciplinary specialisation, via inter-, multi-, and trans-disciplinary approaches is strengthening. Thirdly, at a higher order theoretical level, these developments are explicitly theorized in the discourses associated with postformal reasoning, integral theory and planetary consciousness. In spite of all these developments in other disciplines and knowledge fields, the institution of mass public education, with its underpinning industrial worldview, has been pretty static since its inception two hundred years ago. Finally, the paper identifies three minor, but significant, waves of evolutionary emergence in education over the last hundred years that if articulated and nurtured could strengthen the development of evolutionary pedagogies for the 21st century.

That cost extends to allowing major emitters to make guaranteed windfall profits from pollution permits. The emission trading scheme suffers numerous problems, but the issues raised in this article show that taxes can also be watered down and made ineffectual through concessions. Taxpayers will get no assets from the billions of dollars to be spent buying-off the coal generators or other polluters. The scheme seeks to stimulate private investors to create an additional 12 per cent in renewable electricity generation by 2020. A really serious emissions reducing alternative would need to create a nationalised electricity sector with 100 per cent renewable energy within a decade.

In this paper we carry out a reexamination of these findings using a unique database of disaggregated import prices both at the border and wholesale levels for Chile. Our results do not support previous conclusions. We find a complete and nondeclining ERPT in the long run at both pricing levels of Chilean imports. We extend previous evidence by showing that, in the short run, wholesale prices seem to be less sensitive to exchange rate variations.

In this diploma thesis, influence of organomineral fertilizers based on met and bone meal Omifos-A and Omifos-S+ on crop nutritional status (measured by N-tester), yield, grain quality and amount of mineral nitrogen in soil were studied. The experiment was based on comparison of Omifos with mineral fertilizers. It included following variants of fertilization: (1) un-fertilized control, (2) Omifos-A (10-30-0 + 5.5 Ca) compared to (3) Amofos (11-49-0) and (4) Omifos-S+ (4-6-0 + 20Ca + 7S) compared to (5) Gypsum (17.9Ca + 14S). In the latter variant, urea was applied to supply nitrogen. Fertilizers were applied in autumn with sowing, whereas variants (2), (3) and (6), (7) were also applied in spring time to compare autumn and spring fertilizing. The studied fertilizers reached higher levels of nutritional status, yield, volume weight, N-substances content and sedimentation value by Zeleny test than the unfertilized variant. Increases of values were statistically significant. Also amount of total mineral nitrogen in the soil in DC 31 and after harvest was significantly higher after application of fertilizers in comparison to the unfertilized variant. As emerged from the results of this experiment, organomineral fertilizers of Omifos series are completely comparable with mineral fertilizers. Differences between compared pairs of fertilizers and spring and autumn fertilizer aplication were non-significant.","[Dolezal, S.; Ryant, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Dolezal, S (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xdolez22@node.mendelu.cz,"Ryant, Pavel/I-9294-2018","Ryant, Pavel/0000-0002-4975-7405",,,,,6,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,21,32,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200002,0

In striving towards a competitive institution, a university or any higher education institutions must enhance teaching and training process related to the advancement of ICT and the innovations technologies. Hence, universities in developing countries as well as in developed countries attempt to move in parallel with the rapid advancements of ICT by increasing the adoption of ICT as tools to develop and improve the teaching and learning process and to become more flexible by reducing some difficulties in the education process. With these concerns, and the importance of ICT in Jordanian higher education sector, this study intends to focus on the adoption of ICT in Jordanian public universities among the teaching staff with the focus on the factors influencing the adoption of ICT in their teaching and learning process, and building a suitable model to the Jordanian case according to the results of factor analysis.

To manage current and future externalities, experts are interested in the evaluation of policies for selected sections or regions of concentrated horticulture production. To forecast the economic development of different sectors, a quantitative and dynamic simulation model was designed at the Centre of Business Management in Horticulture and Applied Research (ZBG). To reduce complexity, the model focuses on the vegetable production sector, using the most comprehensive collection of depersonalized accounting data from horticultural farms in Germany. In a first step, the most important factors affecting the business performance are identified from the data. These factors are internal such as the size of the farm, expenses, income and data from the balance sheet, as well as quantitative external influencing factors. Assumptions about their interdependencies are tested and quantified with statistical methods. The model includes labour, area under cultivation, technical equipment, investment and financing, product factors and services and production. The model works by varying external conditions and adjustment strategies in the sector. It calculates the annual results for each individual farm over a maximum period of ten years. At the end, all results of the individual farms can be summarized and analyzed. However, the depersonalized accounting data does not allow conclusions to be made on individual production methods, cultivated plants and external influencing factors, which makes it difficult to interpret different behaviours within a group. Finally the model reproduces managerial processes on an abstract level. Single interdependencies in the model can be estimated satisfactorily from a statistical point of view to suggest possible short-term adjustment strategies.","[Koelbel, C.; Lentz, W.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Biol Prod Syst, Ctr Business Management Hort & Appl Res ZBG, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Kölbel, C (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Biol Prod Syst, Ctr Business Management Hort & Appl Res ZBG, Hannover, Germany.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66050-68-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2012,930.0,,,,,,147,153,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BDT45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314782400019,0

J,"Messerlin, PA",,,,"Messerlin, Patrick A.",,,Climate and trade policies: from mutual destruction to mutual support,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"There is no doubt that trade and climate policies can be mutually destructive. But there are three strong reasons to suggest that they can also be mutually supportive: they have a common problem, common foes, and common friends. Mutual support would be much stronger if the world regimes for these two policies shared a few common principles. The climate community should feel at ease with the broad WTO principles of 'national treatment' and 'most-favoured nation', and rely on them in building its own treaty and institutions. The trade community should grasp the opportunity to benefit from the better disciplines on adjustment policies that it is hoped the climate community will design. These conclusions should put the many pending problems into a more positive perspective, and persuade negotiators to find pragmatic compromises, as was the case with the GATT. Using this perspective, the paper focuses on a few key issues, such as the definition of carbon border taxes and the reasons to ban carbon tariffs. Other cases of mutual support are examined.

From the point of methodology the statistical and other hard data, own field survey and remote sensing photographs study, methodological survey based on facebook conversation and email conversation and interviews with mayors and/or members of municipal council were used. Our preliminary results have shown that the Brno surroundings can be divided into few areas where the attractiveness of natural environment plays a big role. Concerning this in Brno the northern semicircle is more favourable, containing predominantly rugged landscape with a higher share of forest land and involving an attractive area linked to the Brno Dam and the Moravian Karst. The southern part, open to lowland and predominantly surrounded by agricultural land, followed next. The crucial factors for suburbanization advance are the transportational accessibility, attractiveness of landscape, presence of natural barriers and last but not least the willingness of municipal mayors to support the suburban development.","[Pakozdiova, M.; Krenovska, I; Zitnakova, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Pákozdiová, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",1Mery1@seznam.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,662,671,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200077,0

The player who posts the larger bid buys one share from his opponent for this price. Any integer bids are admissible. The model is reduced to a zero-sum game with lack of information on one side.

We estimate the budget impact (BI) on the Swiss mandatory health insurance associated with substituting iron sucrose (standard) with ferric carboxymaltose (new treatment) using real-life data. Resource use was based on recent primary data (Polyquest Prescriber Analysis, Anemia Patient Record Study in Switzerland). Personnel costs were estimated using the Swiss Tarmed fee-for-service reimbursement system. Drug costs and costs of materials used were based on official tariffs (Spezialitatenliste, MiGeL). Actual IMS sales data of both products were used to verify the BI model (1 CHF a parts per thousand 1 USD, Jan 2013). Ferric carboxymaltose was associated with cost savings of 30-44 % per patient per treatment cycle compared to iron sucrose. Costs per 200/500/1,000 mg total dosage treatment cycle were CHF 101/210/420 for ferric carboxymaltose and CHF 144/375/721 for iron sucrose. This results in cost savings of CHF 22-31 million across all indications in 2009. Savings were driven by personnel cost reductions (application time and number of applications). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these cost savings, even for the higher application costs of ferric carboxymaltose, with minimum savings of CHF 17 million per year. Treating iron deficiency involves substantial costs to the Swiss MHI which may be reduced by substituting iron sucrose with ferric carboxymaltose. The use of real-life data raises methodological questions about the fundamental compatibility of this data with the conceptual framework of BI analysis.","[Brock, Elisabeth; Schneider, Heinz] HealthEcon AG, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; [Braunhofer, Peter] Vifor Int AG, Glattbrugg, Switzerland; [Troxler, Josef] Vifor Pharma AG, Villars Sur Glane, Switzerland",Vifor Pharma; Vifor Pharma,"Brock, E (通讯作者)，HealthEcon AG, Steinentorstr 19, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",ebrock@healthecon.com,,,,,,,18,9,11,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Pursuant to Article 3.2, judicial activism at the World Trade Organization (WTO) should be identified not only by behavioural patterns but also by the results the DSB produced. The development of the electronic commerce provides an interesting case study on WTO's judicial decision-making. Should DSB be permitted to 'modernize' agreements to cope with the 'new' services? After methodologically analysing all e-commerce cases under the WTO, this article concludes that activism was extreme in US-Gambling because the panel and Appellate Body invented limitations on the sovereign rights of members to regulate, which has no foundation in the treaty text and no general basis in international law. Different from the 'activist ruling' in US-Gambling, the Appellate Body in China-Audiovisual Services has demonstrated some activism in its interpretation of the 'object and purpose' of the GATS. Similarly, the panel of China-Payment Card has shown certain activism in its interpretation of provisions on the objective of progressive liberalization contained in the Preamble to the GATS.","[Peng, Shin-yi] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Peng, SY (通讯作者)，NCC, Taipei, Taiwan.",sypeng@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,68,2,2,0,13,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

It homes in on fair trade as an ethical market, politically progressive cause and, crucially, form of participation where citizens can engage in the formation of an alternative future and the broader issue of food security. A three-dimensional analysis of agencies and uses of digital structures and content is informed by a case study approach, as well as interviews with fair trade activists, and ethically consuming citizens in the British metropolis. Through this, the argument which primarily rises distinguishes between the dimensions of durability (in terms of time and duration) and sustainability (in terms of time, duration and environmental concerns) of engagement in fair trade as a form of participation. Ethical consumption, then, is part of a durable market which has developed despite general market fluctuation, but is still very much bound in traditional physical economic spaces; in other words, ethical consumption has been integrated in the business as usual paradigm. Additionally, ICTs have not challenged the way in which information about ethical consumption is communicated or the spaces in which it is conducted. ICTs have been employed by fair trade activists, but they have not contributed to the development of fair trade as a political or economic project. Over a period of over five decades since the inception of the cause, their use has not significantly altered the way in which citizens engage with fair trade in the alternative or mainstream marketplace.

Despite these properties, the field of future studies is slow to adopt FCM and to apply the increasingly solid theoretical foundations and rigorous practices for FCM applications that are evolving in other fields. This paper therefore discusses theoretical and practical aspects of constructing and applying FCMs within the context of future studies: based on an extensive literature review and the authors' experience with FCM projects, it provides an introduction of fundamental concepts of FCM modelling, a step-wise description and discussion of practical methods and their pitfalls, and an overview over future research directions for FCM in future studies.

Based on a fairly general model, a condition for a precautionary policy is discussed. By applying the framework to a common-property resource problem with a linear production technology, we illustrate how the qualitative as well as quantitative nature of equilibrium is altered due to the possibility of regime shifts. In particular, when the risk is endogenously affected by the players' behavior, potential regime shifts can facilitate the precautionary management of resources as long as the resource stock is in good shape. As the stock of resource becomes scarce, however, the precautionary effect vanishes and more aggressive resource exploitation emerges. The impacts of irreversibility on the equilibrium behavior are highlighted. It is also shown that there can exist a resource-depletion trap in which a regime shift, once it happens, triggers a continuous decline of resource stock no matter which regime materializes in the subsequent periods.

The international dimension of animal welfare implicates two ongoing debates in international trade law: what the relationship should be between WTO law and general international law, and the extent to which 'public morals' under Article XX(a) of GATT can be locally defined or need to be internationally shared.

The sustainable management of these forests has become a question over the years. We aimed to find answers how different values and objectives form management motives and influence decision making in forest management by these new forest owners. Principal-component and correlation analysis were applied to a collected dataset from forest owners in 2011 containing 254 responses. By the collection of datasets these forest owners were divided also by assessment methods. The results showed that randomly selected forest owners may have some different motives in their approaches to forests and forest management than forest owner organisation members, but mainly their motives overlap. The correlation analysis between individual forest owners revealed also that forest owners are very different in how they arrive to a particular derision in management. In addition, perceived values and long-term objectives are one of the fundamental cornerstones for these decisions. Forest policy often neglects the diversity of landowners and therefore policy implementation is often not successful. More flexibility in policies could be an answer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This dispute is merely example of a number of disputes where the US government had to exhaust the whole process for proper implementation of the WTO rulings under its domestic legal system. The US approach is starkly contrasted with the position taken by the European Union that categorically terminates zeroing practices pursuant to the WTO rulings. While the WTO system indeed recognizes individual Member's peculiar regulatory systems and policies during implementation phases, the current situation in which WTO Members must individually resort to the dispute settlement system in order to rectify the US zeroing practices raises a serious concern regarding the legitimacy and integrity of the WTO dispute settlement system. Maybe it is time for WTO Members to agree on better implementation mechanisms before more Members try to develop overly burdensome and complicated regulatory processes for compliance.","[Ahn, Dukgeun; Messerlin, Patrick] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Ahn, D (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea.",dahn@snu.ac.kr; patrick.messerlin@free.fr,,,,,,,19,10,11,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2014,13.0,2,,,,,267,279,,10.1017/S1474745614000020,0.0,,,13,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AG5GA,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335446300005,0

The AB's reasoning extends earlier GATT jurisprudence into the TBT, applying competition-oriented analysis to the question of product definition, while reserving consideration of regulatory purpose to the comparison of treatment. We consider this emphasis from the perspectives of legal and economic indeterminacy, which we find run in parallel to each other. In the particular questions of the appeal, the AB's decisions are sensible from both perspectives, but ultimately do not add significantly to determinacy. We find it impossible to ignore regulatory purpose in discrimination cases, and we provide a novel economic model for analysing regulatory utility in this respect. In our view, there is not much economic difference in analysing regulatory purpose separately from more observable market considerations, but this sequencing does add political logic, analytical focus and formal transparency, all of which may enhance the legitimacy of WTO dispute settlement rulings, although ideally, further specification from the WTO Membership regarding the methodological content of the national treatment discipline would be preferred.","[Broude, Tomer] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Levy, Philip I.] Chicago Council Global Affairs, Chicago, IL USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Broude, T (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",tomerbroude@gmail.com; plevy@thechicagocouncil.org,,,,,,,19,14,14,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2014,13.0,2,,,,,357,392,,10.1017/S1474745614000044,0.0,,,36,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AG5GA,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335446300009,0

J,"Neven, D; Sykes, A",,,,"Neven, Damien; Sykes, Alan",,,United States - Measures Affecting Trade in Large Civil Aircraft (Second Complaint): some comments,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,,SUBSIDIES,"This paper provides limited comments on portions of the Appellate Body (AB) judgment. With respect to the existence of a subsidy under contracts with NASA and DOD, we find the discussion of whether Boeing has received a financial contribution to be a distraction from the core issue - whether the mix of monetary compensation, access to government personnel and facilities, and IP rights 'overcompensated' Boeing for the services it rendered (or whether the government paid more for those services than they were worth to the government). The panel's analysis of this core issue, which focused on whether Boeing was the principal beneficiary of the contracts, is flawed, but the alternative approach of the AB is equally flawed. The analogy between an R&D joint venture and equity infusion is dubious, and the existence of a benefit simply does not turn on how one dimension of the contract (the allocation of the resulting intellectual property rights (IP)) is specified. We also argue that even a contract that confers a 'benefit' (or economic rent) on Boeing could still be an efficient arrangement for the allocation of cost and prospective revenues between the two partners. With respect to adverse effects, we argue that the panel and AB failed to develop an adequate counterfactual with respect to product developments; that is, it is not implausible that if Boeing had not received a subsidy and would accordingly have developed the 787 later, Airbus would also have delayed the development of the A350. To determine the existence of adverse effects, the panel and AB should have considered the profit (or sales) of Airbus relative to what would have happened in this counterfactual world. Finally, we observe that the analysis of lost sales and 'price suppression' fails to consider the specific features of competition in the aircraft industry. Unlike what happens in the market with posted prices, when contracts are individually negotiated, whether the outcome of competition is affected by a subsidy depends on the relative cost position of the bidders. When Boeing is the lowest cost bidder, the only effect of the subsidy is to increase its rent, with no effect on sales or prices for Airbus.","[Neven, Damien] GVA, Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland; [Sykes, Alan] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Neven, D (通讯作者)，GVA, Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.",damien.neven@graduateinstitute.ch; alan.sykes@nyu.edu,,,,,,,8,6,6,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2014,13.0,2,,,,,281,298,,10.1017/S1474745614000081,0.0,,,18,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AG5GA,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335446300006,0

According to some theorists (e.g. Arrow et al., 2012), under certain conditions a country with a positive level of GS should experience non-declining future utility, given the assumption of unlimited substitutability among all forms of capital (sometimes called weak sustainability). This paper reports the first very long-run tests of GS (also called comprehensive investment or adjusted net savings) as a forward-looking indicator of future well-being. We assemble data for British capital back to 1765, and construct several net investment measures which are used as indicators of two alternative measures of future well-being: consumption per capita and real wages. An allowance for a value of time due to exogenous technological progress is included in some GS measures, and we demonstrate the importance of this measure and the choice of discount rate over the very long-run. On the whole, our results do not reject the postulated relationship between GS and future well-being, and show GS can be a forward looking indicator of future well-being for periods of up to 100 years.

Constructive storytelling was chosen as an educational practice that can bring about change, and was used as a tool for the transfer of alternative worldviews because it is indirect, flexible and inexpensive. The main beneficiaries of the project were the students of the University of Novi Sad and teachers and children of Novi Sad primary schools. The project utilised local knowledge and languages to foster peace and partnership-oriented individual and social narratives through the process of alternative story writing and revision of traditional Serbian and European tales.

Rapid and large-scale demands from outsiders are challenging patterns of gradual, endogenous change toward formalization. Little attention has focused on the gender dimensions of this transformation. However this contribution, based on a 2008-09 study of land tenure in Uganda, analyzes how different definitions of land ownership - including household reports, existence of ownership documents, and rights over the land - provide very different indications of the gendered patterns of land ownership and rights. While many households report husbands and wives as joint owners of the land, women are less likely to be listed on ownership documents, and have fewer rights. A simplistic focus on title to land misses much of the reality regarding land tenure and could have an adverse impact on women's land rights.","[Doss, Cheryl] Yale Univ, Int Affairs Council, MacMillan Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Meinzen-Dick, Ruth] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bomuhangi, Allan] Makerere Univ, Kampala, Uganda",Yale University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Makerere University,"Doss, C (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Int Affairs Council, MacMillan Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",Cheryl.Doss@yale.edu; R.Meinzen-Dick@cgiar.org; abomuhangi@gmail.com,,"Meinzen-Dick, Ruth/0000-0003-4782-3074; Doss, Cheryl/0000-0001-8292-3295",,,,,50,114,126,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Unemployed individuals from rural area have a 37.7% lower exit to a job hazard compared with individuals from urban area, the reference category. The motivation behind choosing this topic was to understand the characteristics of rural registered unemployment spells, to estimate the impact of factors influencing unemployment spells and exit destinations and to identify vulnerable groups regarding reemployment on the labor market. The results can be useful for policy makers, in order to elaborate coherent measures for improving the rural employability and chances of vulnerable individuals. The empirical analysis is based on a large micro-dataset with 1224901 rural unemployment spells registered at the National Agency of Employment Romania during January 1st 2008 - December 31st 2010 and all ongoing spells until April 30th 2011.

Despite the fact that Oman is a predominantly Muslim country, the assumption that this will equate to a significant uptake in Islamic products and services is challenged as factors such as brand recognition and insufficient product knowledge among the population may hinder market penetration. In addition the study provides some recommendations for the success of the Islamic finance development in Oman where financial institutions wishing to offer Shariah compliant services should also not neglect the importance of competing with conventional banks in terms of the quality of service offered in addition to the uniqueness of their products. The availability of a pool of indigenous labor with industry relevant knowledge shall be a vital factor in the sustainable growth and development of the sector in the Sultanate. Finally the paper concludes by highlighting the essential role of educational institutions in providing such a sustainable workforce for Islamic financial institutions through producing graduates with industry relevant knowledge and, in the more immediate term, the provision of training for conventional banking professionals that may make up the current shortfall of qualified labor.

Prior to that period the Nigerian economy was almost a command one with wide range of government control. Indeed, the introduction of SAP was said to be a final solution to the economic crisis faced by the Country. Unfortunately, SAP was introduced yet, the economy became more crunched. During the General Abach's regime (1993-1998), SAP was suspended out rightly. When General Abdulsalami Abubakar (1998-1999) took over, he continued pursuing the privatization programme which is a synonym of deregulation of the economy with the promulgation of another privatization decree. The civilian government led by President Obasanjo which took over from 1999 made deregulation the core with vigour. It is basked on this development that this paper intends to unravel the theoretical paradigm under which the deregulation of Nigerian economy could be explained.

In order to support this objective we developed a qualitative study based on several research methods which include: websites analysis, documents review like promotional materials, personal observations and official statistics analysis. The paper starts with a presentation of the Romanian hotel industry focusing on the main characteristics of different types of hotel units. The Romanian hotel industry grew steadily in the last ten years, offering now a wide range of accommodations characterized by diversity, accessibility and affordability. Further, we focus on literature review, and because the existing hospitality literature has limited number of papers that investigated the perceptions of hotel website users on the importance of specific features of hotel websites, we create a framework with attributes for analysing the hotel websites. Next, we will present the result of a research we carried out in Romania on the implementation of booking engines on hotel's websites. Based on the results of this research we will overview the online booking engines used by hotels in Romania and we will highlight the main characteristics and features of these systems.

A Markov model was developed to predict the lifetime cost and outcomes [exacerbations rates, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY)] in patients treated with roflumilast, which showed a reduction in the exacerbation rates and lung function improvement in a pooled analysis from two clinical trials, M2-124 and M2-125. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties on the cost-effectiveness. The addition of roflumilast to concomitant LABA reduced the number of exacerbations from 15.6 to 12.7 [2.9 (95 % CI 0.88-4.92) exacerbations avoided] and increased QALYs from 5.45 to 5.61 [0.16 (95 % CI 0.02-0.31) QALYs gained], at an incremental cost of A 3,197 pound (95 % CI A 2,135-A pound 4,253) pound. Cost in LABA alone and LABA + roflumilast were A 16,161 pound and A 19,358 pound respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in the base case were A 19,505 pound (95 % CI A 364-A pound 38,646) pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained and 18,219 (95 % CI A 12,697-A pound 49,135) pound per life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses suggest that among the main determinants of cost-effectiveness are the reduction of exacerbations and the case fatality rate due to hospital-treated exacerbations. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that the probability of roflumilast being cost-effective is 82 % at willingness-to-pay A 30,000 pound per QALY. The addition of roflumilast to LABA in the treatment of patients with severe-to-very severe COPD reduces the rate of exacerbations and can be cost-effective in the UK setting.","[Samyshkin, Yevgeniy] IMS Hlth, London N1 9JY, England; [Kotchie, Robert W.] IMS Hlth, Parsippany, NJ 07054 USA; [Moerk, Ann-Christin] Takeda Pharmaceut Int GmbH, CH-8152 Zurich, Switzerland; [Briggs, Andrew H.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland; [Briggs, Andrew H.] Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England; [Bateman, Eric D.] Univ Cape Town, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Med, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Glasgow; University of Cape Town,"Samyshkin, Y (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth, 210 Pentonville Rd, London N1 9JY, England.",ysamyshkin@uk.imshealth.com; rkotchie@imshealth.com; Ann-Christin.Moerk@takeda.com; Andrew.Briggs@glasgow.ac.uk; Eric.Bateman@uct.ac.za,"Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020; Samyshkin, Yevgeniy/ABD-5152-2021","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Samyshkin, Yevgeniy/0000-0003-3561-5585",,,,,39,19,20,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The empirical research was employed for a sample of companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE), over the period 2007-2011, being estimated multivariate regression models for panel data, unbalanced, with fixed effects. The value of the companies was measured out by the instrumentality of Tobin's Q ratio, however adjusted with the purpose of taking into account the industry membership diversity of the selected sample. We considered distinctly the ownership of the first, the second, and the third largest shareholder, as well the sum of holdings of the two largest shareholders and the sum of holdings of the three largest shareholders. Therefore, the results sustain a lack of influence on firm value exhibited by the first largest shareholder, while the second largest shareholder positively influences firm value. By considering the ownership of the third largest shareholder we identified a positive influence, but down to a level of holdings of 13.08 percent, thereupon the influence becomes negative. Thereby, beyond the identified threshold we could perceive the reduction of the third largest shareholder' concern regarding the process of directors' monitoring, thus following the own aims' achievement. Further, from the ownership concentration perspective only the sum of holdings of the three largest shareholders positively influences firm value. However, there was not identified any statistically significant relationship between the sum of holdings of the two largest shareholders and firm value. Accordingly, the results are influenced by the context of an underdeveloped Romanian capital market within the first largest shareholder ownership discourages the occurrence of another investors holding significant stakes.

However, social science is much slower to pick up this approach, and with a few exceptions, governance structures are analysed out of the spatial contexts, despite spatial fit issues being recognised as central to the study of environmental institutions. Another problem arising from the limited use/low awareness of spatial analysis tools is that studies of social-ecological systems are rarely done consistently for a large area; instead they tend to rely on case studies that are often chosen for their idiosyncrasies. As a result, our knowledge of social-ecological systems is somewhat distorted. This study provides an account of quantitative and qualitative spatially-explicit analyses of a resource governance system, and in doing so offers a methodology for integrating biophysical and institutional dimensions of a social-ecological system in the evaluation of its adaptability. The focus is on forest systems, the scale is a nation (Belarus) and the unit of analysis is a square kilometre forest patch. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines how the tax code and government education policies affect graduate enrollment and persistence rates along with the ways in which students fund their graduate education. Our empirical methodology is based on exogenous variations in the availability of an income tax exemption for employer-provided tuition assistance for graduate courses. We find that graduate attendance among full-time workers age 24-30 is higher when the tax exemption is available, mostly due to higher persistence in public universities and vocational course work. The use of employer aid for individuals enrolled in full-time and public part-time graduate programs also increases. We present some evidence that universities may adjust tuition to capture part of the incidence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking this feature into account, we seek to identify factors that are associated with HIV/AIDS through a hierarchical finite mixture model. A mixture of normal components is applied to adult HIV/AIDS diagnosis-related group data (DRG) from 2008. The model accounts for the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, as well the inherent correlation of patients clustered within hospitals. In the present research, a normal mixture distribution was fitted to the logarithm of LOS and it was found that a model with two-components had the best fit, resulting in two subgroups of LOS: a short-stay subgroup and a long-stay subgroup. Associated risk factors for both groups were identified as well as some statistical differences in the hospitals. Our findings provide important information for policy makers in terms of discharge planning and the efficient management of LOS. The presence of atypical hospitals also suggests that hospitals should not be viewed or treated as homogenous bodies.","[Dias, Sara Simoes] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias Med, Dept Univ Saude Publ, P-1169056 Lisbon, Portugal; [Dias, Sara Simoes; Martins, Rosario O.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Super Estat & Gestao Informacao, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal; [Andreozzi, Valeska] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Estat & Aplicacoes, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Martins, Rosario O.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Higiene & Med Trop, P-1349008 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Institute of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine - UNL,"Dias, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias Med, Dept Univ Saude Publ, Campo Martires Patria, P-1169056 Lisbon, Portugal.",sara.dias@fcm.unl.pt,"; Dias, Sara/I-9965-2018","Oliveira Martins, Maria do Rosario/0000-0002-7941-0285; Dias, Sara/0000-0001-6782-7481; Andreozzi, Valeska/0000-0001-6478-8456",,,,,42,6,7,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

First, as a growing number of urban dwellers become wealthier, their desire for greater forest recreational opportunities will increase, resulting in higher values being placed on forest ecosystem services. Second, urban citizens will demand a significant shift in forest management away from high-ecological-impact operations towards environmentally benign practices, resulting in higher costs of timber production and wood delivery. Third, while the forest sector's output of commodity products could decline, wood fibre may find new uses to satisfy human needs for improved standards of living. These developments call for a better understanding of the role of forests in providing multiple streams of benefits simultaneously to different segments of society. Maslow's hierarchy of needs serves as a useful framework for examining the factors underlying stratified human needs with respect to forests. Correspondingly, a stratified framework may be useful for examining diverse forest management objectives, along with a consideration of the stages of economic development.

This study analyzes the existence of a flight-to-quality effect from stocks to long-term government bonds in five Asia-Pacific countries by modeling a dependency structure from a copula-based perspective. The authors employ various copula functions to examine the degrees of dependence on symmetric and asymmetric structures in these countries. They find a negative relationship between stock and bond returns, that there is a flight to quality in the Asia-Pacific region, and that it intensified during the financial crisis period, indicating that investors considered government bonds to be safer financial instruments than stocks during this period. Furthermore, the authors show that the level of economic freedom in a country affects the tendency toward flight to quality.","[Chang, Chiu-Lan] Providence Univ, Dept Int Business, Taichung, Taiwan; [Hsueh, Paul L.] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",Providence University - Taiwan; National Chung Cheng University,"Chang, CL (通讯作者)，Providence Univ, Dept Int Business, Taichung, Taiwan.",clchang@pu.edu.tw; finlyh@ccu.edu.tw,"Chang, Chiu-Lan/ABG-3330-2020","Chang, Chiu-Lan/0000-0002-0000-4998",,,,,46,9,9,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

One possible approach is the adjustment of class sizes based on observed teacher effectiveness. Conceptually, this relationship may be positive or negative. On one hand, performance-maximizing principals may place more students in the classrooms of more effective teachers. But because administrators may have compensation constraints, it is also plausible that they may reward more effective teachers with fewer students in the classroom. This paper examines whether principals reward effective teachers by decreasing their class size or whether they increase the size of classes of more effective teachers as a means of enhancing the school outcome. Results overall indicate that more effective teachers do have larger classes. This result holds implications for prior policy studies of class size as well as for education policy more generally.

An analysis through the theory of access,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Small-scale logging; Illegal logging; Rural livelihoods; Forest management; Congo Basin,FOREST MANAGEMENT; LIVELIHOODS; DECADE,"During the last decade, in Central Africa, timber volume of the artisanal chainsaw milling (CSM) sector, mainly for domestic markets, has exceeded that processed by the export-oriented industrial sector. However, due to lack of legal alternatives, CSM is largely an informal activity. We rely on the theory of access to understand the mechanisms of access to timber resources, and to the income derived from their use, implemented by local actors to participate in the growth of this informal sector. Among eight common access mechanisms, two have played a particularly important role in the development of CSM for the benefit of rural economies. On the one hand, the growth of CSM was built on the customary tenure system, by valuing traditional knowledge and abiding by the traditional rules of access to trees. On the other hand, domestic timber markets remained accessible to independent operators in Cameroon, in Central African Republic and in Gabon, but the situation is less true in Republic of Congo and in Democratic Republic of Congo. Even if the financial impacts of CSM are substantial for rural economies in Central Africa, the application of the theory of access cannot conclude that this activity supports a decentralized, democratic and sustainable management of timber resources. Two elements lack in this analysis, the accountability of resource managers and the ecological sustainability of the harvest. These issues could be better addressed through a fine-tuned formalization of the CSM sector that would not compromise its present positive impact on rural people's livelihoods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The study was carried out among 400 respondents from Barcelona who were representative of the Spanish population in terms of age, sex, and level of education. The DC design included 50 pairs of health states in five blocks. Participants were forced to choose between two EQ-5D-5L states (A and B). Two extra questions concerned whether A and B were considered worse than dead. Each participant performed ten choice exercises. In addition, values were collected using lead-time trade-off (lead-time TTO), for which 100 states in ten blocks were selected. Each participant performed five lead-time TTO exercises. These consisted of DC models offering the health state 'dead' as one of the choices-for which all participants' responses were used (DCdead)-and a model that included only the responses of participants who chose at least one state as worse than dead (WTD) (DCWTD). The study also estimated DC models rescaled with lead-time TTO data and a lead-time TTO linear model. The DCdead and DCWTD models produced relatively similar results, although the coefficients in the DCdead model were slightly lower. The DC model rescaled with lead-time TTO data produced higher utility decrements. Lead-time TTO produced the highest utility decrements.

An agent-based model for the introduction of new drugs in markets,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Technological diffusion; Small world networks; Ising model; Complex economy; Pharmaceutical market; Agent based model,,"The existence of imitative behavior among consumers is a well-known phenomenon in the field of Economics. This behavior is especially common in markets determined by a high degree of innovation, asymmetric information and/or price-inelastic demand, features that exist in the pharmaceutical market. This paper presents evidence of the existence of imitative behavior among primary care physicians in Galicia (Spain) when choosing treatments for their patients. From this and other evidence, we propose a dynamic model for determining the entry of new drugs into the market. To do this, we introduce the structure of the organization of primary health care centers and the presence of groups of doctors who are specially interrelated, as well as the existence of commercial pressure on doctors. For modeling purposes, physicians are treated as spins connected in an exponentially distributed complex network of the Watts-Strogatz type. The proposed model provides an explanation for the differences observed in the patterns of the introduction of technological innovations in different regions. The main cause of these differences is the different structure of relationships among consumers, where the existence of small groups that show a higher degree of coordination over the average is particularly influential. The evidence presented, together with the proposed model, might be useful for the design of optimal strategies for the introduction of new drugs, as well as for planning policies to manage pharmaceutical expenditure.","[Pombo-Romero, Julio; Ricoy, Carlos J.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Varela, Luis M.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fis Mat Condensada, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Pombo-Romero, J (通讯作者)，C Corredoira Muinos 24, Santiago De Compostela 15706, A Coruna, Spain.",juliopombo@hotmail.com,"Varela, Luis M./L-6942-2014","Varela, Luis M./0000-0002-0569-0042; Pombo, Julio/0000-0002-5077-8975",,,,,36,11,14,1,65,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This paper assesses the association between organisational factors of general practices and production and efficiency. We assume that production and efficiency can be modelled using a behavioural production function. We apply the Battese and Coelli (Empir Econ 20:325-332, 1995) estimator to accomplish a decomposition of exogenous variables to determine the production frontier and variables determining the individual GPs distance to this frontier. Two different measures of practice outputs (number of office visits and total production) were applied and the results compared. The results indicate that nurses do not substitute GPs in the production. The production function exhibited constant returns to scale. The mean level of efficiency was between 0.79 and 0.84, and list size was the most important determinant of variation in efficiency levels. Nurses are currently undertaking other tasks than GPs, and larger practices do not lead to increased production per GP. However, a relative increase in list size increased the efficiency. This indicates that organisational changes aiming to increase capacity in general practice should be carefully designed and tested.","[Olsen, Kim Rose; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte; Sorensen, Torben Hojmark] Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Olsen, Kim Rose; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte; Kristensen, Troels] Univ So Denmark, Res Unit Hlth Econ, Odense, Denmark; [Olsen, Kim Rose; Kristensen, Troels] Univ So Denmark, Res Unit Gen Practice, Odense, Denmark; [Vedsted, Peter] Aarhus Univ, Res Unit Gen Practice, Aarhus, Denmark; [Street, Andrew] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; Aarhus University; University of York - UK,"Olsen, KR (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, Copenhagen, Denmark.",krolsen@health.sdu.dk,"Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/A-3161-2011; Olsen, Kim Rose/AAU-5526-2020; Olsen, Kim Rose/ABA-9678-2021; Vedsted, Peter/C-2583-2008","Olsen, Kim Rose/0000-0002-0473-4736; Vedsted, Peter/0000-0003-2113-5599; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/0000-0003-1137-2304; Street, Andrew David/0000-0002-2540-0364; Kristensen, Troels/0000-0001-5232-6895",,,,,44,15,19,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Besides the common sum-of-square intraday realized volatility, we also advocate two power variation realized volatilities to overcome the possible abrupt jumps during the credit crisis with various frequencies. The empirical forecast evaluations consistently show that the realized volatility models are outperformed the interday data models for different frequency data.

The study is focused on the effect of strigolactone on shoot branching of pea (Pisum sativum L.) in relation with polar auxin transport, which has an essential role in apical dominance. After decapitation of the dominant apex lateral buds are released from growth inhibition and their outgrowth and elongation is initiated. Basipetal polar auxin transport system is realized by the downward movement of auxin from apical meristems towards the root system and strigolactone is transported acropetally. The polar auxin flow starts to be established in axillary buds, which is mediated by auxin efflux carriers - PIN1 proteins localized on the basal end of cells. Exogenous application of GR24 - synthetic analogue of strigolactone on the second or third bud of 7 day-plants led to partial growth inhibition of treated bud which is apparently associated with gene expression changes. Expression profiles of PIN1 and DRM1 genes and immunocytolocalizations of PIN1 proteins are studied, to reveal and understand how strigolactone interacts with polar auxin transport on transcriptional and translational levels. The gene expression and polarization of PIN1 proteins after short-time and long-time influence of strigolactone on the axillary bud was followed.","[Dankova, N.; Reinoehl, V] Mendel Univ Brno, CEITEC Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Danková, N (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, CEITEC Cent European Inst Technol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",NellaDankova@email.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,639,643,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800110,0

From 2002 to 2010, the IRBM finalised 4,486,946 audit cases and collected RM11,050.3 million of additional taxes and penalties (IRBM, 2002-2010). However, the public often conveys frustrations when dealing with the IRBM auditors. Tax agents perceive that IRBM auditors have the intention or aim of finding fault in order to impose penalties for incorrect returns or understated income, were not happy with taxpayers' explanations, abused their power by issuing additional tax assessments, and closed cases without being able to explain their reasons to taxpayers (Choong and Lai, 2009; Choong et al., 2012). However, there is no published study on IRBM auditors in conducting audit programs and communicating with the public. This study explores the IRBM auditors' enforcement regulatory styles. It adopts grounded theory methodology, which analyses tax auditors' actual beliefs and experiences in resolving audit settlement disputes. Consistent with enforcement regulatory theory, the analysis of data shows that tax auditors apply different enforcement regulatory styles-firm, explain and educate, bargaining and threatening. This study also has identified 'avoiding' as tax auditors' enforcement regulatory style when dealing with the public.

Transport by ship and availability of appropriate quay facilities are of major importance to increase the harvesting and use of wood, and to secure an efficient and flexible transportation system. An optimisation model is developed that finds the most efficient way to transport logs from supply to demand points and the associated quay locations by minimising total system costs. The influence of co-operation with other industries regarding investment and operation of quay structures is also investigated. We apply the model to a case including 258 municipalities along the Norwegian coast. We present both the model and results of the case study under different scenarios. The analysis shows that the major cost driver is truck transport, and that road quality is paramount, both for the total costs and for optimal location of quay facilities. The results of the scenario analysis also illustrate the trade-off between quay investment costs, number of quays, and truck transport. The model will be a key tool for both quay facility location planning and transportation planning in the Norwegian coastal forestry industry. The model is flexible and robust and can easily be adapted to new regulations and parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Purposive and Multi-stage random sampling techniques were used to select 285 rice farmers from three of the six states of northeastern Nigeria in a ratio proportional to the size of the population of farmers who cultivate rice on sole basis. However, only 270 were used for analyses. The remaining 15 were rejected due to inconsistencies in the responses. Descriptive statistics, stochastic frontier production and cost functions and two-limit tobit regression were used as analytical tools. The results of the study revealed that the farmers obtained mean yield of 2633.5 kilogram per hactare, used a seed rate of 60 kilogram per hactare and realised an average net farmers' income which were (sic)17, 025.61 per hectare Furthermore, while the average numbers of years spent in school by the farmers were about 8 years, the average number of extension visits was approximately 8 during the production season. Stochastic frontier production and cost functions which were used measure the production efficiency of the sampled farmers. The results of the stochastic frontier production and cost functions indicated that technical efficiencies of the farmers ranged from 0.11 (11%) to 0.99 (99%) with the mean technical efficiency of 0.691. The allocative efficiencies of the farmers ranged from 0.084 (8.4%) to 0.899 (89.9%) with a mean value of 0.661 (66.1%). The mean economic efficiency was 0.376 (37.6%) suggesting substantial inefficiencies among the farmers. Two-limit tobit regression was used to identify the determinants of production efficiency. The two-limit tobit regression revealed that family size, education, extension contact, access to credit and system of land ownership were significant (P < 0.05); hence they weredeter minants of production efficiency. The study concluded that there is substantial levels of production inefficiencies among the sampled rice farmers. This study concluded that there is substantial difference in the levels of production inefficiencies among the sampled rice farmers. Government support in terms of revitalization and priority funding of the extension delivery activities of the States' Agricultural Development (ADPs) programs is required. Cross sectional data was employed in this research. Future research should make use of panel data in order to explore the trend of efficiency levels. This is crucial for increased productivity in the rice production in particular and food security in general.","[Shehu, Jacob Fintan] Amer Univ Nigeria, Yola, Nigeria",American University of Nigeria,,jacob.shehu@aun.edu.ng,"SHEHU, JACOB FINTAN/HLX-3219-2023",,,,,,38,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,485,501,,,,,,17,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600046,0

Their findings suggest that oil price dynamics changed significantly in the sample period and the relationship between oil prices and exchange rates became more obvious after the 2008 financial crisis.","[Turhan, Ibrahim] Istanbul Stock Exchange, Ankara, Turkey; [Hacihasanoglu, Erk] Istanbul Stock Exchange, Res Dept, Ankara, Turkey; [Soytas, Ugur] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Business Adm, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey",Borsa Istanbul; Borsa Istanbul; Middle East Technical University,"Turhan, I (通讯作者)，Istanbul Stock Exchange, Ankara, Turkey.",ibrahim.turhan@imkb.gov.tr; erk.hacihasanoglu@imkb.gov.tr; soytas@metu.edu.tr,"Soytas, Ugur/AAU-4974-2021; Turhan, İbrahim M./AAA-1895-2021; Soytas, Ugur/A-5498-2010","Soytas, Ugur/0000-0002-6143-289X; Turhan, İbrahim M./0000-0002-8689-1662; Soytas, Ugur/0000-0002-6143-289X",,,,,22,96,99,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Within the light of the mentioned decision-making process, the analysis of existing tourism products was taken into account. Consequently, we realized a questionnaire research among the population, which was concerned on their contentment with the tourism promotion in the region. The last step of the research consisted in the application of Delphi method, where the opinions of professionals engaged in tourism in the area of interest were recognized. This research was preceded by a survey concentrated on natural, cultural and historical heritage located in the region. By using the results of questionnaire we came to the design of an educational trail called Po Uhrovskom okoli that can support a development of tourism in the target region. At the end we highlighted the benefits of an education trail as a tourism product and synergic effects, which can arise due to its direct application in the landscape.","[Zoncova, M.; Civan, M.; Svorad, A.; Dubcova, A.] Constantine Philosopher Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Geog & Reg Dev, Nitra 94974, Slovakia",Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra,"Zoncová, M (通讯作者)，Constantine Philosopher Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Geog & Reg Dev, Tr A Hlinku 1, Nitra 94974, Slovakia.",michaela.zoncova@ukf.sk,"Dubcová, Alena/AAC-8691-2020; Žoncová, Michaela/L-2352-2018","Žoncová, Michaela/0000-0002-1302-9772",,,,,6,0,0,0,11,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,542,546,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800094,0

In order to address these questions. I estimate a random utility model using administrative application data of all German medical schools. As identification relies on the variation in quality indicators over time, I can disentangle the response to changing quality indicators from the common knowledge regarding university attractiveness.

This paper begins by tracing how models of cognition and human nature formed the foundational design logic (and perceived design constraints) for almost all of the constituted political entities of the last two and half centuries. It then looks at how advances in the brain sciences have expanded, and in many cases overturned, common beliefs about how the brain works and notions about human nature. These include the re-imagining of the bounded, independent individual, the place of rationality and emotion in decision-making, and new understandings of human capacities (and incapacities) for foresight. Next, it analyses the new responsibilities and dilemmas generated by an emerging neuropolitics. Finally, it lays out four alternative futures for governance, with emphasis on the ways agents of power might respond to these changes and how basic political structures of government could evolve within several possible neurocentric worlds.

This paper examines the relative performance of emissions standards and ambient standards when the natural environment provides stochastic environmental services for assimilating pollution. For receiving media characterized by greater dispersion in the distribution of environmental services, the optimal emissions policy becomes more stringent, whereas the optimal ambient policy generally becomes more lax. In terms of economic performance, emissions policies are superior to ambient policies for relatively non-toxic pollutants, whereas ambient standards welfare dominate emissions standards for sufficiently toxic pollutants. In the case of combined policies that jointly implement emissions standards and ambient standards, we show that the optimal level of each standard relaxes relative to its counterpart in a unilateral policy, allowing for greater emissions levels and higher pollution concentrations in the environmental medium.

We work with alternative characterizations of types: gender, school type (public or private), parental education, and their combinations. Following Checchi-Peragine's (2010) non-parametric method, we find that inequality of opportunity for educational achievement in Latin America ranges from less than 1% to up to 25%, depending on the year, the country, the subject and the specification of circumstances. These magnitudes are substantial with respect to what is found in comparator countries. Parental education and school type prove to be important sources of inequality of opportunity, contrary to gender. By means of sensitivity analyses, while most results show small to moderate variation in terms of magnitudes, in ordinal terms (rankings) they remain quite stable.

The non-timber forest products are culturally important and often accessible to local people. We undertook a community-based participatory case study of the cultural uses of non-timber forest products within the Sts'ailes traditional territory. We used semi-structured interviews, ethnography, and secondary documents (e.g. maps and supporting documents) to provide in-depth understanding of the NTFP uses. Sts'ailes people use NTFPs by (1) gathering plants for food and medicine, (2) making materials from the plants, (3) making spiritual regalia and paints for winter ceremonials, and (4) brushing with cedar branches as spiritual practices. Forest environments and NTFPs provide secured environment for spiritual bathing and other spiritual practices and cedar branches are essential to use for purification.

Modeled after the American Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the CHARLS Pilot survey respondents are 45 years and older in two quite distinct provinces-Zhejiang, a high-growth industrialized province on the East Coast, and Gansu, a largely agricultural and poor province in the West-in a sense new and old China. Our cognition measures proxy for two different dimensions of adult cognition-episodic memory and intact mental status. On both measures, Chinese women score much lower than do Chinese men, a gender difference that grows among older Chinese cohorts. We relate both these cognition scores to schooling, urban residence, family and community levels of economic resources, and height. We find that cognition is more closely related to mean community resources than to family resources, especially for women, suggesting that in traditional poor Chinese communities there are strong economic incentives to favor boys at the expense of girls. We also find that these gender differences in cognitive ability have been steadily decreasing across birth cohorts as the economy of China grew rapidly. Among cohorts of young adults in China, there is no longer any gender disparity in cognitive ability. This parallels the situation in the United States where cognition scores of adult women actually exceed those of adult men.","[Lei, Xiaoyan; Zhao, Yaohui] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yuqing] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [McArdle, John J.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Smith, James P.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA",Peking University; Duke University; University of Southern California; RAND Corporation,"Lei, XY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; smith, james/HTQ-1933-2023","Zhao, Yaohui/0000-0002-9252-9715","NIA NIH HHS [P30 AG012815, R37 AG025529, U01 AG009740, P01 AG022481] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,18,137,144,8,132,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

In this paper, we explore the factors that shape the timing of the first prescription of six new drugs by General Practitioners in Ireland. Our analysis is based on a dataset that matches prescription data with data on GP characteristics. We then use duration analysis to explore both equilibrium and non-equilibrium determinants of prescribing innovation. Our study highlights a range of commonalities across all of the drugs considered and suggests the importance of GP and practice characteristics in shaping prescribing decisions. We also find strongly significant, and consistently signed, stock and order effects across these drugs: GPs who have a track record of early adoption tend also to be early adopters of other new drugs; and, the larger the proportion of GPs which have already adopted a new drug the slower is subsequent adoption. Epidemic and learning effects are also evident with slower adoption by rural practices and among those GPs with narrower prescribing portfolios.","[Bourke, Jane] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Econ, Cork, Ireland; [Bourke, Jane; Roper, Stephen] Warwick Business Sch, Ctr Small & Medium Enterprises, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University College Cork; University of Warwick,"Bourke, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Econ, Cork, Ireland.",Jane.Bourke@ucc.ie; Stepen.Roper@wbs.ac.uk,"roper, stephen/P-1088-2016; Bourke, Jane/GQH-8687-2022","Bourke, Jane/0000-0002-3994-3239",,,,,47,16,17,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

As a result, the information needs of land managers must now include social and cultural values. In addition, the public's interest in having greater participation in land management decisions and in generating scientific knowledge has never been greater. The generation of scientific knowledge which is expressed primarily through conventional means - such as peer-reviewed publications targeting academics and technology transfer (e.g., patents, licenses, agreements) primarily for government and industry - does not always satisfy the needs of resource managers and public. In recent decades, there has been rapid growth of methods to help bridge this gap by better connecting new knowledge and knowledge generation with public needs. The U.S. Forest Service is making science delivery as important goal as science creation, including structural institutional changes at the interface among researchers, resource managers, and the public, allocating an appropriate portion of project funding specifically for delivery. The Forest Service is considering increasing its use of citizen science and participatory research - which brings resource managers, decision makers, and the public into the research process to varying extents - as part of the agency's science delivery efforts. Here we explore citizen science and participatory research as possible vehicles to augment existing science delivery efforts from the perspective of a federal land management agency. We found that these mechanisms facilitate public involvement in fundamentally different ways. Depending on the type of research and desired use of research outcomes, either citizen science or participatory research could enhance the use of science in some natural resource management discussions, possibly leading to supportable solutions.

These financial incentives may potentially alter the country's economic landscape. However, current forest and land allocation policies and politics support economic activities that promote the exploitation of forest assets. More recently, global needs for energy and food have increased pressure on forest land. The REDD+ mechanism is designed to reverse this situation and create opportunities for necessary reforms both inside and outside the forestry sector. In this paper, we take a political economy perspective to analyze Indonesia's policies on the allocation of forest land (kawasan hutan) and, related to this, assess the changes in forest land allocation that are needed to enable REDD+ to compete with other sectors. This paper shows that there are numerous challenges to create a space for REDD+, many of which are rooted in the political economy of forests that shapes the nature and process of the land allocation system. The questions of where, on which type of forest land, at what scale and based on which procedures remain key for REDD+ and its capability to compete with other objectives within the current forest land allocation framework.

I do so using a twelve-year panel of charter and mainstream student achievement in North Carolina, focusing on the state's middle schools. Indeed, new charter schools had twice the rate of new teachers as new mainstream schools, as well as lower rates of faculty retention. Consistent with past research. I find significant returns to charter school age in terms of math and reading achievement, and I rule out the possibility that charter maturation was driven by higher-achieving students selecting into older schools. Faculty development explains, at best, a small share of the observed maturation over the initial years of charter schools' operation. Charters of all ages were relatively ineffective at improving math achievement, but were on par with mainstream schools at improving reading achievement by their sixth year of operation.

Weak signals are signs anticipating or pointing to possibly emerging new issues. Weak signals can be perceived through all five human senses: they can be seen, heard, smelled, felt or even tasted. Visual weak signals are weak signals shown in a visual form. They can be represented as images: photos, paintings, drawings, video clips, etc. [2]. The method used by the Futures Window is to display weak signals in a visual form as a slide show on a large screen with the aim of encouraging people to anticipate and innovate futures. The Futures Window could be a central tool to be used in Creative Foresight Spaces (CFS).(1) The concept of CFS is offered as one way of responding to the growing demand for innovation in corporations and work organisations. The FIN method was tested at VU Technical Research Centre (http://www.vtt.fi/) in Finland in two pilots in 2006-2007. A survey was conducted to gather employee's opinions of the FW experiments. The results show that employees considered the FIN positively and they confirmed that it stimulated futures thinking. The results of this study are encouraging for further developing the Futures Window as a key element of CFS. This article will present the concept of Creative Foresight Spaces in detail together with its possible applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few of these offer a typology that can be used to actually analyse governance. In this paper, we present such a typology. We distinguish governance modes and governance shifts and use Kooiman's governance conception as our main inspiration, elaborated with the help of the policy arrangement approach. This results in four ideal-type governance modes - hierarchical, closed co-, open co- and self governance - that are operationalised into four ideal-type governance arrangements. These arrangements differ from one another in terms of actors, power and interaction rules. In explaining governance shifts, we distinguish between old and new modes of governance and introduce three external change factors (adjacent policy arrangements, socio-political trends and shock events) and one internal factor (policy entrepreneurs) that can account for governance change. To prove the value of our framework, we apply it to a case, i.e. the rise of nature policy in the Dutch region Utrechtse Heuvelrug in the 1970s and 1980s. Besides providing insight into how to work with our framework, the results also reveal a rather paradoxical governance shift, i.e. from a new to an old mode, thus putting the much heralded shift from government to governance into perspective.

Some districts have lower relative costs of learning English due to linguistic predispositions.

The article concludes that an effective evaluation of complementary policies should include identifying the market failure the policy is aimed at correcting. The complementary policy should work in conjunction with, not opposition to, other polices aimed at reducing emissions. It should be complementary with the policies of other levels of government and it should also consider issues of efficiency, equity, accountability and adaptability.","[Denniss, R.; Grudnoff, M.] Australia Inst, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Macintosh, A.] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Coll Law, Ctr Climate Law & Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Denniss, R (通讯作者)，Australia Inst, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",mail@tai.org.au; matt@tat.org.au; sha@law.anu.edu.au,,"Macintosh, Andrew/0000-0001-5700-7105",,,,,17,3,3,0,16,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

One approach to assessing the quality of life index is based on public health. We study the indices of quality of life of women from urban areas of Kazakhstan on the basis of the subjective perception of various aspects of health. Methodology - self-rated health was assessed among 4000 individuals (including 2887 women) residing in 6 regions of Kazakhstan, sampled by the National Center for Healthy Lifestyle Ministry of Health. The data for the calculation of indices of quality of life were obtained from the Health Status Survey (2011) in Kazakhstan. Research tools included an assessment of physical, mental, emotional and social functioning person and based on international quality of life questionnaire MOS SF-36, proposed J. Ware (1988).

This will help develop programs to improve the quality of life at local and regional level and will facilitate the formation of human capital. Findings - aggregate indicators of physical and psychological health of women from urban areas showed that the quality of life in Kazakhstan has a strong regional differentiation. The overall index of quality of life was low in all regions of Kazakhstan (no more than 72 out of 100 possible points).

Analysis of the confidence intervals for wheat starch pots, rice hull pots, straw pots, coir pots and peat pots reveal that they overlap, which indicates the price premiums participants are willing to pay for these five types of biodegradable containers do not significantly differ from each other. Consumers express a positive willingness to pay for several types of biodegradable containers relative to the standard plastic pot. There are two distinct levels that emerged with the first tier including coconut coir and peat pots, which received ratings in the same range as rice hull, straw and wheat pots. A second, lower tier of similarly rated containers included the poultry feather, cow manure and recycled plastic pots.","[Hall, C. R.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Behe, B.

In particular, by combining research on gendered subjectivities in elite labour markets with Foucauldian-inspired cultural economy research on the processes of financial subjectification, we argue that business education played an important role in performing discourses of idealised investment banking subjects who embodied essentialised masculine qualities during the period of rapid financialized growth in the 2000s. We then examine the temporary fragility of these 'masters of the universe' by exploring how the power of investment banking subjects was momentarily destabilised as the global financial crisis was scripted in public discourse as being caused in part by the dominance of hyper-masculine investment bankers. By focusing on the relationship between educational practices and the gendered nature of financial services work, our analysis responds to calls to develop a more politically engaged cultural economy of finance by raising normative questions concerning the financial subjectivities that could, or should, be called forth within the post-crisis international financial system.","[Hall, Sarah] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Appleyard, Lindsey] Univ Birmingham, CHASM, Inst Appl Social Studies, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Nottingham; University of Birmingham,"Hall, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",sarah.hall@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Hall, sarah/0000-0001-5563-5909; appleyard, lindsey/0000-0003-1087-8450",Nuffield Foundation [SGS/3204]; ESRC First Grant [RES-061-25-0071]; ESRC [ES/F001053/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F001053/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Nuffield Foundation; ESRC First Grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The research reported on in this paper was funded by The Nuffield Foundation (SGS/3204) and an ESRC First Grant (RES-061-25-0071).

Considering that housing investment demand and housing consumption usually are endogenous in the housing status choice, a two-stage ordered choice model is established introduced a series of instrument variables in this paper. The results show that the fluctuation of prospective rent is the most important factor influencing housing investment demand and housing status choice, while housing investment demand is more sensitive to householder's wealth than housing consumption demand.

Following decapitation the axillary buds establish directional auxin export by subcellular polarization of PIN1 auxin transporters. Competition between two lateral auxin sources after removal the primary source and application of auxin efflux inhibitor, and furthermore, influence of length of the decapitated stem stump on gene expression in axillary buds was studied. Application of auxin efflux inhibitor (NPA, TIBA) to the second axillary bud of decapitated plants reduces bud outgrowth. Inhibition of outgrowth of the second axillary bud in these plants caused outgrowth of the first bud. This competition between the second and first axillary buds is associated with changes in expression profiles of AUX1, PIN1 and DRM1 genes. These results support the competitive canalization theory, by which canalization of auxin from the lateral auxin source is possible only if the primary source is removed or weakened. Length of the decapitated stem stump may affect timing of changes in expression of AUX1, PIN1 and DRM1 genes in the second axillary bud and hence the timing of bud outgrowth initiation after removal of the dominant apex. The signal for axillary bud outgrowth therefore could be the auxin decrease or depletion in the stem.","[Medved'ova, Z.; Balla, J.; Prochazka, S.] Mendel Univ Brno, CEITEC Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Balla, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Plant Biol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Medved'ová, Z (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, CEITEC Cent European Inst Technol, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",zuzana.medvedova@mendelu.cz,"Balla, Jozef/D-5257-2012","Balla, Jozef/0000-0002-7512-2040",,,,,13,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,852,858,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200096,0

A latter case is analyzed, wherein the material recovery potential of three Philippine HEIs was determined. It has been found out that approximately 90% of solid wastes in faculty rooms in the three Philippine HEIs are potentially recoverable, as residual wastes only account 6% - 11%. Furthermore, it is estimated that monetary returns from these recoverable materials range on a rate of P1.59 ($.04) - P11.98 ($.28) per day ($1.00 = P43.00, 2011). It is argued that HEIs of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) may also have high material recovery potential, which can be validated through research, as shown by the case of three HEIs in the Philippines.

The mechanism of their activity is widely studied and the quantification of the drug incorporated in the DNA structure is in the center of attention. In this study we investigated the behavior of the platinum-based cytostatic drug and DNA adducts during the well established Sanger sequencing method involving capillary electrophoretic (CE) separation. Three selected platinum-based cytostatic drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin) were incubated with the DNA fragment (498 bp) to create adducts and subsequently sequenced. It was found that the fluorescence signal provided by fluorescently labeled DNA fragments decreased significantly depending on concentration of the drug. Moreover, even though four types of fluorescently labeled fragments are created during the sequencing reaction prior to the CE separation; similar decrease of the signal was observed in all of the fragment types. This suggests that cytostatic drugs do not influence the CE separation itself but the labeling sequencing reaction. Finally, the difference between three types of the cytostatic drugs was found. It follows from the results that to reach the signal decrease of 75% compared to the control DNA sample only 0.3 mu g/ml of cisplatin is required. On the other hand, 7 and 75 mu g/ml of oxaliplatin and carboplatin, respectively are required to reach the same effect. Our hypothesis was verified by electrochemical analysis and the highest amount of platinum was determined in the cisplatinated DNA sample followed by oxaliplatinated and carboplatinated DNA.","[Smerkova, K.; Ryvolova, M.; Krejcova, L.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Ryvolova, M.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Brno University of Technology,"Smerková, K (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",k.smerkova@centrum.cz,"Smerkova, Kristyna/F-3892-2012; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Krejcova, Ludmila/E-8440-2012; Vaculovicova, Marketa/E-5583-2016","Smerkova, Kristyna/0000-0002-1667-7660; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Krejcova, Ludmila/0000-0002-5199-2949; Vaculovicova, Marketa/0000-0002-6771-1304",,,,,14,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1258,1264,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200147,0

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, we first propose a literature review on experiential view to branding and region of origin labeling strategies. A research methodology based on a qualitative survey (focus group), a questionnaire is described. Data analysis is established by means of three statistical methods: Exploratory factor analysis, Descriptive frequency data analysis and Discriminant analysis. Findings - From qualitative and quantitative data analyses we conclude that food products with regional reference could affect consumer preferences with a larger extent than food products protected by official labels. Emotional experience has been found to affect the group involving those who prefer regional food products more considerably than the other factors. Originality/value - Our findings are relevant for both companies already being engaged on a labeling strategy through official labels and firms searching for giving experiential values to their brands. For the first case, companies that have failed to convince its customers about the added value of their labelled food products could positively influence their preferences through undertaking a communication strategy based mostly on experiential values (emotional and sensory) than functional ones. For the second case, firms who suffer from a decline of their brand image could enhance their notoriety by adopting a new approach to branding consisting on positioning their products by choosing the regional reference associated with their brand name. The use of a well-known region of origin may be a more efficient device for differentiating products than the development, introduction and positioning of a brand name, based on a set of associations.","[Trabelsi Trigui, Imene] ENITA Clermont, Food Qual & Econ Dept, F-63370 Lempdes, France",VetAgro Sup,,imentrigui@yahoo.fr; g.giraud@agrosupdijon.fr,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,12,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2036,2052,,,,,,17,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801084,0

Inducing broad acceptance by Developing Members through the provision of assistance (i.e., paying Developing Members to do so) is compromised by the agreement not bringing the provision of assistance within its legal obligations.

We estimate split population models that simultaneously estimate the impact of individual characteristics and student teaching experiences on the timing and probability of initial hiring as a public school teacher. Not surprisingly, we find that interns endorsed to teach in difficult-to-staff areas are more likely to find employment as public school teachers than interns endorsed in other areas. Younger interns, white interns, and interns who completed their student teaching in suburban schools are also more likely to find a teaching job, all else equal. Prospective teachers who do their internships at schools that have more teacher turnover are more likely to find employment, often at those schools. On the other hand, few of the characteristics of an intern's cooperating teacher are predictive of workforce entry. Finally, interns with higher credential exam scores are more likely to be hired by the school where they did their student teaching. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The debate circled around one central question: should the implementation of this technology be forced through with regulations or should the market decide on pace and character of implementation? In 2008 it was decided that it was best to regulate the implementation. Throughout these 10 years, the debate largely concerned how the future would look with or without regulation. This paper is inspired by the sociology of expectation, which assumes that futures are performative. This means that when the future is evoked or imagined, it influences present action and navigation. With this in mind, the paper analyzes future visions and expectations as they were formulated in the technology debate, and traces the role of these futures in the policy debate and for the policy outcome. The paper identifies two modes of future performativity: translative and transformative futures. Translative futures are often mobilized as spokespersons for desired technology or policy trajectories. Here, they work as (a) stagestting devices: sparking debate, enrolling new actors in the debate and generating interest. Further, they work as (b) regulative tools: establishing the need for political decisions, either to realize the content of future visions, or to avoid the contents of alternative futures. Transformative futures do more subtle and gradual work, shifting the practical, symbolic and cognitive meaning of what the technology in question might become in the future. As an example, the significance of the advanced electricity meters discussed in this paper changed from being a device filling the knowledge gaps of electricity consumers, to being a central hub in households delivering a range of potential services and being available for a number of different users. In this paper, I describe the gradual shift in understanding of what advanced electricity meters could be as a virtual domestication trajectory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Not all ecosystem services in forestry are public goods and deserving of government intervention. Interaction in the market by sellers and buyers concerning payments for ecosystem services is possible. Also government representing the interests of the public may enter the market and negotiate with the providers of ecosystem services. Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is a voluntary transaction for a well-defined environmental service that is acquired by a service buyer from a service provider. PFS has a potentially important role in forestry contexts. While the provider of any particular ecosystem service is always the forest landowner, the buyer may be an actual user of the ES, a government, an NGO, or international agency acting on behalf of consistencies that value or use the ES. An example of the former is a water company using watershed services sustained by a forest. Payments through REDD and REDD+ serve as an example of the latter.

It then introduces three main institutionalized forms of the WTO discourse, namely adjudication, peer review, and consultation/negotiation. These three forms of WTO discourse are mainly responsible for the diurnal operation of the world trade community.

The papers in this special issue reflect critically on the efforts made over the past two decades to formalize the sector, which has fast become one of the most important economic activities in many rural sections of the region, as well as what lies ahead, given the progress made to date with legalizing and supporting operators. The present paper not only summarizes each contribution but also frames the debates on formalization, industry impacts and perceptions of participants which this special issue touches on, with specific reference to sub-Saharan Africa. Host governments and donors are now at a crossroads: on the one hand, faced with the reality that across the region, ASM is now an integral component of the rural economy, but on the other hand, having in place rigid regulatory and policy frameworks which do not necessarily reflect this reality.

The aim of this article is to build on this previous research using the 2006 and 2011 censuses to provide a more disaggregated descriptive analysis of changes in the character of labour market outcomes for Indigenous Australians aged 15-64 years. One of the new findings in the article is that the employment of Indigenous youth (i.e. those aged 1524 years) in remote areas is different from that of Indigenous youth in non-remote areas, but older Indigenous residents of such areas are not very different in employment terms. Policy-makers thus need to pay particular attention to Indigenous youth employment in remote areas because the failure to address these differentials may lead to a foreclosure of future labour market options. Policy also needs to facilitate Indigenous engagement in the mainstream economy by assisting Indigenous people to be work-ready, especially in ensuring that Indigenous skills are matched with employer demands, and expediting employment by informing businesses on how to provide an Indigenous-friendly workplace.","[Gray, Matthew; Howlett, Monica] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Aboriginal Econ Policy Res, Res Sch Social Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Gray, Matthew] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Arts & Social Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hunter, Boyd] Australian Natl Univ, CAEPR, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University; Australian National University,"Hunter, B (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, CAEPR, 24 Copland Bldg, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",boyd.hunter@anu.edu.au,"Gray, Matthew/G-4102-2015; Hunter, Boyd/JQV-7527-2023; Hunter, Boyd/AAH-2372-2020","Hunter, Boyd/0000-0003-0362-4882; Alexander, Monica/0000-0002-8135-3435",Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet,Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet,This article is based on research funded by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; views expressed in it are those of the authors and may not reflect those of the Department or the Australian Government.,,23,8,8,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Using the canonical economic model of religiosity, I develop an empirical test to investigate the importance of religious participation, in particular religious proscriptions and rules, on determining behavior. The test relies on exogenous variation in the cost of secular activities rather than an instrument for religious participation. Several empirical applications of this test are conducted; the results indicate a strong role for religious proscriptions in determining behavior.","[Hungerman, Daniel M.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Hungerman, Daniel M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Notre Dame; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hungerman, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",dhungerm@nd.edu,,,,,,,77,19,24,0,12,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

By contrast, energy security is generally discussed in terms of access to fossil fuels. In this paper we make a different case for renewables: we contrast the extraction of energy (fuels), which - in spite of technological change - takes place under diminishing returns, with the harvesting of nature's renewable energy, which takes place in a process utilizing manufactured devices, where manufacturing generates increasing returns and costs decline along steep learning curves. This gives a fresh perspective on both renewables and energy security. We argue that energy choices can be framed as choices in favour of increasing returns (based on manufacturing), vs. choices in favour of diminishing returns activities, which usually involve extraction of fossil fuels. Such a framing does not entail assumptions as to whether the entire energy system can be converted to renewables, but simply as choices made at the margin - whose effects will cumulate over time. Energy security through renewables manufacturing therefore promises to be a fruitful area of futures studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the ambiguous legal status of the accession protocols in WTO legal system, the disputes relating to the understanding and application of the provisions in accession protocols are frequently taking place. Because accession protocols concern the fundamental trade interests of new Members, their status in the WTO legal system is of great importance. The WTO Ministerial Conference and General Council should therefore fulfil their statutory duties in such a way as to mitigate potential challenges posed by the possible legal uncertainty of accession protocols in pursuing the aims of the multilateral trading system, in adhering to and promoting WTO principles and rules as well as the basic principles of international law and in particular situating accession protocols appropriately within the overall WTO legal framework.

We derive conditions for a 'green orthodox': anticipated climate policies may reduce current emissions. The model can also be used to analyze spatial carbon leakage. Calibrations suggest that intertemporal carbon leakage (from 0% to 8%) is a relatively minor concern. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Kleimann, D",,,,"Kleimann, David",,,Beyond Market Access?: The Anatomy of ASEAN's Preferential Trade Agreements,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article seeks to enhance the understanding of ASEAN's external Preferential Trade Agreements (PTA) in context of the recent growth of economic regionalism in East Asia. The article advances a comparison of the content of ASEAN's five plurilateral PTAs with China, Korea, Japan, India, Australia, and New Zealand with the status quo of ASEAN's internal economic integration. In a second step, the article compares ASEAN's plurilateral agreements and ASEAN's internal integration with the content of six bilateral PTAs that individual ASEAN Member States have concluded with Japan. The empirical findings demonstrate that the ambition of ASEAN's five plurilateral agreements finds its upper limits in the substantive content of ASEAN's internal economic integration. Within these limits, the coverage and depth of commitments varies considerably and corresponds to the intensity of trade between ASEAN and the respective external partner. Moreover, the comparison shows that bilateral PTAs between six individual ASEAN Member States and Japan go significantly beyond the status quo of ASEAN's internal integration and exceed the coverage and depth of ASEAN's external plurilateral PTAs. The author contends that the coverage and depth of ASEAN Member States' plurilateral PTAs is limited by the structural heterogeneity of the signatories and, as a result, a relatively high diversity of policy preferences. Bilateral PTAs between ASEAN Member States and the same external partners result in deeper commitments than the plurilateral accords because of both a higher common denominator among the parties to the agreements and the free-rider problem that persists in plurilateral negotiation settings. Moreover, it is argued that the coverage and depth of the agreements is a function of the intensity of trade among the parties: high trade intensity results in deeper and more comprehensive agreements that tackle twenty-first century trade issues, whereas low trade intensity results in shallow agreements that aim to reduce first-generation trade barriers. These hypotheses, which are fully verified by the empirical findings of this study, allow fir conclusions about the role of ASEAN Member States collectively and individually in current and future economic integration initiatives.","European Univ Inst, Dept Law, Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Kleimann, D (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Law, Florence, Italy.",,,,,,,,31,7,7,0,22,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The article examines whether these changes actually resulted in any shift from a rights-based system for resolving industrial disputation to a system based on workplace-level interest-based negotiation, and whether they were accompanied either by higher labour productivity or by improved social welfare. The analysis draws on a conceptual framework that identifies coherent national labour regulation systems as being based on a convergence of three institutional approaches - to the operation of labour markets, of labour relations and of social security. Broadly, such labour regulation systems can be classified as either civil law or common law based. The Philippine labour regulation system is shown to have a hybrid basis, whose origins are briefly traced by identifying the legacy of the colonial and post-colonial phases, the martial law era and the restoration of democracy in 1986. Whereas Australia, another hybrid system, appears to have achieved some coherence in changes to the regulation of industrial relations, labour markets and social welfare, in the Philippines, such changes have not converged. In the 1990s, efforts to mitigate the traditional legalistic and adversarial character of industrial relations through liberalisation of restrictions on the right to organise were cross-cut by the effects of the growing labour market flexibility that resulted from integration into the global economy. Legal changes between 1999 and 2011 have not fostered voluntary self-organisation of distributive bargaining at enterprise level. Union membership, collective bargaining coverage and numbers of workers involved in notified or actual industrial action have declined, while reliance on compulsory arbitration and monetary compensation claims has remained high. Labour productivity has not improved. Within the context of globalisation, the labour market is increasingly characterised by numerical flexibility and a prevalence of small enterprises. High unemployment levels and a large informal sector indicate divergence between the systems for regulating labour and welfare.","[Sale, Jonathan P.] Univ Philippines, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Sale, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines Diliman, Sch Labor & Ind Relat, Bonifacio Hall,E Jacinto St, Quezon City 1101, Natl Capital Re, Philippines.",jona_sale@yahoo.com,"Sale, Jonathan/ABE-4032-2020","Sale, Jonathan/0000-0001-7061-6255",,,,,43,1,1,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The normative statement underlying such a rationing device is that patients should wait according to need and irrespective of socioeconomic status or other non-need characteristics. The aim of this paper is to test empirically that waiting times for publicly funded specialist care do not depend on patients' socioeconomic status. Waiting times for specialist care can vary according to the type of medical specialty, type of consultation (review or diagnosis) and the region where patients' reside. In order to take into account such variability, we use Bayesian random parameter models to explain waiting times for specialist care in terms of need and non-need variables.

This paper examines a number of complex issues that arose in the WTO litigation between five new PTA partners through the Dominican Republic-Safeguard Measures disputes. First, we highlight the difficulties in assessing the extent to which safeguards imposed following a PTA are the result of PTA concessions relative to developments that pre-date or are otherwise unrelated to the PTA. Second, we examine how the WTO Panel resolved a number of previously unanswered questions in the WTO's safeguards jurisprudence that arose in these cases. We suggest that the Panel rightly foreclosed a number of potentially dubious practices that WTO members might otherwise have pursued when using safeguards to circumvent trade concessions. Third, we identify how safeguard-related provisions within a PTA may give rise to constraints that subsequently affect how a country may apply safeguards available under the WTO Agreements, and we describe some implications for PTA design and negotiation. Finally, we analyze the broader implications that arise from the interplay of PTAs, safeguards, and dispute settlement in light of the availability of both relatively substitutable policy instruments and dispute resolution forums.","[Bown, Chad P.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Wu, Mark] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",The World Bank; Harvard University,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cbown@worldbank.org; mwu@law.harvard.edu,,"Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",,,,,29,12,12,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2014,13.0,2,,,,,179,227,,10.1017/S1474745614000111,0.0,,,49,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AG5GA,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335446300003,0

We argue that electoral institutions play a crucial role in shaping politico-economic distributive coalitions that affected the original division of labour in education financing. In proportional representation systems, the lower and middle classes formed a coalition supporting the establishment of a system with a large share of public funding. In majoritarian systems, in contrast, the middle class voters aligned with the upper income class and supported private education spending instead. Once established, institutional arrangements create feedback effects on the micro-level of attitudes, reinforcing political support even among upper middle classes in public systems. These hypotheses are tested empirically both on the micro level of preferences as well as on the macro level with aggregate data and survey data from the ISSP for 20 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.","[Busemeyer, Marius R.] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany; [Iversen, Torben] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Konstanz; Harvard University,"Busemeyer, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany.",marius.busemeyer@uni-konstanz.de,"Busemeyer, Marius R./Q-6951-2016","Busemeyer, Marius R./0000-0003-4085-1689",,,,,54,34,39,2,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

One year after implementation, we find no significant effects on the cognitive development of the average child, but pronounced differences by birth cohort. The program has significantly improved Fine Motor Skills and Visual Reception scores, related to early reading and writing abilities, of the youngest children aged below 18 months at program start. There is no program impact on the older cohort, whose cognitive development appears to be more strongly correlated with center-based ECD services.

We employed the concentration index (C) to quantify the socioeconomic inequalities in obesity risk across different demographic groups and geographic regions in each survey period. A decomposition analysis of inequality is performed to determine factors that lie behind income-related inequality in obesity risk. Although declining over time, the results show that there exists income-related inequality in obesity risk in Canada. The estimated Cs for men indicate that obesity is concentrated among the rich and its trend is increasing over time. The findings, however, suggest that obesity is more prevalent among economically disadvantaged women. While we found that obesity is mainly concentrated among the poor in the Atlantic Provinces, the degree of socioeconomic related inequality in obesity risk is increasing in these provinces. The results for Alberta showed that obesity is concentrated among the better-off individuals. The decomposition analysis suggests that factors such as demographics, income, immigration, education, drinking habits, and physical activity are the key factors explaining income-related inequality in obesity risk in Canada. Our empirical findings suggest that, in order to combat the obesity epidemic, health policies should focus on poorer females and economically well-off males.","[Hajizadeh, Mohammad; Campbell, M.

With the aim of filling the gap in the literature on Ethiopia, this study explored the actors involved, the nature of power they hold, the accountability relationships among actors and the social and environmental outcomes of the devolved governance system using a Modified Actor-Power-Accountability Framework (MAPAF). The results indicated that discretionary decision-making space is created for the local population and the leaders of Forest Cooperatives to manage and protect the forest and use it for subsistence purposes. To generate income from their withdrawal rights, however, local actors require approval from a mid-level actor, the Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise. Devolution has improved physical and human conditions and the benefits from natural capital, which were identified as salient for the local population as a means of coping with their vulnerabilities and for income generation. The environmental outcome differed depending on the policy followed by the mid-level partner organizations that make decisions with the local population on income-generating activities from the sale of forest resources. Overall, elite capture and the recent emphasis on income generation over forest conservation were identified as key factors hampering positive social and environmental outcomes from the devolved governance system.

In particular, it investigates the certification program issuing formal land title deeds (land certificates) to landholders. Drawing on a household survey with gender-disaggregated asset data conducted in the rural municipality Soavinandriana, the analysis suggests that the certification program has strengthened both men's and women's formal claims to individually held land. However, the lack of gender equality principles and, in particular, of mechanisms to ensure that couples' jointly held land is jointly secured, seems to have reinforced primary ownership of land by male household heads, at the expense of women's land rights. Furthermore, the land tenure reform does not address some of the most important threats to tenure security such as colonial titles and commercial pressure on land, and large parts of the country are still not covered by the certification program.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Widman, M (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",marit.widman@slu.se,,,,,,,45,23,27,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Providers of accounting education must take into account the changed world and create contemporary curricula. In Estonia the change from a command to a market economy has inevitably influenced not only the accounting framework but also the entire system of accounting education. It is clear that without a design of accounting curricula it is practically impossible to fulfill requirements of nowadays high quality financial information. Tallinn University of Technology (TUT) holds on the advanced level of accounting education the leading position in Estonia. The accounting curriculum (on the graduate level as well as undergraduate level) is the most popular among all curricula at the Tallinn School of Economics and Business Administration of TUT. It is a joint system, which consists of undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Small sub specializations: for example in financial accounting, managerial cost accounting, taxation and auditing become evident while interpreting the graduate and undergraduate programs as one united system.

Using an out-of-sample period of 1917 to 2012, our results based on MSE and McCracken (2007) MSE-F statistic, indicate that in general, the non-hierarchical Bayesian shrinkage estimators perform better than their hierarchical counterparts as well as the least square estimators. The Bcryesian shrinkage estimated with Lasso-Landweber is the best-suited model for forecasting the US. real house price. Among the least square models, the individual regression with house price regressed on the fiscal policy variable outperforms the rest. Also results from Lasso-Landweber portray the fiscal policy variable as the best predictor of the U.S. house prices especially in the recent times while the short-term interest rate and real construction cost also did well at the beginning and middle of the sample.","[Aye, Goodness C.; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Aye, GC (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",goodness.aye@gmail.com; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,10,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The present analysis frames these rhetorical confrontations as a struggle over economic legitimacy, highlighting some of the ways in which social actors build and sever the normatively loaded associations that position them and others in social space, and how the 'experimental' combination of business and social responsibilities tests social actors' abilities to adapt to this practice.","[Cockburn, Patrick J.

In these networks, a critical challenge is to construct and maintain multicasting trees to distribute the content from distribution servers to the edge servers, clients and peers. In this work considering tight relation between internal and P2P layers of these networks, a single form of multicasting tree construction problem in this domain is presented formally. NP-Hardness of the problems is proved and based on economic mechanism design theory, an economic direct privacy preserving mechanism is employed to solve the problem. Performance of the solution is studied and it is proved that the solution produces a two approximate outcome. Experiments confirm that the proposed solution produces near optimal results. These experiments also verify that the mechanism is able to maintain quality of results with presence of dynamic changes in multicasting groups.","[Garmehi, Mehran; Analoui, Morteza] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Comp Engn Sch, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Garmehi, M (通讯作者)，Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Comp Engn Sch, Tehran, Iran.",garmehi@iust.ac.ir; analoui@iust.ac.ir,"analoui, morteza/T-1093-2018","analoui, morteza/0000-0001-6792-760X",Iran Telecommunication Research Center (ITRC) [19251/500],Iran Telecommunication Research Center (ITRC),"This research was supported by Iran Telecommunication Research Center (ITRC), Contract Number, 19251/500.",,23,1,1,0,4,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In the literature exists several econometric ways to test for the implications raised by the new RW-PIH theory advocated by Hall (1978), among which perhaps the most used is the class of unit roots test. As pointed out by Cochrane in successive works, the use of unit roots test for stationarity could provide ambiguous information from different reasons. In that sense, here I switch to a continuous environment that allows for a much larger view on what we call stationarity in discrete time. For example, the population of a stochastic process may follow an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck style process, but because the short sample counterpart we found signs for non-stationarity in discrete time. For this purpose I have restored three methods to fit an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the Romanian nondurable goods consumption, in order to identify some important stochastic properties of the underlined series. Also in the current paper I emphasized the following problem: in the emerging countries, heteroskedasticity of the shocks which affect the data generating process for consumption may be due to the sharp switching to different states caused by several types of jumps and not necessarily to the way in which the agents set their decisions (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Iancu, Alexie Ciprian Alupoaiei; Sandica, Ana-Maria] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Iancu, ACA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",alex.alupoaiei@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-5671,,,PROC ECON FINANC,,,2014,15.0,,,,,,228,237,,10.1016/S2212-5671(14)00490-0,0.0,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EB,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357094000029,0

How the event is understood and conceptualized determines to a great extent the ways in which its related uncertainty will be rendered. This, in turn, will determine how such uncertainty will be managed. Although this idea has been widely explored with important nuances by various scholars, what has not been discussed in great detail is the problematic idea of temporality and the role time plays in helping constitute the event object of insurance. Such a problem is of great relevance for pushing forward the debate on the limits of insurability. The empirical cases used in this article, Swiss Re's Vita and Kortis, launched and developed during the last decade, relate to hedging the exposure of life and health insurance portfolios to events that would generate excess mortality and excess vitality. The schemes, as explored here, are not simply actuarial, although actuarial practice still figures prominently in their crafting. They involve the strategic articulation of varied forms of knowledge that enshrine particular understandings of time and produce the truth-base of insurable events.","[Lobo-Guerrero, Luis] Univ Groningen, Dept Int Relat & Int Org, NL-9700 AS Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Lobo-Guerrero, L (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Int Relat & Int Org, NL-9700 AS Groningen, Netherlands.",l.e.lobo-guerrero@rug.nl,"Lobo-Guerrero, Luis/ABG-1250-2020","Lobo-Guerrero, Luis/0000-0002-9233-3034",,,,,79,10,10,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

We use both the bivariate and multivariate nonparametric synchronicity measures proposed by Mink et al. (2007) to assess that linkage. We find a low to mild (mild to strong) degree of synchronization between oil price and stock market returns (volatilities). In a very few instances, we find very strong (above 80 percent) associations between these variables. These results hold irrespective of whether we assume that stock market participants form adaptive or rational expectations about the price of oil.

The number of patients as well as prescriptions to treat this disease has continuously increased over the past few years. The aim of the present study was to analyse the costs for treating ADHD patients from the perspective of a major German health insurance fund. Anonymised administrative claims data were available for the study. All services reimbursed by the health fund for the selected ADHD patients were recorded. Apart from the resource use attributed directly to ADHD, co-morbidities as well as incremental costs were described based on a control group design. A total of 30,264 ADHD patients were diagnosed in 2008. The total costs for these patients were a,not sign3,888, and the incremental costs were a,not sign2,902. The largest proportions of incremental costs were due to therapeutic devices and remedies like occupational therapy amounting to a,not sign1,270. Proportionate costs of a,not sign263 have been settled for pharmacotherapy with Methylphenidate and Atomoxetine. However, 41 % of the patients were not treated with ADHD-related pharmaceuticals. ADHD costs are relevant from health insurance perspective. The expenses for occupational therapy constitute the cost driver. Compared to the findings of studies from the United States and contrarily to the backdrop of public discussions about considerably increased prescriptions of ADHD-specific drugs, the significantly higher additional expenses for occupational therapy services are impressing. This kind of therapy is internationally rather unknown and is therefore not acknowledged as a therapeutic standard.","[Braun, Sebastian] Herescon GmbH Hlth Econ Res & Consulting, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Zeidler, Jan] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Linder, Roland; Engel, Susanne; Verheyen, Frank] Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care, Hamburg, Germany; [Greiner, Wolfgang] Univ Bielefeld, Fac Hlth Sci, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; University of Bielefeld,"Braun, S (通讯作者)，Herescon GmbH Hlth Econ Res & Consulting, Konigsworther Str 2, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",braun@herescon.com,,,,,,,24,22,22,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We expect differences in the returns to education between these groups due to different levels of control over the use of their human capital. The analysis employs the German Socio-Economic Panel and accounts for the endogeneity of education and non-random selection. Results indicate that the returns to a year of education for opportunity entrepreneurs are similar to the paid employees' rate of 8.8%, but 3 percentage points lower for necessity entrepreneurs. Pooling the two types of entrepreneurs tends to understate the value of education for opportunity entrepreneurs and may spark misguided hopes concerning necessity entrepreneurs. The results may also partly explain Europe/US differences in average entrepreneurial returns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ICLs have been shown to be theoretically optimal in terms of efficiency in the presence of risk aversion, adverse selection and moral hazard, and have attractive equity properties. Recognition of their benefits has led to their adoption for tertiary education tuition fees in countries including Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. Since the design of ICLs relies on the prediction of the underlying costs, we explore the extent to which the complexity of earnings modeling affects the estimation of loan subsidies. The use of Australian data allows us to compare our simulated debt repayments to actual repayments under the Australian Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). Our findings reveal that the complexity of earnings modeling has considerable implications for the calculation of loan subsidies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Through the example of Thames Water and its purchase in 2006 by an international consortium of investors led by the Australian bank, the Macquarie Group, this article sets out a model of leveraged debt made possible though the predictable nature of revenue streams captured from households who have no choice over their water supplier or the amount that they have to pay.","[Allen, John; Pryke, Michael] Open Univ, Dept Geog, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Open University - UK,"Allen, J (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Dept Geog, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",j.r.allen@open.ac.uk; michael.pryke@open.ac.uk,,,,,,,55,100,105,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

The quintessential essence of Isotropic (or Isobenefit) Urbanism is to solve Systemic Retroactive Game problems downstream rather than upstream and, also, to give a beautiful city to everyone, rather than just to the richer. Spatial Equilibrium assumptions, Underground Hedonic Theory and Isobenefit Lines, are shortly reminded in order to have a better vision of the Isotropic approach. The Isotropic City is the habitat of a virtual future society that aspires to live in a city where each individual can enjoy an equal level of wellbeing and advantage from the urban quality, services and job location. It is shown by a few visionary examples of virtual future societies habitats such as the Ring City (a city without the 'city centre', where the 'city centre' is all around the peripherical ring, or in a series of rings), the Homogeneous City (a city where the 'city centre' is everywhere), the Annulus City (a city without any geometrical centre in the city) and the Punctiform City (an interconnected net of urban hyperdense 'points' throughout nature, parks and lands). Finally I will show some simulations on more realistic cases which could be of interest as support to urban and public policies in respect to a social well-being point of view as well as to urban theory such as urban economy (i.e., by the relation between an Isobenefit scenario and Property value), urban morphology (influence of different urban forms), urban sociology (how a different location of centralities and amenities gives advantage for social life and wellbeing of citizens).

The Aid for Trade Initiative succeeded in mobilizing quickly a large amount of financial resources. However, because the Doha Round talks stalled, the aid mobilized could not support the implementation of a multilateral agreement. Instead, it was spent on various projects, some of them not clearly related to trade. This affected developing countries confidence in the Initiative. To make matters worse, in the midst of a fiscal crisis that threatens development budgets, the Initiative had difficulties showing convincing results. In order to preserve resource mobilization, the WTO is expanding the scope of the Initiative to new areas only remotely related to trade and the trade and development nexus.

As such, they operate within the context of traditionally studied drivers of forest management on private lands, but also manage their lands within the context of the contentious debate about how the Shawnee National Forest is managed. We posited that this debate about the management of public land could affect forest management actions on private parcels. We also studied the effects of traditional drivers in private forest landowner research: land characteristics, demographics, and landowner objectives. Mail survey results for private forest landowners in the southernmost 11 counties of Illinois were used to examine the factors influencing the adoption of four actions: seeking advice from a forester, obtaining a written forest management plan, doing a commercial timber harvest, and implementing timber stand improvement. Results highlighted that traditional personal factors-financial objectives and parcel size-were strongly related to forest landowner management action adoption. Landowners' actions were largely independent of proximity to the Shawnee National Forest and largely independent of overall satisfaction with Shawnee National Forest management. In the context of decreasing parcel size and generally low financial objectives for private forestland parcels, we emphasize the need for policy and practice to better adapt to address these trends in order to maintain sustainable forest management across the landscape.

Following Jim Dator's alternative futures method, the five alternative future scenarios include four alternative scenario archetypes (growth, discipline, collapse, and transformation) and one preferred future scenario. After reviewing South Korea's history and current situation as well as the existing forecasts of the possible futures, we address the uncertainty about the future in the five alternative scenarios: (a) the Republic of Samsung scenario, (b) the great Han River flood in a warmer South Korea scenario, (c) the big global family phenomenon scenario, (d) the Age of Biotechnology scenario, (e) peaceful unification as a dream come true scenario. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the enhancement of the vivid narratives and imagination characterizing each scenario to provide dramatic insights regarding the emotional and symbolic meanings, and to envision Korea's preferred future that will transform Korea into a better society.

Shrimp has more substitutes than other crustaceans, and lobster has less substitutes than others. The demand for crab and lobster grow faster than the demand for shrimp and crawfish when expenditure increases. Promotion has positive effects on market shares and sales volume of own products and negative effects on cross-products. Shrimp price-reduction promotion strategies will be effective in term of raising shrimp sales value.

The aim of our study is to compare two TTO variants that address this issue: lead-time and lag-time TTO. Quota sampling was undertaken in June 2011 in Buenos Aires as part of the EQ-5D-5L Multinational Pilot Study. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the TTO variants with two blocks of five EQ-5D-5L health states. Tasks were administered using a web-based digital aid (EQ-VT) administered in a group interview. A total of 387 participants were included [mean age 38.85 (SD: 13.97); 53.14 % females]. The mean observed values ranged from 0.44 (0.59) for state 21111 to 0.02 (0.76) for state 53555 in the lead-time group and between 0.53 (0.52) and 0.08 (0.76) in the lag-time group. There were no statistically significant differences in the values between TTO variants, except for a significant difference of 0.19 for state 33133. In both variants, marked peaks were observed around the value 0 across all states, with a higher percentage of 0 responses in the last state valued, suggesting ordering effects. No important differences were found between TTO variants regarding values for EQ-5D-5L health states, suggesting that they could be equivalent variants. However, differences between the two methods may have been obscured by other aspects of the study design affecting the characteristics of the data.","[Augustovski, Federico; Rey-Ares, Lucila; Irazola, Vilma] Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy IECS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Augustovski, Federico] Univ Buenos Aires, Sch Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Oppe, Mark] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Devlin, Nancy J.] Off Hlth Econ, London, England",University of Buenos Aires; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Augustovski, F (通讯作者)，Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy IECS, Dr Emilio Ravignani 2024,C1414CPV, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",faugustovski@iecs.org.ar,"Devlin, Nancy/M-3816-2014",,,,,,14,29,29,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, the potential changes in the distribution of scores have never been addressed. It is unclear if the decline was caused by deterioration in student performance levels at the upper and/or lower tails of the distribution. In an effort to address this issue, we propose the use of the relative distribution method developed by Handcock and Morris (1999). Our findings suggest that the decline of average-test scores is mainly caused by a worsening in the position of all students throughout the distribution of scores and is not specific to a unique quantile of the distribution. In addition, we find that changes in student composition, for the most part, explain the gap in the distribution of test scores during the first biennium of analysis (1997-1999).

Yet there is no comprehensive framework for defining and assessing equity, nor is there a methodology for determining differences in definitions among forest stakeholders. We've employed an analytical framework to a case study of the FSC in Brazil to assess if FSC equity goals are coherent and adherent to its policies, standards and impacts, what factors in FSC's implementation are influencing that coherency, and whether FSC's policies on equity match expectations of stakeholders affected by certification. We found that contextual market factors, local capacity, and procedural rules governing the certification process influence FSC's implementation in an asymmetric way, favoring the certification of large industrial firms over community-based operations. Meanwhile FSC policies and standards prioritize procedural and contextual equity within the operations of individual certified firms. This contrasts with the expectations of local stakeholders focused on distributive outcomes. In general, FSC's ability to reach both its own and local stakeholder goals for equity relies on the proactive agency of actors committed to overcoming the many barriers to local benefit that are both external and internal to certification itself.

J,"Montiel-Molina, C",,,,"Montiel-Molina, Cristina",,,Comparative assessment of wildland fire legislation and policies in the European Union: Towards a Fire Framework Directive,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Fire use; Integrated fire management; Multilevel governance; Wildfire,,"Wildfires are one of the main risks affecting European forests, particularly in Mediterranean countries. Socio-economic changes, certain forest management actions and other policy measures outside the forest sector have generally influenced the flammability of ecosystems and increased the risk of large wildfires. Policy and legislation have great relevance in fire management in order to face the new realities that are bringing about fundamental changes within the forest sector. This paper presents the assessment of the main strengths and weaknesses of the national and regional fire legislation and policy documents in Europe in order to consider their contributions to integrated fire management. The assessment is based on the information obtained through a questionnaire sent to the national representatives of the Expert Group on Forest Fires - a group linked to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), established by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission-, and national fire technicians, and also on other relevant databases with information about wildfires and national forest policies. The territorial scope covers the European Union including its 27 Member States. The scales considered for the policy analysis are the national level for centralised countries and the regional level for decentralised countries. As a result of the analysis of the existing wildfire legal framework and policy instruments, current opportunities, threats, challenges and demands regarding fire management in Europe have been identified. Furthermore, some common ecological and socio-economical patterns have been recognised at the regional level, which were used to provide recommendations to policy-makers and to set the basis for a new legislation and policy measures relative to integrated fire management, adapted to each territorial context. Finally, a Framework Directive is considered as the best legal instrument for promoting the concept of Integrated Fire Management in Europe. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Where humans interact with the landscapes, changing their flammability and acting as fire initiators or suppressors, fire regimes may change. Developing an objective and quantitative method for detecting short-term changes in fire regimes could be of paramount importance for addressing the effectiveness of fire management measures. We used the change point approach to detect shifts in fire frequency and extent in a 100-year fire dataset of two Swiss cantons (Ticino and Valais) differing in environmental, socioeconomic and legal context. We then analyzed the detected changes in fire regimes in the light of the implemented fire policy and the socio-economic evolution. Our results show the suitability of the approach for detecting change points. We found in particular that in the less fire-prone Canton of Valais, major driving forces that yield shifts in fire regimes are of climatic and socio-economic origin, whereas in the fire-prone Canton of Ticino fire policy measures also contributed to detectable changes. Fire legislative measures led to reduced fire frequencies, whereas improvements in fire-fighting resulted in a reduction of burnt area. Policy makers may learn from such analyses for planning future measures. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We study the role of four distinct strands of economic socialization (providing pocket money, jobs at home, work for others, and parental encouragement) using a Dutch sample of young adults (age 18-32, n = 392). Results show positive links between parental encouragement and ability to control spending, saving preferences, future orientation, conscientiousness, and saving. A sample of teenagers (age 14-15, n = 548) and their parents (256 mothers, 227 fathers) is drawn for a Norwegian study of economic socialization. Analyses reveal a small difference in the socialization of adolescents from poorer and less educated backgrounds: they are less likely to receive pocket money and to have part-time work but are more likely to have piggy banks and savings accounts at a younger age. Variations in the economic socialization by parents highlight the importance of financial education in schools. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

They find that greater risk-taking incentives lead executives to invest more in research and development (R&D) projects and less in capital expenditures. Greater managerial risk-taking incentive increases firm focus. Managerial risk-taking incentives have positive effects on firms' leverage. Overall, increasing the sensitivity of chief executive officers' portfolio value to stock return volatility helps incentivize executives to work harder, as sharing gains and losses with shareholders aligns the interests of executives and shareholders. In addition, the results indicate that state control of firms has a negative effect on R&D investment, and this suggests that state-controlled firms should take more initiative to innovate.","[Huang, Yi-Ting; Liao, Szu-Lang] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Money & Banking, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Wu, Ming-Cheng] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Business Educ, Changhua, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; National Changhua University of Education,"Wu, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Business Educ, Changhua, Taiwan.",yitinghuang@livemail.tw; mcwu@cc.ncue.edu.tw; liaosl@nccu.edu.tw,"huang, yiting/HDM-3648-2022",,,,,,36,10,10,6,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

It has been described as the fourth pillar of the international maritime regulatory regime, alongside three major IMO Conventions on safety at sea and marine pollution control. The challenge, the authors argue, will be to enforce it within the existing inspection frameworks of flag State implementation and port State control. Technically, the responsibility rests on the former, but the proliferation of flags of convenience suggests that the latter will have a crucial part to play too, as will, in either case, inspector training.","[Piniella, Francisco; Maria Silos, Jose] Univ Cadiz, Dept Maritime Studies, Cadiz, Spain; [Bernal, Francisca] Univ Cadiz, Dept Labour Law, Cadiz, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz; Universidad de Cadiz,"Piniella, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cadiz, Dept Maritime Studies, Cadiz, Spain.",francisco.piniella@uca.es; josemaria.silos@uca.es; francisca.bernal@uca.es,"Santamaría, Francisca Bernal/AAC-8177-2020; Santamaría, Francisca Bernal/AAC-6274-2020; Piniella, Francisco/K-2962-2013","Santamaría, Francisca Bernal/0000-0002-6744-3290; Piniella, Francisco/0000-0002-9084-4658",,,,,36,15,18,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

We present a global analysis of the transformative pathway of biodiversity using the social maturation framework of issue progression through six phases: Observation, Theorization, Popularization, Challenge, Governance and Normalization. Biodiversity is currently caught at a critical juncture between the Challenge and Governance phases. Movement from the Popularization to Challenge phase around 1990 occurred with intensified public discourse about biodiversity. The ongoing decline in biodiversity could be expected to trigger public concern and movement into the Governance phase, but this has not yet occurred. We hypothesize that benefits from expansion of the human ecological footprint acting in the opposite direction to biodiversity decline dampen system response. This dampening limits resolution of key debates and societal consensus about incorporating biodiversity into legislative and market systems. High quality independent science that connects with public discourse is needed to mobilize decision-makers at multiple scales. Ensuring the new Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) connects to non-government actors who catalyze issue-based social discord about biodiversity risks would help ensure future governance and normative responses.

Certification processes include commitments to respect the rights of Aboriginal peoples. However, there has been little investigation into the relationship between certification and Aboriginal rights. This paper examines the effectiveness of certification in addressing a range of First Nation concerns, taking the example of FSC's National Boreal Standard, applied in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, Canada. This is done through documentary analysis of audit reports for all public land certificates in this region, with particular attention paid to 'conditions' (required changes) issued as part of the audit process. Results indicate that 86% of FSC certifications led to at least one condition relating to First Nations' rights, but that most were deemed minor. The two most common issues flagged by conditions were: agreement for the management plan and the evaluation and protection of First Nations' resources and sites. Analysis of subsequent reports revealed that all conditions were resolved within the allotted time period. A qualitative analysis of conditions revealed a tendency for auditors to accept partial conformance when evaluating compliance. We conclude that FSC certification is pushing forest managers to make progress on a wide variety of fronts, but through a lens of 'continual improvement' rather than strict conformance with the standard.

Our study evaluates the concept and its support in the Dutch health care context. We discuss arguments in the Netherlands for using proportional shortfall and difficulties in transitioning from principle to practice. In doing so, we address universal issues leading to a systematic consideration of equity concerns for priority setting in health care.

As the computational results show, the quality of solutions and the algorithm speed are suitable enough to be used in real world problems.","[Azimi, Parham; Saberi, E.] Fac Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran",,"Azimi, P (通讯作者)，Fac Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran.",p.azimi@yahoo.com; Sab_sml@yahoo.com,,,,,,,29,3,3,0,11,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The operator is very suitable to deal with the situation where the input arguments are represented in uncertain pure linguistic variables. And the IUPLHHA operator can reflect the importance degrees of both the given uncertain linguistic variables and their ordered positions. Also, in the situations where the information about all the attribute weights, the attribute values and the expert weights are expressed in the form of linguistic label variables, we develop an approach based on the IUPLHHA operator for multiple attribute group decision making with uncertain pure linguistic environment. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its feasibility and practicality.","[Bo, Peng; Chunming, Ye] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology,"Bo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71271138]; Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund of Ministry of Education [10YJA630187]; Ningbo Natural Science Foundation [2013A610286],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund of Ministry of Education; Ningbo Natural Science Foundation,"The authors are very grateful to the editor and the anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

Marketing strategies help make decisions that will help us to bring the subject to market activities. The current trend is a knowledge-based society, skills, abilities, information, storage, transmission. Our marketing strategy focuses on four key issues: production, respectively service, price, distribution channels and advertising. It is important to know, how to develop an individual's current self-image. Implementation strategies are then engaged in transforming decisions into concrete action, meaning, that the decision has to be taken with regard to flexibility and acceptance. Methodology: The sample consists of 4,420 respondents, men and women in three age groups 0-15 years, 16-40 years and 41-60 years. All responded to one question, Where is your center. Respondents had to show on their body. The question was chosen very sensitive, not to predict the answer. Terms soul, psyche, personality would be very manipulative, and therefore were excluded. In line with expectations, the majority of respondents have shown to their head, chest and abdomen, but were also unconventional answers, but in accordance with the preferred self-image and values of the individual. Results: Lessons from research outputs were analyzed by the following processes: general description, item-total correlation, exploratory factor analysis of individual areas and correlation analysis of individual items. We found medium correlations between area of body abdomen and age to 15 years were significant. Mean Item-total correlation for Areas of body were: head was.35 and chest.43 and abdomen.22. In the descriptive statistics we found, that most respondents preferred the chest, followed by the head and abdomen. Discussion and conclusions: As for the distribution of respondents into three age groups, we found differences between men and women. Next, we analyzed the relationship between the areas of the body and gender. Statistically significant differences were found on the chest, where women scored more than men, and we also found significant differences in the abdominal area, where men scored more than women. Individuals in the category up to 15 years preferred orientation of the abdomen and their self-concept is actually structured in through concrete experience, where the primary needs and food play a dominant role. Group working people in age from 16 to 40 years confirmed the distribution and their self-concept is primarily structured in the fulfillment of social needs. In the last group with the longest life experiences, people in age from 41 to 60 years has seen a shift away from a transcendent values rather specific to the mental. Customer behavior is determined by our self-image, the individual who created it. Consciously and unconsciously self-image controls the behavior of the customer.","[Gugova, Gabriela Rozvadsky] Dubn Inst Technol, Dubnica Nad Vahom 01841, Slovakia",,,gugova@dti.sk,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,472,480,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600044,0

The operational research community has developed both the theory and practice of problem-structuring methods (PSMs) to help stakeholders determine a solvable joint problem perception. Problem structuring is typically conducted via facilitated modelling (group negotiation) in workshops. This review investigates problem-structuring activity within participatory forest planning over the period 2002-2011. A total of 32 research articles were studied and summarized. It was found that problem structuring is widely scattered in different continents, but most of the explicitly named PSMs arise from south-eastern Asia or Africa. Sophisticated problem structuring seems rather rare in forest planning, but some good examples bring evidence that encourages the use of facilitated modelling in participatory forest planning. Evoked activeness among stakeholders signals meaningful social learning, while improved knowledge exchange, anticipated 'sense of ownership' by stakeholders and commitment to the process were the main observed positive effects of problem structuring. However, problem 'structuring needs good facilitation as well as modelling and decision-analysis expertise. Attention must be paid to ensure participants' comprehension and to explicate the goals and rules of problem structuring with participants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

More particularly, expert opinion can signal policy-makers what kind of societal demands deserves primary political attention and whose interests are of secondary importance. The empirical analysis examines how the perceived importance of shareholders interests among German corporate law experts developed throughout the twentieth century and how this development influenced the political process underlying corporate governance reforms. After a stakeholder-oriented view had dominated the legal discourse for many decades, corporate lawyers put greater emphasis on shareholders interests in the 1990s. It is also shown that legal experts used their position as advisors for both the opposition and the government to infuse a shareholder-centred vision of corporate law into the rule-making process and to make the extension of shareholder rights appear a politically compelling response to the internationalization of financial markets and the growing economic power of institutional investors.","Univ Bamberg, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Klages, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Lichtenhaidestr 11, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany.",philipp.klages@uni-bamberg.de,,,,,,,85,8,8,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Using stakeholders' perceptions, this study evaluates the existing restricted RS wood trade and provides insights for developing a sustainable trade policy by involving private landowners as a strategy for improving its conservation in the wild. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats-Analytic Hierarchy Process framework was used to analyze perceptions of four stakeholder groups (Administrators. Landowners, Traders, and Knowledgeable Sources). There was a consensus among the stakeholders that the challenges for sustainable RS wood trade outweigh the positive features. High price of RS wood and availability of niche international market were seen as the most important Strengths. Long gestation crop (+40 years), lack of Incentives, small land holdings, administrative complexities, and competition from commercial agriculture crops were identified as the main challenges. Results indicate that before proceeding with an imminent policy change, it is important to address the major challenges. These results provide a basis to prioritize and address the existing challenges and reinforce the positive features of RS wood trade. A sustainable wood trade policy formulated by incorporating stakeholders' perceptions may help in improving the conservation status of this endangered species. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We further assess the possible positive and negative aspects related with implementation of this status, to gain better insight on the possibilities for improving the current state of environmental impact assessment in the Slovak Republic. An extensive national questionnaire survey was conducted from July to September 2012 among environmental assessment practitioners. The main data collection was carried out by online survey - e-mail distributed questionnaires - using Google docs technology. Survey was completed by 136 respondents. The survey results show that the environmental assessment practitioners would in general welcome the implementation of the Natura licensed experts status in the Slovak Republic (more than 70 % answered positive). Furthermore 78.7 % of them believe that this would contribute to a higher quality of EIA documentation related to Natura 2000 sites. In regard to implementing the Natura licensed experts status in practice, we have identified main positive and negative aspects in the survey results. It seems that one of the main challenges for implementing this status is to develop an effective competency framework.

The youth has the future but the older has the authority,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In this paper the German-Hungarian international representative comparative youth surveys have been used as basic reference points (15-24 years old youth, 1984/1985). The social changes in the last decade have had a dramatic effect on both the Hungarian and German societies, which are represented by university students' opinion as well (1985 2000). The civilization theory of Margaret Mead proved to be a useful principle in interpretation of the common European youth cultural style. At the radical social changes, common high pessimistic characteristics can be found in the relation of the future-orientation and generations' attitude scale of German and Hungarian youth. In the 10-15 year period after the political system change significant difference can be observed in the future-orientation of German and Hungarian youth attitude. In this paper we discuss in detail the connection between the pessimistic youth attitude and its effect on sustainable development. We argue that sustainable development can be imagined only if the optimistic youth attitude has effect on the negative demographical changes in Europe. Our goal was to discover new life sentiments which can be detected from the opinions of today's Hungarian youth. According to our hypothesis, young people experience the enlarging process of EU as peripheral participants representing that both the optimistic and pessimistic youth attitudes equally refuse to grow up more children in family, which suggest that the sustainable development is not in the focus of their future orientation.

We considered 16 impact scenarios, based on various states of future economic growth conditions, global climate change conditions, timber supply impacts, and adaptation activities. Our findings reveal that the physical and economic impacts of climate change in Canadian forests may be substantial and will not be distributed equally across Canada's regions. For instance, without adaptation, Manitoba. Saskatchewan and the Territories' forestry and logging sector may be hardest hit, losing over 30% of its output value, thereby reducing output and GDP in other sectors by over 18%. On the other hand, provinces such as Quebec and to a lesser extent Ontario could gain up to 2% in their forestry and logging and other sector output and GDP. With adaptation, the negative impacts are reduced and the positive impacts are increased in all regions. In this case, Atlantic Canada in particular could realize output and GDP gains, at up to 2% compared to a no climate change, no adaptation scenario. Net present value analysis indicated that, under all scenarios considered, such adaptation activities as planting new tree species and increasing pest and fire control could be supported on economic grounds. Overall, this analysis can be said to provide the first (and preliminary) estimates of regional economic impacts from climate change in Canadian forests.

In addition to reviewing the relevant trends, the paper offers three scenarios based on fixed, flexible, and improvisational frameworks and within-, pan-, and non-spatial jurisdictions. The solutions depicted in the scenarios draw heavily on innovative uses of information technology. In combination, the frameworks and IT solutions lead to the reconsideration of several fundamental precepts about the legal system. For example, could conducting legal proceedings only in cyberspace violate due process guarantees and could the lack of in-person interactions bias case outcomes? Are pan-jurisdictional courts constitutional and are the potential unintended consequences of these courts acceptable? The vision of an improvisational, non-spatial international court system raised the questions of whether a non-governmental entity can be entrusted to manage the system and whether parties should be able to negotiate amongst themselves the frameworks for their legal processes.

We investigate the labour supply elasticities of these workers, over time, and across countries, within a ceteris paribus condition. The estimates reveal a shift rather than a movement along the supply curve. We find that ambiguities are due to the absence, in the theory, of a clear distinction between a change in consumption that is partly due to changes in the wage rate and partly due to changes in purchasing power. We apply a new pluralist approach to the standard income-leisure choice framework and provide for a more systematic and consistent method of measuring variations in labour supply, with policy implications.","Univ Ballarat, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia",Federation University Australia,"Cavagnoli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ballarat, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia.",d.cavagnoli@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of CDM A/R were estimated by analyzing the case of Khorezm region in Uzbekistan, where a mixed-species tree plantation was established on marginal cropland. The dual purposes of carbon sequestration and production of fruits, leaves as fodder, and fuelwood were studied over a seven-year rotation period. We compared the opportunity costs of land in marginal agricultural areas between this short-rotation plantation forestry and the annual cultivation of the major crops in the region, i.e., cotton, winter wheat, rice, and maize. The analyses were performed considering different levels of irrigation water availability, from 0 to 30,000 m(3)/ha, to reflect the reality of a high variability of water supply in the region. The NPV of CDM A/R ranged between 724 and 5794 USD/ha over seven years, depending on the tree species. Among the latter, Elaeagnus angustifolia L had the highest profits due to the annually recurring cash flows generated from fruit production. Temporary Certified Emission Reductions (tCER) ranged within 399-702 USD/ha after the assumed 7-year crediting period and would not suffice to cover initial investments and management costs of tree plantations. IRR peaked at 65% with E. angustifolia under the conventional afforestation and measured - 10% and 61% when considering only the tCER and the CDM A/R, respectively. In contrast, other species had higher IRRs in case of the CDM A/R. The total profits from tree plantations exceeded those of both cotton and winter wheat, even with the assumption that there was an optimal irrigation supply for these crops. Rice production was overall the most profitable land use option but required water input of 26,500 m(3)/ha/year, which is not consistently available for marginal croplands. We argue that the current global average price of 4.76 USD/tCER is insufficient to initiate forestry-based CDM projects but, in the absence of other incentives, can still motivate forestation of degraded croplands for land rehabilitation and the provisioning of non-timber products. Given the low irrigation needs of trees, 3-30% of the crop water demand, a conversion of degraded cropland to forested areas could save up to 15,300 m3/ha/year at the current tCER price. Combining the monetary value of water and carbon would enlarge the scope for CDM A/R in irrigated drylands, thus enhancing the investments in marginal land rehabilitation and strengthening the resilience of rural populations to the repercussions of climate change.

Constrained NSGA-II is used as a standard genetic algorithm for the integration and the evaluation of the proposed methodology. A typical harvest scheduling problem is examined with two objectives: a) maximization of timber volume and b) minimization of sediment levels. Two constraints are imposed: a) minimum timber yield and b) even-flows. The proposed algorithm (Spatial NSGA), gives better results for both the constrained and the unconstrained problem. Moreover, it achieves old forest compactness, although it is neither a separate objective nor a constraint, but it renders compactness as an emergent result. The purpose of the suggested approach is to support forestry decision-making by generating a set of optimal management alternatives. The implementation of the method produced a Pareto front consisting of non-dominating solutions and showing the tradeoffs between timber harvest and sediment levels in water runoff. The present approach offers potential applications to a wide spectrum of spatial planning problems beyond the one examined in this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The ANP framework helps forest managers to prioritize all alternatives and criteria with respect to each other and to develop their corresponding preferences. This study is an analysis of the environmental, economic, and social context of harvesting operations with the goal of making forest practices more sustainable and leading forest utilization to SFM.

However, the foundations for career choices are laid much earlier. Educational experts claim that female students are doing better in math and science and are more likely to choose these subjects if they are in single-sex classes. One possible explanation is that coeducational settings reinforce gender stereotypes. In this paper, we identify the causal impact of the gender composition in coeducational classes on the choice of school type for female students. Using natural variation in the gender composition of adjacent cohorts within schools, we show that girls are less likely to choose a traditionally female dominated school type and more likely to choose a male dominated school type at the age of 14 if they were exposed to a higher share of girls in previous grades.

Using information on distributions for temperature change and economic impact from recent studies assembled by the IPCC and others, I fit displaced gamma distributions for these variables. These fitted distributions, which roughly reflect the state of knowledge regarding warming and its impact, generally yield values of w*(tau) below 2%, even for small values of tau, consistent with moderate abatement policies. I also calculate WTP for shifts in the mean and standard deviation of the temperature distribution, and show how WTP, and thus the demand for abatement, are driven more by outcome uncertainty than expected outcomes.

Market potential and protection level were set out as the key economic criteria for new FTA partners. Based on these criteria, South Korea emerges as one of the EU's priorities. The EU-Korea FTA, signed on 6 October 2010, is the first of a new generation of FTAs. The Agreement is very comprehensive with regard to trade liberalization in a number of fields, including services, investment, competition, enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs), government procurement, sustainable development, cultural cooperation, and so on. Many of these policy areas are still not well regulated by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU trade policy shall be conducted in the context of the principles and objectives of EU foreign policy. Leveraging trade and foreign policy is expected to strengthen the EU's position in negotiating new FTAs. This article takes the EU-Korea PTA as a case study to examine the following core issues: the historical background of the EU's trade policy, legal basis and decision-making procedure of the new generation FTA, the main contents and special features of the EU-Korea FTA, and the impacts of the EU-Korea FTA on the WTO and third countries. For the future development of EU's FTA policy, this article also proposes an open regionalism approach to make the FTA compatible with the WTO.","[Horng, Der-Chin] Acad Sinica, Inst European & Amer Studies, Taipei, Taiwan; [Horng, Der-Chin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Horng, Der-Chin] Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan University; National Chengchi University,"Horng, DC (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst European & Amer Studies, Taipei, Taiwan.",dchorng@sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,53,11,11,0,29,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

First, the unprecedented increase in the scale of seafood output brought about extensive changes in the structure and methods of seafood production. Second, significant expansion in the seafood processing sector occurred as a result of the increase in the scale and variety of processed seafood, such as surimi (ground fish meat) and its products. There also was a concomitant upgrading of phytosanitary criteria. Third, diversity in new occupations within the distribution channel emerged with a proliferation of new wholesale markets. Fourth, there was expansive growth in the seafood trade as cultured seafood and its products were added to the export trade, and the quantity and value of seafood exports increased rapidly. Fifth, a broader variety and increased quantity of chilled and fresh seafood became available to consumers in addition to traditional frozen seafood. Interestingly, there was an apparent adjustment of taste preferences of Chinese consumers to different types and species of seafood on an ongoing basis. Additionally, seafood maintained steadier prices in comparison to other high protein commodities such as meat, eggs, and milk. However, there remain problems related to market stabilization, the lack of power of fishermen and fish farmers in market transactions, and especially issues of seafood safety, that may hinder the improvement and development of the seafood supply chain, and require the Chinese government to take effective measures.","[Sun, Chen; Che, Bin] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China",Shanghai Ocean University,"Sun, C (通讯作者)，Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 999 Hucheng Huan Rd, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",chensun@shou.edu.cn,,,,,,,12,7,8,1,59,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Especially the fundamental change in the use of environmental policy instruments since the late 1970s in different countries needs explanations: as alternatives to command-and-control instruments, other instrumental forms (e.g., market-based or cooperative forms of governance) have been discussed and successively implemented in different countries. This paper aims - against the backdrop of German ecological tax reform - to develop an analytical framework to explain the choice of environmental policy instruments better than the most important traditional approaches (naive instrumentalism and public choice). By using the analytical framework presented here, it is possible to study processes of environmental policy instrument choice without overestimating or underestimating factors that support and limit instrument change.

While unauthorized cross-border interactions in tropical forest regions are quite common, the implications for forest policies have been explored very little. This paper uses territorialisation theory to explore the presence of illegal immigrants in tropical forest borderlands and links these theories to forest policies. In the northern Bolivian Amazon, borderland territorialisation efforts become quickly enmeshed in political struggles that extended beyond the border region. When this happened, forest policy and administration become entangled in struggles for control not only over the forests and borders, but by the efforts of political parties for national control. The importance of territorialisation concepts and related theoretical principles, therefore, demonstrates that a forest policy analysis approach in tropical forest borderlands that does not include these concepts may be too limited to analyse or explain efforts of government actors and local stakeholders in the forestry sectors. Understanding forestry policies and administration in remote, inaccessible and poorly controlled forest borderlands may require not only framing the discussion within the conventional theories that are typically used in forest policy analysis, but also applying territorialisation theory and other relevant theories.

Combined with demographic, clinical and treatment satisfaction variables, they have a confounding effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study compared the sensitivity of EQ-5D, SF-6D and 15D utilities to the specific effect of diabetes complications. Utilities were compared in 319 type II diabetics with and without comorbidities and complications. Based on subsample size and confirmed diagnoses, coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) were two complications chosen for further analysis. Significant EQ-5D, SF-6D and 15D predictors were identified with OLS regression and subsequently controlled for with ANCOVA. The presence of CHD resulted in utility decrements (P < 0.001) for all instruments, whereas DR only decreased 15D utilities (P < 0.05). Gender, age, treatment satisfaction, arthropathy and diabetic foot were significant predictors throughout, whereas BMI, neuropathy and CHD for at least two utilities. After controlling for these confounding variables, 15D still discriminated between diabetics with and without CHD (P < 0.01) and DR (P < 0.05), with seven and five dimensions affected, respectively. After removing the effect of background variables, 15D utilities remain sensitive to CHD and DR. The obvious explanation is its richer descriptive system, which provides increased discriminative ability compared to EQ-5D and SF-6D, and this might be evidence for preferring the 15D in economic evaluations of interventions for diabetics. However, the need remains for further testing in other diabetes complications and more diverse patient samples.","[Kontodimopoulos, Nick; Pappa, Evelina; Chadjiapostolou, Zinovia; Arvanitaki, Eleni; Papadopoulos, Angelos A.; Niakas, Dimitris] Hellen Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, Patras 26222, Greece; [Chadjiapostolou, Zinovia] Mamatseio Gen Hosp, Kozani, Greece; [Arvanitaki, Eleni] Ag Varvara Hlth Ctr, Iraklion, Greece; [Papadopoulos, Angelos A.] Univ Athens, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med 2, Attikon Univ Gen Hosp, GR-11527 Athens, Greece",Hellenic Open University; University Hospital Attikon; Athens Medical School; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Kontodimopoulos, N (通讯作者)，Hellen Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, Bouboulinas 57-59, Patras 26222, Greece.",nkontodi@otenet.gr,"Pappa, Evelina/IWE-3404-2023","Kontodimopoulos, Nick/0000-0003-4590-6634; Niakas, Dimitris/0000-0003-0528-755X",,,,,58,45,48,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We defined the net incremental consumption, or future costs, as the change in consumption minus change in production, while differentiating between health care and non-health care consumption. Based on 2005 register-based data for the entire Danish population, we estimated the average value of annual production and consumption for 1-year age groups. We computed the net consumption in the remaining expected lifetime and the net consumption per life year gained for different age groups. Age has a profound effect on the magnitude of net consumption. When including net incremental consumption in the cost-effectiveness ratio of a health care or health promotion intervention, the relative cost-effectiveness changed up to a,not sign21,000 across age groups. The largest difference in the cost-effectiveness ratio was observed among the 30-year-olds where costs were reduced significantly due to significant future net contributions to society. This paper contains cost figures for use in cost-effectiveness analyses, when the societal perspective is adopted and future consumption and production effects are taken into account. The net consumption varies considerably with age. Inclusion of net incremental consumption in the cost-effectiveness analysis will markedly affect the relative cost-effectiveness of interventions targeted at different age groups. Omitting future cost from cost-effectiveness analysis may bias the ranking of health care interventions and favour interventions aimed at older age groups. We used Danish data for this assessment, and our results will therefore not represent true figures for other countries. We do, however, believe that the overall impact of including net production value in CEA will be similar in other countries that have similar transfers of income from the younger age groups to older age groups as well as publicly financed social and health care services.","[Kruse, Marie; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ So Denmark, Hlth Econ Unit, Inst Publ Hlth, Odense, Denmark; [Kruse, Marie; Sorensen, Jan] Univ So Denmark, Ctr Appl Hlth Serv Res & Technol Assessment, Odense, Denmark; [Kruse, Marie] Univ So Denmark, Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Odense, Denmark; [Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark,"Kruse, M (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Hlth Econ Unit, Inst Publ Hlth, Odense, Denmark.",mkru@cast.sdu.dk,"Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/A-3161-2011; Sorensen, Jan/AAN-3738-2020","Sorensen, Jan/0000-0003-0857-9267; Kruse, Marie/0000-0001-7159-8781; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/0000-0003-1137-2304",,,,,23,21,21,2,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This paper proposes the Narayan and Popp (2010) model to determine the structural break date for interest rate data in Taiwan. The break date coincides with the well-known financial crisis at the end of 2008. The empirical results in this paper show that the calibration model with the dataset after the structural break date captures the downward trend and mean reversion pattern better than with the whole historical dataset. Overall, if the interest rate is indeed nonlinear but is modeled on a simple mean reversion model, the resulting interest rate scenarios can be biased and inaccurate. Because of such a structural break nature, risk analysts must be cautious when specifying a time series process for consistent market interest rate scenarios.","[Chang, Chih-Kai] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; Feng Chia University,"Chang, CK (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taichung, Taiwan.",ckchang@fcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,17,4,4,0,6,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

We do so by conducting a field experiment among environmental economists attending a large international conference on environmental economics. The participants were, at the time of registration, randomly allocated to different treatments related to carbon offsetting. What differs from earlier default studies is that our subjects have good knowledge about the good at hand. We investigate whether the choices of these experienced individuals are affected by a pre-set default option, and we also study the effect of a treatment with no pre-set default option. Our results, together with previous findings, indicate that the effect of a default option attenuates with experience. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Zm-p60.1 is an enzyme that is part of cytokinin metabolism and can convert the inactive glycosylated form of cytokinin to its active form. Zm-p60.1 is one component that regulates the level of active hormones. Altered activity or specificity of this enzyme provides a tool which would be possible to use for fine modulation of the cytokinin level in the plant and thereby affect individual processes such as cell division, differentiation, root growth, sprout growth and other processes. Protein engineering offers a means to change substrate specificity of this enzyme. Substrate specificity of the enzyme Zm-p60.1 is determined by amino acid composition in the vicinity of active center. The tryptophan 373 position in Zm-p60.1 is involved in stacking interaction with aromatic system on the substrate. By structural folding of 33 glycosidases from GH1 family was found that the position of W373 is highly preserved. Likewise, by the multiple sequence comparison of characterized enzymes from GH1 family, it was found that the W373 is sequentially preserved with a few exceptions where in this position occur other amino acids. By saturation mutagenesis was created a library containing 20-mutants at position W373. On artificial substrates was carried out preliminary test studying the effects of mutations on the activity of mutant enzymes. None of the mutants had higher activity than the original wild enzyme form of Zm-p60.1 (W373W). As the second most active appears W373H followed by group of 4 mutants W373F, W373G, W373T and W373Y with significantly lower activity. Other mutants had little or no activity. New variants of functional beta-glucosidase Zm-p60.1 will be further studied to determine changes in substrate specificity towards cytokinin conjugates. If such a change will be found, a new glucosidases could serve as a tool for studying the hormonal system of plants.","[Turek, D.; Mazura, P.; Brzobohaty, B.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Mol Biol & Radiobiol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Turek, D (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Mol Biol & Radiobiol, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",dusanturek@seznam.cz,"Brzobohaty, Bretislav/D-7212-2012","Brzobohaty, Bretislav/0000-0002-1552-1314",,,,,8,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1279,1290,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200150,0

How much is spent on the elderly is important as they are a population group that is increasing in size. However other factors, such as death-related costs that are known to be high, need be considered as well in any expenditure projections and budget planning decisions. Objective This article analyses, for the first time in Scotland, how expenditure projections for acute inpatient care are influenced when applying two different analytical approaches: (1) accounting for healthcare (HC) spending at the end of life and (2) accounting for demographic changes only. The association between socioeconomic status and HC utilisation and costs at the end of life is also estimated. Methods A representative, longitudinal data set is used. Survival analysis is employed to allow inclusion of surviving sample members. Cost estimates are derived from a two-part regression model. Future population estimates were obtained for both methods and multiplied separately by cost estimates. Results Time to death (TTD), age at death and the interaction between these two have a significant effect on HC costs. As individuals approach death, those living in more deprived areas are less likely to be hospitalised than those individuals living in the more affluent areas, although this does not translate into incurring statistically significant higher costs. Projected HCE for acute inpatient care for the year 2028 was approximately 7 % higher under the demographic approach as compared to a TTD approach. Conclusion The analysis showed that if death is postponed into older ages, HCE (and HC budgets) would not increase to the same extent if these factors were ignored. Such factors would be ignored if the population that is in their last year(s) of life were not taken into consideration when obtaining cost estimates.","[Geue, Claudia; Briggs, Andrew; Lewsey, James] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland; [Lorgelly, Paula] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of Glasgow; Monash University,"Geue, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, 1 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland.",Claudia.Geue@glasgow.ac.uk; Andrew.Briggs@glasgow.ac.uk; Jim.Lewsey@glasgow.ac.uk; paula.lorgelly@monash.edu,"Lewsey, James/F-7546-2010; Lorgelly, Paula K/B-5400-2012; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Lorgelly, Paula/0000-0002-8990-9514",Medical Research Council Funding Source: Medline; Chief Scientist Office Funding Source: Medline,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Chief Scientist Office,,,27,33,34,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Lessons on Methodology in Legal Analysis from the Recent WTO Litigation on Renewable Energy Subsidies",JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Through the use of the recent litigation on renewable energy subsidies in the World Trade Organization ('WTO') as a case study, this article highlights the importance of methodology in legal analysis and, in particular, of integrity, coherence, and legitimacy. Reference is made to those cases where, in the presence of pressing policy considerations, the adjudicator is led to commit serious errors in order to reach what is perceived as a just and desirable outcome. Adjudicators are often called to distinguish a 'good' policy from a 'bad' one but, if the regulatory framework is not sufficiently responsive to such distinctions, the act of accommodation of law and policy may lead to 'ugly' constructions of the law. The twist of this course of conduct is that the effects of legal interpretation tweaking might not be easily confined to the case at hand and may have broader, negative implications for the legal system at large. Rather than resolving into a simple criticism of adjudicating bodies, the article argues that the ultimate responsibility for dispute settlement mistakes caused by policy pressures is that of law-makers and their inability to take the lead and reform the law.","Univ Birmingham, Sch Law, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Rubini, L (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Sch Law, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",l.rubini@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,22,24,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

However, supplementary insurance (SI) may restrict choice of insurer for basic health insurance (BI) due to a joint purchase of BI and SI. Roos and Schut (Eur J Health Econ 13(1):51-62, 2012) found that the belief in not being accepted by another insurer for SI was an important reason for not switching insurer for BI for 4 % of the non-switching Dutch population in 2006. This increased to approximately 7 % in 2009. In this paper, we provide evidence that in 2011 and 2012 approximately 10 % of the Dutch population expected that another insurer would not accept them for SI. An additional 20 % of the consumers expected to be accepted by another insurer, but only for a higher premium than other consumers with the same SI. About one-third of the elderly (55+) consumers, and more than half of the consumers with bad or moderate health status, expected their current insurer to offer them more favourable conditions for SI, in terms of acceptance and premium, than other insurers do for similar SI. However, if dissatisfied high-risk consumers, due to a joint purchase of BI and SI, do not switch insurer for BI, the disciplining effect of 'voting with one's feet' is substantially reduced. This is a serious problem that may increase in coming years. We discuss several potential solutions. Our conclusion is that the integration of BI and SI into one basic-plus-insurance is an effective solution under current EU legislation. This conclusion may also be relevant for other countries.","[Duijmelinck, Danielle M. I. D.; van de Ven, Wynand P. M.

The program (PANN 2000) was implemented by regular staff at local public health posts and consisted of offering free micronutrient-fortified food for children aged 6-24 months in exchange for routine health checkups. Our regression discontinuity design exploits the fact that the program was initially running only in the poorest communities of certain provinces.

The covariance between different types of assets could be affected by new information. Changes in the covariance, for example, could come from a stronger rebalancing between stocks and bonds. Therefore, we will analyze four different assets-government bonds, corporate bonds, money market instruments, and equities-and study the conditional correlation between them. We find that the corporate bond market tends to increase coupling in turbulent times, while the money market decreases coupling. We propose to test international spillovers taking into account a methodology for estimating the conditional mean, variance, and covariance on domestic bond and equity markets, while considering that shocks may have asymmetric effects depending on whether the news is good or bad.","[Morales, Marco] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile; [Moreno, Carola; Vio, Camilo] Cent Bank Chile, Financial Policy Div, Santiago, Chile",University Diego Portales; Central Bank of Chile,"Morales, M (通讯作者)，Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile.",marco.morales@udp.cl; cmoreno@bcentral.cl; cv2340@columbia.edu,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We analyze various waves of deliberative politics that emerged in different contexts related to the Himalayan crisis, the flow of international aid for conservation and development projects, civil conflict and democratic transition, and most recently the policy responses to climate change. The analysis shows how such deliberative politics contributed to the change or continuity of conventional authorities around forest policy and practice. It shows that despite notable participatory policy reform, the conventional authority has become further re-entrenched. Based on this analysis, we argue that efforts to understand forest policy change can be more meaningful if attention is paid to whether and how deliberative politics emerge to challenge the hegemonic claims to power and knowledge about resource governance practices. Such approach to policy analysis can open new possibilities for understanding democratic policy reform by explicating the nuances of deliberation and policy politics occurring at multiple scales.

We investigate the effects of type of good and several survey-design features on the WTP/WTA disparity, measured as the logarithm of the ratio of mean WTA to mean WTP. Confirming Horowitz and McConnell's (2002) pioneering meta-analysis, we find the disparity is smaller for ordinary private goods than for public and non-market goods, that it is not solely an artifact of using hypothetical transactions or other weak experimental or survey methods, and that it is smaller for studies using student subjects. In addition, we find that the disparity is smaller when subjects have experience valuing the good in real markets or through repeated experimental trials. In contrast to Horowitz and McConnell, we find the disparity is significantly smaller in studies using incentive-compatible elicitation mechanisms. The disparity is smaller in more recent studies, an effect that is attributable only in part to changes in study characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The effects on skills more closely related to reading and language are larger than those on skills such as numeracy skills. However, all findings in relation to reading and other cognitive skills are persistent and robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses. Although reading to children is also correlated with children's non-cognitive skills, after accounting for the endogeneity of reading to children, no causal effect remains. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A major challenge is emissions leakage. Border carbon adjustments and output-based allocation of emissions allowances can increase effectiveness of unilateral action but introduce distortions of their own. We assess antileakage measures as a function of abatement coalition size. We first develop a partial equilibrium analytical framework to see how these instruments affect emissions within and outside the coalition. We then employ a computable general equilibrium model of international trade and energy use to assess the strategies as the coalition grows. We find that full border adjustments rank first in global cost-effectiveness, followed by import tariffs and output-based rebates. The differences across measures and their overall appeal decline as the abatement coalition grows. In terms of cost, the coalition countries prefer border carbon adjustments; countries outside the coalition prefer output-based rebates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A management plan for a 30 year period was developed for (1) a Bavarian municipal forest rich in standing timber, and (2) a hypothetical forest enterprise with even-aged stands which were based on actual growth data from the municipal forest. Maximization of net present value (NPV) - which implicitly accounts for uncertainty by discounting future returns - was contrasted with two alternative objective functions which explicitly account for uncertainty: maximization of the certainty equivalent (CE) and of the value-at-risk (VAR). The sources of risk considered were hazard probabilities of trees, and price volatility. Periodic harvest volumes and resulting net revenues were smoothest and increasingly more consistent when VAR was maximized, while NPV maximization encouraged sudden, unbalanced outputs. The enterprise value - measured by NPV - was reduced by 16%. The impact of risk aversion was slightly less pronounced when initial age-class structure more closely resembled a fully regulated forest. Yet, the coefficients of variation for harvests and net revenues were reduced to 14% and 21%. However, risk aversion offered a more effective hedge than age-class structure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our aim was to investigate whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) consider different types and levels of health losses as acceptable beyond a certain age. A multicenter cross-sectional survey was performed involving RA patients at the initiation of the first biological therapy. The EQ-5D and the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) questionnaires were used to describe domain-specific health states. Patients were asked to indicate for each domain from what age and onward (between ages 30 and 80 years in 10 year intervals) they considered moderate and severe problems acceptable or alternatively never acceptable. Seventy-seven RA patients (females 86 %, mean age 50.3, disease duration 9.1 years) completed the questionnaire. Disease activity (DAS28), EQ-5D and HAQ-DI scores were mean 6.00 (SD 0.85), 0.35 (SD 0.36), 1.48 (SD 0.66), respectively. The majority of the patients considered age 70 and beyond as acceptable to have some health problems (EQ-5D: self-care 42 %, pain/discomfort 34 %, mobility 33 %, usual activities 33 %, anxiety/depression 27 %), whilst at ages 30 and 40 as not acceptable. Severe health problems were mostly (57-69 %) considered never acceptable, except the 'Usual activities' domain (acceptable from age 80 by 50.6 %). The great majority of the patients (77-96 %) were younger than what they indicated as the acceptability age limit. Similar results were found for the HAQ-DI. This small experimental study suggests that RA patients consider some health problems acceptable. This acceptability is age related and varies by health areas. Further larger studies are needed to explore explanatory variables and to compare with other diseases. Owing to the impact acceptability might have on RA patients' self-evaluation of current health state and decision-making, the topic deserves methodological improvement and further investigation.","[Pentek, Marta; Hever, Noemi Vartokne; Strbak, Balint; Baji, Petra; Brodszky, Valentin; Gulacsi, Laszlo] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Pentek, Marta; Toth, Agnes Edit] Flor Ferenc Cty Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, H-2143 Kistarcsa, Hungary; [Rojkovich, Bernadette] Polyclin Hosp Bros St John God Budapest, Dept Rheumatol 2, H-1023 Budapest, Hungary; [Czirjak, Laszlo] Univ Pecs, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, H-7632 Pecs, Hungary; [Geher, Pal] Polyclin Hosp Bros St John God Budapest, Dept Rheumatol 1, H-1023 Budapest, Hungary; [Keszthelyi, Peter] Kalma Pandy Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, H-5700 Gyula, Hungary; [Kovacs, Attila] Hosp Hungarian State Railways, Dept Rheumatol, H-5000 Szolnok, Hungary; [Kovacs, Laszlo] Univ Szeged, Dept Rheumatol, Albert Szent Gyorgy Hlth Ctr, Fac Med, H-6725 Szeged, Hungary; [Szabo, Zita] Andras Josa Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, H-4400 Nyiregyhaza, Hungary; [Szekanecz, Zoltan] Univ Debrecen Med & Hlth Sci Ctr, Inst Med, Dept Rheumatol, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Tamasi, Laszlo] Semmelweis Teaching Hosp, Dept Rehabil, Szent Ferenc Hosp Div, H-3529 Miskolc, Hungary; [Ujfalussy, Ilona] Mil Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, Natl Hlth Ctr, H-1062 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; University of Pecs; Szeged University; University of Debrecen,"Péntek, M (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",marta.pentek@uni-corvinus.hu,"Péntek, Márta/HTQ-3097-2023; Geher, Pal/Y-1620-2019; Baji, Petra/JHV-1617-2023; Szekanecz, Zoltán/GXN-0235-2022; Brodszky, Valentin/AFN-4112-2022; Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023","Péntek, Márta/0000-0001-9636-6012; Baji, Petra/0000-0003-2899-8557; Brodszky, Valentin/0000-0002-6095-2295; Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746",,,,,30,10,10,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Follow-up programmes have been proposed to improve the outcomes for these patients. We tested the hypothesis that nurse-led intensive care follow-up programmes are cost-effective. Methods A pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of nurse-led intensive care unit follow-up programmes versus standard care. A cost-utility analysis was conducted after 12 months' follow-up to compare the two interventions. Costs were assessed from the perspective of the UK NHS and outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based upon responses to the EQ-5D administered at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Results A total of 286 patients were recruited to the trial. Total mean cost was 5,789 pound for standard care and 7,577 pound for the discharge clinic. The adjusted difference in means was 2,435 pound [95 % confidence interval (CI) -297 to 5,566]. Mean QALYs were 0.58 for standard care and 0.60 for the discharge clinic. The adjusted mean difference was -0.003 (95 % CI -0.066 to 0.060). If society were willing to pay 20,000 pound per QALY then there would be a 93 % chance that standard care would be considered most efficient. Conclusions A nurse-led intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up programme showed no evidence of being cost-effective at 12 months. Further work should focus on evidence-based development of discharge clinic services and current ICU follow-up programmes should review their practice in light of these results.","[Hernandez, R.

The interaction of gender and education, we argue, has been overlooked in previous work. For only one of 22 European countries do we find a statistically significant training gap for women with a university degree-but in six countries, we find a statistically significant and sizeable training gap for women without a university degree. Multilevel analysis supports the results and shows that institutions are linked to the chances of training. In particular, a system of vocational education and training geared towards firm-specific skills enhances the female training gap.

Although precarious work exists across formal and informal employment, its nature and dimensions are most commonly researched in relation to formal work in developed economies where the loss of standard conditions can be documented. Similarly, homework is most usually discussed as a category of informal work, in the context of developing countries, within which precariousness is one among numerous aspects of adverse job quality. Applying the concept of precariousness enables homework to be assessed systematically against specific labour standards, yielding a more powerful analysis than reference to a general deficit.

This study is unique in simultaneously considering Taiwan's corporate governance, bank mergers, and the financial restructuring scheme. Unlike other literature that investigates only the characteristics of corporate governance that affect the concurrent static efficiency of bank mergers, we further use the dynamic slacks-based measure to examine the persistent and intertemporal effects on the dynamic efficiency of bank mergers. The results of this study show that major shareholders of acquiring banks have greater controlling power to decide whether to merge during the financial restructuring period. A bank merger using the financial restructuring scheme has less static and dynamic efficiency in the short run but gradually increased static and dynamic efficiency in the long run. Such an observation is consistent with the hypothesis that controlling shareholders pursue long-term efficiency in a bank merger.","[Lee, Tung-Hao; Chih, Shu-Hwa] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Money & Banking, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Chih, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Money & Banking, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",leet@nccu.edu.tw; shchih@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,14,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This phenomenon is an inherent and endemic part of the international trading system. Given this, and given the significant governing role which the WTO plays in that system, the question stands: to what extent do, or could, the WTO institutions and WTO Agreements regulate transfer pricing and, more particularly, transfer mispricing? This article considers that question. Section I introduces the topic. Section II explains the concept of transfer pricing (and mispricing). Section III identifies the institutions of the WTO (and WCO) which are relevant to the phenomenon of transfer pricing and mispricing. Section IV identifies those provisions of the WTO Agreements the operation of which could have consequences for the phenomenon of transfer pricing and mispricing, in particular Article VII of the GATT and the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement. Section V considers whether, pursuant to the terms of the CVA and GATT, transfer mispricing could be raised in the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. Finally, section VI offers a brief conclusion about the likely future treatment of transfer pricing and mispricing in the WTO.","Quadrant Chambers, London, England",,"Bastin, L (通讯作者)，Quadrant Chambers, London, England.",,,,,,,,25,5,5,0,13,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

First, this study discusses the interface between rights and custom to highlight the inherent distortions of African customary law. Second, it argues that liberal formulations of the law are limited by a set of assumptions regarding women's position in the political economy. And third, this discussion discursively assesses the debates in the literature regarding the efficacy of law in protecting women's rights to land. The discussion proceeds from a critique of two approaches to promoting gender equity in land tenure systems: the institutional approach, which deals with women's formal land rights; and the political economy approach, which deals with the structural nature of women's traditional relations to land.","Univ Witwatersrand, Polit Studies Dept, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Ossome, L (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Polit Studies Dept, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",lyn.ossome@gmail.com,,"Ossome, Lyn/0000-0001-8255-8742",,,,,65,27,31,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In this paper we apply the production function method on annual time series covering years 1991-2012 and employ the Hodrick-Prescott filter, Baxter- King and Christiano-Fritzgerald band- pass filters on quarterly data of real GDP covering the period 2000- 2012 to extract potential GDP and output gap for Romania. The production function we use is Cobb-Douglas type with constant returns to scale and Hicks neutral technological progress and the potential labor is computed considering both constant NAIRU, estimated with Ball-Mankiw's method (2002), and variable NAIRU resulted from a version of Phillips curve expectation augmented model (Greenslade, Pierse (2003)). Potential output and output gap are calculated using two different values for production elasticity with respect to capital, and both constant and variable NAIRU. Regarding the empirical applications of the filters, we conclude that the CF filter performed better, and that all the methods used show the economic crisis that affected the Romanian economy during 2008-2010.","[Andrei, Ana-Michaela; Paun, Ramona-Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Andrei, AM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",aaeconomy@gmail.com; ramona.paun@csie.ase.ro,"Paun, Ramona/AAA-7889-2020",,,,,,29,1,1,0,20,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Reciprocity work, considered here as an element of degrowth, is introduced into the well-being equation and the effects generated on well-being are investigated. A preliminary analysis demonstrates the lack of formal models of degrowth. This is due to, on one hand, an a priori ideological rejection by degrowth supporters and promoters of any formal framing; on the other to the fact that existing approaches fail, for different reasons, to comprehensively represent the definition of degrowth. The framework adopted is valid and viable and a good starting point for future research and developments. The idea of a formal representation of degrowth so that it could be made a concrete research subjects, is strongly supported. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is of current interest because many rural women engaged in housekeeping and raising children would like to work outside the home. However, the narrowness of employment opportunities, deformed branch structure of the agrarian economy, and poorly developed market for social services limit the choice of jobs and implementation of employment preferences. The aim of this paper is to study the possibilities of combining rural women's professional employment and motherhood as well as the factors that determine their choice and the constraints they face. The object of the study is rural women having 1-8 children divided into two groups - working and not working. The information base of this study is the results of a questionnaire survey of rural women of Saratov Oblast (Russia). The data were processed by using SPSS Statistics 17.0 software. The results of the study show that the increase in the part of rural women wishing to combine professional employment with the birth and upbringing of children stimulates the development of the infrastructure of childhood and flexible forms of employment in rural areas. Measures are needed for encouraging women with children to be employed. The results of this study are of an applied character and can be used when developing regional strategies for sustainable social-economic development of rural areas and implementing employment programmes.","[Blinova, Tatiana; Vyalshina, Anna] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Agr Problems, Saratov, Russia; [Rusanovskiy, Victor] Saratov State Socioecon Univ, Saratov, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Agrarian Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences,,ruandre@mail.ru,"Vyalshina, Anna/V-5999-2018",,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-2-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,35,,,,,208,216,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347133500023,0

The paper starts with a literature based approach for asserting the added value brought by business intelligence software in a company which will be used as a support for proposing a new method of determining the adjusted net assets value. These new market value oriented approaches are benchmarked for a diverse sample consisting of both BVB and NYSE listed companies. The estimated result of this research is the determination of an adjusted net assets valuation method that will take into account the value of business intelligence software a company uses and correct its goodwill. The research presents an extensive literature review and adopts a positivist paradigm in evaluating the theoretically constructed method. It also consists of a critical approach of case studies presented by literature. The importance of this research is to provide the investors with a better way of valuating adjusted net assets and, as a consequence, a company's goodwill, which can lead to better investing, practices in the future. Also, this research can provide a new and improved tool for anyone who wishes to adapt their valuation instruments to the changes resulted from technological progress. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Under country risk we understand a part of the country equity systematic risk or so called country beta within the CAPM framework. Using a regression-based approach we focus only on unanticipated component of the fundamental variables, which we find as the residuals from time series auto regressive models.

This article argues that for an understanding of power and agency in the labour market, particularly in the service and retail industry, passion needs to be given more consideration. Building on ethnographic observations and interviews with sales assistants and store managers within fashion retailing, the reasons for employees to perform 'aesthetic labour' are examined. Aesthetic labour generally refers to work practices in which workers are expected to conform to particular corporate aesthetics, management ideals or brand identities. The article argues that embodied work practices must be related to workers' own motivations. The purpose is to examine why so many people working as sales staff in the field of fashion retail claim to 'love' their work and why 'passion' is considered so important? The findings of this work are that employees are driven by emotions and affects and that aesthetic labour relies on 'the commodification of passion'. Workers dressed and talked the way they did because they identified affectively with the self-organizing principles of these retail fields. Passion made sense to the interviewees because it gave meaning to being a working subject on the neo-liberal labour market.","[McIntyre, Magdalena Petersson] Univ Gothenburg, Ctr Consumer Sci, Box 606, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"McIntyre, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Ctr Consumer Sci, Box 606, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",magdalena.petersson@cfk.gu.se,"Petersson McIntyre, Magdalena/ABD-4355-2021","Petersson McIntyre, Magdalena/0000-0003-4966-5313",,,,,40,17,18,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The study is based on analysis of the degree of interest manifested by entrepreneurs from Metropolitan Area of Iasi, to implement the sustainability aspects in their business strategies and to design some products, services, techniques and technologies with high socio-economic effects and minor environmental impact. Starting from the observation that in Metropolitan Area of Iasi operates predominantly SMEs, by trade, tourism and industry sectors, it was realized a survey based on a questionnaire. In order to establish a relevant connection between the interest of entrepreneurs from Metropolitan Area of Iasi for sustainable development and the responsibility that assumed on the management of activities with impact on the environment, we analyzed their opinions about: the barriers to the implementation of business strategies based on the sustainability principles, the interest in acquiring new information and knowledge on this concept and practices, the interest to protect the society values and the environment.

We employed a fuzzy clusters cmeans analysis, an innovative method which depicts more accurately the economical reality, compared to the hierarchical clusters method. Thus, each entity is assigned a membership degree to each cluster. The analysis indicates that trade is a vehicle of business cycle transmission, hence of globalization. Yet, this channel requires a certain amount of time in order to be effective, the results proving a degree of synchronization which can be related to the waves of accession to the European Union. The novelty of this study is given by the fuzzy cluster analysis which offers a more nuanced approach.

Industry-level consolidation and the rise in international investments are the most noticeable features of this process. Based on reviewing internationalization from internalization and transaction cost, resource based, industrial organization and managerial incentives theories, we apply the systematic review method to go through the literature concerning internationalization processes in the forest products industry during the 2000s. By linking the theories with empirical indicators in the forest products industry, we identify research gaps and formulate propositions for future research. We conclude that macro-level studies concerning policy and economic issues are relatively well represented in the literature, whereas only limited attention has been paid to micro-level studies. Based on the literature review, we argue that future internationalization research inter alia in the forest products industry should focus more on the role of corporate culture, the importance of corporate managerial capability, the multidimensional construct of sustainability, and conducting analysis within broader geographic scope than has been done so far.

Even if the problem of optimal public expenditures structure was largely debated in literature, especially from a neoclassical perspective, only a few studies have addressed the optimal composition of public expenditure in European developing countries. The findings could be valuable for policy makers, especially when one looks at arbitrary cuts in public expenditures adopted in most of these countries in recent years, as a response to the financial crisis and public debt and deficit crisis. Neither economic theory nor empirical evidence provides clear answers to the question of how the composition of public expenditures affects economic growth. Using regression analysis for data over 1995-2012 for a group of CEE countries, we estimate the correlation between the two types of public expenditures (current and capital) and economic growth. We investigate, using the Armey's model, the optimal levels of current and capital public expenditures which help maximizing economic growth. Comparing to neoclassical model, our estimations show non-optimal composition of public expenditures for the analyzed countries. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We framed the experiment to assess the impact of legitimacy perceptions: With framing we introduced the game as a protected area natural resource extraction game, while without framing the game was introduced using the usual, abstract wording. The results indicate that framing lowers extractions. The difference with non-framed extractions is not significant, however, until we control for individual legitimacy perceptions. From the perspective of ecosystem service payments our results indicate that perceptions of the current institutional context influence the extent to which participants cooperate and are willing to self-enforce their resource use.

This paper provides an analysis of the institutional performance of the Costa Rican Payment for Environmental Services Program (PESP). While recognizing its low additionality, our analysis highlights its positive long-term and indirect environmental impacts via the discontinuation of agriculture and institutional interplays. It also recognizes social impact as a secondary objective of the program, concluding that its current social performance is poor. However, it concludes that the program has higher sustainability, due to its strong legitimacy, than Coasean analyses suggest by focusing solely on its financing. Our analysis shows the risks and limitations of Coasean recommendations that focus on improving PESP cost-effectiveness. It proposes instead to strengthen the program's strategic management, to give more importance to other modalities than the forest protection one and to improve other institutions of the forest sector. This includes stricter enforcement of the law prohibiting deforestation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As PES schemes are being extensively adopted around the world, questions related to their institutional dimensions, as well as the role of different actors and contextual factors in PES initiation, design and implementation, arise. This paper seeks to gain an understanding of these issues by analysing three voluntary incentive schemes currently implemented in Catalonia: land stewardship - a predominantly private PES scheme aimed at enhancing biodiversity, mature forest reserves - a predominantly public scheme for protecting old-growth forest stands, and a hybrid public-private initiative for forest fire protection - forest defence groups. We develop a framework for the institutional analysis of PES extending earlier work on this subject, and we focus on actor and institutional interactions and outcomes that are likely to result. from scheme implementation to draw conclusions regarding the factors that influence the success and the durability of these schemes.

Another finding that deserves particular attention is that in the long run, the CDS spread is negatively related with the CDS market uncertainties.

This article first analyzes the economic feasibility of the technological changes that can be adopted by the shellfish farming sector in France. It then examines their associated social impacts. Finally, an application is carried out on the Bourgneuf Bay production area. The economic analysis addresses three issues related to HABs: (1) the economic performance of the shellfish farms in Bourgneuf Bay, (2) the costs of these new technologies, and (3) the economic viability of such an investment. Results suggest that only a few economically viable farms would be able to implement these technologies, yet this would not be an option for smaller, less profitable farms. Individual action within the context of a laissez-faire public policy, taking into account the need for technological equipment, would result in a concentration of the sector to the benefit of the largest capitalist farms, with negative effects on employment and the distribution of economic rent. Alternative ways for implementing these technological changes would require collective actions or public support.","[Agundez, Jose A.

Yet, as demonstrated by recent literature, the empirical support for the deregulatory view is ambiguous. This paper re-assesses this debate by bringing in new evidence from a larger group of countries, which includes advanced and new market economies. Using new data and paying special attention to the robustness of estimation results, we find rather thin support for the deregulatory view. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that in most cases the adverse effects of institutions disappear with small changes in the sample or the use of alternative estimators and specifications. The impact of institutions is particularly weak in new market economies, where unemployment is related primarily to macroeconomic factors. Overall, our findings challenge the policy orthodoxy that comprehensive deregulation is the universal solution to unemployment.","[Avdagic, Sabina] Univ Sussex, Dept Polit, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Salardi, Paola] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Avdagic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Polit, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",s.avdagic@sussex.ac.uk,,"Salardi, Paola/0000-0002-7224-5563",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G001995/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G001995/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,54,47,47,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We exploit different evaluations at the end of compulsory education in Norway in a difference-in-differences framework. Compared to the results at anonymously evaluated central exit exams, girls get significantly higher grades than boys when the same skills are assessed by their teacher. This gender grading gap in favor of the girls is found in both languages and mathematics. We find no evidence that the competitiveness of the environment can explain why boys do relatively better on the exam. We find some evidence that the gender grading gap is related to teacher characteristics, which indicates that the teacher-student interaction during coursework favors girls in the teacher grading.

They are adapted to disturbance cycles that occur at multiple temporal and spatial scales. They are embedded in a complex institutional system involving multiple governance structures spanning multiple ownership types. The salmon populations that inhabit the streams, rivers, and estuaries are diffuse and provide heterogeneous values to a heterogeneous user population. Management of these watersheds has been controlled by top down hierarchical land management agencies with policy dictated at the federal level, but there appears to be a transition to a more collaborative multi-level, polycentric approach based on local watershed councils. In this paper, the relevance of an emerging sub-discipline of economics, known as the New Institutional Economics, is explored as a vehicle for understanding how institutional governance structures relate to characteristics of the resource and the resource user community and guiding future watershed management policy. The recently established Watershed Councils in the state of Oregon, U.S., are explored as an example of how institutional arrangements for resource management may evolve over time. While some studies evaluate the effectiveness of this decentralized approach based on participants' opinions about process, the question of effectiveness with regards to ecosystem health remains to be addressed.

It is also noteworthy because it is the first time the WTO Members, or even a subset of them, have made an explicit reference to the issue. This article examines the direct and indirect references to the duties of corruption-reduction found in the revised agreement on government procurement and considers what such references are worth in practice and to the global efforts to control corruption.","[Schefer, Krista Nadakavukaren; Woldesenbet, Mintewab Gebre] Univ Basel, Fac Law, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Schefer, KN (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Law, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,66,3,5,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Instead, sorting by quality within degree program is the main contributor to the growing gap. Most of this sorting is due to the initial choice in which program type to apply to.

Recently, the field has attracted criticism for its focus on large-scale economic processes, such as profit accumulation based not on production, but on a diversification of financial risk management tools - a focus which ignores the way in which individuals and households experience financialisation in everyday life. In addressing this gap, theorists have sought to understand financialisation as it relates to individuals as consumers and investors, increasing their need to integrate financial calculation into daily life. This article takes the analysis two steps further. First, it argues that precarious work is actually an aspect of financialisation, based on risk-shifting by employing organisations - a process of structural change in the labour market that actually undermines individual workers' capacity to manage financial risk successfully. Second, it argues that financialisation is an ideology or narrative of individual responsibility, which seeks to legitimate structural change by promising emancipation through individual calculation. It draws on interviews with precarious workers to explore the gap between such norms of financial self-determination and the lived experience of insecure employment. It identifies this paradox of precariousness by focusing on people in professional occupations, who in theory are best placed to successfully negotiate economic change.","Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Chan, S (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",s.chan@unsw.edu.au,,"Chan, Sharni/0000-0002-7385-5427",,,,,53,25,27,0,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This study extends this line of research and explores the impact of corporate diversification on the long-term stock returns on R&D increase announcements. After controlling for the important variables in explaining the performance of R&D increases, a significantly negative association is found between the degree of corporate diversification and the long-run stock returns on R&D increase announcements. This result suggests that the costs of corporate diversification dominate the benefits regarding corporate diversification, and highlight the important effect a firm's diversification strategy has on the market valuation of R&D innovation.","[Chen, Li-Yu] Soochow Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wang, Chi-Feng] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan",Soochow University; National Yunlin University Science & Technology,"Chen, LY (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan.",lychen@scu.edu.tw; wangcf39@yuntech.edu.tw,,,,,,,35,3,3,1,25,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

J,"Kröger, M",,,,"Kroger, Markus",,,"Grievances, agency and the absence of conflict: The new Suzano pulp investment in the Eastern Amazon",FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Natural resource conflicts; Paper and pulp industry; Industrial tree plantations; Social movements; Brazil; Latin America,PLANTATIONS; INDUSTRY,"In November 2013, Suzano Papel e Celulose, a Brazilian paper company, is projected to inaugurate the world's largest pulp mill in Imperatriz in the remote state of Maranhao, Eastern Amazon. This investment will further consolidate Brazil's position as the leading exporter of wood-pulp coming from vast, corporate-controlled industrial plantations. These inland forestry investments are a feature of the second wave of large pulp projects, extending inland from the best lands in the coastal belt via accessible rivers and railroad networks. This globally significant inland expansion has been poorly studied, if at all. No publications exist on this Suzano pulp project. Empirically, this article provides a baseline study on the political economic dynamics. The case is highly relevant for conflict theory. Generally, industrial tree plantation expansion has boosted grievances, but the resistance and conflicts have varied depending on the social actors' agency. In comparison to the high-intensity conflicts between the rural social movements such as the Brazilian landless Movement (MST) and the pulp companies in most other new investments, there has been a rare absence of conflict in this case, as no movement has seized on local grievances. Conflicts cannot be studied in-depth by focusing only on conflict cases. Absence-cases open up an opportunity to revisit the question why conflicts arise. An analysis of this case allows an empirically rooted theoretical discussion on conflict causalities, which can answer several vexing questions in the study of conflicts. A new and generally applicable typology of different types of grievances is offered, and the grievances' causal relation to conflicts is examined. The importance of political dynamics and inter-personal relations in investment conflicts is emphasized. The way culture influences conflict dynamics is pondered upon by ethnography of the Brazilian conflict culture, where personal relations are more relevant in explaining conflict escalation than in the political systems with a stronger (impersonal) rule of law. The role of third parties such as other industries in the investment area is discussed. A qualitative comparative analysis of the major pulp project conflicts and their causes in Latin America is offered. Mobilization and thus conflict causality is explainable only when taking into account the types of grievances and the local, inter-personal, and organizational (state-business-movement) relations by which these are remediated and negotiated.

The paper draws on discursive approaches to new institutional theory in integrating three inter-related elements of conflict management: collaborative practices; formal and informal institutions; and the ways the policy issues are understood and communicated (framed) by the different actors in contested situations. The Discursive Institutional Conflict Management Analysis framework (DICMA) draws focus to the interaction between these three elements during conflict management efforts. It also helps to identify challenges related to each of the elements when improving conflict management, and contributes to formulating necessary policy reforms. A case study looking at the management of old-growth forest conflicts on public land in Finland is used to illustrate the applicability of the approach. The empirical analysis shows that the 'old new institutionalist' analysis is useful in explaining how history shapes the paths of the institutional reforms, how informal norms affect behaviour of natural resource management agencies, and how institutional structures create counterproductive incentive structures for the conflict management practices. However it takes the discursive approach, here applied through frame analysis, to understand the responses and strategies of natural resource management agencies in the face of the institutional challenges. Institutional and frame analyses in combination shed light to the logic behind the state forest agency's seemingly unproductive approaches to the conflicts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Different variants of capitalism have reacted in distinct ways to the collapse of the Bretton Woods System in the 1970s. Countries like the USA and the UK followed a path of financialization while Germany and countries in East Asia have pursued an export-oriented growth model. The interdependence between two variants of capitalism has contributed to the dynamics and crises of international finance for the past four decades. This imbalance of capitalisms also became an obstacle to international cooperation in regulating finance, because both variants have different preferences for international cooperation in the fields of macroeconomic policies, currency policies, as well as the regulation of financial flows and financial firms.","Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120750, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Kalinowski, T (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, 11-1 Daehyun Dong, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",kalinowski.thomas@gmail.com,"Kalinowski, Thomas/ABI-4352-2020","Kalinowski, Thomas/0000-0002-8334-3337",,,,,71,26,27,1,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The authors analyze whether the degree of threat from corporate governance and the legal environment influences value creation. Based on ninety-eight merger and acquisition deals from 1998 to 2006, this paper concludes that emerging market acquirers typically have good operating performance before transactions occur, but that the average adjusted operating performance over a three-year period following a merger transaction shows little improvement. In addition, the square relationship that exists between postacquisition performance and the level of ownership concentration provides evidence to support both the incentive and the tunneling effects of large shareholders. Furthermore, there is no significant difference in performance improvement related to the legal framework of the acquirers' home countries, but the legal quality of target nations does have an impact on acquisition performance. Finally, our results on firm-specific governance mechanisms complicate the usefulness of audit committees on company boards but support the crucial role of independent directors. The results for country-specific legal systems confirm that a secure legal environment can help curb the practice of using ownership to extract private benefits and lead to better performance by emerging market acquirers, although legal enforcement from public institutions that is too strong reduces value.","[Yen, Tze-Yu] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Minxiong, Taiwan; [Chou, Shuching] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Douliu City, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University; National Yunlin University Science & Technology,"Yen, TY (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Minxiong, Taiwan.",fintyy@ccu.edu.tw; chousc@yuntech.edu.tw; andre@essec.fr,"Andre, Paul/AAE-6453-2020","Andre, Paul/0000-0003-2462-1138",,,,,67,12,15,0,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Moreover, they argue, subsequent amendments to the regulatory framework made the scheme vulnerable to abuse, as reflected in the significant numbers of short-term workers in industries unaffected by the crisis and the emergence of a pattern of long-term short-time work.","[Brenke, Karl] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Bonn,"Brenke, K (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",kbrenke@diw.de; rinne@iza.org; zim-mermann@iza.org,"Rinne, Ulf/AAF-6676-2020","Rinne, Ulf/0000-0003-3270-7986",,,,,21,25,28,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

In this policy brief, we address three questions to help policy makers, educators, and researchers better understand census-funding models and special education finance policies in general. The first question is, what are the key advantages and disadvantages of census-funding models? The second and third questions relate to aspects of policy implementation, in the event a state legislature should choose to adopt the approach. First, we examine what options are available to mitigate concerns about the equity of funding under a census funding model. Second, we examine what other options exist for helping states and districts to contain special education costs while maintaining a high level of quality.","[Dhuey, Elizabeth] Univ Toronto, Ctr Ind Relat & Human Resources, Toronto, ON M5S 2E8, Canada; [Lipscomb, Stephen] Math Policy Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of Toronto; Mathematica,"Dhuey, E (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Ctr Ind Relat & Human Resources, Toronto, ON M5S 2E8, Canada.",elizabeth.dhuey@utoronto.ca; slipscomb@mathematica-mpr.com,"Dhuey, Elizabeth/E-4886-2012","Dhuey, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2833-4323",,,,,24,5,13,0,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

First, trade decouples some of regulation's costs from its benefits, prompting demand for stringent environmental regulations. Second, trade provides consumers with access to new varieties of goods; the associated income (substitution) effect raises (lowers) demand for strict regulation. The model predicts (1) international trade to be more environmentally beneficial than intranational trade due to a stronger decoupling effect, and (2) both intra and international trade to be pro-environment unless substitution effects are sufficiently strong. Using data on intra and international trade for the US and Canada, along with several environmental outcomes, we find robust evidence that international trade has a statistically and economically beneficial causal effect on environmental quality, while intranational trade has a harmful impact. This pattern is consistent with a moderate-sized substitution effect along with a stronger decoupling effect of international trade. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Professor King argues that economics is unique among the social sciences in having a single monolithic mainstream, which is either unaware of or actively hostile to alternative approaches. He presents a case for pluralism in economics, derived from the complex and ceaselessly changing nature of the world in which we live. He argues first, that economic reality is very complicated, so that the questions that economists ask are unlikely to have simple answers. Second, he argues that economic reality is fluid and subject to continuous change, so that the quest for a single, 'general' theory applicable to human behaviour in all societies, at all points in time, is a delusion. To illustrate the case for pluralism, Professor King will draw on the recent history of the global economy, the problems encountered in understanding it and the dangerous policy implications that have been drawn from mainstream theory.","[King, John E.] La Trobe Univ, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"King, JE (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",j.king@latrobe.edu.au,,,,,,,63,14,16,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

An extended SECI (Socialization-Externalization-Combination-Internalization) model of knowledge creation is linked to methods of artistic mediation by including appropriate actions for the different bas. This results in a framework for processing innovation in organizational settings in a new way. In light of a company case we discuss how different modes of knowledge may be created and how that may be aided with artistic mediation. We use a specific artistic orientation of action research, research-based theatre (RBT); a research strategy that includes theatre as a way to conduct scholarly research methods. This novel framework is reflected on using empirical data collected during an organizational development process in a large Finnish company. Interest has been growing among researchers and developers to find new kinds of approaches to organizational innovation. Using different kinds of artistic methods has opened up interesting possibilities, but there is still a great need for concrete examples of how artistic methods are used in 'real life situations' to facilitate collaborative knowledge creation.

Several alternative model specifications were investigated to estimate the values for all 243 states in the EQ-5D descriptive system. Only the best fitting model is presented in this paper. The analysis was conducted at an individual level to make the maximum use of the available data, and we estimated mixed models with random intercept. Models were compared through the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and the predicted values of each model.

Forest owners were asked to rate the relevance of nineteen factors representing information related to the social, ecological, and economic aspects of decision making based on a five-point Likert scale. This information was consolidated into major categories with Principal Component Analysis. Expectation maximization (EM) clustering was used to build a probabilistic private forest owner derision making typology. Six major categories of information determined 64% of the variability in decision making: non-wood goods and services, forest economics, property administration, optimization of wood production, forest protection, and minimum cutting restrictions. EM clustering revealed two decision making types differing in their attitude towards the total economic value of forests: Materialists, whose decisions are mainly related to the extractive value of forests and Non-materialists, who manage for non-extractive vale. Full-time farmers, owners living within 2 km of their holdings, and owners who permanently cooperated with the public forest service were much more likely to be Materialists. The uncertainty in private forest owner typology building and the applicability of probabilistic models of private forest owners to end-users is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We exploit unique attributes of the higher education industry to examine if training and academic ability affect the placement of university presidents within the research hierarchy of U.S. institutions. The analysis uses two data sets drawn from the American College President Survey conducted over three decades and a digitized sample of 212 curriculum vitae for presidents at top U.S. universities in 2009, to model the factors that determine who among the pool of university presidents places at Carnegie-classified research institutions. The findings suggest the rise to the presidency of a research institution depends on the investments in research-specific human capital over the entire course of a career consistent with prior evidence that the knowledge of the research enterprise is critical to the success of such institutions.

With a ratio of 200 cars for every one thousand people, Malaysia ranks among the top countries with high car ownership ratio in the region. Toyota, Honda, KIA, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Volvo are some of the global automotive companies which have set up operations in Malaysia to take advantage of the buoyant consumer demand. Thus, the automotive companies in Malaysia have spent huge amount of money for promotional strategies in order to maintain their sales. To date, the companies have introduced various strategies such as 'promotional mixed' which are advertising, internet marketing, personal selling and public relation/publicity in accordance to changes in the consumers' socio-economy, technology, and competition aspects. Nevertheless, the success of these strategies is vague. Therefore, this study aims to identify which promotional strategies have reached the consumer most and to determine to what extent these promotional strategies influence the consumers. Our model of study is based on AIDA concept and this model proposed that consumers respond to marketing messages in a cognitive (thinking), affective (feeling), and conative (doing) sequence. In addition, the population of the study is the consumers who purchase car in Malaysia. We strongly believe that the study will help the automotive companies in Malaysia to understand the so called new market and prepare them to be more competitive via promotional strategies.

The research finds that women's housework time is more strongly affected by women's relative earnings than by their absolute earnings, and neither outsourcing nor unobserved heterogeneity can explain the relationship between women's earnings and their housework time in Australia. These results indicate that Australia has a strong male-breadwinner institutional framework that continues to hinder gender equality in paid and unpaid work.","[Baxter, Janeen] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Baxter, Janeen; Hewitt, Belinda] Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Baxter, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",,"Baxter, Janeen/A-6793-2013","Baxter, Janeen/0000-0002-8723-9000",,,,,46,65,72,2,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

However, there has been relatively little study of quota markets and no published analysis of market transactions that involve barter (quota for quota) transactions which are frequently observed in multispecies ITQ systems. I propose a modified hedonic method for estimating implicit prices from these transactions and test it with Monte Carlo experiments before applying it to quota market data. The empirical analysis of implicit quota pound values from barter trades in the British Columbia groundfish ITQ supports anecdotal evidence that quota pound values do not rise above ex-vessel values even for bycatch species that are consfraining catch of other species.","NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, NOAA Fisheries, Seattle, WA 98112 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Holland, DS (通讯作者)，NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, NOAA Fisheries, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",dan.holland@noaa.gov,,,,,,,16,17,20,0,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Main success-factors for environmental investments are the local innovator, the knowledge base, the creation of an appropriate recipient space and the focus to the local production and local processing. However, by analysing the case studies, besides the success-factors, more difficulties were also observed, like the missing know-how network, the complicated tender application-systems, the lack of financial sources and the low attention from national authorities. It is important to consider the obstacles, in order to increase the use and potential of renewable energy sources.

Banks' monthly financial statements data for the period 2004 - 2012 are used. Firstly, we develop an indicator to measure institution's credit risk that reflects variance and average value of NPL corrected for loan loss reserves. It is used to compare the risk-return patterns of largest state-owned banks, and under our framework we identify how the strategies of various banks differ in retail and corporate loans, identifying 'safest' and 'riskiest' institutions. Secondly, loan growth and credit risk sensitivity to macroeconomic shocks is analyzed using vector autoregression. Macroeconomic shocks do not significantly increase NPL growth in corporate segment. However, inflation and investment growth have considerable impact on NPL growth in retail segment (which is however almost three times less than the corporate). Based on these findings we conclude that there is no reason to expect rampant rise in corporate loan defaults in response to exceptional sudden changes in macroeconomic environment in Russia, though further growth of corporate loan segment increases credit risk, while the opposite is true about the retail sector.","[Karminsky, Alexander M.] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Acad Dept Finance, Moscow, Russia; [Kozlov, Oleg S.] Fraud Investiga & Dispute Serv, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Karminsky, AM (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Acad Dept Finance, Moscow, Russia.",karminsky@mail.ru; kozlovos@mail.ru,"Karminsky, Alexander M/L-5969-2015",,,,,,14,1,1,0,1,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-3-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,19,34,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4MA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336000900003,0

These indices are then unable to detect differences at higher levels of nitrogen nutrition and provide highly variable results, depending on the variability of canopy density. For this reason, the new index based on reflectance in the red-edge band, normalized to the reflectance in the red and infrared was developed (NRERI). This index provides a nearly linear relationship to the level of nitrogen nutrition up to higher doses, while it is relatively little affected by the crop density. This index was tested in experiments with graduated nitrogen nutrition and crop density and also verified on the contrasting barley genotypes. Based on these results, the prototype of a sensor for measurement of NRERI in field conditions was also developed.","[Novotna, K.; Rajsnerova, P.; Klem, K.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Novotna, K.; Rajsnerova, P.; Klem, K.] CzechGlobe Global Change Res Ctr AS CR, Vvi, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Misa, P.] Agrotest Fyto Sro, Kromeriz 76701, Czech Republic; [Misa, M.] GRYF HB Spol Sro, Havlickuv Brod 58001, Czech Republic","Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Agricultural Research Institute Kromeriz, Ltd; Agrotest Fyto","Novotná, K (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",novotna.k@czechglobe.cz,"Novotná, Kateřina/H-6221-2014; Klem, Karel/G-9726-2014",,,,,,6,1,1,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,120,124,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800019,0

In this paper we present a model that considers both production and sales subsystems and develop a computer program to simulate the dynamic evolution of a firm, taking into consideration the above mentioned decisions.","[Paun, Ramona-Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania; [Dumitrescu, Gheorghe] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Mihalcea, Marian] CCSACBRNE, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paun, RM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania.",ramona.paun@csie.ase.ro,"Paun, Ramona/AAA-7889-2020; Paun, Ramona-Mihaela/K-6938-2014",,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The main purpose was to quantify reactions of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to soil drought during flowering period and to identify differences among four genotypes that differ in their origin. Characteristics of water atributes like relative amount of water in plant (RWC), water, osmotic and pressure potentials were measured. We quantified drought influence on four genotypes of barley. Water potential as estimation of water status, is very useful for fixing water transport in the system soil-plant-atmosphere. Gradual dehydration of the original substrate in laboratory conditions led to a gradual loss of water (RWC) from assimilatory organs and loss of turgor, which ended in plant wilting. With the gradual dehydration decreased also osmotic and water potential and loss of turgor was observed as well. Limitation of physiological processes in the case of drought during flowering period, when mechanisms of automatic compensation are broken, is the cause for a decrease in the amount of grains. We analyzed differences among genotypes in harvest reduction with statistical tools.","[Presinszka, M.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Plant Biol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Kovar, M.] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Plant Physiol, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Mendel University in Brno; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Presinszká, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Plant Biol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",m.presinszka@gmail.com,"Kovar, Marek/AHB-6490-2022","Kovar, Marek/0000-0002-1478-8383",,,,,10,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,664,668,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800115,0

The decision tool can be used with different welfare indicators, different species and production systems. It can be used to rank the economic consequences of different techniques that aim to improve welfare. We illustrate the decision tool with a case study relating to the use of triploids in rainbow trout farming.

We focus on three care decisions: the caregiver's own decision, a family decision and a recipient request. Results show that informal caregivers, engaged in care activities as a result of a family decision, are more likely to devote more than 5 h to care activities, even after allowing for endogeneity. Our findings are robust to controlling for a large number of socio-demographic characteristics, including care recipient and caregiver characteristics. Supplemental analysis, developed to explore whether care arrangements are related to informal caregiver's satisfaction, indicates that the family decision heavily penalizes informal caregivers. Given the importance of informal care activities in reducing health care costs, our findings imply that care decision processes should be taken into consideration when formulating health care policies.","[Marcen, Miriam; Molina, Jose Alberto] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Molina, Jose Alberto] Inst Study Labour IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Zaragoza; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Marcén, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Anal Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",mmarcen@unizar.es; jamolina@unizar.es,"Pérez, Miriam Marcén/V-8124-2019; Molina, Jose Alberto/H-1676-2015","Pérez, Miriam Marcén/0000-0002-1944-4790; Molina, Jose Alberto/0000-0002-9437-4606",,,,,52,8,9,0,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This generates measurement error in peer variables similar in form to the textbook case of errors-in-variables, resulting in the estimated peer group effects in an OLS regression model being biased towards zero. We investigate the problem using survey data for England from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) linked to administrative micro-data recording information for each PISA sample member's entire year cohort. We calculate a peer group measure based on these complete data and compare its use with a variable based on peers in just the PISA sample. We also use a Monte Carlo experiment to show how the extent of the attenuation bias rises as peer sample size falls. On average, the estimated peer effect is biased downwards by about one third when drawing a sample of peers of the size implied by the PISA survey design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In 1995, Taiwan's government began, via afforestation, to establish air quality enhancement zones (AQEZs) in order to promote multiple environmental benefits, including improved air quality, increased carbon sequestration, and enhanced environmental quality of life. In 2010, there were over 504 such zones. In addition to providing urban forests and green spaces, tree growth in AQEZs can sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide and, by shading and evapotranspiration, reduce energy demand and increase soil storage of organic carbon. In addition, afforestation can offset the carbon footprint of the world's population and is one of the best approaches to implementing carbon neutrality. The purpose of this study was to analyze the carbon reduction benefits of afforested AQEZs. Investigations of 48 AQEZs showed (1) a high diversity of trees planted (168 species), (2) an average density of trees of 1142/ha, (3) a forest timber volume of 23.92 m(3)/ha, lower than in standard plantations, (4) a carbon storage capacity of 9.25 tons/ha, and (5) average annual carbon sequestration of 134 ton-C/ha/yr. Carbon sequestration by AQEZs in Taiwan, although not remarkably high, is nevertheless, along with other ecosystem services provided by AQEZs, a significant and direct benefit to the urban public. This study provides a reliable basis of measureable results with which decision makers can evaluate benefits of urban forest carbon sequestration. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on research on the role of family characteristics in predicting teacher work behavior, we examine predictors of reentry. We employ survival analysis of time to reentry for exiting teachers using longitudinal data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth. We find that younger, better paid, and more experienced teachers are more likely to reenter. We also find that women are more likely to return to teaching than men. Child rearing plays an important role in this difference. Women are less likely to reenter with young children at home. We conclude that reentrants may be an important source of teacher labor supply and that policies focused on the needs of teachers with young children may be effective ways for districts to attract returning teachers.","[Grissom, Jason A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Reininger, Michelle] Stanford Univ, Ctr Educ Policy Anal, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College; Stanford University,"Grissom, JA (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",jason.grissom@vanderbilt.edu; reininger@stanford.edu,,,,,,,37,21,32,2,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

This paper aims to document the dynamic, traditional forest knowledge (TFK) of the Vi, including: forest categorization methods; routine forest utilization; land tenure and use-right arrangements; benefit-sharing mechanisms; customary regulations; and forest-related beliefs. Our analysis is based on rapid investigations conducted in two dozen Yi 'natural villages' and in-depth studies of three Yi natural villages in Nanhua County, Yunnan. The interrelationship between the forests and Yi livelihoods has developed through farming systems and daily livelihood practices. TFK has contributed to the protection of old-growth forests, which are essential to biodiversity conservation, as well as to human-nature harmonization and equitable resource access through benefit-sharing schemes. However, this knowledge appears to be vulnerable to government policy interventions, the expansion of increasingly globalized market economies, and declining interest in traditional wisdom, knowledge, and lifestyles among younger generations. Further, Yi people remain excluded from processes of policy formulation and implementation. This paper concludes that the inclusion of minority groups such as the Yi in policy formulation could substantially enhance sustainable forest management and social and economic development, while providing an avenue through which to recover and preserve rapidly-vanishing traditional knowledge and practices.

This phenomenon is limited to the top end of income distribution and concerns mainly the top 0.1, whose share of total salaries increased from 1.2 to 2 between 1996 and 2007. This increase in inequality was accompanied by some changes in the social composition of this wage elite. These include a decline in CEOs and an increase in lower rank management, such as chief officers and other administrative managers, as well as a rise in sportspersons. A sector approach shows that finance (3 of private sector employees) is responsible for half of the rise in inequality at the top end of wage distribution. We discuss the role the volume of financial activity plays in the tremendous increase of top financial wages.","[Godechot, Olivier] Ctr Maurice Halbwachs, CNRS, Paris, France; [Godechot, Olivier] LSQ CREST, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Godechot, O (通讯作者)，Ctr Maurice Halbwachs, CNRS, Paris, France.",olivier.godechot@ens.fr,,,,,,,33,66,69,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

After a theoretical introduction to the embeddedness concept, highlighting its multidimensionality and dynamics as well as the role of agency, the contribution of International Business (IB) studies and economic sociology to clarifying the embeddedness concept will be discussed. In four strands of IB literature, the environments of MNCs are characterized by assets, contingencies, resources and rules. Sociological approaches focus on the influence of the broader institutional environment on MNCs, on the micro-political and cognitive-cultural dimensions of agency and on interdependency between transnational and other social spaces.

KARST.; RISK; DECISION; CONSEQUENCES; HARVEST,"Schemes for transformation of even-aged monoculture forest management regimes into near-natural regimes are currently applied throughout the Atlantic region of Europe. This is mainly due to poor ecological stability, low economic performance, and decrease in biodiversity in existing forests. In this study, we analysed the simultaneous transformation of adjacent even-aged stands (a forest division) into mixed conifer/broadleaved stands. The case area is found in a conifer-dominated Danish forest and consists primarily of Norway spruce, European beech, Douglas fir and Sitka spruce. An economic evaluation of several transformation strategies was carried out by simulation. An area based combined Markov chain and Dynamic yield table model was used. Analyses were conducted under risk of wind throw. Strategies were defined by length of the cutting cycle and the diameter class harvest volume proportions of each tree species. As a reference point, an optimal strategy was determined using strict target diameter harvesting. It was assumed that such a regime would not achieve the desired change in stand structure due to the narrow diameter distributions of the existing stands as well as the present forest structure. Two groups of harvest strategies were analysed: passive strategies entailing harvesting mature and over-mature trees, and active strategies entailing harvest of immature, mature and over-mature trees; and three lengths of cutting cycles were applied: 2, 5 and 8 years. A transformation period of 80 years was assumed for the entire forest division. The importance of the local forest conditions was evident: for all strategies, an economically over-mature forest structure resulted in large harvest income at the beginning of transformation, leading to small differences between the strategies and thus increasing flexibility in the choice of strategy. When trees were harvested before or after economic maturity, opportunity costs depended on strategy. Such costs must be taken into account when forcing a fast transformation, e.g. for biological or recreational reasons. For the worst performing strategy, the overall loss was 34% compared with the optimal strategy in terms of total expectation value. Regarding area distribution of tree species and size classes, the differences between strategies were insignificant at the end of the transformation period. The active strategies with a 2-year cutting cycle were the least vulnerable to wind throw but had the lowest economic performances, emphasising the trade-off between vulnerability and operational costs (entry costs).

Estimating the impact of class size on learning is complicated, since children in small and large classes differ in many observed and unobserved ways. This paper uses a method of Hoxby (2000) to assess the impact of class size on the test scores of grade 3 and 5 students in Minnesota. The method exploits random variation in class size due to random variation in births in school and district catchment areas. The results show that reducing class size increases mathematics and reading test scores in Minnesota. Yet these impacts are very small: a decrease of ten students would increase test scores by only 0.04-0.05 standard deviations (of the distribution of test scores). Thus class size reductions are unlikely to lead to sizeable increases in student learning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Perceived mortality among athletes may be distorted. In this article, we examine medium-term mortality of professional soccer players in The Netherlands. More specifically, we answer two questions. First, we examine if the mortality of soccer players is significantly different from mortality in the general population. Second, we assess whether mortality varies by team. We find that mortality among soccer players is significantly lower than in the general population, with no significant between teams variation.

By drawing on scenarios for the future of the HE sector in the UK in 2035, the article argues that postgraduate research students will be the key factor that sustains the future of the Academy as universities focus more and more attention on the teaching of ever increasing numbers of undergraduate students. The paper highlights the danger of a divide occurring between the idea of the university and the notion of the Academy in the future, and the essential role that research students will play in ensuring this divide remains bridged. The article argues that it is imperative for universities to expand their postgraduate research degree provision if the Academy is to continue in the future as the foundation to knowledge creation.

Our analyses make use of institutional level panel data that we have collected for a large sample of American academic institutions. We find that other factors held constant, including our estimate of the expected share of new hires that should be female, that institutions with female presidents and provosts, as well as those with a greater share of female trustees, increase their share of female faculty at a more rapid rate. The magnitudes of the effects of these leaders are larger at smaller institutions, where central administrators typically play a larger role in faculty hiring decisions.

A mail survey was distributed to NIPF landowners throughout Mississippi to elicit their preferences concerning the utilization of logging residues from harvesting operations to produce bioenergy. When presented with hypothetical situations that compared the bioenergy utilization harvesting attributes along with those of standard clearcutting in pine plantations, more landowners preferred those associated with the bioenergy utilization scenarios, even when more money was offered for the standard clearcutting option. Older landowners with larger landholdings were less likely to prefer the bioenergy scenarios. Landowners with more formal education who were financially motivated, considered habitat management an important goal, and thought global climate change was an important issue, were more likely to prefer the bioenergy utilization scenario over the standard clearcut. This indicates that a market for logging residues, in the form of wood-based bioenergy, could increase NIPF landowner harvest rates based solely on the different harvesting attributes, and that most woody biomass feedstocks from pine plantations would be available for the production of bioenergy in Mississippi.

Therefore, any logistic solution that is said to be done for SMEs has no chance to be successful if the base lacks the opinions of SMEs. Thus, the main objective of this study is to request the opinions of SMEs in terms of logistics and discover their problems related to foreign trade activities. Furthermore, a guide is tried to be provided for state officials, SMEs, and logistics professional by suggesting possible locations to built logistic distribution centers in Turkey and stating the services that should be provided in those distribution centers. Data collected from 322 SMEs from Ankara, Denizli, and Manisa was analyzed by using descriptive, ANOVA, and t-tests. Findings reveal that, exporting SMEs and non-exporting SMEs are unsatisfied from high logistics costs regardless of their locations.

Chichelev's methodology was used to evaluate the extent of the tax burden and unavoidable payments to individuals depending on the scope of its activities.

Originality - Despite the enormous attention to the tax system as a whole, the improvement of individual tax in Kazakhstan neglected. Evaluation of the tax burden, the proposed article was first held in Kazakhstan. Application of this technique allowed us to prove the role of low individual tax issues of inequality in the country. Findings - Analysis of the relationship of inequality and individual income tax on the example of 44 countries showed that there is no clear relationship. Socio-economic content of income tax on individuals is being successfully implemented in countries where there is an effective system of income redistribution of the state budget, which is the well-developed system of social protection.

This paper examines NTFPs' role in contributing to the household economy and how different socio-economic factors may influence this contribution. Field methods involved quantitative and qualitative data collection of forest-adjacent households of Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. Results show that the contribution of different types of NTFPs to household economy varies in terms of subsistence and cash income. However, overall NTFP income is much higher than income from timber or firewood which indicates a larger dependence of the households on NTFPs. Income data analysis also finds that the poor households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs for their subsistence and cash income than the better-off households. Moreover, the study reveals that there are many other socio-economic factors at the household level such as number of members in household and total value of household implements and furniture that are significantly correlated with the NTFP income. More site-specific applied research on NTFP income and influential factors is necessary to generalize the findings for other parts of the world with similar socioeconomic and environmental settings.

The analysis presented here is based in part on literature about the vertical integration of markets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

First, operating two systems of public schools under separate governance arrangements can create excess costs. Second, charter school financing policies can distribute resources to or away from districts. Using the city school districts of Albany and Buffalo in New York, we demonstrate how fiscal impacts on local school districts can be estimated. We find that charter schools have had fiscal impacts on these two school districts. Finally, we argue that charter schools policies should seek to minimize any avoidable excess costs created by charter schools and ensure that the burden of any unavoidable excess costs is equitably distributed across traditional public schools, charter schools, and the state. We offer concrete policy recommendations that may help to achieve these objectives.

In particular, we investigate the impact of locus of control, self-esteem, and work ethics at age 15, on test scores at age 16, and on subject choices and subsequent performance at age 17-18. In particular, individuals with external locus of control or with low levels of self-esteem seem less likely to have good performance in test scores at age 16 and to pursue further studies at 17-18, especially in Mathematics or Science. We use matching methods to control for a rich set of adolescent and family characteristics and we find that personality traits do affect study choices and performance in test scores - particularly in Mathematics and Science. We explore the robustness of our results using the methodology proposed by Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2005) that consists of making hypotheses about the correlation between the unobservables that determine test scores and subjects' choices and the unobservables that influence personality.

Current data for each international indicator is compared to the 10th percentile of OECD countries and evaluated on a scale of 1-10. South Korea ranked 17th among the 30: its natural capital and quality of life indexes are relatively high, but its economic activity scores (production, consumption, and trade) are relatively low. These findings suggest that production and consumption processes must be made more environmentally and economically sustainable. Given that South Korea's green growth strategy currently emphasizes economic value, the country is moving in the right direction and our analysis projects that economic activity scores will rise in the future. This study offers a novel tool for measuring overall effects of green growth strategies, providing the information necessary to re-shape national economic plans based on current circumstances.

An unknown but significant part is constituted by activities that are not based on legally registered mining licenses. The division of formal and informal ASM is, however, dissolved in the marketing chain where trading channels are intertwined: traders buy from miners with and without a license. So far state institutions and civil society organizations have endeavoured to 'formalize' the informal sector by focusing on relatively isolated entry points in the ASM chain from production to consumption. This paper argues that future research and design of policy mechanisms needs to focus on the inter-linkages of actors and material flows within the complex intertwinement of the formal and informal ASM sectors. Our point of departure is the findings on interlocked markets within the literature on rural dependency relations, barriers for poverty eradication and agricultural development. The paper outlines the previous debate on formalization and maps out the territorial and organizational configuration of the present ASM gold chain in Tanzania and Ghana. On this basis we maintain that state action is inevitable and suggest possible institutional mechanisms to set up incentives for possible formalization pathways for African ASM gold chains.

On net, affirmative action bans lead to fewer underrepresented minorities becoming graduates of selective colleges. Although the graduation rates for underrepresented minority groups at selective institutions rise when affirmative action is banned, this may be due to the changing composition of students at these universities. Moreover, this effect is small relative to the number displaced from selective universities due to affirmative action bans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, this study aimed to answer the following questions. How does the local population represent the possible changes in riparian vegetation over time? What historical events were responsible for these possible changes? How does the local population represent concerns related to the use and maintenance of riparian vegetation? This study was carried out with 87 informants from three communities: two rural ex-settlement communities and one quilombo in Northeastern Brazil. According to the informants, there were changes in the riparian vegetation. The main causes of these changes include the type of agriculture practiced in the region and the building of a large dam to provide water to the city of Sobradinho in the state of Bahia. However, there was no significant difference between the number of informants who said that the changes were for the worse and those who said that they were for the better. In addition, the respondents reported an increase in the abundance of exotic species and a decrease in the abundance of native species. Thus, the importance of including this group of people in the process of the forest restoration that will occur in the region is emphasized because they possess information about the past vegetation changes and their causes. They can also indicate which species should be prioritized for replanting according to their usage needs and they understand the importance of conserving riparian vegetation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It remains unclear, however, how dropout can be effectively reduced, as many different factors determine student dropout. Community schools recognize this and aim to modernize education such that it better accommodates students' personal needs. As a result these schools cooperate more with external organizations, stimulate parental involvement in the educational process, and organize more extracurricular activities. This study examines the impact of Dutch community schools on student dropout. It focuses in particular on pre-vocational education, because dropout is particularly high in this educational track. Moreover, the focus is on the city of Rotterdam because this city is a frontrunner in the Netherlands in establishing community schools. Use is made of unique registration data on all Rotterdam students who were enrolled in pre-vocational education between 2004 and 2008. The impact of community schools is identified by exploiting the fact that community schools were not created before the beginning of the school year 2006/2007. This enables us to estimate the community school impact by means of a difference-in-differences estimation model combined with an iterative matching approach. The estimation results suggest that community schools are as effective as regular schools with respect to dropout reduction. Community school subsidies do not seem to contribute to reducing dropout.

This paper expands the discussion on the role and importance of backcasting towards using multiple visions as a part of strategic transport planning process. This is done by presenting a method for pluralistic backcasting, which is defined as a process where multiple visions of the future are developed in a participatory, interdisciplinary process using the Delphi method. Further, the pathways to the alternative visions are constructed with a set of policy packages in a collaborative process with key stakeholders. The pluralistic backcasting approach outlined in the paper presents a set of practical tools to support development and implementation of climate strategies and policy programmes for transport. It presents a novel, policy relevant application in the field of backcasting. The approach is tested with a case study of multiple visions of the future on CO2 emissions for transport in Finland up to the year 2050, including the identification of required policy packages to achieve the visions.

According to the attributable fraction method and based on available epidemiological data from the literature, we estimated the number of respiratory cancer cases due to each identified risk factor. We used the cost-of-illness method with a prevalence-based approach. We took into account the direct and indirect costs. We estimated the cost of production losses due to morbidity (absenteeism and presenteeism) and mortality costs (years of production losses) in the market and nonmarket spheres. The social cost of lung, larynx, sinonasal and mesothelioma cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, chromium, diesel engine exhaust, paint, crystalline silica, wood and leather dust in France in 2010 were estimated at between 917 and 2,181 million euros. Between 795 and 2,011 million euros (87-92 %) of total costs were due to lung cancer alone. Asbestos was by far the risk factor representing the greatest cost to French society in 2010 at between 531 and 1,538 million euros (58-71 %), ahead of diesel engine exhaust, representing an estimated social cost of between 233 and 336 million euros, and crystalline silica (119-229 million euros). Indirect costs represented about 66 % of total costs. Our assessment shows the magnitude of the economic impact of occupational respiratory cancers. It allows comparisons between countries and provides valuable information for policy-makers responsible for defining public health priorities.","[Serrier, Hassan; Sultan-Taieb, Helene; Bejean, Sophie] Univ Bourgogne, Lab Econ & Gest, Pole Econ & Gest, 2 Blvd Gabriel,BP 26611, F-21066 Dijon, France; [Sultan-Taieb, Helene] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Ecole Sci Gest, Dept Org & Ressources Humaines, Ctr Rech Interdisciplinaire Biol Sante Soc & Envi, Montreal, PQ H2X 3X2, Canada; [Luce, Daniele] Inst Rech Sante Environm & Travail INSERM, Fac Med, U1085, F-97154 Pointe A Pitre, Guadeloupe, France; [Luce, Daniele] Hop Paul Brousse, Ctr Rech Epidemiol & Sante Populat INSERM, U1018, F-94807 Villejuif, France",Universite de Bourgogne; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Saclay; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Paul-Brousse - APHP,"Serrier, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne, Lab Econ & Gest, Pole Econ & Gest, 2 Blvd Gabriel,BP 26611, F-21066 Dijon, France.",hassan.serrier@u-bourgogne.fr,"Béjean, Sophie/GZG-4552-2022; Serrier, Hassan/GVT-9517-2022; Luce, Daniele/J-9125-2015","Serrier, Hassan/0000-0002-5920-1830; Luce, Daniele/0000-0002-1708-4584; Bejean, Sophie/0000-0002-1042-0039",,,,,74,12,15,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, there is little empirical evidence on these effects. This paper analyses a large-scale expansion of higher education supply in Italy, which occurred at the end of the 1990s, to estimate the effects of the policy on the secondary school graduates' probability of being inactive, employed, unemployed, and on their wages. Robust difference-in-differences estimates show that the probability of being inactive decreases by 4.5 percent, as the policy significantly displaces individuals from inactivity. Those shifting across educational level have middle ability but favourable parental background, and would have worked in the family firm, or waited for a public competition had the expansion not took place, indicating that a new campus nearby induces mainly those with a low opportunity cost to enrol in university. Lack of significant effects on the labour market outcomes of the workforce provides evidence in favour of the human capital hypothesis. However, the policy may have induced too little variation in the workforce to distinguish between the human capital and signalling theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Propositions focus on microeconomics, macroeconomics, distributional and international topics, as well as pedagogy. Results indicate a movement toward an overall higher level of consensus, mainly because of a drop in the incidence of no consensus.

The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort was used as the analysis sample. We included 1300 bilingual children and 5150 English monolingual children.

Attention is focused on Southern and Midwest regions which historically have experienced a relatively large amount of land-use change between the agriculture and forest sectors. The Forest and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model-Greenhouse Gases model is used to examine responses between sectors as part of the regional afforestation policy analysis. Main findings suggest that most of afforested area in the Midwest regions remains unharvested by mid-21th century but a significant percentage of afforested area in the Southern regions shifts back to agricultural uses by this time. We also simulated a policy where carbon sequestration credits paid for afforestation are reduced 40% relative to other mitigation actions. A permanence value reduction for afforestation further promotes the harvesting of afforested stands in the Southern regions. Also, it has an impact not only on grassland pasture but also on high productive cropland. Results of this analysis are robust to lower permanence value reduction rates for higher carbon prices and can serve as upper bound of impacts for lower carbon prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A critical analysis of the Appellate Body's ruling on US-COOL,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"In US-COOL, the Appellate Body (AB) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) found that the US measure imposing country of origin labelling (COOL) requirements on livestock of domestic, foreign, and mixed origin was in violation of the obligation to avoid discrimination embedded in Article 2.1 of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). We argue that the AB could not and should not have reached this decision based on the information available to it. The AB adopted an erroneous methodology: under its view, the consistency of a measure coming under the purview of the TBT can be examined under Article 2.1 irrespective of its evaluation under Article 2.2 thereby making the two obligations distinct. The AB also failed to address the central question raised by this dispute: Does there exist an alternative to COOL that is less trade restrictive? We argue that the over-arching issue in this case should have been to determine what, if anything, the TBT Agreement did to alter or enhance the obligation of non-discrimination that was already embedded in the arsenal of the multilateral trading rules. Unless the AB asks this question in subsequent case law pertaining to the TBT, we risk seeing repetitions of similar mistakes in the future.","[Mavroidis, Petros C.] EUI, Florence, Italy; [Saggi, Kamal] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",European University Institute; Vanderbilt University,"Mavroidis, PC (通讯作者)，EUI, Florence, Italy.",Petros.Mavroidis@unine.ch,,,,,,,8,7,7,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2014,13.0,2,,,,,299,320,,10.1017/S147474561400007X,0.0,,,22,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AG5GA,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335446300007,0

For children with one MAOA variant, increases in household income have the expected positive association with education. For children with another variant, who comprise over half of the population, this relationship is much weaker.

It argues that its current understanding may be quite misleading because the concept of service is not accurately delineated and because available data are not appropriately understood. First, bearing in mind Hill's (1999) service definition, the paper discusses the extent of service-producing activities. It stresses that 'services' producing 'knowledge capturing products' should be recognized as genuine goods-producing activities. It also asserts that cross-border trade in genuine services is still scarce, even if Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have made it easier in some cases. Second, the paper explains that the picture of trade in services, which the Balance of Payments (BOP) displays, although improving, is nevertheless quite heterogeneous and blurring. Contrary to a common view, the BOP does not provide accurate information about trade of service industries. Moreover, still unfamiliar is the fact that, for several significant services, service industries are not the major actual international service traders.","Univ Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, Lab Rech Gest & Econ LARGE, Univ Strasbourg Polit Sci Inst France, F-67082 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Damien, B (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, Lab Rech Gest & Econ LARGE, Univ Strasbourg Polit Sci Inst France, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France.",damien.broussolle@unistra.fr,,,,,,,45,3,3,2,23,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Moreover, even if growth may have resulted in poverty declining in some isolated pockets, inequalities of income, wealth and access to key services have grown dramatically in the country as a whole. The beneficiaries of the growth process are confined mostly to the top quarter of the population. Furthermore, 'development' under globalization has had disastrous consequences for the environment. If 'sufficient' prosperity, distributive justice and ecological survival are the goals, business-as-usual is not an option in India. The development trajectory of the Western world and East Asia cannot be repeated in India for many reasons. The best bet is to regulate markets and integrate macroeconomic policies within a radically new socio-ecological vision capable of addressing the emerging crises. This paper discusses these points and pointers towards a new socio-ecological vision through twelve propositions about India in the global economy in the 21st century. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper deals with the development and application of an integrated log-lumber trade model that divides the globe into 20 regions. These regions play a significant role as producers and/or consumers of coniferous logs and softwood lumber. The model is calibrated using positive mathematical programming (PMP) so that the baseline scenario precisely duplicates observed 2010 bi-lateral trade flows of both logs and lumber. The calibrated model is then used to examine (1) liberalization of Russian log export taxes and (2) removal of the export restrictions on Canadian lumber exports to the United States. By permitting expanded log exports, Russian welfare increases by $23 billion, with losses to lumber consumers and producers more than covered by the gain in rents to timber land. However, the impacts on other regions in the model are surprisingly small. Likewise, removal of the export tax on Canadian lumber to the U.S. also leads to very small changes in welfare; Canada gains $91.8 million, but the U.S. loses only $16 million as it shifts lumber sales from domestic to export markets. Russia loses $485 million because it produces less logs and lumber, while the impact on other regions is imperceptible. Clearly, by modeling logs and lumber together, the overall impacts of forest policies in one region are mitigated at the global scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[van Kooten, G.

Efficient risk management also allows stakeholders to have increased confidence in the police forces and capability to deliver its outputs.

By putting focus on the employees, companies would have more motivated, satisfied and educated staff, dedicated to achieving company's business objectives, as well as promoting the product portfolio and maintaining a stimulating working atmosphere. The goal of this paper is to provide proofs that investing in the motivation of employees is one of the most important factors in successful business development, bringing in and retaining customers and increasing competitive advantage. The discipline of internal marketing is relatively new and has not yet been scientifically thoroughly investigated. The paper hence provides a detailed theoretical analysis of internal marketing from available internet databases. In addition, a concept of motivating employees is also presented. A research has been undertaken by means of in-depth interviewing on the usage and familiarity with the term internal marketing in Croatia. Eminent Croatian marketing experts with years of experience in working for medium and larger companies were interviewed in the undertaken study. The results indicate to what extent marketing experts are familiar with the concept of internal marketing. It is assumed that the results will demonstrate that, in most cases, the upper management has not yet recognised the concept as an important factor of success on the market. There are a lot of possibilities for the development of internal marketing in Croatia, taking into consideration that it does not require investments as large as those related to external marketing. Furthermore, the corresponding expenses are not affected by changes in the market, and the results can be significantly bigger. It is proposed that good relations with the upper management for the development of internal marketing are established and, values which encourage activities of internal marketing are promoted. A thorough research of internal marketing is also advocated as well as detailed planning aimed at implementing and evaluating internal marketing concept in the company.","[Blace, Dubravko; Tadic, Diana Plantic; Vrhovski, Ivana] Univ Appl Sci VERN, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Blace, D (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci VERN, Zagreb, Croatia.",dubblace@gmail.com; diana.plantic-tadic@vern.hr; ivana.vrhovski@vern.hr,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,378,389,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000035,0

We consider that the most important issue that has resulted from these reforms refers to the introduction of consolidated financial reporting in the public sector. The public sector consolidated financial statements represent a challenging topic of worldwide research and also, became a debated issue both for international regulatory body (IPSASB) and for governments. However, the objective of this article is to analyze if there is a need for consolidated financial statements in the public sector and to outline the activity of the international regulatory bodies regarding the issuance of specific standards regarding this current topic. So as to reach this main objective of the research we explore the scientific literature regarding this issue and we followed the steps taken by regulators in the development of standards regarding consolidated financial statements that can be globally used. This theoretical paper emphasizes the importance of the introduction and presentation of consolidated financial statements by public sector entities and reveals the link between these types of reports prepared by entities from private sector and public one. The main conclusion of this conceptual paper is that public sector entities should prepare these consolidated reports and the regulators and governments play an important role in taking and introducing these practices into the public sector.

Monetary adherence and turnover of Copom directors are used to test the quality of Brazilian monetary policy. Using the structural vector autoregressive techniques, two reaction functions are estimated. The result of the two reaction functions indicate that the turnover of directors in the monetary policy committee leads to an increase in the interest rate in order to keep the inflation rate around the desired target level. Thus, the turnover produces a high social cost to the economy through monetary policy. Moreover, monetary adherence - measured by the deviation of monetary aggregates from its optimal level -seems to be the ultimate exogenous variable that causes changes in the output gap and in inflation. Thus, there would be less social cost to the economy if policymakers pay closer attention to the deviations of monetary aggregates from their optimal level.","[dos Santos, Allan Silveira] Univ Estadual Maringa, Grad Program Econ, Sci, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Ambrosio Dias, Maria Helena; Dias, Joilson] Univ Estadual Maringa, Grad Program Econ, Dept Econ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Ambrosio Dias, Maria Helena] Araucaria Fdn, San Diego, CA USA; [Dias, Joilson] Natl Counsel Res CNPq Brazil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Maringa; Universidade Estadual de Maringa,"dos Santos, AS (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",allansilveira1@gmail.com; mhadias@uem.br; jdias@uem.br,,,,,,,44,2,2,1,3,DENFAR TRANSNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,ONTARIO,"58 RIDEAU HEIGHTS DR, ONTARIO, OTTAWA NEPEAN K2E 7A6, CANADA",,,978-0-9868210-5-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,10,31,,,,,,22,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353691000002,0

Since the lack of a certain and deterministic solution is a natural characteristic of problems under uncertainty, different methods proposed various schemes to solve such problems. In this paper, a new framework is developed to solve fuzzy linear programming where the problem's parameters, include objective function coefficients, technological matrix elements and right hand side values, are stated as fuzzy numbers. The proposed method is based on the notion of maximizing and minimizing sets, as a well known and widely accepted method of fuzzy numbers ranking, and tries to find a solution which optimizes the utility function of fuzzy objective functions by considering fuzzy constraints which are analyzed based on the concept of alpha-cuts and interval numbers relations. To show the applicability of the proposed method, its application is illustrated in a numerical example and its results are compared with a current method.","[Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi; Amoozad Mahdiraji, Hannan; Hashemi, Shide Sadat] Islamic Azad Univ, Kashan Branch, Kashan, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazemieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Islamic Azad University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Hajiagha, SHR (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Kashan Branch, Kashan, Iran.",s.hossein.r@gmail.com; h.amoozad@ut.ac.ir; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; shide_hashemi@yahoo.com,"Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/AAT-9996-2020; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi/ABE-8871-2020","Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/0000-0002-8382-6603; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X;",,,,,51,1,1,0,6,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The presenters wrote up their comments in the form of short essays which are collected together in this forum. The introductory piece by Jackson and Brammer challenges the conventional wisdom that irresponsible behaviour by corporations is associated with strong reputational penalties. In various ways, the Discussion Forum contributors explore why this link may be weak or highly contingent, focusing on dynamics at different levels of analysis. Karpoff identifies grey areas of firm behaviour characterized by market failures around both negative and positive externalities, and reviews evidence showing prospects and limits of reputation in this context. The next two contributions by Lange and Zavyalova address problems with the social attribution of irresponsible behaviour at a micro level of analysis. Harrington shows further how micro-level attributions are shaped by wider historical and institutional contexts by presenting evidence on how individual investors responded to the widespread fraud in wake of financial crises in the USA. Partnoy and King stress the role of public and private forms of regulation, stressing the role of macro-level institutions in defining legitimate behaviour and framing expectations about what is responsible or irresponsible. Applying these various concepts, Deephouse reconstructs the history of Apple's encounters with grey areas and the reputational consequences thereof.","[Jackson, Gregory] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Brammer, Stephen] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Karpoff, Jonathan M.] Univ Washington, Foster Sch Business, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lange, Donald] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ USA; [Zavyalova, Anastasiya] Rice Univ, Jesse H Jones Grad Sch Business, Houston, TX USA; [Harrington, Brooke] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Partnoy, Frank] Univ San Diego, Sch Law, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [King, Brayden G.] Northwestern Univ, Kellog Sch Business, Evanston, IL USA; [Deephouse, David L.] Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Free University of Berlin; University of Birmingham; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Rice University; Copenhagen Business School; University of San Diego; Northwestern University; University of Alberta,"Jackson, G (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Berlin, Germany.",gregory.jackson@fu-berlin.de; karpoff@uw.edu; don.lange@asu.edu; anastasiya.zavyalova@rice.edu; bh.dbp@cbs.dk; fpartnoy@sandiego.edu; b-king@kellogg.northwestern.edu; davidd@ualberta.ca,"Deephouse, David/AAL-4710-2020; Brammer, Stephen/ABE-2187-2021; Harrington, Brooke/AAR-4952-2020; Deephouse, David/JOZ-9389-2023; Lange, Donald/AAN-5518-2020; Brammer, Stephen J/C-5890-2009; Jackson, Gregory/E-3178-2010; Brammer, Stephen/F-8982-2018","Deephouse, David/0000-0002-2092-9787; Brammer, Stephen/0000-0003-1424-0008; Deephouse, David/0000-0002-2092-9787; Brammer, Stephen J/0000-0003-1424-0008; Jackson, Gregory/0000-0002-1593-8988;",,,,,133,30,31,2,110,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The research is aimed at the study of taxes paid into the state budget by agricultural enterprises, the dynamics of paid taxes, and tax burden for different groups of taxpayers. Tasks to achieve the set aim: to study the dynamics of agricultural sector enterprises and different legal forms; to analyse the tendencies in tax payments made by agricultural enterprises; and to compare the income tax differences for different taxpayers. The research results allowed concluding that reimbursements of taxes and different tax reliefs in the agricultural sector considerably exceed tax payments into the budget. Tax differences for agricultural enterprises of different forms have declined since 2013; thus, aligning both the tax rates and application of tax reliefs. However, the planned amendments in relation to the imposition of the income tax on subsidies from 2017 will significantly increase the tax burden of agricultural enterprises.

The paper focuses on the main task to consider the changes in the structure of rural population's economic activity in respect to the changes in the numbers and the share of a particular category of individuals in the general rural population in a dynamic perspective, differentiating between the population involved and non-involved in farm activity. The main source of the research data was the results of Agricultural Index which was applied in Poland in 2011. The research also used the materials from the Main Statistical Office and authors' previous studies. The main conclusions suggest that during the 10-year period since Poland's accession to the European Union some noticeable changes occurred in the economic activity of rural population. Demographic, educational, and social factors have played an important role. Extended education period has resulted in later entry of the youngest working age population into the labour market, which has both positive and negative consequences. It is necessary to bear in mind that activity is not a constant value assigned to a given professional or social group. Furthermore, the measurement of economic activity cannot be identical for each work station, function fulfilled or social role adopted.","[Mickiewicz, Bartosz] West Pomeranian Univ Technol, Fac Econ, PL-70310 Szczecin, Poland; [Zuzek, Dagmara K.] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Econ, Krakow, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology; Agricultural University Krakow,,Bartosz.Mickiewicz@zut.edu.pl,"Mickiewicz, Bartosz/E-8021-2016","Mickiewicz, Bartosz/0000-0002-4787-2477",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-2-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,35,,,,,164,171,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347133500018,0

Using a preliminary univariate and cross-correlation analysis, we select a short list of discriminants for the NFIs' defaults. A further filtering of risk drivers is performed via multivariate logit estimation. The econometric results suggest that three core variables form the risk profile of NFIs in default, namely: low or negative ROA, elevated NPL ratio and a rather reduced share of loans in total assets. The high discriminatory power of the EWS was confirmed by the backtesting results, as its forecasts adequately captured the moderate deterioration of NFIs' performance in the third quarter compared to the first quarter of 2013.","[Moinescu, Bogdan] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Money & Banking, Bucharest, Romania; [Costea, Adrian] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Moinescu, B (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Money & Banking, Bucharest, Romania.",acostea74@yahoo.com,"Moinescu, Bogdan-Gabriel/C-4226-2012; Costea, Adrian/B-2518-2015","Moinescu, Bogdan-Gabriel/0000-0003-2813-592X; Costea, Adrian/0000-0002-9968-0469",European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/89/1.5/S/59184],European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was supported from the European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/89/1.5/S/59184 Performance and excellence in postdoctoral research in Romanian economics science domain.",,24,5,5,0,22,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The main purpose of this paper is: (a) producing evidence regarding the effect of GRP on prices; (b) testing the hypothesis that there is a reallocation of demand from the genericated (and reference-priced) molecules to patent-protected products that have the same therapeutic indication. The analysis used a unique dataset of quantities and revenues of six therapeutic groups that were observed for more than a decade. Difference-in-differences analysis is applied. Prices are adjusted for all the regulatory interventions in the ten years of observations, to control for confounding impact of these interventions. On average, prices dropped 13 % more in groups to which GRP was applied than in other groups. Moreover, each entry of a new generic was associated with a price drop of around 2.8 %. On the other hand, GRP did not induce any significant switching towards in-patent molecules. We provide the first empirical results of the impact of GRP on prices in Italy and evidence that GRP cannot be held solely responsible for the often reported demand reallocation towards new and in-patent molecules.","[Ghislandi, Simone] Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Milan, Italy; [Armeni, Patrizio; Jommi, Claudio] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management, Milan, Italy; [Jommi, Claudio] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, I-28100 Novara, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Jommi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Largo Donegani 2, I-28100 Novara, Italy.",claudio.jommi@pharm.unipmn.it,,"ARMENI, PATRIZIO/0000-0003-3150-3332; Jommi, Claudio/0000-0002-2862-2990",,,,,22,9,11,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The early orthodoxy of modernisation theory put the state at the centre of development, giving it prime responsibility for generating development. Realisations of the shortcomings of modernisation theory and disappointment with its results led to the rise of neoliberal approaches in development thinking and action, with a focus on the shrinking state. However, in turn, the efficacy of neoliberalism has been questioned, and its human toll has been critiqued. Coupled with evidence of the success of the East Asian developmental states, the result has been a rethinking of the state and a new acknowledgment of its central role in development. Strong institutions and efficient, effective and responsive public sector management have been identified as key ingredients of capable states that made development happen. In outlining this trajectory, the article introduces the case studies that comprise this symposium.","[Turner, Mark] Univ Canberra, Sch Govt & Policy, Bruce, ACT 2601, Australia; [O'Donnell, Michael] Univ New S Wales, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Suh, Chung-Sok; Kwon, Seung-Ho] Univ New S Wales, Korea Res Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Suh, Chung-Sok] Univ New S Wales, Sch Management, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Canberra; University of New South Wales Sydney; Australian Defense Force Academy; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Turner, M (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Sch Govt & Policy, Bruce, ACT 2601, Australia.",Mark.Turner@canberra.edu.au,,,,,,,62,3,3,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Using the officially reported air pollution index (API) from 2000 to 2009, we show that these measures improved the API of Beijing during and a little after the Games, but a significant proportion of the effect faded away by October 2009. For comparison, we also analyze an objective and indirect measure of air quality at a high spatial resolution - aerosol optimal depth (AOD), derived using the data from NASA satellites. The AOD analysis confirms the real but temporary improvement in air quality, it also shows a significant correlation between air quality improvement and the timing and location of plant closure and traffic control. These results suggest that it is possible to achieve real environmental improvement via stringent policy interventions, but for how long the effects of these interventions will last will largely depend on the continuation of the interventions.

This interplay between obligation and flexibility has given rise to tension in various fora of the WTO, including in committee work, negotiations and dispute settlement. This paper brings together these three distinct strands of WTO work to illustrate core aspects of the international standards debate. In our analysis, we first briefly outline the nature of the discipline in the TBT Agreement itself; next, we describe where and how the discussion arises in the WTO; and, finally, we explore under what circumstances international standards contribute to regulatory convergence and the challenges they face in this regard. We propose that greater regulatory convergence could be fostered through a renewed focus on the procedures used by international standardizing bodies (the how) and greater emphasis on robust technical/scientific underpinnings of the standards themselves (the what).","[Wijkstroem, Erik; McDaniels, Devin] World Trade Org, Trade & Environm Div, Geneva, Switzerland",World Trade Organization,"Wijkström, E (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, Trade & Environm Div, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,38,27,31,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The authors find that conservative accounting is an important characteristic of high-quality financial reporting that can reduce the cost of longer maturity debt such as bank loans and bonds. Even state-owned enterprises, which have fewer financial constraints than non-state-owned enterprises, benefit from accounting conservatism's ability to reduce financial costs. Moreover, the findings indicate that bond investors are concerned about the issuer's fundamentals, while banks are more likely to focus on the operation and bankruptcy risk of borrowers.","[Chen, Chao] Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Song] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Beijing Normal University,"Zhu, S (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",chen_chao@fudan.edu.cn; zhusong@bnu.edu.cn,"Zhu, Songping/C-6480-2019",,,,,,41,25,33,5,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The empirical evidence suggests that CEFTA-2006 exerted a positive, significant, and large effect on trade in Southeast Europe. This finding can be largely attributed to the distracted trade flows in the region over the 1990s.

The sample is composed of firms listed on the Argentine, Brazilian, and Mexican stock exchanges from 1994 to 2009. For the small firms, the substitution hypothesis was not rejected. However, this hypothesis was not confirmed homogeneously for all the firms during the crises. Unlike Brazilian and Argentine firms, Mexican firms use more cash reserves than trade credit. The big firms tend to use other financing sources. A pattern of trade credit use by sector has not yet been found.","[Sheng, Hsia Hua] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Finance Accounting & Controllership Dept, Sao Paulo Sch Business, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Bortoluzzo, Adriana Bruscato] Insper Inst Educ & Res, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Pereira dos Santos, Gisler Andre] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation; Insper; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Sheng, HH (通讯作者)，Getulio Vargas Fdn, Finance Accounting & Controllership Dept, Sao Paulo Sch Business, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",hsia.sheng@fgv.br; adrianab@insper.edu.br; gisler_a@yahoo.com,"Bortoluzzo, Adriana/K-1511-2013","Bortoluzzo, Adriana/0000-0003-2872-031X",,,,,33,8,10,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In Taiwan, there are an estimated 1.5 million users and the majority of them are also smokers. The number of people who died from oral cancer rose more than five times over the period from 1987 to 2006. In this study, we employ propensity score matching and the Weibull hazard model with instrumental variables to examine the health effects of betel quid chewing, in particular the health effect of its combined use with cigarettes. We show that betel quid chewing and smoking have a significant negative effect on health, and that the 10-year death hazard for joint users of betel quid and cigarettes doubles that for abstainers. Moreover, betel quid chewing is as harmful to health as smoking. We also find that betel quid chewing and smoking significantly increase the odds of dying from oral and oesophagus cancers.","[Keng, Shao-Hsun; Sheu, Sheng-Jang] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung,"Sheu, SJ (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",shkeng@nuk.edu.tw; shengjangsheu@gmail.com,"Keng, Shao-Hsun/W-6172-2019","Keng, Shao-Hsun/0000-0002-7153-5892",,,,,42,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Even if the distribution of guesses is unbiased, the highest bidder is likely to have overestimated the true number and ended up with a loss. Because winning becomes an increasingly rare and informative event as the number of bidders increases, the exercise generates a dramatic winner's curse in large classes where clicker systems are commonly used. Initial guesses about the number of items tend to suffer from perception bias, and this partial failure of the wisdom of the crowds can make bids even less rational.","[Bostian, A. J.

In this paper we rely on quantity measures using gravity equation. In order to take into consideration the presence of zero flows in the database, we use a sample selection model. Then, we use the results of both stages of the model to derive tariff equivalents based on the distribution of the estimated residuals. Applying this methodology to the Eurostat database, we obtain tariff equivalents for a large number of countries and for 11 services sectors. Our main conclusions are that protection is not homogeneous among sectors for a country and that services openness is not directly linked with the level of development. Our results are robust to changes in specification, but we do find that OLS estimations overestimate the commercial openness of the countries with many zero flows.","Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Guillin, A (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria.",guillin.amelie@gmail.com,,,,,,,78,6,6,1,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2013,12.0,3,,,,,549,575,,10.1017/S1474745612000559,0.0,,,27,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,217BT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324332200005,0

In particular, we analyze whether the degree of complementarity of natural resources in consumer preferences may give rise to multiple steady states and path dependence even when resources are managed optimally. We find that, for a given social discount rate, society tends to be less willing to buffer exogenous shocks if resource good are complements in consumption than if they are substitutes. The stronger the complementarity between the various types of natural resources, the less resilient the economy is, and even more so the higher is the social discount rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Under the scheme, farmers combine tree planting and maintenance with the cultivation of food crops until tree canopy closure. This paper aims to generate lessons from the MTS with respect to its role as a social safeguard against the likely adverse impacts of the implementation of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) between Ghana and the EU to combat illegal logging, using the six social safeguard dimensions identified by the IoI Project Team (2010). It addresses the question of what the major dimensions of social safeguards are and how the MTS does relate to these characteristics. Based on a survey of 146 MTS farmers and qualitative methods, results revealed that the MTS potentially meets several of the social safeguard mechanisms distinguished by the lot Project Team (legal security for forest users, soft law enforcement by creating incentives for adaptation, benefit sharing, capacity building, alternative livelihoods/employment and expanding the resource base). The most promising of these is based on the expansion of areas with planted trees that will become available as legal timber in the future. However, the potential safeguards will only materialise if several institutional and management challenges are addressed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ros-Tonen, Mirjam A.

The EU establishes Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) with individual tropical timber exporting countries; these VPAs should be developed through a stakeholder-inclusive governance process and define national standards for timber legality. The national policy level serves as an interface between the EU policy and the local realities of forest exploitation. This article assesses whether new assemblages of timber legality standards were developed at this interface. It presents the opinions of people actively engaged in the FLEGT/VPA process in Ghana (n=38) and Indonesia (n=40) about which principles regarding timber legality, law enforcement and social safeguards were considered during the VPA negotiations' in each country. Almost half of the respondents (44%) were positive about the integrative focus of VPA discussions focusing on both forestry and livelihood issues, 40% considered it had mostly a limited focus or traditional timber sector focus, and 16% indicated a high degree of attention to social responsibility issues. There were differences in the characteristics of respondents and their opinions between Ghana and Indonesia; these reflect differences in organisation of the FLEGT/VPA process. The findings demonstrate how depending on country-specific policy processes principles from an international forest policy are adapted at national level; this may involve new assemblages of the original policy principles.

We use the example of oral antidiabetics in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2; 113,108 patients derived from a German statutory health insurance fund were analyzed. We identified 12 methodological categories as pervasive features in pharmacy claims data based NA analyses. The influence of the different methodological categories and their parameters on analysis results was tested using sensitivity analysis. To validate alternative methodological framework options, we performed multivariate logistical regression estimates using diabetes-related hospitalization/clinical events as a combined dichotomized dependent variable. The choice of parameters within the identified 12 methodological categories available has exceptional impact on the results of pharmacy data based claims NA analyses. When the full range of theoretically possible cases is considered in our sample, it can be seen that the resulting NA range is between 15.7 % and 97.0 %. The definition of the required daily dose, the decision to use either a prescription-/interval-based approach, and the classes of medication analyzed exert a notable influence on the study results. In our analysis, 69.4 % of the 216 different study design options analyzed significantly explain the likelihood of diabetes-related clinical events. We recommend strongly that methodological transparency is awarded a much more important role in the conduct of NA analyses made on the basis of pharmacy claims data.","[Wilke, Thomas; Groth, Antje; Mueller, Sabrina; Reese, Dallas; Linder, Roland] Hsch Wismar, Inst Pharmakookon & Arzneimittellogist IPAM, D-23952 Wismar, Germany; [Ahrens, Susanne; Verheyen, Frank] Techniker Krankenkasse, Wissensch Inst TK Nutzen & Effizienz Gesundheitsw, Hamburg, Germany",,"Wilke, T (通讯作者)，Hsch Wismar, Inst Pharmakookon & Arzneimittellogist IPAM, PF 1210, D-23952 Wismar, Germany.",Thomas.wilke@hs-wismar.de,,,,,,,73,17,18,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

To test this argument, we estimate spot interest rate models with dummy variable sets and derive an economic interpretation. The empirical results suggest that a relaxation of the exchange rate regime increases the independence of market-based monetary policy; however, it weakens the independence of monetary policy for forecasting future normal events, and it also imposes an ambiguous impact on the independence of monetary policy for forecasting future rare events.","[Li, Shaoyu] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Secur & Futures, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Tsai, Li-Chuan] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Xiamen University,"Li, SY (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Secur & Futures, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",lishaoyu2007@aliyun.com; lichuan.tsai@gmail.com,"li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022",,,,,,21,4,4,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We find that between 24% and 37% of graduates were over-educated shortly after course completion, with over-education most common amongst young females and least common amongst older females. Over-education rates vary markedly across major fields of study and appear to be associated with the relative demand for graduate labour. Overeducation was less common three years after course completion; however a nontrivial proportion of graduates remain over-educated. With regard to the effect of over-education on earnings, we find a notable age-related effect not reported in earlier studies. Young over-educated graduates were not penalised after unobserved heterogeneity had been addressed, whereas older over-educated graduates were at an earnings disadvantage relative to their well-matched peers.

Our findings indicate that the availability of parental health insurance can have significant effects on the probability that a young individual enrolls as a full-time student. A young individual who has access to health insurance via a parent can be up to 22% more likely to enroll as a full-time student than an individual without parental health insurance. After controlling for unobserved heterogeneity this probability drops to 5.5% but is still highly significant. We also find that the marginal effect of the availability of parental health insurance has a larger effect on older students between ages 21 and 23.

A few sensors monitoring the temperature and humidity of the surroundings were placed in the stable; the data was saved every fifteen minutes. the measurements were taken in morning hours, when all horses were asleep. We were particularly interested in the following data: breath frequency per minute, heart beats per minute and body temperature measured in rectum. All collected data were recorded into Microsoft Excel and also processed using Pearson's correlation function in Unistat 5.1. According to the calculated results, it can be said the microclimate of the observed stable is appropriate for horse stabling. A relatively high value of the correlation coefficient (r = 0.85**) was found on the first day of our research - July 19th, 2013. This value has been found when calculating of the relation of breath frequency and environment temperature. Contrary to that, a low correlation value indicates there is actually no relation between the heartbeat frequency and environment temperature. Various values of correlation have been found for the relation of relative environment humidity and the breath frequency of horses. An insignificant positive correlation is found on August 9th, 16th and 23rd, a medium-high correlation is identified on August 30th (r = 0.55), while on September 13th, 2013, it is statistically provable that the breath frequency is rising alongside with the relative environment humidity (r = 0.54**). A dependency closing in on medium negative correlation has been found for relative environment humidity and heartbeat frequency during the second stage of our research. In this timeframe, the relative environment humidity was rising, while the heartbeat frequency was dropping. Observing the dependency of relative environment humidity and body temperature has provided us with variable correlation (both negative and positive). The only statistically significant correlation has been found on August 16th, 2013; this was a positive correlation (r = 0.66**).","[Bihuncova, I; Jiskrova, I; Kost'ukova, M.; Cernohorska, H.; Oravcova, I] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Bihuncova, I (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",iveta-lorietta@centrum.cz,"Jiskrová, Iva/L-2939-2018",,,,,,7,1,1,1,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,177,183,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800029,0

The study is based on in-depth interviews with central non-governmental representatives divided into four categories: forest owners, forest industry, environmental representatives and other representatives. The paper shows that, in spite of lacking interest and engagement in this issue on the Swedish government's side, the Swedish forest owners and the forest industry have made a U-turn and now welcome some form of formalized forest policy in the EU, as it would benefit their interests. They also believe they can influence the content of the integration process. This confirms the theoretical premise that organized interests, in this case non-governmental forestry stakeholders in Sweden, can act as pressure groups for further coordination and integration. National and transnational elites and their work in transnational networks and associations seem particularly important in this context. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Lipid droplets (LDs), activity of mitochondria and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content represent the constituents important for cytoplasmic maturation of mammalian oocytes. This research provides detection of LDs, ATP content and rearrangement of mitochondria in matured porcine oocytes with different meiotic competence. In porcine oocytes mitochondria surround LDs forming so-called metabolic units. Meiotic competence of porcine oocytes is directly influenced by the size of follicle from which oocytes are derived. The meiotically higher competent (MHC) and less competent (MLC) oocytes were isolated separately from medium (6-9 mm) and small follicles (<5 mm) respectively by aspiration and cutting of ovarian cortex. LDs were stained by molecular probe Nile red. To determine localization of the lipid droplets protein, oocytes were labeled with an antibody against the lipid droplet specific protein ADRP. For vizualization of mitochondria we used special probe MitoTracker (R) Orange. The ATP content (pmol per oocyte) was detected using FL-ASC assay kit. After maturation the total area of lipid droplets was analogous between MLC and MHC oocytes (28.8% vs. 29.8%). The total number of lipid droplets was higher in MHC (296.6 +/- 109.9) oocytes in comparison to MLC oocytes (277.64 +/- 100.6). In MHC oocytes significantly higher (P<0.05) proportion of oocytes with metabolic units was discovered. The ATP content was higher (P<0.05) in MHC oocytes in comparison to MLC oocytes. In conclusion, we have shown that porcine oocytes with higher meiotic competence have greater amount of lipid droplets, higher levels of metabolic units and ATP content in comparison to less competent oocytes.","[Milakovic, I; Hanulakova, S.; Machal, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Milakovic, I; Hanulakova, S.; Jeseta, M.; Hanzalova, K.; Knitlova, Ctvrtlikova D.] Vet Res Inst, Dept Genet & Reprod, Brno 62100, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Veterinary Research Institute,"Milakovic, I (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",irena.milakovic@gmail.com,"Machal, Ladislav/K-7596-2018; Jeseta, Michal/A-3159-2013","Machal, Ladislav/0000-0001-6638-4404; Jeseta, Michal/0000-0003-1778-3454",,,,,35,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,238,246,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800041,0

Both the resource stock and capital are treated as state variables. The resource owner controls fishing effort and the investment rate in an optimal way. Biological stock growth and the capital depreciation rate are stochastic in the model. We find that the stochastic resource should be managed conservatively The capital utilization rate is found to be a nonincreasing function of stochasticity. Investment could be either higher or lower depending on the interaction between capital and the resource stock In general, a stochastic capital depreciation rate has no strong influence on optimal management. In the long run, the optimal harvest for a stochastic resource becomes lower than the deterministic level.","[Poudel, Diwakar; Sandal, Leif K.; Kvamsdal, Sturla F.; Steinshamn, Stein I.] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Poudel, D (通讯作者)，NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",Diwakar.poudel@nhh.no; Leif.Sandal@nhh.no; Sturla.Kvamsdal@nhh.no; Stein.Steinshamn@nhh.no,"Sandal, Leif Kristoffer/W-3702-2019","Sandal, Leif Kristoffer/0000-0002-5384-0316; Poudel, Diwakar/0000-0001-9604-5905","NFR [196433, 216571]",NFR(Research Council of Norway),We thank two anonymous reviewers for useful comments.

Its dynamics is exceptional and brings significant gains to many countries. Slovakia has very good conditions for tourism development, i. e. and for his components - agrotourism and rural tourism. In addition to natural attraction such as mountains, caves, lakes, healing mineral springs, rich flora and fauna. The Slovak Republic also offers a valuable historical buildings and complexes, cultural monuments, castles, palaces, buildings of folk architecture, folk expressions, traditional crafts etc. Nowadays, rural tourism and agrotourism are becoming quite frequent terms, although rural tourism in Slovakia is relatively a new form of tourism in comparison with other countries. The recognition of cultural traditions, especially the specifics of individual regions of the world, is considered one of the most profitable industries. Global trend of mass tourism circumvent and Slovakia - the country although a small size, but rich in natural, cultural and historical features. Global trend of mass tourism also does not ignore Slovakia at all - it is a country with a small size but rich in natural, cultural and historical wealth. Rural tourism and agrotourism are put down for the future of the countryside as a stabilizing factor in economic and social development. Social and economic benefits can be included to the most important in rural tourism and agrotourism from which we can mention for instance: the improvement of infrastructure, development of small and medium-sized enterprises, improving income and others. Agrotourism in Slovakia can gradually subserves several basic goals such as maintaining the traditional rural settlements and the security of landscape and ecological functions, utilization of material base of farms and private farmers for the provision of agrotourism and not only to gain additional income but also using of the available material base of rural population. Rural tourism is a higher income for the village, possibilities to create job opportunities in the village, their revitalization and also improves the living standard of the population. Entrepreneurship in rural tourism has its own certain specificities. Engaging communities and businesses in tourism development is influenced by objectives pursued by both visitors and entrepreneurs. Visitors want to spend their vacation on extraordinary places, which are connected with nature and values. Countryside represents these values and also its own way of life, traditions and the beauty of countryside, connection to nature, implementation of physical activity to health care of family, especially children, full board etc. The entrepreneurs service providers must realize these values. Successful businesses in rural tourism quality are services for visitors. Therefore it is very important to know about the technology and ways to provide rural tourism services on required standard. Slovakia is one of the most rural countries of the Europe. The exact number of agricultural entities working with agrotourism and country tourism is unknown. Customers' requirements about a good countryside vacation should encourage the entrepreneurs in rural tourism to provide their facilities with additional services. The aim of this paper is the evaluation of the position of the Slovak rural tourism and agrotourism based on the acquisition and processing of information in this field. Free available reports, materials and data published by Agricultural Paying Agency (PPA SR), professional publications, papers and other resources were used for processing this paper.

We find that student achievement increased during the years ProComp was implemented, but that these gains were observed for students taught by teachers enrolled in ProComp's alternative compensation system as well as non-participating teachers. While the findings are not consistent across grades and subjects, there is some evidence that teachers voluntarily opting into ProComp are more effective than those who do not volunteer.

However, teachers in unionised districts were less likely to leave for better pay and were more enthusiastic about teaching than teachers in non-unionised districts.

We use a flexible budget constrained output distance function model to estimate both technical and allocative efficiency scores for 448 Dutch secondary schools between 2002 and 2007. The results indicate that the average technical efficiency amounts to about 78 percent, implying that, with the given resources, schools could improve students' educational performance by 28 percent. In terms of allocative efficiency, we estimate a 0.65 percent overutilization of teachers while management and supporting personnel are underutilized.

It also reviews the evidence on the debt-growth relationship at some length. It finds that the negative relationship between debt and GDP growth is influenced by outliers or exceptionally high debt-GDP ratios. It also points out that the composition of public debt matters. Additionally, the debt-GDP relationship appears to be non-linear - positive first and turning to negative, but there is considerable variation in the estimated turning or 'tipping' point, which is not helpful as a policy guide. Historical evidence does not lend support to the concerns that the current situation is likely to cause rapid upward spiraling of public indebtedness. Finally, the argument that fiscal consolidation is possible without adversely affecting growth is not based on robust empirical evidence. This conclusion is reinforced by a succinct overview of some country-specific experiences (Denmark, Ireland and United States).","[Chowdhury, Anis] Univ Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia; [Islam, Iyanatul] Int Labor Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Islam, Iyanatul] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Western Sydney University; Griffith University,,a.chowdhury@uws.edu.au; islami@ilo.org,,,,,,,64,9,11,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

They also promised to hold themselves accountable for this commitment using a novel transparency mechanism based in the World Trade Organization. At the same time a civil society organization, the Global Trade Alert, set itself up as an alternative accountability mechanism. The WTO and the GTA reached different conclusions both about how loudly the protectionist dog barked, and about whether G-20 governments kept their promises. I conclude from a detailed comparison of GTA and WTO data and interpretations using the notion of an 'accountability regime' that the protectionist dog did not bark, allowing inferences to be drawn from this curious incident about how transparency can help to close the gap between commitment and action, thereby contributing to accountable global governance.","Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Wolfe, R (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada.",robert.wolfe@queensu.ca,,,,,,,66,13,13,0,13,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The findings suggest that firms with a less severe agency problem have more information in their repurchase announcements, buy back fewer shares, and perform better after the repurchase programs.","Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management, Zhongli City, Taiwan",Yuan Ze University,"Wu, RS (通讯作者)，Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management, Zhongli City, Taiwan.",rswu@saturn.yzu.edu.tw,,,,,,,41,4,5,0,24,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In addition to doing science to support policy, forest policy academics engage in research to expand policy sciences. The link to theory enables the forest policy researcher to generalize findings. The successful use of theory in analyzing a specific forest policy issue is a test of the theory and an important contribution to the general academic discussion of each theory. Existing theories can be adjusted and refreshed through forest policy studies. Forest policy studies have a tendency to follow trends, and choose theories that are in vogue to analyze forest policy cases. As such, forest policy science is well integrated into the broader field of policy sciences and political sciences in general. Apart from the modest contributions to the dominant policy theories, forest policy science has become internationalized over the last two decades and is thus perhaps more capable of serving as a vehicle for broad theory development and theory cross fertilization than political sciences sub-disciplines with a more narrow geographic focus.

The evidence shows that the judicial efficiency of debt enforcement had greater effects on the reorganization choice than the formalism on debtor rights written in the law books had. A higher bank debt ratio did not necessarily favor liquidation over reorganization, and creditors relied on the future value of the viable firm and judicial efficiency to decide between reorganization and liquidation.

Course evaluation scores are known to be positively correlated with students' expected grades, and this paper tests whether or not there is an incentive for the instructor to buy higher evaluation scores by inflating grades. To test this hypothesis. I use unique data from the University of Washington's Office of Educational Assessment that includes a measure of each student's relative expected grade in the course. I find that there is an incentive for instructors to grade leniently after accounting for the potential endogeneity of the relative expected grade variable due to unobserved teacher productivity and unobserved heterogeneity of instructors and departments. Instructor fixed effects account for a significant part of the measured effect of relative expected grade on evaluations, and by not including them, the estimated impact of relative expected grade on evaluations is biased upwards.

Therefore, this paper aims to empirically investigate the stability of industry beta risk over time and identify potential and unkown mean revision using the panel data unit root test with multiple structural breaks approach developed by Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2005). Time-varying beta is generated by utilizing the Kalman filtering approach for eight main monthly industry portfolio indexes over the period from January 1981 to October 2007, covering several sectors of banking, cement, construction, electrical machinery, food, plastics, pulp and paper, and textiles. The results differ from previous findings in that industry beta risk is found to exhibit time-varying characteristics as well as stationarity based upon the panel unit root test for beta series. Besides the pulp and paper, plastics, and textiles sectors, the empirical evidence reveals three distinct regime changes for the months July 1988, December 1996, and April 2000 in the case of the electrical machinery sector, as well as three distinct regime changes for the months of July 1988 and March 2001 in the case of the food sector.","[Chen, Sheng-Hung] Nanhua Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Lee, Jun-De] Minghsin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, Hsinchu, Taiwan",Nanhua University,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Nanhua Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan.",shenghong@mail.nhu.edu.tw; jundelee@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,5,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

For the evaluation -as an alternative to the comprehensive criteria and indicators on sustainable community forestry-, we propose an approach based on the core policy objectives of the program. In fact, community forestry is very much connected to the following three objectives of: 1) alleviating the poverty of forest users, 2) empowering them, and 3) improving the condition of the forests. Based on field tests in two community forests in Indonesia, the focus on the core policy objectives appears to provide a more practical approach than the use of complex criteria and indicators.

In the practical part of the experiment, doses were 4 and 5.5 kg of clay applied on 6m(2) of litter. The experiment was divided into nine experimental groups within there were placed 900 chicken meat hybrid ROSS 308. Each group had the same microclimatic conditions, including the used litter (wood shavings). There was used complete mixture BR 1 and BR 2 for fattening of all experimental groups and the fattening were fed ad libitum. The experimental period lasted from the first day to thirty-sixth day of fattening. In the stable, there were monitored ammonia, temperature (degrees C) and relative humidity (%). For measurements, there were used several data loggers observing parameters at one-minute intervals from placement in a stable. The measuring technique was positioned to record the microclimate objectively not only in the life zone of chickens, but also the average value in the whole area of stable. There was also sampled the litter in seven-day intervals with subsequent analysis on the contents of total, ammonia and nitrate nitrogen. The second part of the experiment was used for monitoring of the absorption capacity of clays in laboratory-controlled conditions with subsequent measurement of the concentration ammonia in exact time interval. The experiment was carried out in glass containers of 1 liter which were always applied to different amounts of a specific type of clay mineral (2, 4, 6 and 8 g), followed by the addition of technical ammonia (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 mu l). The concentration of the first sample of bentonite (containing 50.1% montmorillonite) was in the range from 4.3 to 94.3 ppm two days after the application (the first control measurement).

Interactions between heavy metals and proteins are important for range of physiologic processes like transpiration, photosynthesis or detoxification of organisms. In our experiment an electrochemical profile of interactions between 23 metallothionein fragments and cisplatin was studied. At first 23 MT fragments (decapeptides) were selected given by differences in aminoacids ordering. For the experiment amperometric detection implemented to flow injection analysis system (FIA-ED) was used. However a lot of results were estimated, we focused on complex formation between cisplatin and 23 MT fragments analyzed in various conditions. All the 23 MT fragments interacted with cisplatin, in the optional conditions as equimolar ratio, in physiological conditions of phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) in temperature of 37 degrees C. Based on results obtained we determined an interaction constant which defines an ability of each peptide to make an interaction with cisplatin. The highest IC was found by fragments 18 and 22 and the lowest IC by 1, 15, 12 and 19. We found that the major influence of interaction was done not by the change of near neighbouring aminoacids with the conservative cysteines byt these which were about 2 or 3 of positions far away from cysteiene.","[Sobrova, P.; Zitka, O.; Kominkova, M.; Skalickova, S.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Kizek, R.] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61600, Czech Republic; [Skutkova, S.] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn & Commun, Dept Biomed Engn, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Brno University of Technology; Masaryk University Brno; Brno University of Technology,"Sobrová, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",Papaya1@seznam.cz,"Zitka, Ondrej/L-5588-2019; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Skalickova, Sylvie/E-8430-2012; Kominkova, Marketa/D-2297-2013; Sobrova, Pavlina/E-1090-2012; Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012","Zitka, Ondrej/0000-0001-7607-5058; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Skalickova, Sylvie/0000-0002-2808-001X;",,,,,12,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1265,1271,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200148,0

We studied the effect of the establishment of eucalyptus and pine plantations on local people's social valuations of ecosystem services in a case study in Uruguay. We also assessed the social and political restrictions that might limit the establishment of new markets for ecosystem services. Our study showed that the rapid change in land use in Uruguay over the past 20 years, from grassland to plantations, has affected people's perceptions of landscape's capacity to produce ecosystem services. The ecosystem services of plantations that showed the greatest discrepancy between local people's valuations and both recognition by experts and current scientific evidence were biodiversity, water effects, and carbon cycling. We found that in particular regulating services, and some provisioning ones, are quite well recognized by substance specialists, but are sometimes rather unfamiliar to the general public. The proper planning of plantations may improve the provision of ecosystem services, such as biodiversity enhancement, wood availability for fire and energy, water quality, and carbon sequestration, while at the same time diluting some others.
