We examine the asset pricing effects of fiscal policies in a production-based general equilibrium model in which taxation affects corporate decisions by: (1) distorting profits and investment; (2) reducing the cost of debt through a tax shield; and (3) depressing productivity growth. In settings with recursive preferences, these three tax-based channels generate sizable risk premia, making tax uncertainty a first-order concern. We document further that corporate tax smoothing can substantially alter the effects of public expenditure shocks.","[Croce, M.

Yet, research into leisure mobility has tended to ignore important aspects of leisure travel, such as its joint character, i.e. its dependence on the participation of other people and the important part played by characteristics of the sites where leisure activities are conducted, as well as the link between leisure activities and the dynamics in people's social networks. This paper introduces a relational approach to leisure activities and travel, which studies joint leisure activities and travel within the webs of relations - the assemblages of people, artefacts, as well as ideas, emotions and other immaterial phenomena - in which they are situated. Two such webs deserve particular attention: the social ties that people have with others and particular configurations of elements (buildings, infrastructure, nature, people, etc.) that collectively make up 'places'. A key idea of our approach is that two-way connections exists between single instances of leisure and the longer term, structural phenomena of the social tie and place. We expand the relational approach in relation to the decision whether or not to engage in joint leisure and the location choice. For each dimension, we review relevant literature and elaborate the relational approach in terms of the relations among people, artefacts, other forms of materiality and the ideas, norms, affects that hold them together and circulate between them.

The results support the prospect theory including assumption of loss aversion at monthly and yearly horizons, which indicates the market utility is S-shaped, and steeper for losses than for gains. And, the findings do not provide convincing evidence for positive skewness preference. Therefore, it should probe into asset pricing model and financial puzzles by prospect theory preferences. It may thus be difficult for the market to benefit from the asset through its features on skewness or other higher order central moment. We also develop several bootstrap procedures with favorable properties in statistical size and power for testing stochastic dominance efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These include quality of paved roadway sections over time, evolution of land use at the parcel level, vehicle purchases by socially networked households, and mode choices by individuals residing across adjacent homes or neighborhoods. Such responses depend on various influential factors, and can have temporal and spatial dependence or autocorrelation. In many cases, dynamic spatial-model specifications based on maximum fitness, profit or utility may be most appropriate. This study develops a dynamic spatial multinomial probit (DSMNP) model by pivoting off the ordinary MNP model while incorporating spatial and temporal dependencies. The study adds value to existing work by addressing polytomous outcomes and space-time data. (Most spatial models rely on cross-sectional data sets and/or binary outcomes.) The paper first explains how the model reflects behaviors at play, and then describes estimation using Bayesian methods, which are of great interest in multiple fields. Simulated data sets containing both generic and alternative-specific explanatory variables are used to validate the model's performance (and that of its associated code). Estimation efficiency issues and identification issues are discussed. The model is then applied to analyze parcel-level land use changes in Austin, Texas. It is found that better accessibility boosts the potential of residential development while hampering non-residential development. The effects of job and population density, neighborhood income and soil slope are also explored, and found to exert variable effects across space. It is also found that land development tends to cluster when existing development intensity in a neighborhood is low. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To do so I push existing applications of practice theories by outlining a 'systems of practice' approach, which articulates theories of practice with socio-technical systems approaches. After sketching out a theory of practice, I explore the potential of a practice theory approach to illuminate systemic change in transport. I do this by confronting two key criticisms of practice theories; first of their apparent difficulty in accounting for change; second of their limited demonstrated ability to move beyond a micro-level focus on doing. The counter I offer to these criticisms leads directly into recognising how theories of practice can articulate with socio-technical systems approaches. From this basis. I go on to consider the implications of a practice theory approach for informing interventions to effect a system transition towards decarbonised transport. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Polynomial kernels and the kernel underpinning the partial-moment analogue of the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM are nested. I derive the partial-moment analogue to the Black CAPM, thus completing a theoretical parallelism, and compare the kernel-implied and canonical risk-neutral probabilities.

In particular, we use a large Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) with an optimal amount of shrinkage towards univariate AR models. The optimal shrinkage is chosen by maximizing the Marginal Likelihood of the model. Focusing on the US, we provide an extensive study on the forecasting performance of the proposed model relative to most of the existing alternative specifications. While most of the existing evidence focuses on statistical measures of forecast accuracy, we also consider alternative measures based on trading schemes and portfolio allocation. We extensively check the robustness of our results, using different datasets and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the proposed BVAR approach produces competitive forecasts, systematically more accurate than random walk forecasts, even though the gains are small. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the substitution effect between credit and equity markets is improved following financial openness. The negative impact of volatility on real output before financial openness turned positive after financial openness, suggesting that appropriate volatility enhances Taiwan's economic growth under the circumstance of more matured stock market following financial openness. However, the beneficial influence of liquidity on real output before financial openness turned negative afterward, suggesting openness generated the undesirable side effect of excess liquidity that impeded economic growth.

With widespread adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT) and location-aware mobile devices, large tracking datasets have become readily available. This study uses a tracking dataset of approximately 12,000 taxis in Wuhan, China over 1 week to analyze spatiotemporal origin-destination (O-D) patterns of trips that use three critical bridges connecting the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang separated by the Yangtze River and the Han River. We use the space-time prism concept to identify alternative space-time paths passing through different bridges that observe the spatial and temporal constraints between each O-D pair derived from the taxi trajectory data.

ARDL cointegration analysis yields an income elasticity of calorie intake of 0.22, while the food-price elasticity is insignificant. The results suggest that economic growth in Turkey has improved calorie intake; future income growth can alleviate further inadequate nutrition. This result confirms Engel's law too. An augmented form of Granger causality analysis is conducted amongst the variables. The short-run causality testing reveals the existence of only one causality which is running from income to calorie intake. The post-sample variance decompositions indicate that income is the main cause of the increased calorie intake in the long-run.

Therefore, this topic is reexamined in the context of Thailand. In a sample of 50 repurchase rate announcements of the Bank of Thailand during 2003-2009, our regression results suggest that the raw change in the repurchase rate has a negative effect on stock returns at the market level, which is inconsistent with the literature. Contrary to the results of numerous studies, we find that at the market level the expected change in the repurchase rate has a negative effect on stock returns and the unexpected change in the repurchase rate exhibits no effect on stock returns. However, the effect of the unexpected change in the repurchase rate on stock returns is evident at the firm level. Our findings also suggest that the stock market's response to the repurchase rate change is asymmetric. The unexpected change in the repurchase rate that is considered as good news has a negative effect on stock returns. Overall, the evidence lends support to the notion that the monetary policy announcements have a significant effect on stock prices and further adds to the debate on whether the creditability of the monetary authority may contribute to the stock market's response to the monetary policy actions.

The significance of this indicator depends on the efficacy of shareholders monitoring.

Irving Fisher argued for a commodity dollar standard where the purchasing power of money was fixed by indexing it to a basket of commodities. We show that movements in the price of silver closely track the movements in overall prices during the classical gold standard era.

The first scenario assumes that increases in international oil prices are passed on to end users with no changes in government policy instruments. In this scenario, poverty indicators increase. The second scenario assumes that the world price increases are nullified by a price subsidy by the government. This scenario still leads to an increase in poverty as the beneficial price effect is cancelled out by a decline in households' income induced by the financing method used. While revenue generated from a 50 per cent tax on windfall profit of the petroleum industry helps to minimize the loss in government revenue, it does not contribute to mitigating the increasing poverty trend, since the decline in saving and investment under this scenario restricts the country's growth, employment and income distribution perspectives.","[Chitiga, Margaret] Human Sci Res Council, Pretoria, South Africa; [Fofana, Ismael] IFPRI, Dakar, Senegal",Human Sciences Research Council-South Africa; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Chitiga, M (通讯作者)，Human Sci Res Council, Private Bag X41,134 Pretorius St, Pretoria, South Africa.",mchitiga@hsrc.ac.za; I.Fofana@cgiar.org; Ramosm@ffc.co.za,"Chitiga-Mabugu, Margaret/AAN-8275-2021; Mabugu, Ramos Emmanuel/HPF-8840-2023","Mabugu, Ramos Emmanuel/0000-0001-8405-3051; Chitiga-Mabugu, Margaret/0000-0001-9894-0452",,,,,16,7,7,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Furthermore, we find that q values are lower for firms that exhibit deviations between cash flow rights and voting rights. We also find that the value benefits of complying with good corporate governance practices are nullified in the presence of pyramidal ownership structures, raising doubts on the effectiveness of governance measures when ownership structures are not transparent.

This implies, however, that memories of high inflation are likely to fade, because over time larger parts of the population have never experienced high inflation, whereas those who have might forget. This paper tests whether memories of high inflation affect agents' preferences about the importance attached to price stability, using a large database covering over 50,000 survey responses from 23 countries over the years 1981-2000. It finds that memories of hyperinflation are there to last, whereas those of less drastic inflation experiences tend to erode after around 10 years. The recent decline in the importance attached to price stability does therefore most likely reflect mitigated inflation concerns in an environment of low and stable inflation, but also the consequences of fading memories of high inflation. The longer central banks have successfully delivered price stability, the more important it is for them to engage in a pro-active communication, especially with the younger generations, about the merits of low and stable inflation.

Our study explores, for the case of Mexico, the reaction of short-term interest rate futures to monetary policy announcements, and to what extent the change to the operational targeting of interest rates implemented by the central bank in 2004 led to changes in this reaction. The results show that in a market dominated by institutional investors trading solely for hedging purposes, the actions of the central bank are not fully incorporated into prices in advance. As a result, interest rate futures prices are adjusted on announcement dates. Furthermore, the change to an interest rate operational target modified the trading behaviour so that the changes in the volatility, volume and prices of the futures contracts on the announcement dates are now more evident.","[Herrerias, Renata] ITAM, Sch Business Adm, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico; [Gurrola, Pedro] Regents Coll, European Business Sch, London, England",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Herrerías, R (通讯作者)，ITAM, Sch Business Adm, Camino Sta Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico.",rherreria@itam.mx,"Herrerias, Renata/JBJ-7372-2023","Herrerias, Renata/0000-0001-7200-1254",,,,,32,0,0,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

Market access and wage growth in China,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Market access; Wages; New economic geography,INCREASING RETURNS; SPECIALIZATION,"New economic geography models predict that costly transport and the spatial distribution of demand affect the profits firms can earn in different locations, leading to higher wages for workers employed in cities with better geographic access to markets. In light of the dramatic embrace of globalization and labor market reforms that occurred in China after 1995, we measure the extent to which the influence of market access on wages strengthened and influenced wage growth over the subsequent period. Using survey data from two waves of the Chinese Household Income Project, we find that urban wages became more strongly influenced by access to markets. including domestic markets, between 1995 and 2002. The estimated elasticity of the wage with respect to market access of the worker's location more than doubles over the period. We also find that market access influences wages paid to both skilled and unskilled workers. Within provinces, we find no significant relationship between market access and either group's wages when adjusted for living costs, as expected in the context of internal labor migration. However, across provinces wages net of living costs are positively correlated with the market access of the worker's location. Consistent with deregulation of wage setting in state enterprises, the influence of market access on wages strengthened most for state-owned firms. A decomposition of the change in the mean wage indicates that market access is an economically important factor explaining the growth in average wages between 1995 and 2002. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

While these three taxes have attractive neutrality properties, moving from the status quo to a new system often involves a difficult trade-off between short-run losses and long-run gains. We consider two alternative ways of spreading the gains and costs of reform more evenly across generations. Deficit financing of the large revenue loss that occurs immediately after reform allows the smoothing of wage tax rates over time and the elimination or reduction of short-run income losses. Alternatively, a system of delayed deductions requires firms to carry forward with interest some of the large deductions that are newly available after the enactment of a major tax reform. In shifting tax revenue from the future to the present, such policies are politically appealing, as they trade somewhat reduced future income gains for improved economic performance immediately after reform.","[Keuschnigg, Christian; Keuschnigg, Mirela] Univ St Gallen FGN HSG, St Gallen, Switzerland",,"Keuschnigg, C (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen FGN HSG, St Gallen, Switzerland.",Christian.Keuschnigg@unisg.ch; Mirela.Keuschnigg@unisg.ch,,"Keuschnigg, Christian/0000-0003-4924-7859",,,,,39,1,1,0,10,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The probability of postdoctoral participation is substantially higher for temporary visa holders than for permanent visa holders because of visa-related restrictions in the U.S. labor market. To identify the causal effects of visa status on entry into a postdoctoral position, this paper uses a unique shock to visa status generated by the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992. Eligibility for the act is used as an instrumental variable for visa status. Two-stage least-square estimates show that permanent visa holders are 24 percent less likely to take postdoctoral positions than temporary visa holders. The effects of a permanent visa vary considerably across research fields, but for most fields, it reduces postdoctoral participation significantly.

We find evidence supporting both hypotheses.

However, there is limited understanding of what factors enable firms to obtain process benefits via consortium activities. Based on 232 member surveys collected from seven e-business standard consortia, we find that firms anticipate more process benefits if they are more technically capable, value the forthcoming standards higher, and participate in a better-managed consortium. Surprisingly, although relational risks exist due to potential competition among consortium members, their impacts on process benefits are insignificant in e-business standard consortia.

However, such effects may often hide a distributive effect, which occurs when one part of a region grows faster or at the expense of another part. This paper distinguishes distributive accessibility effects and distributive centre-periphery effects. The pattern of such distributive effects is explored for the new (2003) tunnel under the Westerschelde estuary in the Netherlands, which links a central region with a peripheral region. The tunnel led to dramatic changes in accessibility since it replaced car ferries that operated at quite a distance from the tunnel. Our ex-post analyses explore whether employment and population have redistributed following the opening of the tunnel. Increased accessibility led to employment decline in the centre, and to slight growth in the periphery. In particular, the tunnel enabled a process of rationalization of employment in the non-commercial services sector. For population, we found that the new fixed link led to stronger population growth in the centre. Especially people aged 20-40 moved out of the periphery.

It presents four main advantages. First, it is a model free method which can be used to assess the forecasts issued from different EWS (probit, logit, Markov switching models, or combinations of models). Second, this toolbox can be applied to any type of crisis EWS (currency, banking, sovereign debt, and so on). Third, it does not only provide various criteria to evaluate the (absolute) validity of EWS forecasts but also proposes some tests to compare the relative performance of alternative EWS. Fourth, this toolbox can be used to evaluate both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts. Applied to a logit model for 12 emerging countries we show that the yield spread is a key variable for predicting currency crises exclusively for South-Asian countries. Besides, the optimal cut-off correctly allows us to identify now on average more than 2/3 of the crisis and calm periods.

We employ a risk-constrained optimization approach to study the capital allocation decisions under ERM. Given the decision maker's risk appetite, the problem of holistically managing enterprise-wide hazard, financial, operational, and real project risks is treated by maximizing the expected total return on capital, while trading off risks simultaneously in Value-at-Risk type of constraints. This approach explicitly quantifies the concepts of risk appetite and risk prioritization in light of the firm's default and financial distress avoidance reflected in its target credit rating. Our framework also allows the firm to consider a multiperiod planning horizon so that changing business environments can be accounted for. We illustrate the implementation of the framework through a numerical example. As an initial conceptual advancement, our formulation is capable of facilitating more general ERM modeling within a consistent strategic framework, where idiosyncratic variations of firms and different modeling assumptions can be accommodated. Managerial implications are also discussed.","[Ai, Jing] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, Dept Financial Econ & Inst, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Brockett, Patrick L.; Cooper, William W.] Univ Texas Austin, Global Fellow Inst IC2, Dept Informat Risk & Operat Management, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Golden, Linda L.] Univ Texas Austin, Global Fellow Inst IC2, Dept Mkt, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Ai, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, Dept Financial Econ & Inst, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jing.ai@hawaii.edu; brockett@mail.utexas.edu; cooperw@mail.utexas.edu; utlindagolden@gmail.com,"Golden, Linda L/A-1451-2009",,,,,,33,25,36,4,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

On the effectiveness of industrialization policies for economic development The role of the government in industrialization is heavily debated. Some claim that extensive government involvement is key to initiate a sustainable development process, others see the government as an obstacle to it, pointing to the importance of government failure. We formulate a model, which explains why even a highly inefficient industrial policy can successfully promote big-push development. Moreover, we show that extensive government intervention is more likely to be successful when the initial level of development is low. J. Japanese Int Economies 26 (1) (2012) 129-141.

Results indicate that although milder climate objectives can be achieved at moderate costs, stringent stabilization paths, compatible with the 2A degrees C target, might require significant economic resources. Innovation and technology are shown to be able to mitigate, but not structurally alter, this trade-off. Technologies that allow capturing CO2 from the atmosphere are shown to be important for expanding the feasibility space of stringent climate policies, though only if deployed at a scale which would represent a tremendous challenge. In general, the analysis indicates that the timing of mitigation is an important factor of cost containment, with early action being desirable.

Our empirical results indicate that the existence and level of credit ratings are associated with a lower negative effect of diversification. Further analysis reveals that the mitigating effect of credit ratings on the diversification discount is more pronounced for firms with more severe information asymmetry. In addition, both a change in firm status from no rating to being rated and a change in rating level from low to high lead to a significant reduction in the diversification discount. An event study on diversification buttresses the findings by showing that the market has a less negative reaction to rated and higher-rated firms around the announcement of diversifying mergers. Our results are robust to alternative techniques used to control for potential endogeneity bias, to controlling for corporate governance, and to different sample periods. Overall, the evidence suggests that credit ratings reduce information asymmetry problems and thus mitigate the diversification discount. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show that in a market populated by risk-averse, prudent and temperate investors, firms whose returns exhibit negative coskewness or positive cokurtosis should yield higher premia relative to counterpart firms with positive coskewness and negative cokurtosis respectively. These theoretical predictions are empirically tested using a comprehensive dataset of shares listed on the London Stock Exchange during the period 1986-2008. Our empirical results confirm that coskewness and cokurtosis premia are genuinely priced in the UK market, over and above what covariance risk, size, value and momentum factors can explain.

This paper is drawn from the Minimum Income Standards (MIS) research programme, which primarily involves groups of members of the public reaching consensus about what households need for a minimum, socially acceptable standard of living. The paper looks at the additional needs and costs of rural households, compared with their urban counterparts, and focuses on the methodology used to research these costs. This discussion is framed in terms of transport disadvantage, and the Capability Approach. The results of the research are presented: how travel needs and costs vary for different household types; and how minimum transport costs impact on overall household budgets. The paper concludes by considering the possible application of the 'MIS Rural' approach in practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Expressive voting may partly explain the divergence, but some who are generally uninterested in politics and thus unlikely to take elections as an important form of personal expression nevertheless vote. One possible explanation is that these voters overestimate the instrumental, outcome-changing consequences of voting; such systematic misperception may be more likely among those with less cognitive capacity.

Empirical findings confirm these expectations, demonstrating that young growth firms were more likely than non-growth firms to seek all forms of capital and exporters were particularly likely to apply for equity and trade credit.

AFL-CIO-affiliated shareholders become significantly less opposed to directors once the AFL-CIO labor organization no longer represents a firm's workers. Other institutional investors, including mutual funds and public pension funds, do not exhibit similar voting behavior. Union opposition is also associated with negative valuation effects. The data suggest that some investors pursue worker interests, rather than maximize shareholder value alone.","[Agrawal, Ashwini K.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Agrawal, AK (通讯作者)，44 W 4th St,KMC Room 9-75, New York, NY 10012 USA.",aagrawal@stern.nyu.edu,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,,,,,65,88,103,2,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In addition, inventory investment is volatile and procyclical, and inventory-to-sales is persistent and countercyclical. We embed an inventory holding motive into the investment-based asset pricing framework by modeling inventory as a factor of production with convex and nonconvex adjustment costs. The augmented model simultaneously matches the large inventory growth spread in the data, as well as the time-series properties of the firm-level capital investment, inventory investment, and inventory-to-sales. Our conditional single-factor model also implies that traditional unconditional factor models such as the CAPM should fail to explain the inventory growth spread, although not with the same large pricing errors observed in the data.","[Belo, Frederico] Univ Minnesota, Dept Finance, Off 3 137, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Lin, Xiaoji] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Belo, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Finance, Off 3 137, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",fbelo@umn.edu,,,,,,,52,63,73,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

At the early stages it is crucial that companies improve succession by strengthening the company's leadership development and focus on those people, internal and external, who might one day take on the role of CEO. Potential new leaders must be good for the company's existing customers, for the company itself and for the management team. A leadership development program which considers succession as a central element at all levels in the company can be a major part of the company's value proposition, one that competitors cannot understand, let alone imitate.","[Bradley, Frank] Univ Coll Dublin, Michael Smurfit Grad Business Sch, Blackrock, Co Dublin, Ireland; [Connolly, Aidan J.] West Liberty Foods LLC, West Liberty, IA 52776 USA; [Connolly, Aidan J.] Alltech, Lexington, KY 40356 USA",University College Dublin; Alltech United States,"Bradley, F (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Michael Smurfit Grad Business Sch, Blackrock, Co Dublin, Ireland.",frank.bradley@ucd.ie,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,19,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Combining a literature review with interviews from a panel of 24 agribusiness 'experts', we identify seven key barriers which impede our ability to feed nine billion people on earth. Collected under the acronym GLIMPSE, they help to frame the obstacles and identify the opportunities. This is an important step towards harnessing the power of the marketplace so that agribusinesses can bring together the creativity, determination, and technology similar to the 'miracle of the cerrados' in Brazil to bear on the challenge of feeding the three billion additional people that will join our world by 2050.","[Connolly, Aidan J.] Alltech, Dunboyne, Meath, Ireland; [Connolly, Aidan J.] UCD Michael Smurfit Grad Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland; [Phillips-Connolly, Kate] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Ctr Global Business Syst, Dublin 2, Ireland",Alltech United States; Alltech Ireland; Trinity College Dublin,"Connolly, AJ (通讯作者)，Alltech, Summerhill Rd, Dunboyne, Meath, Ireland.",aconnolly@alltech.com,,,,,,,49,7,7,0,12,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The empirical analysis starts by analyzing the time series properties of the data which is followed by examining the nature of causality among the variables. Iran is oil producing rather oil-importing country. Contrary to the results of some previous studies, our results show that oil price is not Granger-causes for economic growth. Results show that neutral effect of oil price on economic growth as such the significance for error-correction term is not statistically supported. Given the natural effect of oil prices on economic growth and the fact that Iran has adopted economic growth targeting as its policy anchor, we recommend that monetary policies should be relaxed during the global oil price shocks in order to protect the country from any possible outcome of a full-blown stagflation scenario.

However, domestic travel can mean a massive volume of tourist activity (Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2011 - World Economic Forum). In this respect, in the present paper we aimed at carrying out a research on the European countries tourism competitiveness using statistical tools.

In order to see how the 14 pillars of the competitiveness index are grouping on the 27 EU countries and the other 15 non-EU countries, we used - separately for EU countries and non-EU countries - the principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation and Kaiser normalization, followed by hierarchical cluster analysis and then the k-means cluster analysis to view the countries clustering on the principal components resulted.

Social network analysis is carried out to investigate the role of attitudes towards information sources. Our findings demonstrate the influence of communication frequency with interpersonal network actors (agricultural organizations and neighborhood farmers) on continuous innovation adoption in three ways: First, the communication frequency of organic farmers with both agricultural organizations and neighborhood farmers does not influence the original farmer's decision to adopt AEM. Second, a higher education level of frequently communicated neighborhood farmers increases the probability of farmers' AEM adoption, while the innovativeness of frequently communicated farmers does not. Third, inside the population of frequently communicated organic farmers, formal information sources (agricultural organizations) are considered as more important information sources about agricultural issues than are informal sources (other farmers).","[Gailhard, Ilkay Unay] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Germany; [Bavorova, Miroslava; Pirscher, Frauke] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Gailhard, IU (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Germany.",,,,,,,,73,0,0,0,7,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,383,400,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800027,0

Our bank-by-bank framework uses balance-sheet data plus high-frequency market data in a way that measures risk exposures and can capture key risk transmission and feedbacks with the sovereign in real time. Risk transmission between banks and sovereigns can arise in the framework from several important sources: (a) bank holdings of risky sovereign debt, (b) explicit and implicit guarantees from sovereigns to banks, and (c) spillovers from sovereign spreads into bank borrowing costs. We illustrate the framework with several examples and ways forward to analyze multicountry sovereign and banking interactions.","[Gray, Dale F.] Int Monetary Fund, Monetary & Capital Markets Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; Univ Los Andes, Sch Management, Bogota, Colombia",International Monetary Fund; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Gray, DF (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Monetary & Capital Markets Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dgray@imf.org; samuel.malone@gmail.com,,"Gray, Dale/0000-0001-5034-8556",,,,,60,8,8,1,39,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4804-5,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Prudence and impatience generate stationary household wealth levels that depend on income. Skill, and therefore labor income, heterogeneity leads to wealth heterogeneity, with high skill households accumulating high wealth and low skill households accumulating low wealth. A HARA class utility with subsistence consumption requirement generates decreasing RRA with respect to household wealth. Consequently, low skill households also have significantly higher local RRA. In addition low skill households have less human capital and therefore have lower diversification demand for stocks. Low wealth, high RRA and low diversification demand predicts that low skill households do not hold stocks in the face of a moderate ownership cost. In addition, the model predicts a humped lifecycle wealth accumulation pattern and a humped lifecycle stock allocation pattern. I also find that stockholders exhibit a greater aggregate willingness to supply risky capital during the expansion phase of a business cycle, despite the lower conditional equity premium.

It examines the assumptions made by regulated companies in their FRS 17 valuations. These assumptions generate parameters that systematically understate both the present value of pension liabilities and current service costs. These are re-estimated using the risk-free real rate of discount and compatible assumptions. On this basis, the total pension deficit for the sample increased from 12.7 pound billion to 56.3 pound billion in 2009, equivalent to about 110% of regulated revenues. Further, the cost of current service for 2008-09 was 20% higher than total contributions in the year, despite large top-up contributions. If contributions were increased to cover current service costs and to eliminate pension deficits over a period of 10 years, the additional contributions would amount to 235% of actual contributions or 13% of regulated revenues implying a significant increase in regulated charges. Companies in the communications and transport sectors face the largest adjustments in addressing the problems of underfunded pension schemes.","Univ Edinburgh, Dept Econ, Edinburgh EH8 9JT, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Hughes, G (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Dept Econ, 31 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",g.a.hughes@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

In this context and considering the relative homogeneity of the new member states, regarding their transition from centralised economies to market economies and afterwards their EU ascension, the aim of our paper is to analyze if the return on assets of the banks from these states converge toward a common value, this fact underling a deepening of the banking integration process.

The study employs tax revenues and GDP U.S. government data for the period 1948:1-2008:4 in two non-linear causality tests, developed by Hiemstra and Jones (1994) and Diks and Panchenko (2006). Using the two alternative tests serves the need for evaluating the role of heteroskedasticity as a non-linear causality-affecting factor. In a fiscal policy framework, the study explores the GDP growth influential role of the tax burden distribution across tax-liable groups in a country's economy. The empirical findings provide two discrete policy considerations. First, when the policy challenge is to influence the GDP growth by means of taxation, this should be preferably attempted by adjusting the taxes levied on production and imports or. on corporate income. On the contrary, when stability in GDP growth is required, while a change in the tax policy is attempted, this should be preferably restricted in the field of the personal income taxation.

The PSTR model endogenously determines the non-linear insurance-income nexus and allows for a continuum of an intermediate regime among extremes. We find overwhelming evidence in support of a non-linear income threshold. The life and non-life insurance premiums are inelastic and elastic with respect to real income, suggesting that they are a necessary good and luxury good respectively. Furthermore, as time goes on, the income elasticities of insurance premiums present a similar upward trend, implying that the impact of economic development on insurance premiums is more important in recent periods.

The model has an overlapping generations' structure where both parties have altruistic behavioural traits. We derive the relationships between the remittances, consumption, labour supply, savings, and bequests, and compare these variables under the two scenarios. For both scenarios, the remittances have a positive effect on the relative's leisure, consumption, and investment. The effects of the wage and the non-wage income of the relative and the migrant and the interest rate on the equilibrium level of remittances are also qualitatively similar under the two scenarios. However, the parties' degrees of altruism as well as the discount rates have different effects on the equilibrium level and incidence of remittances for the non-cooperative and cooperative interactions. These shed some light on the differences in remittance behaviour observed in empirical studies.","[Melkonyan, Tigran A.] Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Exeter, Devon, England; [Grigorian, David A.] Int Monetary Fund, Middle E & Cent Asia Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of Exeter; International Monetary Fund,"Melkonyan, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Exeter, Devon, England.",tmelkonyan@cabnr.unr.edu,,,,,,,66,13,14,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Several energy indicators are used as independent variables in panel data regression models for several European Union countries with very high and high human development. Their contribution to the changes in Human Development Index (the dependent variable from the equations) is revealed. Both fossil and renewable energy consumptions are included in the analysis in order to declare their capability of attaining human development in the context of consequences on health and environment. In the same time, as energy consumption is accompanied by carbon emissions, we included the CO2 intensity among the explanatory variables. In our trial to determine if energy drives or hinders human development, energy intensity was also used; it resulted that mainly, high levels of energy intensity of a nation poses threats to its human development.

It reviews emerging experience with a number of these mechanisms along with experience from other sectors that may shed light on generic problems of implementing PPPs in Africa. While finding some positive impacts on investment, it notes that state failures can also undermine PPP effectiveness.

If the buyer of the tobacco stamps does not pay the excise duty by the legal deadline, the customs office can ask the bank that issued the bank guarantee for payment in the full amount of the tax obligation. The excise duty for tobacco products continues to grow, and therefore the producer's expenses for securing the duty are also increasing. Economic fluctuations also play no small role, as they result in further price increases that the producers of the tobacco products have to pay to the banks in order to provide the appropriate bank guarantee.

While business performance changed radically between 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis and economic recession, only minor increases in risk exposure, risk consequence or risk management strategies were found from 2007 to 2008. ERM information did not predict or have any appreciable effect on business performance. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the first years after reforms, there was a substantial decline in the production of barley, malt and beer. However, the brewery sector soon attracted interest from foreign investors, who faced problems in sourcing sufficient high quality malt in order to produce high quality beer. Therefore, they reintroduced vertical coordination in the supply chain to obtain malt and barley that consistently met their quality requirements. The associated change in beer quality has been one of the drivers behind the spectacular growth of beer consumption in several Eastern European countries. Most remarkable was the growth in the Russian beer market, where beer consumption more than quadrupled over the course of a decade. In this paper, we describe and analyze the dramatic restructuring of the beer industry and the changes in the industrial organization of its supply chain over the past two decades. In addition, we document how the drastic improvement in the quality of beer has been an important driver behind rapid growth in beer consumption in Russia.","[Van Herck, Kristine; Swinnen, Johan F.

First, we present stylized facts on banking, debt, and currency crises. Using panel vector autoregression we find that banking and debt crises are interrelated and both typically precede currency crises, but not vice versa. Banking crises are the most costly in terms of the overall output loss, and output takes about six years to recover. Second, on a reduced sample we try to identify early warning indicators of crises specific to developed economies, accounting for model uncertainty by means of Bayesian model averaging. The most consistent result across the various specifications and time horizons is that significant growth of domestic private credit precedes banking crises, while rising money market rates and global corporate spreads are also leading indicators worth monitoring. For currency crises, we also corroborate the role of rising domestic private credit and money market rates and detect the relevance of domestic currency overvaluation. The role of other indicators differs according to the type of crisis and the warning horizon selected, but it mostly seems easier to find reliable predictors at a horizon shorter than two years. Early warning indicators of debt crises are difficult to uncover due to the low occurrence of such episodes in our dataset.

This paper proposes a series of empirical models and applies them to the State of Maryland in the United States, using a spatial lag approach to explore land use, built environment, demographic, socio-economic, and traffic condition connections to bicycle ridership, defined as the number of bicycle trips generated by a given analysis zone per day. A set of models is proposed for three land-use typologies: urban, sub-urban and rural. The data that drives this analysis was obtained from a recently conducted Household Travel Survey (HTS) in the Baltimore Washington region in Maryland. Results show that some land uses, socio-economic and demographic characteristics, and transit accessibility are positively correlated with bicycle ridership. Other types of land use, transport system characteristics and income level have an inverse relationship with bicycle ridership. The contributing factors to bicycle ridership vary with land-use typology. This proposed approach could be used to evaluate factors relevant to bicycle demand. State and local agencies are advised to build designated bicycle paths according to traffic conditions and increase bicycle-parking capacity in specific establishments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

One way to reduce basis risk is to additionally purchase gap insurance, which fills the gap between an insurer's actual loss and the index-linked instrument's payout. The previous literature detects gains in the effectiveness of this hedging strategy in a mean-variance framework. The aim of this article is to extend this analysis and to examine the effectiveness of gap insurance in a shareholder value maximization framework under solvency constraints. Our results show that purchasing gap insurance can generally increase the hedging effectiveness in multiple ways by reducing basis risk, thus increasing shareholder value and, at the same time, lowering shortfall risk.","[Gatzert, Nadine; Kellner, Ralf] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Insurance Econ & Risk Management, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Gatzert, N (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Insurance Econ & Risk Management, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",nadine.gatzert@fau.de; ralf.kellner@fau.de,,,,,,,53,4,4,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

In particular, by estimating portfolio equations for JGB demand and bank loans, based on a panel data set from the late 1990s to the 2000s, we rigorously test the popular assertion that the long stagnation of the real economy caused a shift in the portfolios of commercial banks from bank lending to JGBs. We find that the popular assertion is not empirically supported. Rather, the portfolio shift from loans to JGBs has been caused by a fall in the ratio of the loan rate to unit lending costs, or the bank's price-cost margin for lending. J. Japanese Int.

Reliable estimates are beneficial to spatial structuring, facility design, and vehicle operation, as well as financial and labor management. Traditional ridership estimation approaches mainly rely on regression models that consider subway fares, population, and employment distribution in surrounding areas. Yet consideration of ridership's spatial dependency is largely lacking in these models. This paper recognizes the spatial effect by estimating the ridership of the new Second Avenue Subway in New York City using a network Kriging method. Network distance, instead of Euclidean distance, is used to reflect the fact that subway stations are only connected by subway tunnels. Results show that the new service should effectively relieve the traffic burden on other currently crowded subway lines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on both smartcard and household travel survey data, we find that the theoretical minimum commute is considerably lower for bus users than for car users in Beijing. This suggests that there is a greater inter-mixing of jobs-housing functions (i.e., a better jobs-housing balance) associated with users of that mode compared to the corresponding land-use arrangement for car users, who locate further from the central area (Tian'anmen) than bus users. The commuting range for car users is 9.4 km greater than for bus users. Excess commuting is slightly higher for bus users (69.5%) than for car users (68.8%). Commuting capacity values are slightly lower for car users than for bus users, implying that car users consume less of their available commuting resources overall than bus users, albeit only marginally.

However, there is no clear evidence of a significant negative effect of trade openness on inflation, except for nations with low trade openness and high inflation rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To do so, we consider, in addition to the set of variables used in Rapach and Zhou (2013), the forecasting ability of four other important variables: the US economic policy uncertainty, the equity market uncertainty, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment, and the Kansas City Fed's financial stress index. Using a more recent dataset compared to that of Rapach and Zhou (2013), our results from predictive regressions show that the newly added variables do not play any significant statistical role in explaining the equity premium relative to the historical average benchmark over the out-of-sample horizon, even though they are believed to possess valuable informative content about the state of the economy and financial markets. Interestingly, however, barring the economic policy uncertainty index, the three other indexes considered in this study yield economically significant out-of-sample gains, especially during recessions, when compared to the historical benchmark.

The current research is part of a larger study directed at analyzing the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on customer loyalty. Improving service quality is a fundamental part of the social responsibility of tourism businesses, while creating, maintaining and increasing customer loyalty is essential for the sustainability of these businesses. Starting from these assertions, the current paper tries to reveal certain correlations and to identify a model that depicts the impact of travel agencies' service quality on their customers' loyalty. In order to accomplish these goals, an online survey has been conducted among a sample of 286 Romanians which travelled using the services of a travel agency. In order to evaluate service quality, the SERVPERF assessment procedure was adapted to the case of travel agencies, using items related to tangibles (physical facilities, equipment and appearance of personnel), reliability (ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately), responsiveness (willingness to help customers and provide prompt service), assurance (knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to inspire trust and confidence - including competence, courtesy, credibility and security), and empathy (caring and individualized attention that the firm provides to its customers - including access, communication, understanding the customer). In what concerns customer loyalty, the paper focuses on its behavioral facet, namely on the recommendations effectively made regarding certain travel agencies. In the proposed model, the scores regarding perceptions (SERVPERF) were approached as independent variables, while behavioral loyalty was depicted as dependent variable.","[Moisescu, Ovidiu I.; Gica, Oana A.] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Moisescu, OI (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",ovidiu.moisescu@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Gica, Oana Adriana/AAX-9359-2020; Moisescu, Ovidiu I./C-1175-2013; Gica, Oana/AAS-6168-2021","Gica, Oana Adriana/0000-0001-7958-1036; Moisescu, Ovidiu I./0000-0003-0097-5660; Gica, Oana/0000-0001-7958-1036",,,,,40,1,3,0,41,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1191,1204,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900012,0

This paper re-examines the problem in the context of Marginal Conditional Stochastic Dominance (MCSD), which can accommodate any return distribution or concave utility function. Our results provide strong evidence that there is a financial price to be paid for socially responsible investing. Indices composed of socially responsible firms are MCSD dominated by trademarked indices composed of conventional firms as well as by indices carefully matched by size and industry with the firms in the SRI indices. Zero cost portfolios created by shorting the SRI index and using the proceeds to invest in the conventional index generate higher average returns, lower variance and higher skewness than either of the two indices standing alone. They also MCSD dominate the SRI and conventional indices standing alone. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The expected frequency of this type of behavior, however, remains an open and important question, and limited access to detailed election data makes it difficult to resolve empirically. In this paper, we develop a spatial model of voting behavior to approach the question theoretically. We conclude that monotonicity failures in three-candidate IRV elections may be much more prevalent than widely presumed (results suggest a lower bound estimate of 15 % for competitive elections). In light of these results, those seeking to implement a fairer multi-candidate election system should be wary of adopting IRV.","[Ornstein, Joseph T.] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norman, Robert Z.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Math, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Dartmouth College,"Ornstein, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, 5700 Haven Hall,505 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ornstein@umich.edu,"Ornstein, Joseph/JVZ-0624-2024","Ornstein, Joseph/0000-0002-5704-2098",,,,,17,7,7,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2014,161.0,1-2,,,,,1,9,,10.1007/s11127-013-0118-2,0.0,,,9,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AN4BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340532400001,0

This program has created a national debate about the effectiveness of the ownership of health insurance in increasing the use of health services-particularly among the poor-given the limitations in their quantity and quality. Using membership data on different health insurance programs from the 2007 rounds of Susenas and Riskesdas, this article researches the impact of having health insurance on health service utilisation, by controlling the levels of quality and quantity of health services in the area.

We used an extension of the event study dummy approach that includes direct effects on beta risk and volatility. We identified effects on both kinds of risk, indicating that rating agencies provide new information to the market. All types of rating announcements (upgrades/downgrades, reviews and outlook reports), whether positive or negative, have a significant impact on risks. Rating actions that indicate improvements in credit quality cause lower idiosyncratic risk. Positive outlook reports also cause lower systematic risk. Conversely, ratings announcements that indicate deteriorations in credit quality are linked to a rebalance of both types of risks, with a higher beta risk together with a lower diversifiable risk. The relevant factors that determine how the two kinds of risks react to rating changes are mainly characteristics of the effective rating changes. The 2007 global financial crisis increased the market's sensitivity to these characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Predictability in implied volatilities is expected due to the learning behavior of agents in option markets. In particular, we explore the possibility that the dynamics of the implied volatility surface of individual stocks may be associated with movements in the volatility surface of S&P 500 index options. We present evidence of strong predictable features in the cross-section of equity options and of dynamic linkages between the volatility surfaces of equity and S&P 500 index options. Moreover, time-variation in stock option volatility surfaces is best predicted by incorporating information from the dynamics in the surface of S&P 500 options.

These renegotiations primarily relax existing restrictions and result in economically large changes in existing limits. Renegotiations of specific covenants are a response to both the distance the covenant variable is from its contractual limit and the firm's specific operating conditions and prospects. Moreover, the borrower's post-renegotiation investment and financial policies are strongly associated with the covenant changes resulting from the renegotiation.

Evidence from country and industry emerging market equity indexes,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS INSTITUTIONS & MONEY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financial integration; PCA; Industries; Systemic banking crises,EXPECTED RETURNS; LONG-RUN; CONTAGION; LIQUIDITY,"This paper examines the dynamics of the financial integration process across equity markets in one global emerging region (Emerging) and three emerging sub-regions (Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America) over the last two decades. The proportion of total variation in individual excess returns explained by the first principal component serves as a robust measure of integration. Financial integration is measured in the national equity market (market) and in ten different industrial equity markets (basic materials, consumer goods, consumer services, financials, healthcare, industrials, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology and utilities). We obtain two main results. First, we observe that the level of integration across emerging equity markets in emerging regions is rather low, both at the country and industry level. Second, the shape of the financial integration process is not homogeneous among different industries. Specifically, J-shaped, U-shaped and increasing trends are observed. Overall, our integration numbers and dynamics simultaneously improve portfolio diversification benefits and reduce risk-sharing opportunities. This is supported by a CAPMbased analysis.

In contrast to the classical term structure literature, in which nonlinearities are captured by increasing the number of latent state variables or by latent regime shifts, in our no-arbitrage framework the regimes are governed by thresholds and are directly linked to economic fundamentals. Specifically, starting from a simple monetary policy model for the short rate, we introduce a parsimonious and tractable model for the yield curve, which takes into account the possibility of regime shifts in the behavior of the Federal Reserve. In our empirical analysis, we show the merit of our approach three dimensions: interpretable bond dynamics, accurate short end yield curve pricing, and yield curve implications.

The market indexes used in empirical tests are likely to be inefficient ex ante, which could lead to spurious results even in the absence of sampling errors. This problem has led many to express serious doubt on the testability of the CAPM. In this paper I show that the CAPM is indeed testable. This paper builds on the seminal paper by Kandel and Stambaugh (1995) and proposes a two-step procedure for testing the CAPM. The first step uses a simple combination of the coefficients of determination from both Ordinary Least Squares and Generalised Least Squares estimations. This step tests whether the index used in the empirical test is efficient and whether there are no omitted factors. The second step tests the hypothesis that the efficient index is the market portfolio. The two-step approach enables testing the CAPM regardless of whether the true expected return generating process is a CAPM or a non-CAPM. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The methodology should include both general indicators applicable to any study programme and some indicators that are specifically developed for business study programmes. No consensus exists in the internationalization literature and practice over the actual scope and the indicators to be considered in the implementation of such a study. Researchers rather propose methods for assessing and prioritizing universities and/or faculties and lay down a lot of criteria according to which rankings are developed. These rankings are mainly focused on the level of internationalization of socioeconomic and engineering study programmes. Being aware of the limits of theory and practice, the authors develop a scoring model that measures the degree of internationalization of business education curricula according to stringent criteria. The research originality lies in the attempt to describe the avenues of a new methodology for measuring and assessing realistically the economic study programmes so that these may be better positioned on the educational market and become more attractive to the future candidates. Based on a synergistic approach to indicators, the model may contribute to creating competitive advantage in relation to other programmes from the same university or from partner institutions.","[Dabija, Dan-Cristian; Postelnicu, Catalin] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Pop, Nicolae Al.] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dabija, DC (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",cristian.dabija@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Dabija, Dan-Cristian/I-8101-2012; Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/L-9045-2016; Postelnicu, Catalin/F-6352-2016","Dabija, Dan-Cristian/0000-0002-8265-175X; Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/0000-0003-4565-4879; Postelnicu, Catalin/0000-0001-7892-9993",,,,,40,12,12,0,43,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,726,745,,,,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400003,0

This study analyzes unique data from Burundi, testing three hypotheses: relative deprivation, investment, and insurance, derived from New Economics of Labor Migration studies, employing propensity score matching. Results show that remittances are common among wealthier households, rejecting the relative deprivation hypothesis. Remittances have strong effects on non-productive assets, such as living conditions and food security, and weak effects on productive assets, such as asset ownership. Poorer households invest mostly in non-productive assets, suggesting that remittances are insurance for the poor, whereas wealthier households seem largely unaffected by remittances.

We also consider the frequently discussed measure to require the issuer disclose certain information of the securitized assets. In a dynamic model with asymmetric information between a risk-averse originating bank and a continuum of risk-averse investors, we find that it is impossible for a flat-rate retention requirement to be optimal for all asset types. Although both risk retention and information disclosure regulations are effective in reducing investors' informational loss, neither can unconditionally enhance social welfare upon the unregulated case. For both measures, there are associated regulatory cost: risk retention regulation aggravates adverse selection problem because it undermines the channel of informational revelation by the choice of securitization intensity, and information disclosure requirement incurs a signalling cost by distorting banks' securitization intensity in sending signals. Under an appropriate set of conditions we find that information disclosure requirement complements risk retention regulation when investors are sufficiently risk averse. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical record of Morales' first five years in office, however, illustrates significant neoliberal continuities in the country's political economy. At the same time, the most important social movements that resisted neoliberalism prior to Morales' election have been considerably demobilized in its wake. This gives rise to the critique that the Morales government has merely implemented a more politically stable version of the model of accumulation it inherited. This paper draws on recent field research in Bolivia to make a contribution to this broader research agenda on reconstituted neoliberalism. Our focus is twofold. On the one hand, the paper examines the continuities of agrarian class relations from the INRA law at the height of neoliberalism in 1996 to the various agrarian reform initiatives introduced since Morales assumed office in 2006. On the other hand, the paper traces the mobilization of the Bolivian Landless Peasants' Movement (MST) in response to the failure of the 1996 neoliberal agrarian reform, followed by the movement's demobilization after Morales' 2006 agrarian reform initiative. The paper explores this demobilization in the context of agrarian relations that have remained largely unchanged in the same period. Finally, the paper draws on recent reflections by MST members who, to varying degrees, seem to be growing critical of Morales' failure to fundamentally alter rural class relations, and the difficulties of remobilizing their movement at the present time.","[Brabazon, Honor] Univ Oxford Univ Coll, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford OX1 4BH, England; [Webber, Jeffery R.] Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London E1 4NS, England",University of Oxford; University of London,"Brabazon, H (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Univ Coll, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford OX1 4BH, England.",honor.brabazon@politics.ox.ac.uk; j.r.webber@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,100,15,17,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Four conditional univariate GARCH models are used to estimate the volatility in the stock indexes for large and small firms in Taiwan. Daily data from 30 November 2001 to 27 February 2013 are used, which covers the period of Cross-Straits tension between China and Taiwan. The full sample period is divided into two subsamples, namely prior to and after the policy reform that encouraged Chinese tourists to Taiwan. The empirical findings confirm that there have been important changes in the volatility size effects for firm performance, regardless of firm size and estimation period. Furthermore, the risk premium reveals insignificant estimates in both time periods, while asymmetric effects are found to exist only for large firms after the policy reform. The empirical findings should be useful for financial managers and policy analysts as it provides insight into the magnitude of the volatility size effects for firm performance, how it can vary with firm size, the impacts arising from the industry policy reform, and how firm size is related to financial risk management strategy.

The optimal risk choice depends on the ratio of the fund's assets under management to its high-water mark. If the manager's outside option value is low, investors' termination policy is strict, or management fees are high, then negative returns induce the manager into derisking. Otherwise, he engages in gambling. Having the option to walk away increases risk taking, though in many cases exercise is never optimal.

Bailed-out banks initiate riskier loans and shift assets toward riskier securities after receiving government support. However, this shift in risk occurs mostly within the same asset class and, therefore, remains undetected by regulatory capital ratios, which indicate improved capitalization at bailed-out banks. Consequently, these banks appear safer according to regulatory ratios, but show an increase in volatility and default risk. These findings are robust to controlling for credit demand and account for selection of TARP recipients by exploiting banks' geography-based political connections as an instrument for bailout approvals.

We first employ a random level-shift autoregressive model to quantify the shift in investment ratios of four Asian economies hit by the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis: Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. We trace the major historical shifts in the levels of investment ratios and we find that the cumulated downward shifts in investment ratios during 1997-1998 for Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand are 6, 5, 14, and 14 percentage points, respectively. The investment ratios of most countries experienced several rebounds between 1999 and 2001, but the rebounds were too small to bring investment ratios back to their pre-1990 levels. Having identified the episodes of investment shifts, the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and several robust tests are employed to investigate the determinants of those level shifts in investment ratios. We find that real per capita gross domestic product growth and banking crises are the two most important factors contributing to shifts in the investment levels of these four crisis-hit Asian economies. The results are useful in understanding the causes and remedies of global imbalances.

Our findings enrich the current view on the entrepreneurial team, but also warn against the implementation of one-size-fits-all employee involvement programs in small firms.","[Andries, Petra; Czarnitzki, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Andries, Petra; Czarnitzki, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr R&D Monitoring ECOOM, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Andries, Petra] Univ Ghent, Dept Management Innovat & Entrepreneurship, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Czarnitzki, Dirk] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; Ghent University; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Czarnitzki, D (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",petra.andries@kuleuven.be; dirk.czarnitzki@kuleuven.be,"Czarnitzki, Dirk/AAV-4124-2021",,,,,,155,89,116,3,148,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We derive convenient closed-form option valuation formulas, and we assess the option valuation properties using Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 return and option data.

A survey of students aged 11 to 13, revealed that an overwhelming majority walk to school, while bicycling and bus use are minimal. Students who walk to school often do so as part of a larger group of schoolmates, attend schools that are located relatively near their house, are faced with relatively few major road crossings during their journey, and belong to families that are less likely to own a car. Children who are driven to school (only 13.5% of our sample) usually have higher-income families and live farther from the school. Although Tirana's high residential density has some environmental drawbacks, we deem it positive in that its result is that most students live very close to their schools and in close proximity to classmates walking to school. The fine grain pattern of the urban public school network contributes to the short distances between schools and homes. We provide a number of recommendations for the promotion of walking in home-school trips, as well as for the future physical development of the city and the school network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper develops a microlandscapes approach that combines fragmentation measures with quasi-experimental evaluation methods in order to assess the effects of policy on habitat fragmentation. As an application, the paper estimates whether and to what extent wildlife sanctuaries and national parks in Thailand prevented forest loss and fragmentation. I find that both types of protected areas significantly increased forest cover, average forest patch size and maximum forest patch size. Comparisons between the two types indicate that wildlife sanctuaries were more effective than national parks in terms of protecting forest in the interior versus exterior areas of parks and preventing fragmentation conditional on the level of forest cover. The differences are consistent with predicted differences resulting from spatial patterns of enforcement that are uniform or core-focused in the wildlife sanctuaries versus boundary-focused or include agglomeration penalties in the national parks. Given the greater effectiveness of wildlife sanctuaries in preventing fragmentation and the suggestive link to enforcement types, these results reinforce existing theoretical work urging conservation managers to consider how the spatial distribution of enforcement may affect patterns of resource use.","Amherst Coll, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",Amherst College,"Sims, KRE (通讯作者)，Amherst Coll, Dept Econ, AC 2201, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",ksims@amherst.edu,,"Sims, Katharine/0000-0002-9854-6807",,,,,105,34,38,3,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Among the documents under analysis we can mention contractual agreements, applicable procedures, as well as relevant empirical data provided by NAPC, NAMRC, economic operators and a site for online complaints, namely ReclamatieOnline.ro. The analyses emphasize that consumer complaints are mainly due to problems arising from contracts with service providers, billing services and defects of electronic terminals under warranty. The main cause for all this is the insufficient information users are provided with and, therefore, consumers' decreased ability in the decision making process involved in the purchase of mobile technology and internet services.

Telematics works at the interface of road vehicles and the road network, helping to ensure the former make the most efficient and rational use of the latter. The exact nature of this interaction is the topic of this paper. Four archetypal street patterns were modelled using traffic microsimulation, populated with vehicles possessing various levels of telematics, and run multiple times to reveal outcomes in terms of journey length, duration, cost and carbon emissions. The findings show that the topology of urban street patterns interacts strongly with the level of telematics and the route guidance it provides. In some network types the amount of route guidance provided led to consistent improvements in network and vehicle performance, whilst in other networks the same performance could be achieved with 100% telematics as it could with 0%. A fundamental relationship is revealed between the universal network coefficient Beta (beta) and the overall level of telematics required to optimise performance across all variables. The implications for telematics strategies are profound: it seems that every driver does not need to know everything in order to bring about optimal network performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that the survival of innovative and non-innovative enterprises is linked to personal criteria such as age, gender, belonging to a minority, professional experience and financing sources. Our results also highlight the positive effect of not being alone in the start-up design phase, whereas being involved in a business network after the start-up period has no significant influence. The survival time of innovative enterprises, which is significantly lower than that of the non-innovative ones, seems adversely influenced by the entrepreneur's previous management experience. Finally, when considering both innovative and non-innovative start-ups, there appears to be a type of pecking order as bank financing has a much more positive effect on survival than a personal one, although when focusing solely on innovative ones this difference does not exist.","[Boyer, Tristan] IPAG LAB, F-75006 Paris, France; [Blazy, Regis] EM Strasbourg Business Sch, IEP Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France",,"Boyer, T (通讯作者)，IPAG LAB, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",tristan.boyer@ipag.fr,,,,,,,86,90,110,1,112,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This differential sensitivity to IST shocks has two main implications. First, firm risk premia depend on the contribution of growth opportunities to firm value. Second, firms with similar levels of growth opportunities comove with each other, giving rise to the value factor in stock returns and the failure of the conditional CAPM.

I develop and test a new hypothesis that accounting conservatism is associated with managers making less risky investments. I find that under more conservative accounting managers make less risky acquisitions and that firms with accounting-based debt covenants drive this association. This result is consistent with conservative firms avoiding risky investments because of the potential for large losses to trigger debt covenants. Conservatism reducing risk-shifting can in part explain debt holders' demand for conservative accounting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In many developing economies, agents participate in multiple activities, creating linkages between resource exploitation and other sectors (e.g., agriculture). In Northern Honduran fishing communities, households allocate effort to fishing according to the opportunity cost of their time, which depends on returns in other activities. We develop a model that demonstrates how market structure impacts fishery exploitation. Agricultural price increases have an ambiguous effect on labor allocated to fishing because they reduce the value of labor in fishing but increase the demand for fish via an income effect. The size and magnitude of impacts depend strongly on the tradability of inputs and outputs in the community economy. The findings point to a need to account for economic linkages and market structure when designing policies to reduce pressure on a natural resource.","[Manning, Dale T.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Taylor, J.

However, the average invested amount declines by 0.8 %, leading to a net positive total increase of about 0.9 %. This result indicates that, to a considerable extent, demand for informal investment creates its own supply. As a result, the research finds that market forces help solve finance constraints for new ventures and hence lessen the need for public policy intervention.

Scholars suggest that both structural forces and individual preferences help explain these residential patterns. However, less attention is paid to where preferences come from, and how they respond to policies and social structure to shape residential decisionmaking. In this paper, we use data from fieldwork with 110 participants in the Baltimore Mobility Program (BMP), an assisted mobility voucher program, to demonstrate how residential preferences can shift over time as a function of living in higher opportunity neighborhoods. Since 2003, BMP has helped over 2,000 low-income African American families move from high-poverty, highly segregated neighborhoods in Baltimore City to low-poverty, racially mixed neighborhoods throughout the Baltimore region. Along with intensive counseling and unique program administration, these new neighborhood contexts helped many women to shift what we term residential choice frameworks: the criteria that families use to assess housing and neighborhoods. Parents who participated in the mobility program raised their expectations for what neighborhoods, homes, and schools can provide for their children and themselves. Parents report new preferences for the quiet of suburban locations, and strong consideration of school quality and neighborhood diversity when thinking about where to live. Our findings suggest that housing policies should employ counseling to ensure relocation to and sustained residence in low-poverty communities. Our work also underscores how social structure, experience, and policy opportunities influence preferences, and how these preferences, in turn, affect policy outcomes.","[Darrah, Jennifer] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [DeLuca, Stefanie] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Sociol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Johns Hopkins University,"Darrah, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",darrah@post.harvard.edu; sdeluca@jhu.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1124004] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,122,55,72,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

First, the challenger decides whether to choose a high-risk campaign (e.g., risky platforms, negative campaigning, an interactive Web technology) or a less risky one. In a second stage, both the challenger and the incumbent raise funds and invest in the electoral contest. The politicians differ in their fund-raising costs. According to theory, a high-cost challenger should choose high risk (gambling for resurrection). If the benefit of winning is sufficiently large, a low-cost challenger should take high risk either to discourage the incumbent or to prevent intense campaigning. Both effects are based on the fact that high risk campaigning reduces incentives to invest in the contest. In case of a rather small benefit of winning, a low-cost challenger should prefer low risk to avoid jeopardizing his competitive advantage. Our experimental findings show that gambling for resurrection plays a role. Taking low risk to preserve a competitive advantage is strongly supported by the data. However, reactions of low-cost challengers when facing high benefits of winning are heterogeneous. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To address the potential endogeneity in the determination of airport sizes, the 1944 National Airport Plan is used to instrument for the current distribution of airports. Airport size is found to have a positive effect on the employment share of tradable services, controlling for overall local employment, but no measurable effect on manufacturing or most non-tradable sectors. The effect of airport size on overall local employment is practically zero, suggesting that airports lead to specialization but not growth at the metropolitan-area level. The implied elasticity of tradable-service employment with respect to airport size is approximately 0.22. The results are relevant to the evaluation of airport construction or improvement projects that aim to benefit the local economy by making travel to and from the metropolitan area more convenient.

The modernization of China required the accumulation of public capital and the building of good institutions, upon which a vibrant class of merchants and entrepreneurs could gradually emerge. This class contributed to the enrichment of the society and the emperor, but its activities also weakened the dominance of the emperor and the elite, who would then prefer to block the modernization of China and to restrict the size of the merchant class, putting the economy into long-run stagnation. However, when the emperor faced severe foreign military threats and when he realized that a modern sector improved the defense capabilities of China, he made the opposite choice.","[Laffargue, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris 01, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Chan, Kenneth S.] City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon 220, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; City University of Hong Kong,"Laffargue, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",jean-pierre.laffargue@orange.fr,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We calibrate a standard endowment model of multiple assets under recursive preferences. The momentum effect partly comes from investors' aversion to consumption risks. An unexpected dividend increase generates a positive return and increases the asset's proportion of consumption, raising the correlation between its future dividend growth and consumption growth. This is compensated by a higher expected return, generating the momentum effect. The cross-sectional difference in expected returns is also a key contributor. The quantified model produces sizable momentum profits, often close to the observed profits.","[Choi, Seung Mo] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Kim, Hwagyun] Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Washington State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mays Business School,"Choi, SM (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, POB 646210, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",choism@wsu.edu; hagenkim@tamu.edu,,,,,,,39,5,6,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

We introduce a new, comprehensive database, made publicly available, on bank ownership (including the home country of foreign banks) for 5,324 banks in 137 countries over the period 1995-2009. We document large increases in foreign bank presence in many countries, but with substantial heterogeneity in terms of host and banks' home countries, bilateral investment patterns, and bank characteristics. In terms of impact, we document that the relation between private credit and foreign bank presence importantly depends on host country and banks' characteristics. Specifically, foreign banks only seem to have a negative impact on credit in low-income countries, in countries where they have a limited market share, where enforcing contracts is costly and where credit information is limited available, and when they come from distant home countries. This shows that accounting for heterogeneity, including bilateral ownership, is crucial to better understand the implications of foreign bank ownership.","[Claessens, Stijn] Univ Amsterdam, Int Monetary Fund, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Van Horen, Neeltje] DNB, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Claessens, S (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Int Monetary Fund, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",sclaessens@imf.org; n.van.horen@dnb.nl,,,,,,,52,266,289,2,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In former colonies with low precolonial population density, the common law has promoted high financial development, but where endowments were abundant, this legal tradition has not worked well. In contrast, the effect of the French civil law on finance is invariant to endowments.

Our results imply that credit ratings are not sufficient for pricing, which is surprising given their central role in structured finance markets. This illustrates limitations of the rating methodologies that are solely based on real-world default probabilities or expected losses and do not capture risk premia. We also demonstrate that CDO tranches have large exposure to systematic risk and thus their ratings and prices are likely to decline substantially when credit conditions deteriorate.

It is motivated by recent puzzling empirical evidence of taxable municipal bond yields significantly exceeding the level expected relative to tax exempt bonds. A behavioral explanation is a tax aversion bias, the phenomenon that people perceive an additional burden associated with tax payments. We conduct market experiments on the trading of differently taxed and labeled securities. The data show an initial overvaluation of tax payments that diminishes when subjects gain experience. The tax deduction of expenses is valued more than an equivalent tax exemption of earnings. We find that the persistence of the tax aversion bias critically depends on the quality of feedback. This suggests that tax aversion predominantly occurs in one-time, unfamiliar financial decisions and to a lesser extent in repetitive choices.","[Blaufus, Kay; Moehlmann, Axel] Leibniz Univ Hannover, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Blaufus, K (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Koenigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",blaufus@steuern.uni-hannover.de,"Blaufus, Kay/AAO-5847-2020","Blaufus, Kay/0000-0001-9010-3772",,,,,34,19,20,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Stakeholder engagement is considered one of the key elements to help facilitate an increased uptake of green business models. There is limited research available on principles and mechanisms to enhance stakeholder engagement. This paper aims to investigate principles for engaging stakeholder in the context of the UK construction industry as a means towards achieving a green business model transformation. Qualitative research was used to investigate the practice of stakeholder engagement with 19 managers and academics in the construction sector. Semi- structured interviews were conducted with these professionals and thematic analysis was used to identify themes that display effective stakeholder engagement practice. The findings suggest that stakeholder engagement is a driver contributing towards an organizations success and it can help green business models implementation. Practices, of stakeholders engagement, emerge from the data include: top level support; staff empowerment; incentive and reward; collaboration; effective communication; understanding clients need; being proactive; interacting early with clients; building relationships; partnering; and matching or facilitating different services. Organizations' ability to interact and engage with stakeholder will be a major game changer on the competition environment.

However software engineers are usually driven by time-to-market pressure and haven't a comprehensive understanding of how to apply sustainability-improving techniques to integrate sustainability into their software systems. While software engineering research and practice has suggested a large amount of techniques that can indirectly support software sustainability, a holistic overview is missing. The research goal of this project is to overcome the barriers of incorporating sustainability into software systems through the use of a recommender system. This system will recommend the kinds of sustainability techniques that could be considered in a given situation. This paper proposes a preliminary architecture of a software sustainability recommender system designed to make software engineers aware of existing techniques and guidelines to integrate sustainable alternatives in software products.","[Amri, Rahma] Univ Manouba, Ecole Nationale Sci Informat, RIADI Lab, Manouba, Tunisia; [Ben Saoud, Narjes Bellamine] Univ Tunis EL Manar, Inst Super Informat, RIADI Lab, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de la Manouba; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar,"Amri, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manouba, Ecole Nationale Sci Informat, RIADI Lab, Manouba, Tunisia.",rahma.amri@gmail.com; narjes.bellamine@ensi.rnu.tn,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,585,590,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300063,0

The material consistency and the temporal continuity of built heritage in Mediterranean city make relevant its interpretation and analysis according to the resilient approach. The declination of this approach in many disciplines generated a substantial diversity among the definitions of resilience (Francis and Bekera, 2014). Consequently, frameworks, adopted for a quantitative or qualitative assessment, underline the lack of standardization and rigor in defining resilience measurements. A review of resilience literature and actual applications in urban context permit to understand that there are different operators working on the field: on the one hand there are international organizations, on the other hand there are academics. The review of both the two ambits of investigation intends to clarify specific properties and convergence points in order to trace an evolution of conceptual framework and to identify general features of urban resilience. This process is fundamental in focusing the main aims of the research program: the definition of the role of urban built heritage, given by the close correlation between masonry constructive technique, typologies and morphologies, its material value in urban system, and its relevance in Mediterranean city in constitution of urban resilience (UNISDR, 2012a). Despite an increasing number of academic studies concerning the role of built environment in defining and improving cities resilience, their major attention is still focused on street patterns and lifelines infrastructures.

Democratic-leaning firms spend $20 million more on CSR than Republican-leaning firms ($80 million more within the sample of S&P 500 firms), or roughly 10% of net income. We find no evidence that firms recover these expenditures through increased sales. Indeed, increases in firm CSR ratings are associated with negative future stock returns and declines in firm ROA, suggesting that any benefits to stakeholders from social responsibility come at the direct expense of firm value.

The dynamics of NPLs is an important topic since they serve as an indicator of financial imbalances, especially in the context of the recent economic crisis where there are many debates related to the factors responsible for financial vulnerability. After one decade in which borrowing had grown constantly due to the deregulation of financial markets, the recent economic crisis highlighted the importance of managing correctly credit risk in relation with the macroeconomic context. Given the fact that the transition economies from Central and Eastern Europe experienced profound transformation of the banking system, the purpose of our study is to investigate the explanatory power of macroeconomic variables as determinants of NPLs in these banking sectors.

We explore the different sources of serial persistence in the data (unobserved country pair effects, genuine state dependence, and transitory shocks) and examine the crucial factors affecting the decision to invest in a host country. Methodology - Based on a gravity setup, we consider investment behavior at the extensive (participation) margin and employ dynamic first-order Markov probit models, controlling for unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity and serial correlation in the transitory error component, in order to explore the sources of persistence. Within this modeling framework we explore the importance of institutional quality of the host country in attracting foreign investment. Findings - The data support that the strong persistence is driven by true state dependence, implying that past investment experiences strongly impact on the trajectory of future investment holdings. Institutional quality appears to play a significant role to attract foreign investment. Research implications - The empirical findings suggest that due to the existence of genuine state dependence, inward-investment stimulating policy measures could have a more pronounced effect since they are likely to induce a permanent change to the future trajectory of inward investment. Originality - Both the substantial number of zeros and the salient persistence characterizing bilateral investment holdings decision have been previously overlooked in the literature. A study modeling jointly the levels and the selection mechanism could prove a fruitful direction for future research.","[Drakos, Konstantinos] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Athens 10434, Greece; [Kyriazidou, Ekaterini; Polycarpou, Ioannis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Drakos, K (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Athens 10434, Greece.",kdrakos@aueb.gr,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78350-756-6; 978-1-78350-755-9,INT SYMP EC,,,2014,23.0,,,,,,125,152,,10.1108/S1571-038620140000023005,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358526100005,0

This raises the question of whether foreign firms avoid listing in the USA after SOX because the Act imposes unnecessary costs upon firms. The objective of this article is to reconcile the US and international evidence by distinguishing between the effect of SOX on controlling shareholders and managers of foreign firms and the effect on minority investors of these firms. Our results suggest that insiders of foreign firms believe that the regulation makes the extraction of value from minority investors more difficult and costly for them. Outside investors in foreign firms, on the other hand, seem on average to believe that SOX is beneficial to them. The combination of these results reconciles the existing US and international evidence regarding SOX.","[Duarte, Jefferson] Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Kong, Katie; Siegel, Stephan; Young, Lance] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Rice University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Duarte, J (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",,"Siegel, Stephan/E-9098-2011","Siegel, Stephan/0000-0002-7938-6940",,,,,47,8,10,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Absent other legislative changes, the reform will come into force on January 1, 2015. We evaluate its impacts on the tax burdens and the average and marginal tax rates in a representative sample of Czech individuals and households. The main impact of the reform is a reduction in the average tax rates for the self-employed in the 5th through 10th income deciles, most frequently by 4.4 percentage points. The variation in the change in the average tax rates among the self-employed in low incomes deciles is large and varies between minus 5 to plus 5 percentage points. The reform would reduce the taxes for most employees only slightly but it would increase the average tax rate by up to 5 percentage points for employees with earnings exceeding four times the average wage. The effective marginal tax rates faced by the self-employed would drop most commonly by either 4.4 or 10-11 percentage points, while the effective marginal tax rates faced by employees would remain unchanged. The impacts on the households are highly heterogeneous depending on the share of income from self-employment in the household's total income. The reform would reduce the budget revenues by approximately CZK 19 billion.","[Dusek, Libor; Kaliskova, Klara; Muenich, Daniel] CERGE EI, CZ-11121 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Dusek, Libor] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dusek, L (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, CZ-11121 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",libor.dusek@cerge-ei.cz,"Dušek, Libor/AHD-6685-2022; Kalíšková, Klára/H-2887-2014; Dušek, Libor/G-3205-2013; Munich, Daniel/B-8891-2008","Dušek, Libor/0000-0001-8054-3002; Kalíšková, Klára/0000-0002-4762-086X;",,,,,12,5,5,0,13,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Sinaloa's entry into maize has restructured the geography of national supply, and generated a new national confidence in white maize self-sufficiency. Using semi-structured interviews and secondary data, we document the primary social and political drivers of Sinaloa's maize boom. Local actors trumpet Sinaloa's response as a success story of entrepreneurship and technological innovation, while simultaneously appropriating the language of food sovereignty to justify preferential entitlements in public investment. Our analysis confirms interpretations of neoliberalism as a political project, illustrating how existing natural, social and political capital held by specific interest groups can be leveraged and reinforced through private-public partnerships to mould national policy and investment, and the potential vulnerabilities that may emerge from this process.","[Eakin, Hallie; Bausch, Julia C.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Sweeney, Stuart] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Eakin, H (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, 800 S Cady Mall,POB 875502,Mail Code 5502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Hallie.Eakin@asu.edu; jcbausch@asu.edu; Sweeney@geog.ucsb.edu,"Sweeney, Stuart/G-7024-2015","Sweeney, Stuart/0000-0003-3450-6870",,,,,97,26,38,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Little research has examined involuntary teacher transfer policies or their effects on schools, teachers, or students. This article uses administrative data from Miami-Dade County Public Schools to investigate the implementation and effects of the district's involuntary transfer policy, including which schools transferred and received teachers, which teachers were transferred, what kinds of teachers replaced them in their former schools, and how their performanceas measured by their work absences and value-added in math and readingcompared before and after the transfer. We find that, under the policy, principals in the lowest performing schools identified relatively low-performing teachers for transfer who, based on observable characteristics, would have been unlikely to leave on their own. Consistent with an equity improvement, we find that involuntarily transferred teachers were systematically moved to higher performing schools and generally were outperformed by the teachers who replaced them. Efficiency impacts are mixed; although transferred teachers had nearly two fewer absences per year in their new positions, transferred teachers continued to have low value-added in their new schools.

The relations between monetary and fiscal policy its coordination, cooperation or mutual antagonism are basic determinants of successful economic policy implementation of each country. Fiscal and. monetary policies usually have different aims. Therefore, some conflict situations may arise in practical economic and political decision-making process. Methodical approaches of this article are based on the game theory, which deals with the analysis of a wide range of decision-making situations with more participants (players); it is primarily focused on the conflict situations. Our results confirm the stabilizing role of monetary policy in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary, also the dominant role of monetary policy in the Czech Republic and the dominant role of fiscal policy in Hungary. In the case of Slovakia, inconsistent results concerning the monetary policy role are probably caused by its EMR II membership and Eurozone entry in 2009.","[Janku, Jan; Kappel, Stanislav; Kucerova, Zuzana] VSB TU Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Janku, J (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",jan.janku@vsb.cz; stanislav.kappel@vsb.cz; zuzana.kucerova@vsb.cz,"Kucerova, Zuzana/K-6162-2018; Janků, Jan/AAA-7569-2021","Kucerova, Zuzana/0000-0001-6888-9262; Janku, Jan/0000-0002-4112-4611",,,,,26,3,3,0,12,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The system is based on algorithms developed by the authors. The system was developed and fine-tuned in the course of the Android project. The authors based their Advisory System on the presumption that, by assigning a user post-disaster stress self-assessment and then looking for the interdependency with the user's biometric parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, pupil, skin conductance and humidity; body, forehead, nose, left and right cheek, chin, left palm and left middle finger temperatures, etc.) recorded at that time, it is possible to determine the link rather accurately. In other words, a user internally senses the actual rating of his/her personal post-disaster stress. Their existing experiences and intuition give users a rather accurate indication about their post-disaster stress. A sufficient number of studies have been performed worldwide and quite many systems have been developed that apply biometric technologies to establish different human states of stress. The global innovative aspects of the Biometric Advisory System, developed by the authors, are primarily that it determines the level and symptoms of the post-disaster stress, carrying out multivariant design of a disaster stress management life cycle (emergency response, recovery, prevention/mitigation and preparedness/readiness) and alternative recommendations applicable to a specific user (on ways to reduce post-disaster stress), performs a multiple criteria analysis of it and selects the ten most rational ones (disaster stress management life cycle and tips) for that user. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) is used as a self-assessment instrument to determine the symptoms of post-disaster stress stress and to draw up recommendations. Also, the users were assessed with the IES-R in order to define the significance of posttraumatic stress symptoms. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Attention must be given to rehabilitate the business community that is affected by these disasters. However, improper planning for recovering damages in business community becomes a major issue when it obstructs the continuation and development of the business community. Therefore, required measures should be taken to avoid collapsing of development of the business community affected by disasters. In this context, insurance plays a vital role to reinstate the business while reducing the financial consequences of the disaster. This study investigates the role of insurance as a provision to recover the disastrous destruction of the business community in Sri Lanka. To achieve this, the survey method was used as the approach and semi structured interviews carried out within five experts from insurance sector and eight experts from the business community. Content analysis was used to analyze the collected data from the empirical study. The analysis of the findings based on two areas of insurers' and insured' perception of insurance. One of the major finding was that the insurance is not extended to any frequent disaster prone area of the country unless accepted by the insured with either higher premium amount or higher amount of deductible. As per the insurer's side, some issues of the current practice are identified as less awareness, dishonesty and fraudulent practice of the insured which leads to less identification of the insurance as a risk management strategy within the business community. According to the insured, main purposes of obtaining insurance are quick recovery of business and to fulfil the borrowing requirements. Recommendations were developed as increase the awareness, educating and the government participation to increase the insurance penetration to the business community. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The methodology of dynamic modelling allows us to express the hidden relationships that cannot be observed directly, but can be derived in keeping with the observed data. If we extend the DSGE model by an implemented decision function of legislators and decision-makers in the administration of the social system, then this implementation is indirectly incorporated into decision rules of households and companies. Any changes to the system set-up are therefore reflected in the changes in the behaviour of the system's entities, making the resulting behaviour of the system a credible description of reality.

We hypothesize that increased disclosure level can reduce information asymmetry, which in turn improves capital investment efficiency. Consistent with our hypothesis, we document a significantly negative association between disclosure level and measures of inefficient investments, such as level of investment inefficiency, overinvestment, and underinvestment, indicating that firms increased disclosure level are found to improve investment efficiency. These results are robustness after using various measures for level of investment inefficiency and increased disclosure and considering different types of disclosure such as voluntary disclosure. Overall, our findings suggest that through reducing information asymmetry, increased disclosure level induces managers to act in the best interest of shareholders, which improves capital investment efficiency.","[Lai, Shu-Miao] Kainan Univ, Dept Accounting, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Liu, Chih-Liang] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Management, Dept Ind & Business Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Wang, Taychang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Accounting, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",Nan Kai University Technology; Chang Gung University; National Taiwan University,"Liu, CL (通讯作者)，Chang Gung Univ, Coll Management, Dept Ind & Business Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",clliu@mail.cgu.edu.tw,"Liu, Chih-Liang/H-9589-2019","Liu, Chih-Liang/0000-0001-8869-4585",,,,,47,28,32,5,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

With this in mind, what would Malaysians' choices be? Products made in China are often cheaper compared to locally made products, mainly due to China's massive production industry.

It is therefore imperative for SME to strengthen its governance, risk and control (GRC) system that is recommended by Corporate Governance (CG) code to support strong business performance. Internal auditor is the right party to provide assurance and consultancy on GRC for a firm to stay competitive. There is generally a lack of awareness among these enterprises regarding significance of internal audit and if there is awareness, there is a general aversion to adopting these practices because of the cost of implementation. This paper was carried out solely through analysis of extant literatures. We identified from reports and previous studies that SME failures are contributed by several factors including low productivity, lack of financing as well as inadequate skills and capabilities. The corporate governance literature posits that companies may achieve strategic, tactical and operational efficiency by embracing good CG principles which include risk management and controls mechanism. Further, internal audit enhance CG through assurance and consultancy work on GRC. Based on the findings from the review of extant literatures, it was found that current status of CG in SMEs are not impressive at all, mainly because of lack of awareness as well as high cost of implementation involved. However, good governance is still deemed important; hence we may argue that a separate set of corporate governance framework may work better for SMEs, similar to the adoption of a separate set of IFRS for SMEs.

The results show the existence of a low intensity of the connection between the accounting information and that generated by the stock market, which points to a limited impact of the data provided by the financial statements on the investment decisions. It is possible to notice, however, a superior level of the analyzed correlation, both in the case of auditing the synthesis documents by consecrated companies, and in the conditions of expressing a previous audit opinion, with certain reserves.

For example, every year Australian communities are subjected to the damaging impacts of disasters associated with climate change and sea level rise. Far little literature on disaster stakeholder management is present and even that has not scrutinized the concept in terms of stakeholder's proactive and/or reactive approaches toward disasters. In addition, there exists insufficient information and support for developing and application of measurement tools to assess stakeholder's responses to disasters. Hence, the aim of this study is to develop an index to measure Australian stakeholder's approaches - proactive and/or reactive - against disasters in transport infrastructure. The Stakeholder Disaster Response Index (SDRI) is a composite index that allows direct comparison of stakeholders' approaches, and describes the relative contributions of socio-economic, built environment and stakeholder's attributes to that overall response. Results indicate that Australian Councils have chosen more reactive approaches than proactive tasks; moreover, stakeholder's attributes are significant factor contributing to the implementation of proactive and/or reactive approaches, even when controlling for contextual characteristics. The research concludes the anticipated benefits of SDRI for direct comparison of different stakeholder's approaches against disasters in society and the built environment. Such a comparison could be useful for governments, emergency institutions, and disaster management organizations as they allocate scarce resources among various stakeholders. Insurance and reinsurance companies could employ it as they plan their portfolio diversification and establish premiums for disaster insurance policies. Finally, it paves the way for stakeholders to have comprehensive plans for resilient built environment by taking more proactive approaches in disaster risk management. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The main aim of this strategy is first to reduce inflation at low levels and then take under the control at these levels. It is agreed that unless the target variations (or target range) occurred depending upon economic fluctuations are permanent, they do not create any negative effects on the success of approach.

The paper intends to analyse the volatility of the leu/euro exchange rate taken into account the influence of the volatility of other currencies and other fundamental macroeconomic variables. The analysis is based on specific methods for high frequency time series. The database is comprised of daily time series for the period 05.01.2000-31.08.2013. The application of different ARCH-GARCH models indicate that the volatility of the leu/euro exchange rate follows an ARCH process, that there is a high asymmetry in the evaluation of information regarding the evolution of the exchange rate and that the exchange rate returns are correlated with volatility.

An inquiry was carried out using a sample of 148 respondents asking questions concerning the options offered by the employer and those preferred by the respondents for work-life balance. The research of the options for work life balance offered by the employer reflects particular situations in a sample of Czech-based companies and organisations. The results corroborated the rigidity of options offered by the employer to senior employees. According to the results of the research on the work-life-balance options as preferred by the employees, the following options in descending order would be welcomed by a majority: part-time work, flexible working hours, home office, and company kindergarten.

The IMF couples the crop rotation model CropRota, the bio-physical process model EPIC and the bottom-up economic land use model PASMA at regional level (NUTS-3) considering agri-environmental indicators. Four contrasting regional climate model (RCM) simulations represent climate change until 2050. The RCM simulations are applied to a baseline and three adaptation and policy scenarios. Climate change increases crop productivity on national average in the IMF. Changes in average gross margins at national level range from 0% to + 5% between the baseline and the three adaptation and policy scenarios. The impacts at NUTS-3 level range from -5% to + 7% between the baseline and the three adaptation and policy scenarios. Adaptation measures such as planting of winter cover crops, reduced tillage and irrigation are effective in reducing yield losses, increasing revenues, or in improving environmental states under climate change.

It is a fact that not every farm can implement precision crop production into practice, it depends on their size, production structure, technical level/equipment and finally on the labour skills.

I use bivariate regime-switching models to investigate the alternation of high-risk and low-risk markets, where the high-risk regime is characterized by higher and more volatilities with weaker cross-market linkages. Common information about economic and financial conditions appears to drive VIX and MOVE fluctuations between the two risk regimes. Two-regime specifications also distinguish between information spillover and common information effects. Ignoring regime shifts leads to spurious extreme persistence and incomplete inferences about asymmetric volatility. The findings carry important implications for asset allocation.

But there is still a gap to explain the mechanism why this happened. Based on such concerns, this paper integrated the model of antecedents and consequences of interpersonal forgiveness and vulnerability, and developed conceptual framework of the impact of brand credibility on forgiveness in order to examine the impact mechanism of brand credibility on forgiveness under ambiguous product harm crises. Two empirical studies were based on real product harm crises. Questionnaires were used to collect data and structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the direction and strength among constructs. The results of structural equation modeling of two studies suggest that brand credibility negatively affects perceived vulnerability. And at the same time perceived vulnerability positively affects rumination and negatively affects forgiveness. The results also show that rumination negatively affects forgiveness. Brand visibility moderates the relationship between brand credibility and perceived vulnerability. Compared to low brand visibility, When brand visibility is high, the effects of brand credibility on perceived vulnerability are stronger.

Specifically, it considers the importance of three different types of financial institutions: low-end financial institutions, specialized lenders, and banks. Two findings stand out. First, dominance of the financial system by banks is associated with lower use of financial services by firms of all sizes, while low-end financial institutions and specialized lenders seem particularly suited to ease access to finance in low-income countries. Second, there is no evidence that smaller institutions are better in providing access to finance. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous branch-level studies of sales efficiency consider a static setting of a single time period, ignoring the stochastic nature of sales outcomes. In this paper, we examine efficiency and performance of sales teams in a bank branch network over time, taking into account the changing demand and operational conditions, as well as random disturbances. The intertemporal sales frontier is estimated from the panel of monthly data over the years 2007-2010 using the stochastic semi-nonparametric envelopment of data (StoNED) method. The efficiency scores of sales teams and the trajectories of performance over time allow managers and the sales force to learn from past events and to develop the managerial and work practices across the network. While this study focuses on the case of a specific bank, some of the innovative features of our approach are applicable to sales efficiency assessment in other banks and financial institutions, as well as other network-based sales organizations.

We find that prior to deregulation there is no relation between probability to engage in value destroying acquisitions or acquirer returns and antitakeover indices, whereas after the adoption of the FSMA, probability to engage in value destroying acquisitions and the stock market reaction to bidder M&A announcements are both significantly related to governance indexes and measures.

Because choices about land development tend to have long-lasting impacts that span over decades, understanding the magnitude of this influence is critical to the design of policies to reduce emissions and other negative externalities associated with car use. Combining household survey data from Germany with satellite imagery and other geo-referenced data sources, we undertake an econometric analysis of the relation between landscape pattern and automobile dependency. Specifically, we employ a two-part model to investigate two dimensions of car use, the discrete decision to own a car and, conditional upon ownership, the continuous decision of how far to drive. Results indicate that landscape pattern, as captured by measures of both land cover (e.g. the extent of open space and landscape diversity) and land use (e.g. the density of regional businesses) are important predictors of car ownership and use. Other policy-relevant variables, such as fuel prices and public transit infrastructure, are also identified as correlates. Based on the magnitude of our estimates, we conclude that carefully considered land development and zoning measures - ones that encourage dense development, diverse land cover and mixed land use - can have beneficial impacts in reducing car dependency that extend far into the future.

At the aggregate level, there are diversification benefits of the increase in noninterest income. However, noninterest income has higher volatility and cyclicality than net interest income, and the marginal benefit of diversification decreases with the increase in noninterest income. At the bank level, the correlation coefficients of the growth rates of net interest income and noninterest income are mostly negative, which also suggests that there are diversification benefits of increasing the noninterest income. However, further model analysis indicates that the effect of the noninterest income share on the Chinese banking industry's revenue and risk is not significant. Overall, our findings suggest that noninterest income diversifies bank revenue, but increased reliance on noninterest income may worsen the risk/return trade-off for the Chinese banking industry.

The analysis is based on a comprehensive US dataset on asset securitizations for the time period between 2000 and 2008. We find that the shortfall of regulatory capital during the Global Financial Crisis is strongly related to ratings. In particular, we empirically show that insufficient capital is allocated to tranches with the highest rating. These tranches account for the greatest part of the total issuance volumes. Furthermore, this paper is the first to calibrate risk weights which account for systematic risk and provide sufficient capital buffers to cover the exposure during similar economic downturns. These policy-relevant findings suggest a re-calibration of RBA risk weights and may contribute to the current efforts by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and others to re-establish sustainable securitization markets and to improve the stability of the financial system.

This study combines the principles of the natural evolution theory with the price of fuels and two types of family houses: single-family houses and apartment buildings. The main finding drawn from the econometric analysis is that an increase in the price of fuel leads to a decrease in the construction rate of single-family houses.

Why has the branchless-banking revolution not yet materialised? Constrained by regulation, deployments have failed to attract a critical mass of users. Indonesia's fragmented telecommunications sector has made it difficult for providers to emulate the success stories in other countries, in which dominant providers are competing for the market with a proprietary platform. In Indonesia, it is likely that a considerable degree of interoperability will be required for providers to unleash network effects and attract users. Indonesia's providers are experimenting in this space.

We estimate a multilevel model based on more than 10,000 surveyed firms in some 50 countries. We find that perceived quality of state courts and the frequency with which firms resort to non-state dispute resolution are positively correlated and that, hence, state courts and non-state dispute resolution are complements, rather than substitutes.

Our experiment examines the investment choices of a nationwide sample of 249 participants in a simulation of investing for retirement. Segregating investment results by asset decreases subsequent risk taking. Those presented segregated results lower their equity proportion by 4.21% and their portfolio volatility by 0.88%. Both decreases are 8% of the mean levels of risk taking, 50.59% and 10.85%, respectively. At the beginning of the simulation, we present historical results of the investment options either asset by asset or aggregated into portfolios. Among the small number of participants who spend a significant amount of time studying these historic results, segregating results lowers their equity proportion by 9.81%. Our results are a challenge to fully rational theories of investment choice but are consistent with a combination of three aspects of prospect theory based models: loss aversion, narrow framing of individual-asset results, and diminishing sensitivity to aggregated gains and losses. Our experiment never varies the presentation of investment results across time, thus our results are distinct from the effect of myopic loss aversion.","[Anagol, Santosh] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gamble, Keith Jacks] DePaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",University of Pennsylvania; DePaul University,"Gamble, KJ (通讯作者)，DePaul Univ, Kellstadt Grad Sch Business, 1 East Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",kgamble@depaul.edu,,,,,,,26,10,11,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

For centuries, large haciendas had dominated Chile's Central Valley. The agrarian reforms carried out by Frei and Allende - and to a greater extent the counter-reform of Pinochet - transformed that property structure with its generalized system of agricultural production for the domestic market. Recently, there has been a marked shift in emphasis towards specialization, exports and off-farm agricultural resources. A seasonal labour market has arisen, employing predominantly female workers, whose precarious work conditions stand in marked contrast to the success of Chilean agricultural exports. This paper reviews the main trends in Chilean agriculture and rural society, drawing on data gathered principally in Colchagua Province, which is known for its fine export wines.","[Bengoa, Jose] Acad Christian Humanism Univ, Sch Anthropol, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano,"Bengoa, J (通讯作者)，Acad Christian Humanism Univ, Sch Anthropol, Casa Cent Condell 343 Providencia, Santiago, Chile.",jbengoacabello@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,10,13,0,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Building on the dynamic capabilities literature, we test whether two organizational capabilities (external sourcing and employee involvement in renewal activities) predict sales growth, and if so, whether such effects are mediated by process and/or product innovation. Based on survey data from a panel study of Dutch SMEs, and controlling for several firm characteristics (firm size, sector, age and family business), we conclude that external sourcing has direct effects on both product and process innovation, with an indirect effect (mediated by process innovation) on sales growth. In line with our hypothesis development, we also find that employee involvement, while positively affecting process innovation, has a negative effect on sales growth. Firm size moderates the effects of two of the variables (external sourcing and product innovation) on sales growth, with more positive effects found for the smallest firms, results supporting the nimbleness (versus resource-based) view.","[Uhlaner, Lorraine M.; Duplat, Valerie] EDHEC Business Sch, F-59057 Roubaix, France; [van Stel, Andre] Panteia EIM, NL-2701 AA Zoetermeer, Netherlands; [Zhou, Haibo] Univ Groningen, Dept Innovat Management & Strategy, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands",Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School; University of Groningen,"Uhlaner, LM (通讯作者)，EDHEC Business Sch, 24 Ave Gustave Delory, F-59057 Roubaix, France.",lorraine.uhlaner@edhec.edu; a.van.stel@eim.panteia.nl; Valerie.Duplat@edhec.edu; H.Zhou@rug.nl,"Uhlaner, Lorraine M./K-4303-2012; Zhou, Haibo/AGJ-1251-2022; ZHOU, Haibo/M-7373-2017","Uhlaner, Lorraine M./0000-0001-5151-697X; Zhou, Haibo/0000-0002-2815-8577; Van Stel, Andre/0000-0003-4512-654X",,,,,92,79,94,3,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

First, we confirm recent results for US data and find evidence of a negative cross-sectional relation between extreme positive returns and average returns after controlling for characteristics such as momentum, book-to-market, size, liquidity and short term return reversal. We argue that this is the case because these stocks have lottery-like characteristics, which is attractive to certain investors. Also, these stocks tend to be very volatile so that arbitrageurs are discouraged from correcting potential mispricing. As a consequence, these stocks are often overpriced and hence face lower expected returns. Second, when we control for extreme returns, the recently found negative relationship between idiosyncratic risk and future returns is less robust. In our models, after adding maximum returns, the relationship is insignificant and sometimes even positive. We also find that idiosyncratic skewness and coskewness play an important role for asset pricing, as predicted by several theoretical models. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The first portrays government as a provider of public goods and a corrector of externalities. The second associates larger governments with bureaucratic inefficiency and special-interest-group influence. What distinguishes these alternatives is that only in the former is governmental expansion generally associated with an increase in social welfare. In the latter, the link between government size and public goods provision (or social welfare) is negative. We study the empirical significance of these competing claims by examining the relationship between government size and a particular public good, namely environmental quality (notably, air quality measured by SO2 concentrations), for 42 countries over the period 1971-1996. We find that the relationship is negative, even after accounting for the quality of government (quality of bureaucracy and the level of corruption). This result may not prove conclusively that the growth of government has been driven by factors other than concern for the public good, but it creates a presumption against the theory of government size that emphasizes public good provision.","[Bernauer, Thomas; Koubi, Vally] ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bernauer, Thomas; Koubi, Vally] ETH, IED, Zurich, Switzerland; [Koubi, Vally] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Bern, Switzerland; [Koubi, Vally] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Bern; University of Bern,"Koubi, V (通讯作者)，ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, Zurich, Switzerland.",koubi@ir.gess.ethz.ch,,"Bernauer, Thomas/0000-0002-3775-6245",,,,,49,55,64,0,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2013,156.0,3-4,,,,,593,609,,10.1007/s11127-012-9916-1,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,184NK,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321897600010,0

We show that firms that experience shocks that increase illiquidity are less liquid than firms that experience shocks that decrease illiquidity. Shocks that increase illiquidity have no statistical impact on comovement. However, shocks that reduce illiquidity lead to a fall in comovement, a pattern that becomes stronger as the illiquidity of the firm increases. This discovery is consistent with increased transparency and an improvement in price efficiency. We find that a small number of firms experience a double illiquidity shock. For these firms, at the first shock, a rise in illiquidity reduces comovement while a fall in illiquidity raises comovement. The second shock partly reverses these changes as a rise in illiquidity is associated with a rise in comovement and a fall in illiquidity is associated with a fall in comovement. These results have important implications for portfolio construction and also for the measurement and evolution of market beta and the cost of capital as it suggests that investors can achieve higher returns for the same amount of market risk because of the greater diversification benefits that exist. We also find that illiquidity, friction, firm size and the pre-shock correlation are all associated with the magnitude of the correlation change. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

They find that median 2009 net worth ($117,700) for households with no outstanding student loan debt is nearly three times higher than for households with outstanding student loan debt ($42,800). Further, multivariate statistics indicate that households with outstanding student loan debt and a median 2007 net worth of $128,828 incur a loss of about 54 percent of net worth in 2009 compared with households with similar net worth levels but no student loan debt over the same period. The main policy implication of this study is that outstanding student debt may jeopardize the short-run financial health of households.

We set-up a principal-agent framework with moral hazard with hidden information to perform our theoretical analysis. The results show the existence of an incentive of the loan officer to manipulate the soft information, which can be prevented provided an incentive compatible compensation contract.

Consumption-based pricing of emissions-which could in practice be implemented with a full border tax adjustment (BTA)-has been forwarded as an option to increase the effectiveness of unilateral climate policy. This paper questions the economic rationale behind this approach, using a theoretical trade model in which leakage occurs through terms-of-trade effects. We show analytically, first, that consumption-based pricing of emissions does not necessarily result in less leakage than production-based policies. Second, the sign of the optimal unilateral carbon tariff depends on the carbon-intensity differential between the foreign country's exporting and non-exporting sectors, and not on the differential between home's and foreign's exporting sectors, as implied by the full BTA approach. Third, based on empirical data for the year 2004, our model implies that full BTA applied by the European Union on e.g. imports from and exports to China would-by shifting China's production from the export sector with a relatively low carbon-intensity towards the more carbon-intensive non-export sector-actually increase leakage.","[Jakob, Michael; Marschinski, Robert] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Jakob, Michael] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Marschinski, Robert] Tech Univ Berlin, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Huebler, Michael] Zentrum Europa Wirtschaftsforsch, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Jakob, M (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A31, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",jakob@pik-potsdam.de; robert.marschinski@pik-potsdam.de; huebler@zew.de,,,,,,,44,54,54,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We focus on the five categories that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has recently proposed as indicators of systemic importance. Our findings suggest that unstable funding is the main factor driving systemic risk. Furthermore, the combination of significant trading activities with global presence appears to exacerbate spillover risks to the global financial system. Interestingly, whereas trading activities contribute to the build-up of correlated or 'wrong-way' risk they help to mitigate individual solvency risk. Conversely, a decentralized approach to liquidity management seems to alleviate individual solvency risk but amplifies the transmission of financial distress across the financial system. This suggests that a macro-prudential approach to financial regulation should focus not only on scaling up micro-prudential measures but also on enabling the efficient transfer of risk between financial institutions.

University laboratories therefore have two sources of funds: direct grants from sponsors and income from licensing. Tax credits for private R&D also contribute, because they increase the profitability of licensing. Because Bayh-Dole profits are a source of funds, the question arises how subsidies and Bayh-Dole profits fit together. I show that subsidies to the university can either prime the pump' for spending out of Bayh-Dole funds, or can crowd it out. Because of crowding out, if the sponsor wants to increase university spending beyond the university's own target, it will end up funding the entire research bill, just as if there were no profit opportunities under the Bayh-Dole Act. A subsidy system that requires university matching can mitigate this problem.","[Scotchmer, Suzanne] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Scotchmer, Suzanne] NBER, Berkeley, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Scotchmer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",scotch@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,25,3,4,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

One direction in economic theory suggests that intrinsically motivated workers are willing to accept lower wages and donate work, for example, in terms of unpaid overtime (the donative-labour hypothesis). In the other direction, intrinsic motivations are expected to increase worker productivity and, in turn, wages (the intrinsic motivation-productivity hypothesis). Using a new database of a sample of workers in the cooperative non-profit sector, we find that, consistently with the motivation-productivity hypothesis, more motivated workers earn significantly higher wages, which signals higher productivity. Evidence supporting the donative-labour hypothesis is weaker, even though a generally positive connection between motivations and work-donation is confirmed. We interpret these findings by arguing that the impact of the donative-labour effect is dominated by the intrinsic motivation-productivity effect.","[Becchetti, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ Law & Inst, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Castriota, Stefano] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Tortia, Ermanno C.] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, I-38122 Trento, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Perugia; University of Trento,"Becchetti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ Law & Inst, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",becchetti@economia.uniroma2.it; stefano.castriota@unipg.it; ermanno.tortia@unitn.it,,"Tortia, Ermanno/0000-0002-2138-1119; Castriota, Stefano/0000-0001-9252-778X; BECCHETTI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-7629-0716",,,,,34,35,52,5,109,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We introduce a new procedure for testing this effect: participants are divided into two groups. Possession group participants inspect a numbered lottery ticket and know it is theirs, while inspection group participants only inspect a lottery ticket without being endowed with it. Subsequently participants choose between playing the lottery with this (possessed or inspected) ticket, or exchanging it for another one. Our procedure tests for the effect of endowment while controlling for the influence of transaction costs as well as for inspection effects and the influence of bargaining roles (buyer vs. seller), which often afflict experimentation with the endowment effect. In a real setting, tickets in possession were valued significantly higher than inspected tickets. Contrary to some findings in the literature participants also correctly predicted these valuation differences in a hypothetical situation, both for themselves as well as for others. Furthermore, our results suggest that regret rather than loss aversion may be the source of the endowment effect in an experimental setting using lottery tickets. Applying our procedure to a setting employing riskless objects in form of mugs revealed rather ambiguous results, thus emphasizing that the role of regret might be less prominent in non-lottery settings.

The SCP appears to exert a destabilising effect on advanced banks, suggesting that a more concentrated banking system may be vulnerable to financial instability, however, the RMP seems to perform a stabilising effect in both economies. Evidence also highlights that profitability and stability increase with an increased interest-margin revenues in a less competitive environment for emerging markets. Overall, these results suggest that although policy measures to promote competition may dampen economic rent, excessive implementation may have an undesired destabilising impact on banks.

We investigate how capital constraints affect the choice of the healthy bank to takeover or liquidate the exposure held jointly with the failing bank, and how the bank's ex ante optimal capital holding and possibility of contagion are affected by anticipation of bail-out policy, capital requirements and the joint exposure. We identify a range of factors that strengthen or weaken the possibility of contagion and bailout. Recapitalization with common stock rather than preferred equity injection dilutes existing shareholder interests and gives the bank a greater incentive to hold capital to cope with potential contagion. Increasing the minimum regulatory capital does not necessarily reduce contagion, while the requirement of holding conservation capital buffer could increase the bank's resilience to avoid contagion.

This paper gathers these concepts in order to assess the eco-efficiency of the dairy sector in La Reunion. Our assessment compare two objectives seemingly opposed: the productivist approach and the environmentalist approach. According to the productivist approach, focused on the milk production maximization, inefficiency reduction could create an increase of 54% of the dairy production, without additional undesirable emissions. At the same time, a better environmental management leads to an important potential decrease of undesirable outputs as greenhouse gases or nitrogen surpluses (-46 %), given the current milk production. Unexpectedly, the two approaches lead to similar values of environmental indicators: Nitrogen surplus per liter of milk and greenhouse gases per liter of milk. On an insular territory as La Reunion, impacted by the food self-sufficiency issue of overseas department, efficiency sectoral analysis appears to be a powerful tool to support decision plan, as it allows an assessment of optimal allocation of local resources and an optimization of imported materials for agricultural sector.","[Berre, David] CIRAD UMR SELMET, LEM IESEG Sch Management, F-59000 Lille, France; [Blancard, Stephane] AGROSUP Dijon, UMR CESAER 1041, Dijon, France; [Boussemart, Jean-Philippe] Univ Lille 3, F-59653 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Boussemart, Jean-Philippe] LEM IESEG Sch Management, Lille, France; [Leleu, Herve] CNRS LEM UMR 81791, Dijon, France; [Leleu, Herve] IESEG Sch Management, Dijon, France",CIRAD; IESEG School of Management; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; Universite de Lille; IESEG School of Management; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IESEG School of Management,"Berre, D (通讯作者)，CIRAD UMR SELMET, LEM IESEG Sch Management, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France.",d.berre@ieseg.fr; stephane.blancard@dijon.inra.fr; jp.boussemart@ieseg.fr; h.leleu@ieseg.fr; tillard@cirad.fr,"DAVID, BERRE/AAJ-3354-2020; Leleu, Hervé/B-5729-2013; Boussemart, Jean-Philippe/X-3545-2019","Leleu, Hervé/0000-0003-4027-5175; Boussemart, Jean-Philippe/0000-0001-7932-6940; Berre, David/0000-0001-8494-9966; BLANCARD, Stephane/0000-0001-5996-2368",,,,,26,2,2,1,42,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

These claims are not backed by much hard evidence. This paper seeks to fill some of that gap by investigating why an educational reform containing explicit accountability elements is poorly implemented across Norwegian municipalities about four years after the reform has passed the parliament. The empirical analyses provide evidence that municipalities with a large share of public employees are less likely to implement the reform. The relationship seems to be causal. A reduced-form approach is applied, which prevents conclusions about the mechanisms through which the public employees exercise their influence. However, some preliminary analyses indicate that school leaders hold more negative attitudes towards the reform in municipalities with a large share of public employees, potentially indicating that regulatory capture is an issue: school leaders tend to sympathize more strongly with teachers in such environments.","NTNU, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Bonesronning, H (通讯作者)，NTNU, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",hansbo@svt.ntnu.no,,,,,,,19,7,10,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2013,156.0,1-2,,,,,309,327,,10.1007/s11127-011-9900-1,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,164WW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320443600018,0

Because the Black-Scholes analytical valuation formula for compound options is not able to incorporate the sensitivity to volatility, the aim of this paper is to develop a numerical pricing procedure for this type of option in stochastic volatility models, specifically focusing on the model of Heston. For this, the compound option value is represented as the difference of its exercise probabilities, which depend on three random variables through a complex functional form. Then the joint distribution of these random variables is uniquely determined by their characteristic function and therefore the probabilities can each be expressed as a multiple inverse Fourier transform. Solving the inverse Fourier transform with respect to volatility, we can reduce the pricing problem from three to two dimensions. This reduced dimensionality simplifies the application of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method developed by Dempster and Hong when transferred to our stochastic volatility framework. After combining their approach with a new extension of the fractional FFT technique for option pricing to the two-dimensional case, it is possible to obtain good approximations to the exercise probabilities. The resulting upper and lower bounds are then compared with other numerical methods such as Monte Carlo simulations and show promising results.","Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Griebsch, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",susanne.griebsch@uts.edu.au,,,,,,,22,8,10,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

In the 1970s, the development of Left politics generated the modes of production debate and many of the communist parties used their interpretations of agrarian change then to guide their Indian path to socialism. More than 40 years on, ongoing changes in economic and social relations in the agrarian sector and in society at large make it important to revisit those earlier debates and conclusions. On the basis of the papers of this special issue, the introduction outlines the development of capitalism in the Indian countryside, its relation to the development of capitalism in India and to neoliberal globalization. It raises the question of how rural class relations have developed in different parts of the country and discusses the extent to which Indian Left politics has analysed and strategized such development.","[Lerche, Jens] Univ London, Dept Dev Studies, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London WC1 0XG, England; [Shah, Alpa] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, London WC1 2AE, England; [Harriss-White, Barbara] Univ Oxford Wolfson Coll, Oxford OX2 6UD, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford,"Lerche, J (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Dev Studies, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Thornhaugh St, London WC1 0XG, England.",jl2@soas.ac.uk; a.m.shah@lse.ac.uk; barbara.harriss-white@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,48,33,37,1,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The travel decisions could relate to a range of choices including transport mode choice and time of departure. This paper seeks to provide an answer to the following question: Do travellers, both prior and during travelling, refer to their social network when taking travel decisions in uncertain conditions? An internet-based survey was conducted with over 2000 respondents in the two United Kingdom cities of London and Glasgow. Respondents were asked to name those within their social network and to provide information on their contacts including age, gender, relationship length, car availability, and the type and frequency of social interaction. Insights are also provided from the analysis of relationships between an individual's socio-demographic characteristics, their ego-centric social network, their social interactions and the location in which they live, through the use of clusters analysis, and how this links to two key travel behaviour aspects: who respondents would turn to in particular for advice an travel decisions, and who (and why) they would contact, if they were experiencing an uncertain situation while travelling. It is shown that the first named member of the social network member is a key person for individuals facing travel uncertainty, and that individuals will turn to others, often within their social network, for emotional as well as decisionmaking support. In addition, older people, those with a lower number of contacts, and those living in smaller households are more likely to decide by themselves in uncertain travel situations. (C) 2013 The Authors.

This is done by making a threefold analysis, which combines the overall improvement in the level of accessibility, territorial cohesion, and spatial spillovers. Moreover, we use different spatial dimensions (namely national and international) and different distance decay parameters to estimate both the short trips (e.g. commuting) and the long trips (e.g. business trips or tourism). The results are presented at a very detailed spatial scale (i.e. municipalities - LAU-2 units). The paper provides empirical evidence of improvement in accessibility, changes in the degree of territorial cohesion, and spatial spillovers resulting from the recent completion of two sections of motorway in Poland. The selected case studies differ according to their location (i.e. national and European, peripheral vs. central location), population density, and the settlement structure around the investment. The validity of the proposed multidimensional approach to the evaluation of road investments is verified as the combination of different accessibility dimensions and leads to results which differ respecting efficiency, equity and spillover effects. This paper provides arguments to strengthen the need for the tailor-made parameters of potential accessibility indicator and spatial dimension of analysis. They should be adjusted to the main aim of the particular evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we propose a simple model to describe the evolution of the real exchange rate. We then propose a more general smooth transition (STR) function than has hitherto been employed, which is able to capture structural changes along the (long-run) equilibrium path, and show that this is consistent with our economic model. Our framework allows for a gradual adjustment between regimes and allows for under- and/or over-valued exchange rate adjustments. Using monthly and quarterly data for up to twenty OECD countries, we apply our methodology to investigate the univariate time series properties of CPI-based real exchange rates with both the U.S. Dollar and German Mark as the numeraire currencies. The empirical results show that, for more than half of the quarterly series, the evidence in favor of the stationarity of the real exchange rate was clearer in the sub-sample period post-1980.

As market power is the primary source of franchise value, reduced competition in banking markets has been seen as promoting banking stability. A recent paper by Martinez-Miera and Repullo (MMR, 2010) shows that a nonlinear relationship theoretically exists between bank competition and risk-taking in the loan market. We test this hypothesis using data from the Spanish banking system. After controlling for macroeconomic conditions and bank characteristics, we find support for this nonlinear relationship using standard measures of market concentration in both the loan and deposit markets. When direct measures of market power, such as Lerner indices, are used, the empirical results are more supportive of the original franchise value hypothesis, but only in the loan market. Overall, the results highlight the empirical relevance of the MMR model, even though further analysis across other banking markets is needed.

We then construct and analyze firm-level FKS and WKS measures and find that, despite severe external financing constraints, those firms with low FKS and high WKS exhibit the highest fixed investment rates.

The aim of this paper is to provide evidence of hiring discrimination, using a real effort experiment. In this experiment, the employer (principal) has to hire an employee (agent) in order to provide effort during a production task. The main result of this study is that in the absence of relevant information on productivity, the principal uses signals such as gender or level of study to make his hiring decisions. These results support the existence of discrimination against females. Moreover, this discrimination does not rely on in-group favoritism and is more likely to be explained by statistical discrimination.

In particular, we aim to estimate the connectivity loss for the population caused by the closure of airports with traffic of less than 1 and 2 million passengers per year, which represent two thirds and three quarters, respectively, of all operating European airports. Taken together these account for 8% of European passenger traffic. We apply a methodology that involves computing the quickest travel time necessary to connect each origin municipality to any destination in Europe and to major intercontinental destinations. The travel time includes three components: (i) travel time by road and high-speed train to access the departure airport, (ii) travel time by flight from the departure airport to the destination airport, including waiting times in intermediate airports when no direct flight is available, and (iii) travel time by road and high-speed train from the destination airport to the final destination municipality. For each of the over 75,000 municipalities in Europe, we calculate the average travel time needed to reach any other municipality in two cases: (i) including all airports operating in Europe, and (ii) considering only airports offering more than 1 and 2 million seats per year. The results show that, with the exception of the Scandinavian countries, the average loss of connectivity is small on a country level. However, the connectivity loss is unevenly distributed: several regions in France, Spain, and Italy experience very significant increases in average travel times, in some cases of up to 40%.

However, heterogeneous linear response functions combined with the pooled analysis commonly used in these studies can yield false convexity estimates. We show that such heterogeneity obtains in practice. Along these same lines, the paper also finds that several previously unexamined implications of a convex flow-performance relation fail to hold. Moreover, convexity with fractional flows (which we confirm) largely disappears in a conditional analysis that controls for heterogeneity. Market shares offer an alternative specification for flow that is more resilient to heterogeneity. Using this alternative specification, we again find no evidence of convexity in the flow-performance relation. We conclude that the widely held belief that the flow response function is convex is due solely to misspecification of the empirical model. The flow-return relation is linear. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Flexible manufacturing has been replaced with mass production and the old concept of government has been replaced with the concept of governance. In this process, devolution of authority of the nation states and attendance of different agents to the decision making process has required new institutional structure which functions as a mediator in the implementation of these policies.

Research to date, however, has neglected to study the effects of financial and relational strategies on relationship preservation simultaneously. In the present contribution, we examine this question. Based on the equality norm, we hypothesized that a financial compensation that fails to redress the harm suffered by the recipient (i.e., undercompensation) will be less effective in preserving a relationship than a financial compensation that do redress it (i.e., equal compensation and overcompensation). Moreover, we expected that relational strategies (i.e., apologies) would promote relationship preservation in contexts where the financial compensation alone is insufficient to redress the harm to the recipient, thus in cases of undercompensation. The results of a pilot study and a lab experiment using the dictator game confirmed our hypotheses.

Existing studies on the race to the bottom in social services attempt to discern the extent to which FDI affects social expenditure. However, it remains an open question whether FDI is actually attracted to lower spending levels. We find no indication that FDI is repelled by social spending; indeed there is strong evidence that investment is associated with greater programmatic emphases on health and education. These findings have important implications for leaders seeking to attract investment and for those attempting to expand social programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Hecock, R.

This paper addresses the response of property prices to an inflow of foreign capital. For that purpose we estimate a panel VAR on a set of Asian emerging market economies, for which the waves of inflows were particularly pronounced, and identify capital inflow shocks based on sign restrictions. Our results suggest that capital inflow shocks have a significant effect on the appreciation of house prices and equity prices. Capital inflow shocks account for - roughly - twice the portion of overall house price changes they explain in OECD countries. We also address cross-country differences in the house price responses to shocks, which are most likely due to differences in the monetary policy response to capital inflows. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the role of self-esteem in determining wages directly and indirectly via education. We use data from the 1979 wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY79) to estimate a three equation simultaneous equation model that treats self-esteem, educational attainment, and real wages as endogenous. We find that, while self-esteem has a positive and significant impact on wages indirectly via education, it does not significantly affect wages directly once we control for locus of control. We find that the indirect effect of self-esteem comprises upwards of 80% of the total effect of self-esteem on wages after 1980. Additionally, we find that wages and education both affect self-esteem. We discuss gender differences in the relationships between wages, education, and self-esteem and conclude that females experience a higher rate of return on education than males, and self-esteem is a stronger determinant of educational attainment for males than females.

Public pension funds' in-state investments achieve performance that is lower by two to four percentage points than both their own similar out-of-state investments and similar investments in their state by out-of-state investors. Overweighting in home-state investments by public pension funds is greater in venture capital and real estate than in buyout funds. States with political climates characterized by more self-dealing invest a larger share of their portfolio in local investments, although a given local investment performs only as poorly in these states as in other states.

A Multinomial Logit (MNL) model was used to estimate the determinants of variety choice. The results show that M9 was the most preferred hybrid variety, followed by M2 and M14. However, many of the respondents (39.4%) chose Mbwazirume, a local variety, as their most preferred variety. Good taste, large bunch size, soft food and good flavour were the most desirable attributes, while longer maturity period was a notable undesirable attribute. Results from the MNL analysis suggest that small land size, taste and regional location were negatively associated with variety choice, while perceptions that hybrid bananas could reduce food insecurity and tolerance to pests and diseases were positively associated with probabilities of variety choice. Probabilities of choosing hybrids for food security increase in favour of M2 (by 6.13%) and M9 (27.60%), and decrease by 23.05% for M2, 6.89% for M14 and 9.36% for M9 due to taste relative to Mbwazirume. Farmers' involvement in varietal improvement and development programmes is vital for meeting their preferences. Future breeding efforts should consider attributes such as bunch size, good taste, soft food and agronomic characteristics. Farmers with large land sizes should be targeted for on-farm promotional activities to increase the potential adoption and impact of the hybrids. After the hybrids are popularized and used by farmers, there will be a need for an impact study to evaluate their acceptability in terms of household food security and income.","[Akankwasa, K.; Ortmann, G.

These three role players must ensure that the information security controls are implemented, properly checked and independently evaluated against the organisation's strategic objectives and the regulatory requirements.

Concerns have been raised about the impact of these security measures on the movement of people across the border. This paper examines the impact of security on the number of travelers crossing the border by employing a multivariate regression analysis utilizing monthly data from January 1991 to December 2007. In addition, the impact of the WHTI is specifically examined by employing a similar multivariate regression analysis with monthly data from October 2001 to December 2011. Controlling for the effects of a number of factors, such as exchange rates and gas prices, results showed that security measures, including the WHTI, have negatively impacted the number of Canadian visitors to the US and American visitors to Canada traveling by automobile. The findings of this study will be of interest to researchers, policy makers, and a variety of stakeholders in the tourism industry in both countries.

Supply chains are currently going through a series of transformations (outsourcing production, relocating activities in emerging countries etc.) which drive more efficient operations and cost savings, but also bring a percentage of risk in their day-to-day activities. These risks are the triggers of unexpected events that negatively affect global supply chains' performances. They can be either of endogenous nature (from inside the supply chain), or exogenous risks (from outside the supply chains). When exogenous risks occur they affect multiple operations, organizations and regions and can be even more dangerous when the supply chain structures are not prepared to cope with them and their negative effects. And when we talk about supply chain organizations spread all over the world every disruption (external) risk propagates and amplifies while advancing though the risk sensitive supply chain structures. In this research paper I discuss some of the actual/real external risks that supply chains are struggling with and propose some approaches for mitigation and building resilient structures.","[Brinza, Georgiana; Cherbeleata, Iuliana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,Georgiana.brinza@gmail.com; iulia.cherbeleata@yahoo.com,"Cherbadgy, Ivan I/G-3004-2016",,,,,,10,0,0,2,10,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,508,512,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100053,0

Our empirical results show that high stock prices affect corporate policies because they relax financing constraints. During the tech bubble, constrained non-tech firms' investment responded strongly to high stock prices (specifically, the component of price that is not captured by fundamentals). They also issued stock in response to that overvaluation effect, saving part of the proceeds in their cash accounts. We find no such patterns for unconstrained non-tech firms, nor for tech firms. Our findings are not consistent with the notion that managers systematically issue overvalued stocks and invest in ways that transfer wealth from new to old shareholders. More broadly, they suggest that what appears to be overvaluation in one sector of the economy may have positive externalities for other sectors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Ex ante modeling-which took account of the reductions in emissions resulting from meeting the renewables target and the inflow of project-based credits-indicated that this would result in an approximate allowance price of (sic)30 per tonne of CO2, which was judged to provide the necessary financial incentive to abate emissions, to support carbon capture and storage and innovation in alternative energy supplies, and to discourage member states from doing their own thing in terms of price support and other measures. The only linkage was the acceptance for compliance purposes of Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation credits. But in 2013, all has changed; the allowance price is approximately 75% less than what was anticipated, a friends-of-coal lobby has emerged in the EU, and opportunities to link with other ETS are now becoming a reality.

Recent survey studies about hydrographic education in the Netherlands and in Belgium have pointed out a shortage in hydrographic training in these countries. Currently, the most active hydrographers in Belgium are engineers who received additional training within private companies. For the construction and implementation of the programme, a round table discussion was set up to assess the audience, procedures and desired outcomes for the industry. Relevant higher education institutes, governmental organizations and the maritime industry participated in this discussion. For reasons of flexibility and administration, a postgraduate programme was established, based on IHO (International Hydrographic Organization) standards for certification and quality. Apart from the compulsory courses, the emphasis lies on on-the-job practice with the partners of the industry to ensure maximum competence. An optimized flexibility is achieved by allowing any bachelor with a scientific background. All courses are lectured in English, and courses can be taken up over several years to facilitate part-time work. Furthermore, a selection committee has been installed to assess exemptions, in order to enable active hydrographers to study only the modules that are relevant for them. These procedures allow for a qualitative and professional yet accessible programme.","[De Wulf, Alain; De Maeyer, Philippe; De Ryck, Marijke; Nuttens, Timothy; Stal, Cornelis] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Libert, Micha; Annaert, Axel] IVH Antwerp Maritime Acad, HZS, Inst Hydrog, Antwerp, Belgium",Ghent University,,,"De Maeyer, Philippe/N-7152-2019; Stal, Cornelis/ABE-9028-2020","De Maeyer, Philippe/0000-0001-8902-3855; Stal, Cornelis/0000-0002-4704-8330",,,,,4,1,1,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,429,436,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400057,0

It has been called The Pearl of Polish spas for decades. The health resort is situated at about 650 m above sea level. It has a rich spa tradition reaching the 18th century, which attracts many bathers from Poland and abroad. The main natural resource of Krynica-Zdroj is mineral water used for drinking and bathing treatment. Both mineral water and alpine mountain microclimate make Krynica-Zdroj a mainstream spa treatment centre. The resort has excellent natural conditions mostly owing to carbonated alkaline mineral water that helps treat gastric, cardiac and urological disorders. The existence of this health resort is ensured not only by excellent natural conditions but also by properly adapted infrastructure including mineral, mud and balneotherapeutic baths, inhalatorium and a spa park. There are also rest homes, sanatoriums and spa hospitals in Krynica-Zdroj. Hotels, guest houses, recreational and catering facilities have been modernized since the mid-20th century. Along with health resort facilities, food industry associated with the production of mineral water is being developed. Moreover, geological resources allow to exploit carbon dioxide used in industrial processes. A rapidly growing service sector of cosmetics and beauty and health regeneration has been developing for several years. The health resort provides a rapidly developing range of spa services. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of environmental factors on the development of spa industry in Krynica-Zdroj from the mid-nineteenth century to the first decade of this century. It aims to present the practical use of non-anthropogenic components to organize tourism, winter sports and recreation. It seems reasonable to investigate the impact of natural resources on the level of social well-being of the resort residents.","[Dorocki, Slawomir; Brzegowy, Pawel] Pedag Univ Cracow, Krakow, Poland",Pedagogical University of Cracow,,,"Dorocki, Sławomir/B-4706-2011","Dorocki, Sławomir/0000-0001-6083-0346",,,,,15,2,2,0,8,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,309,316,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400041,0

The Role of Homeownership,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The authors use the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances to document a boom in home ownership and mortgage borrowing among young families in the years leading up to the recent financial crisis. Many young families lost more of their wealth during the downturn than middle-aged and older families. The authors find that about three-quarters of the decline in the average young family's wealth between 2007 and 2010 was due to its exposure to residential real estate. For middle-aged and older families, housing losses contributed about 53 percent and 40 percent of the total decline in wealth, respectively. Regression evidence suggests that young families' wealth, on average, was unusually highly concentrated in housing and these families' debt burdens were extremely high at the peak of the boom.

The pressure exerted on the landscape with increasing intensity leads to a structure overloading and thus to the emergence of risk phenomena, determining a new area of study in tourism geography, slightly approached until now (P.Cocean, 1999, I.Ianos, 2000, M.Mazilu, 2012). Tourism is a phenomenon that from a geographical perspective expresses tensions and contradictions between established places such as central cities, and marginal places such as mountains, seaside resorts or the countryside. It is one the one hand spatially congruent with the nation state's emergence and its attempt to control territories and to domesticate a wild nature interpreted as risky. On the other hand, tourism is contradictory to established spatial patterns by the emergence of geographical locations whose qualities and signification are radically different to previously known spatial forms and whose geographical position make them peripheral. The transfer of urbaneness is ever-present, and peripheral is coded as a relevant desire or a positive value. The tourism activity, as a complex process, has components in its structure that often appear contradictory. In relation to mankind and its interests it can take a negative turn, in opposition with the prognosis that will lead to functional disturbances of the system. The touristic risk phenomena and processes are included in this category, having a major impact both on the natural and on the economic areas.

Yet a rich empirical literature in the region shows that producing agricultural goods is really only one of many, many ways in which land is used, and not necessarily the most important. This paper argues that many of the ways in which land is used (often labelled social or cultural) are in fact best understood as part of processes of distribution that are a vital part of many poor Southern Africans' livelihoods. An exclusive focus on production as the problem, and more productive agriculture as the solution, blinds us both to most of the things that people, in fact, do with land, and to many of the most important issues facing low-income rural people. Giving a more central place to processes of distribution may help us to see just how much is lost if we allow distribution to be treated as an afterthought to production or the land question to be reduced to the agrarian question.","[Ferguson, James] Stanford Univ, Dept Anthropol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ferguson, James] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Sociol & Social Anthropol, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Ferguson, James] Univ Cape Town, Dept Social Anthropol, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",Stanford University; Stellenbosch University; University of Cape Town,"Ferguson, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Anthropol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jgfergus@stanford.edu,,,,,,,20,47,64,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We find that these laws delay but do not prevent foreclosures. We first compare states that require lenders to seek judicial permission to foreclose with states that do not. Borrowers in judicial states are no more likely to cure and no more likely to renegotiate their loans, but the delays lead to a build-up in these states of persistently delinquent borrowers, the vast majority of whom eventually lose their homes. We next analyze a right-to-cure law instituted in Massachusetts on may 1, 2008. Using a difference-in-differences approach to evaluate the effect of the policy, we compare Massachusetts with neighboring states that did not adopt similar laws. We find that the right-to-cure law lengthens the foreclosure timeline but does not lead to better outcomes for borrowers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Empirical studies show that corporate bond yield spreads are still larger than can be explained by these known determinants of credit spreads.

The paper analyzes 770 households randomly selected from a household travel survey in the New York City region, and measures their complete parking supply, including garage size, driveway spaces, and on-street parking availability, using Google Streetviews and Bing Maps. Results from a nested logit model show that parking supply can significantly determine household car ownership decisions, even after controlling for the endogeneity between the two. Their influence actually outperforms household income and demographic characteristics, the often-assumed dominant determinants of car ownership. Different parking types also behave differently: driveway spaces are more important to car ownership than garages probably because many residents in the study region do not use a garage for car storage. On-street parking is also important to households with off-street parking. Implications for residential parking policies like the maximum off-street parking standard, resident parking permit, and street cleaning are also discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, international trade in agricultural and food products seemed more resilient. This poses the question as to what extent recent and previous economic recessions have had an effect on the trade flows of these specific products. An understanding of this connection will assist the agricultural sector to pro-actively strategize for future economic downturns in their respective export markets. Hence this study uses South Africa's exports of fresh fruits and wine as a case study and applies an import demand model to analyse the relationship between export flows, several demand factors and economic shocks in its traditional export markets over the last 28 years. The results reveal that change in real per capita income is a much more significant determinant of import demand for South Africa's fruit and wine than the incidence of an economic recession. Contrary to general perceptions, economic downturns even positively affected the import demand for wine and apples.","[Idsardi, E. F.; Cloete, P.

However, I argue, this development is not adequately reflected by a corresponding growth of Austrian influence within the economic orthodoxy. Quite to the contrary, many orthodox scholars have taken over rigidly Keynesian positions since the financial crisis culminated in 2008 and 2009. In my article I maintain that Austrians themselves have contributed significantly to such a situation by not preventing three major tactical mistakes, related to the domain of sociology of economics, from occurring. Firstly, they have not formed a really unified and thus influential group of scholars; instead, they have been divided into a few streams, sometimes with highly contradictory stances. Secondly, many Austrians have made bold predictions, especially with regard to possible enormous inflation stemming from the unprecedented provision of liquidity to the financial system during and in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, which have not been fulfilled at all. Thirdly, a critical number of Austrian school's economists do not effectively communicate with the rest of the profession and even, it seems, fail to adequately comprehend the orthodox analytical tools and theories.","Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kovanda, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",lukas.kovanda@seznam.cz,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We create a series of maps that can be overlaid with traditional poverty maps to identify strong candidate areas for intervention, though an efficiency/equity tradeoff sometimes exists.

Each type of learning has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages may include: 1) students can work at their own speed; 2) you can be sure the materials are written by expert and experienced professionals. Some of the disadvantages include: 1) there may be little interaction with other students; 2) the opportunities to speak English in real situations is limited; 3) sometimes the courses can be expensive. The language teachers have selected many sites that are very useful for learning English. In addition, they have made up a list of some useful English learning websites that can help for self-study (for both American and British English). When the institute purchased a Sanako language lab for English classes the English teachers were able to change considerably the way they teach and managed to implement a far more effective styles of teaching. The use of it is based on the need for individualized teaching. So as the students had an interesting lab program, they were able to work on their own without the assistance of the teacher but according to the approved plan, thus creating a tutorial system. Analysis of the list of factors relating to class use of ICT reveals a very positive attitude amongst the majority of the teachers to using ICT in their teaching.

But business activities, like all human operations, are also subject to ethical judgment. Ethical judgment reflects organization's compliance and social acquiescence to business targets and possible means to achieve them. Professor Gasparski, leader of Polish Business Ethics' Center, suggests addition ethics to effectiveness and economics, as a third rating criteria for business operations. He stresses that prosperity of a company cannot exist without: - effectiveness which means successful result of activities taken, - economic understood as reasonable usage of controlled resources, and - ethics resulting in responsible, conscientious and sustainable business operations. The above theory pinpoints that modem enterprises control a huge amount of resources: tangible and intangible assets, human and intellectual rights, as well as ecological reserves. It all gives enterprises colossal power but it is an obligation to them as well. Contemporary enterprises should consider not only effectiveness and economic aspects in each and every business decision taken, but also should contemplate ethical aspects of day-to-day activities. Decisions regarding environment protection or preserving natural resources for future generations shall therefore be in question not only from economic point of view, but also as ethical obligation of a business. Incorporating environmental issues into business prosperity factors, sets up new challenges in financial reporting that is meant to disclose results of a business usage of all controlled resources, including ecological resources. Useful information should be provided to a community, in which business operates, as it takes the risk of a business operation as well. Moreover, corporate responsibility is limited to the value of equity, while members of the community may suffer severe and long lasting results of imprudent business operations. Environment destruction is one of results that are more burdensome to a community than to an enterprise. That is why special information should be disclosed in all financial reporting, but it requires conscious and responsible incorporating environmental issues into effectiveness, economic and ethical aspects of business doing.","[Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda] Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Finance & Insurance, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,,,"Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda/A-3596-2014","Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda/0000-0003-0461-4133",,,,,9,1,1,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,187,192,,,,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400025,0

Respondents represented the broad spectrum of the food industry and data were collected in three rounds. The participants were selected purposively according to their experience in the food industry and marketing of agricultural and food products. In round one, experts designed promising pricing strategies. The pricing strategies were divided into four broad categories and these were: A. Taxes; B. Government interference and insurance; C. Packaging; and D. Price and discounting strategies. The strategies were subsequently evaluated on eight criteria using a time-budget model incorporating Sleep, Leisure, Occupation, Transportation and Home-based activities (SLOTH). Results were analysed using median and inter-quartile deviations scores. The results revealed reasonable consensus among experts and a varied list of promising pricing strategies. The panel agreed on the potential success of offering small gifts, providing price cuts on healthy foods and discounting healthier foods more frequently. Also, it was found that experts gave higher rates to pricing strategies for which the implementation responsibilities could be placed elsewhere.","[Mkhabela, Thulasizwe] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, Fac AgriSci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Mkhabela, T (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, Fac AgriSci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",mkhabelat@ada-kzn.co.za,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,7,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2013,52.0,,,1,SI,,101,117,,10.1080/03031853.2013.770955,0.0,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,103TE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315941000006,0

A bank makes a loan, learns if it needs monitoring, and then decides whether to lay off credit risk. The bank can transfer credit risk by either selling the loan or buying a credit default swap (CDS). With a CDS, the originating bank retains the loan's control rights; with loan sales, control rights pass to the loan buyer. Credit risk transfer leads to excessive monitoring of riskier credits and insufficient monitoring of safer credits. Increases in banks' cost of equity capital exacerbate these effects. For riskier credits, loan sales typically dominate CDS but not for safer credits. Once repeated lending and consequent reputation concerns are modeled, although CDSs remain dominated by loan sales for riskier credits, for safer credits they can dominate loan sales, supporting better monitoring (albeit to a limited extent) while allowing efficient risk sharing. Restrictions on the bank's ability to sell the loan expand the range in which CDSs are used and monitoring is too low. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Poverty is estimated not through national but regional poverty thresholds. We present the methodological tools necessary for the understanding of the dynamics of poverty with the generic formula of poverty indices proposed by Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (1984) in order to estimate and analyze poverty in Senegal from 2002 to 2006. Starting over, and assuming the existence of disparities notorious variation of poverty, we explore the sectoral decomposition of poverty changes depending on the geographic location using the decomposition method proposed by Ravallion, Huppi (1991). It is used for the assessment of the contribution of potential explanatory factors of differences in poverty. The obtained results reveal at first that the disparities in poverty show the non-irrelevance of the use of a single threshold in Senegal. Then, they suggest lowering the monetary poverty in the national domain, but with strong disparities between regions and stabilization of the poverty inequality during a studied period. And finally, the effect of the changes of the localization of the population contributes to increase the poverty in certain regions and in the global poverty. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The usual approach in constructing such networks is based on the calculation of stock return correlations, their transformation to distances and creation of a graph with edge weights set to the calculated distances. To reduce the complexity of the structure, a reduction in the number of edges is conducted, mostly by utilizing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph. This paper considers alternative approaches to the subgraph selection problem and compares the topological properties of the ensuing graph structures. Specifically, the paper considers three approaches: the widely used minimum spanning tree (MST), planar maximally filtered graph proposed by Tumminello, Lillo & Mantegna (2005), and the winner-take-all approach suggested by Tse, Liu & Lau (2010). After constructing graphs using the three approaches, the paper then focuses on centrality and graph centralization. It is shown that although the MST does not have clear economic justification, not much information is lost by its use when studying graph centrality.","[Vyrost, Tomas] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Kosice, Kosice 04130, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,,tomas.vyrost@euke.sk,"Vyrost, Tomas/AAO-3780-2020","Vyrost, Tomas/0000-0002-8384-5724",,,,,13,1,1,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1512,1521,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100152,0

In sub-regional intra-industry trade regression models, we introduce extensive and intensive margins of prefecture exports as new explanatory variables. We find that a rise in sub-regional intra-industry trade is driven by the introduction of a new variety of exports, while intra-industry trade is discouraged by an increase in the trade value of products that are already exported.

The extent of such insurance is determined by a political process, i.e. ultimately by the workers themselves. If unemployment were purely accidental then all risk averse workers should vote for a party which promises complete coverage of the unemployment risk. In an experimental investigation on the basis of the Solidarity Game (Selten & Ockenfels, 1998) we compare voluntary ex post-solidarity transfers toward unfortunate low income subjects with mandatory solidarity transfers for which the rules are determined ex ante in a voting procedure. Less than a quarter of our subjects vote for complete coverage of their and others' risks and less than 12% vote for zero transfers. This result can neither be explained by Expected Utility Theory nor by income based social preferences nor by standard parameterizations of Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979: Tversky & Kahneman, 1992).

We propose a new dynamic asymmetric copula model to capture long-run and short-run dependence, multivariate nonnormality, and asymmetries in large cross-sections. We find that correlations have increased markedly in both developed markets (DMs) and emerging markets (EMs), but they are much lower in EMs than in DMs. Tail dependence has also increased, but its level is still relatively low in EMs. We propose new measures of dynamic diversification benefits that take into account higher-order moments and nonlinear dependence. The benefits from international diversification have reduced over time, drastically so for DMs. EMs still offer significant diversification benefits, especially during large market downturns.","[Jacobs, Kris] Univ Houston, CT Bauer Coll Business, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Jacobs, Kris] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Errunza, Vihang; Langlois, Hugues] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Christoffersen, Peter] Univ Toronto, Copenhagen Business Sch, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Houston System; University of Houston; Tilburg University; McGill University; University of Toronto,"Jacobs, K (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, CT Bauer Coll Business, 4800 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",kjacobs@bauer.uh.edu,"Errunza, Vihang R./L-5532-2017",,,,,,55,255,280,3,69,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Overall, we confirm CRS's result that price adjustments to new information occur on average within 5-15 min for large NYSE stocks. We further show that it takes about 20 min longer for smaller firms to incorporate information into prices. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the speed of convergence to market efficiency is significantly related to the type of trading platform where orders are executed, even after controlling for relative order flows, trading costs, volatility, informational effects, trading conditions, market quality, institutional trading activity, and other firm-specific characteristics.

A number of studies have been conducted on Malaysian palm oil mills; however, none has obtained the marginal abatement cost (MAC) through an estimated total cost function. More particularly, as far as inflation is concerned, the effluent-related fee and effluent charge specified have not been revised within the past two decades. In addition, to our knowledge, there has not been any study comparing MAC to the mills of the two different methods of disposal, namely watercourse and on land. Our results show that, to force POMs to meet the standard, the effluent charge must be set higher, equaling the MAC. While the results show the existence of economies of scale in abatement activity, setting the effluent-related fee equal to the MAC may encourage mills to further abate their water pollution.","[Hojat, Amir Hossein Montazer] SCU, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Ahvaz, Iran; [Rahim, Khalid Abdul] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Agr & Food Policy Studies, Serdang, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Hojat, AHM (通讯作者)，SCU, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Ahvaz, Iran.",a.mhojat@gmail.com; khalid@econ.upm.edu.my,"khalid, kartini aboo talib/C-8221-2017","khalid, kartini aboo talib/0000-0002-1702-0601",,,,,19,2,2,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Using a hand-collected data set, we find evidence that the chairman, as a motivated insider, plays an important role in determining fund performance. The results also show, although with weaker evidence, that outsiders may positively impact fund performance. During the 2007-2008 crisis, however, the insider professional knowledge outweighed the benefits of having motivated outsiders on the supervisory board. Consequently, the results show that both the composition of the supervisory board and the motivation and knowledge of its members are important in explaining pension fund performance. We also find that other governance factors have no impact on fund performance. The results are a relevant contribution to the current regulatory debate on reforms of the pension fund industry in Poland, arguing that modifying the supervisory board structure and electing outsiders with professional knowledge may significantly improve its performance.

This is also the case for a new constitutional rule in Germany, referred to as a debt brake (Schuldenbremse), which requires the federal and state governments to run (almost, cyclically adjusted) balanced budgets from 2016 and 2020 onward, respectively. In this context I analyze within a simple political-economy model, where politicians are less patient than citizens, the costs and benefits of a credibly announced but lagged deficit or debt ceiling. I show that a balanced-budget rule is at best as effective as not having such a rule in terms of implementing the first best. In an important benchmark case, the first best cannot be reached at all. By contrast, a constitutional limit on the future debt level is more effective, even though the first best cannot be always reached when politicians are too impatient.","Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Janeba, E (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L 7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",janeba@uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,18,6,6,1,18,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,DEC,2012,68.0,4,,,,,383,405,,10.1628/001522112X659547,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,080PG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314254700005,0

These include collective bargaining, minimum wages, employment protection laws, unemployment insurance (UI), mandated parental leave, and active labor market policies (ALMPs). Since it is unlikely that an unregulated private sector would provide the income insurance these institutions do, these policies may enhance economic efficiency. However, to the extent that unemployment or resource misallocation results from such measures, these efficiency gains may be offset. Overall, Scandinavia and Central Europe follow distinctively more interventionist policies than the English-speaking countries in the Northern Hemisphere. Possible explanations for such differences include vulnerability to external market forces and ethnic homogeneity. I then review evidence on the impacts of these policies and institutions. While the interventionist model appears to cause lower levels of wage inequality and high levels of job security to incumbent workers, it also in some cases leads to the relegation of new entrants (disproportionately women, youth, and immigrants) as well as the less skilled to temporary jobs or unemployment. Making labor markets more flexible could bring these groups into the regular labor market to a greater extent, at the expense of higher levels of economic insecurity for incumbents and higher levels of wage inequality.

This leads to the question of how to promote a sustainable transport sector that meets both environmental protection targets and economic requirements. In this context, the objective of this paper is to compare the CO2-sensitve productivity development of the European commercial transport industry for the period between 1995 and 2006. We calculate a Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index to investigate the effects of country-specific regulations on productivity and to identify innovative countries. Our results show a high variation in the CO2-sensitive productivity development and a slight productivity decrease on average. Efficiency losses indicate that the majority of the countries were not able to follow the technological improvements induced by some innovative countries.","[Krautzberger, Lisann; Wetzel, Heike] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, Dept Econ, D-50827 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Krautzberger, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, Dept Econ, Vogelsanger Str 321, D-50827 Cologne, Germany.",l.krautzberger@uni-koeln.de; heike.wetzel@uni-koeln.de,,"Wetzel, Heike/0000-0002-3945-6318",,,,,36,39,40,1,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

During a transition from NDB to NDC a financing gap typically arises due to accrued to date liabilities from the old system in excess of the NDC scheme's sustainable flow of benefits.

Using structural event analysis we demonstrate that team members' start-up experience is important in this context. Second, we attempt to reconcile conflicting evidence concerning the influence of team homogeneity on performance by considering the element of time. We hypothesize that higher team homogeneity is positively related to short term outcomes, but is less effective in the longer term. Our results confirm a difference over time.

Overall, we find that access to lines of credit is more contingent on bank lending standards for private than for public firms. The impact of bank lending standards is however asymmetric: while private firms are less likely than public firms to gain access to new lines when credit market conditions are tight, we find no difference between public and private firms in terms of their use or retention of pre-existing lines. We also find that private firms without lines of credit use more trade credit when bank lending standards are tight, which is suggestive of a supply effect. Overall, the evidence suggests that credit crunches are likely to have a disproportionate impact on private firms. However, pre-existing banking relationships appear to mitigate the impact of these contractions on private firms.","[Demiroglu, Cem] Koc Univ, Coll Adm Sci & Econ, Istanbul, Turkey; [James, Christopher; Kizilaslan, Atay] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Koc University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Demiroglu, C (通讯作者)，Koc Univ, Coll Adm Sci & Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",cdemiroglu@ku.edu.tr; christopher.james@warrington.ufl.edu; atay.kizilaslan@warrington.ufl.edu,,"Demiroglu, Cem/0000-0003-4865-1411",,,,,30,31,38,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The simulated gains are generally large compared with those from conventional forms of financial liberalization.","[Lastrapes, William D.; Selgin, George] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Lastrapes, WD (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,"Lastrapes, William D./ABA-2030-2020; Lastrapes, William D./AAC-6950-2019",,,,,,64,2,3,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The payoff is linked to the performance of a multi asset investment strategy and includes a minimum interest rate guarantee. In addition, the buyer receives the option to decide on the investments dynamically. Prominent examples are so called variable annuities. Due to the embedded guarantee, these products are interesting for risk averse investors who benefit from diversification. However, the price setting of the provider takes into account the most risky strategy. This implies that the investor mitigates optimally between the diversification and the worst case strategy. We analyze the distortion and utility effects caused by the additional rider in the presence of background risk and borrowing constraints. A simulation analysis sheds light on the question if the additional rider is worth its costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, these constraints may be impossible to satisfy simultaneously because VaR is independent of the benchmark portfolio. The management of these restrictions is likely to affect portfolio performance and produces a wide variety of scenarios in the risk-return space. The aim of this paper is to analyse various interactions between portfolio frontiers when risk managers impose joint restrictions upon TEV and VaR. Specifically, we provide analytical solutions for all the intersections and we propose simple numerical methods when such solutions are not available. Finally, we introduce a new portfolio frontier.

This change inevitably has significant implications for physical travel in the age of electronic communication (e-communication). This paper aims to provide greater insight into people's travel behavior based on their e-Communication to Travel balance (C/T balance). This balance represents the ratio between an individual's e-communication and physical travel. The analysis studies the relevance of social ties in Ahmedabad, India, as a source of explanation of social activity, thus travel, undertaken by individuals. It is hypothesized that the C/T balance emerges from an individual's social network characteristics. The ability of an individual to engage in social activities not only depends on the individual's socioeconomic and lifestyle attributes, but also on the 'modality' of such interactions (e.g. physical travel or e-communication). The different modalities create different social networks. Each network represents a particular flow of potential activity travel generated by interaction between the individuals. These networks have been clustered on the basis of their C/T balance to get distinct people's profiles that can be used to target transport and ICT policies better. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine the micro-level factors that should be considered by a borrower when structuring debt denominated in various currencies. This paper will show how the currency composition of debt affects the cost of debt through the interaction with the risk of company's assets. We look at the currency mismatch in the firm and analyze its credit spread within a Merton's type model with bankruptcy. We show that foreign currency borrowing is cheaper when the exchange rate is positively correlated with the return on the company's assets. The determining factor is not just whether a given company is an exporter or importer, but rather the statistical correlation between the rate of return on the firm's assets and changes in the exchange rate.","[Galai, Dan; Wiener, Zvi] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Galai, D (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",msgalai@huji.ac.il; mswiener@huji.ac.il,"Wiener, Zvi/AAE-9750-2019","Wiener, Zvi/0000-0002-5169-4642",,,,,32,4,6,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Since then, there has been a new geographical debate concerning where students live and go to school and possible implications of this on student educational achievement and educational equality, as well as on students' daily lives. In studies of changes in the school system, travel distances to school have so far been less studied in the Swedish context. In this paper we will analyze the changes in distance to school for 15-year-olds, from 2000 to 2006, in order to identify who, and in which context, is traveling shorter/longer distances, and thus performing a school choice. We use register data from the database PLACE, Uppsala University. The focus is not on effects on achievement, nor school composition, but instead on the difference in ability/possibility of using school choice as measured by distance. A time-geography approach concerning variation in constraints between students is used. School choice may be a matter of preference for certain schools, but importantly, it might also be a matter of time and space restrictions for families with fewer resources: that is, with less spatial capital and a limited opportunity structure. Results show that travel to school distances have increased since the year 2000. Foreign-born students are traveling shorter distances, except for those with highly educated parents. Shorter distances are also travelled by students from families with social assistance and for visible minorities in areas where such minorities exist. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This has major policy implications. Many standard reviews of the region still, however, tend to maintain that urbanization is occurring rapidly but, as this paper demonstrates, the data used are frequently erroneous. Such errors are exacerbated by a lack of reasonable estimates of the size and growth of towns in Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa's most populous country with the region's most complex urban system. This paper also attempts to address this knowledge gap and shows how Nigeria's level of urbanization has also been significantly over-estimated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The formula presented covers options from the plain vanilla to most, if not all, mountain range exotic options and is developed in a multi-asset, multi-currency Black-Scholes model with time dependent parameters. It particular, it focuses on payoffs that depend on the distributions of the underlyings prices at multiple but set time horizons. The general formula not only covers existing cases but also enables the combination of diverse features from different types of exotic options. It also creates implicitly a language to describe payoffs that can be used in industrial applications to decouple the functions of payoff definition from pricing functions. Examples of several exotic options are presented, benchmarking the closed formulas' performance against Monte Carlo simulations. Results show a consistent over performance of the closed formula reducing calculation time by double digit factors.","[Veiga, Carlos] Univ Nova Lisboa CMA FCT UNL, Ctr Matemat & Aplicacoes, Fac Ciencias Tecnol, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Wystup, Uwe] MathFinance AG, D-65529 Waldems, Germany; [Esquivel, Manuel L.] FCT UNL, Dept Matemat, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Esquivel, Manuel L.] CMA FCT UNL, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Veiga, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa CMA FCT UNL, Ctr Matemat & Aplicacoes, Fac Ciencias Tecnol, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal.",carlos.veiga@live.com; uwe.wystup@mathfinance.com; mle@fct.unl.pt,"Wystup, Uwe/AAD-5466-2020; Esquivel, Manuel L./C-8266-2009","Esquivel, Manuel L./0000-0003-4991-7568",,,,,28,1,1,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

J,"Wintrobe, R",,,,"Wintrobe, Ronald",,,Autocracy and coups d'etat,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dictatorship; Coup d'etat; Internal governance; Japan; China,AGENCY COSTS; DICTATORSHIP,"In this paper I first briefly survey Tullock's contributions to the study of autocracy and . Tullock's analysis of the is insightful. He suggested that those at the top could control those at the bottom with a proper system of incentive payments. Here I expand on that idea by asking the reverse question, not what keeps those at the bottom from rebelling, but what keeps those at the top from looting the regime? I begin by noting that shareholders of the modern widely held corporation face a similar problem: what keeps the CEO from looting the company when the market for corporate control is flawed, shareholders are too weak to exercise discipline, and the board is in the CEO's pocket? I suggest the answer is provided by internal governance: the old need the young for good performance. I explain the financial crisis of 2008 as in part the result of the failure of this mechanism. I also explain the success of modern China this way: The Communist Party facilitates growth because its structure provides a way for superiors (the old) to trade with subordinates (the young). I have also expanded on Tullock's analysis to ask what conditions might prevent the dictator from implementing his solution to the problem, thus explaining why actually occur. The basic reason is the weakness of the state. Japanese history provides two interesting illustrations of this: first the Tokugawa regime, where the people were over-controlled, and second, the Meiji constitution, implemented after the fall of the Tokugawa state. The Japanese problem after Meiji was that the military (the young) had no incentive to offer their loyalty to the old (the civilian regime), so the young acted on their own. The problem was the reverse of the Tokugawa regime's: the Meiji constitution left the bottom with too much control over the top. There was no formal but a number of coup attempts were made and the military increasingly constituted a state within a state. This reversal of authority apparently continued down the chain of command, ultimately with tragic consequences, most notably the invasion of Pearl Harbor.","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Wintrobe, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada.",rwintrob@uwo.ca,,,,,,,32,8,13,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2012,152.0,1-2,,,SI,,115,130,,10.1007/s11127-011-9862-3,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,944AN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304170600009,0

Our theoretical analysis suggests that auction performances are equalized between the discriminatory-price and uniform-price auctions. However, laboratory experiments reveal that, although the discriminatory-price auction has an advantage in terms of reducing policy costs, it is more likely to cause adverse selection.

Our results provide a word of caution: the Treasury's inherent interest in patriotic taxpayers may strengthen the political push for patriotism in an age of globalization and increased mobility.","[Qari, Salmai; Konrad, Kai A.] Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Geys, Benny] Norwegian Sch Management BI, N-0442 Oslo, Norway; [Geys, Benny] Social Sci Res Ctr Berlin WZB, D-10785 Berlin, Germany",Max Planck Society; BI Norwegian Business School,"Qari, S (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, Marstallpl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",salmai.qari@tax.mpg.de; kai.konrad@tax.mpg.de; geys@wzb.eu,,"Qari, Salmai/0000-0003-3457-0637; Geys, Benny/0000-0003-4524-1820",,,,,79,24,24,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2012,151.0,3-4,,,,,695,717,,10.1007/s11127-011-9765-3,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,858QZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297818800014,0

In our optimal dynamic control model, a park management maximizes tourism revenues and conservation benefits net of control costs by choosing optimal dynamic levels of conservation and visitor management. The optimization is constrained by an extended food chain model representing species-habitat-visitor interactions. We illustrate for a game bird in an Alpine national park that ecotourism can indeed lead to ecosystem degradation when the park management is more concerned about increasing tourism revenues than about achieving the conservation target and if the endangered species is unknown to most visitors. If, however, the park management is well aware of the potentially negative consequences of ecotourism and hence cares for species conservation, limited ecotourism can provide funding for species conservation which ensures population levels above the uncontrolled steady state.","[Bednar-Friedl, Birgit] Graz Univ, Dept Econ, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Bednar-Friedl, Birgit] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Behrens, Doris A.] Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Econ, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Behrens, Doris A.] Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Math Methods Econ, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Getzner, Michael] Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Publ Finance & Infrastruct Policy, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz; University of Klagenfurt; Technische Universitat Wien; Technische Universitat Wien,"Bednar-Friedl, B (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",birgit.friedl@uni-graz.at,"Getzner, Michael/S-6765-2019; Bednar-Friedl, Birgit/F-3257-2016","Bednar-Friedl, Birgit/0000-0002-8348-4615; Getzner, Michael/0000-0003-1088-2652",,,,,61,14,16,1,63,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Six objectives including risks associated to paths and shelter locations, evacuation path lengths, and the final evacuation time from shelters to, for instance, hospitals, were considered in a mixed integer linear programming model. The proposed approach was tested for a simulated fire situation concerning the historical urban city center of an old European city (Coimbra, Portugal).

Evidence from ABS-CDOs,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Asset-backed security; Credit rating; Collateralized debt obligation; Yield spread,RATES,"Based on a sample of 3254 floating rate tranches from 617 ABS-CDOs (collateralized debt obligations backed by asset-backed securities), this paper tests the rating overdependence hypothesis - i.e., that ratings of structured products are a sufficient statistic (in terms of predicting future credit performance) for yield spreads at origination. The paper's findings are fourfold. First, yield spreads at issuance predict future performance of ABS-CDO tranches even after controlling for the information contained in ratings. Second, the ability of yield spreads to predict future performance, however, is driven exclusively by ratings below AAA (and, to a lesser extent, also by the lowest priority AAA tranches), whereas spreads of super senior AAA tranches show no information content. Third, the predictive ability of yield spreads is lower for tranches from later vintages and for tranches from deals with more complex collateral pools. Fourth, the conditional correlation between ratings and spreads, in turn, is increasing in time and higher for tranches from complex deals. In sum, the evidence indicates that investors in (especially AAA) tranches from later and more complex deals have avoided performing costly due diligence on the securities they bought.

Minimum acceptable income replacement rates range from 95 to 45% across income quintiles in the U.S., and from 75 to 60% across income quintiles in The Netherlands.

First, we summarize the effects of export taxes using both partial and general equilibrium theoretical models. When large countries aim to maintain constant domestic food prices, in the event of an increase in world agricultural prices, the optimal response is to decrease import tariffs in net food-importing countries and to increase export tariffs in net food-exporting countries. The latter decision improves national welfare, while the former reduces national welfare: this is the price that must be paid to keep domestic food prices constant. Small net food-importing countries are harmed by both decisions, while small net food-exporting countries gain from both. Second, we illustrate the costs of a lack of regulation and cooperation surrounding such policies in a time of crisis using a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, mimicking the mechanisms that appeared during the recent food price surge (2006-2008). This model illustrates the interdependence of trade policies, as well as how a process of retaliation and counter-retaliation (increased export taxes in large net food-exporting countries and reduced import tariffs in large net food-importing countries) can contribute to successive augmentations of world agricultural prices and harm small net food-importing countries. We conclude with a call for international regulation, in particular because small net food-importing countries may be substantially harmed by those policies that amplify the already negative impact of a food crisis.","[Bouet, Antoine; Debucquet, David Laborde] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Bouet, Antoine] Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, LAREFI, F-33608 Pessac, France",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Universite de Bordeaux,"Bouet, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",a.bouet@cgiar.org; d.laborde@cgiar.org,"Laborde, David/D-6408-2015","Laborde, David/0000-0003-3644-3498; Bouet, Antoine/0000-0002-8020-8877",,,,,28,39,43,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

So far it is rarely analyzed whether these variables of social cognition influence everyday decision making behavior. We focus on entrepreneurs who are permanently facing exchange processes in the interplay with investors, sellers, and buyers, as well as needing to trust others and reciprocate with their network. We base our analysis on the German Socio-Economic Panel with its recently introduced questions about trust, positive reciprocity, and negative reciprocity to examine the extent that these variables influence the entrepreneurial decision processes. More specifically, we analyze whether (i) the willingness to trust other people influences the probability of starting a business; (ii) trust, positive reciprocity, and negative reciprocity influence the exit probability of entrepreneurs; and (iii) willingness to trust and to act reciprocally influences the probability of being an entrepreneur versus an employee or a manager. Our findings reveal that, in particular, trust impacts entrepreneurial development. Interestingly, entrepreneurs are more trustful than employees, but much less trustful than managers.

Empirical results indicate that the asymmetric EGARCH model is the most preferable according to purely statistical loss functions. However, the mean mixed error criterion suggests that the EGARCH model facilitates option buyers for improving their trading position performance, while option sellers tend to favor the IGARCH/EGARCH model at shorter/longer trading horizon. For VaR calculations, although these GARCH-type models are likely to over-predict SPDRs' volatility, they are, nevertheless, capable of providing adequate VaR forecasts. Thus, a GARCH genre of model with SGT errors remains a useful technique for measuring and managing potential losses on SPDRs under a turbulent market scenario. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, we find that stocks are substantially more volatile over long horizons from an investors perspective. This perspective recognizes that parameters are uncertain, even with two centuries of data, and that observable predictors imperfectly deliver the conditional expected return. Mean reversion contributes strongly to reducing long-horizon variance but is more than offset by various uncertainties faced by the investor.

This paper assesses whether these assumptions hold through the analysis of how the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label for capture fisheries has managed supply, demand and civic concerns in the market for sustainability certifications. The MSC has created and now dominates the market for sustainable fish, but success has been accompanied by serious challenges. The MSC has so far failed to convincingly show that its certification system has positive environmental impacts, and it has marginalized Southern fisheries, especially in low-income countries. As an institutional solution to the global fishery crisis, the MSC seems to be better tuned to the creation of a market for sustainable fish rather than sustainable fisheries.","[Ponte, Stefano] Danish Inst Int Studies, DK-1401 Copenhagen C, Denmark; [Ponte, Stefano] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies; Copenhagen Business School,"Ponte, S (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Int Studies, Strandgade 56, DK-1401 Copenhagen C, Denmark.",spo@diis.dk,,,,,,,53,153,170,6,101,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

On the one hand, for capital account liberalization to be growth enhancing, a critical level of local institutional quality is needed. On the other hand, increased integration in the global financial system strengthens these countries' institutions. We argue that this complex relationship may give rise to multiple equilibria in the dynamics of financial global integration: haphazard capital account liberalization may lead to situations where well integrated nations become increasingly better integrated, while poorly integrated nations are left at the margin. To test this hypothesis, we check whether controlling for the quality of institutions eliminates conditional convergence of global financial integration. Our results confirm that growth in financial integration is non-linear, and that this non-linearity disappears once we control for the quality of institutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The results are robust to controlling for supply-side factors, including house price appreciation, mortgage securitization, and other economic fundamentals, and to several robustness tests controlling for endogeneity. The results are consistent with the notion that a relaxation of lending standards, triggered by an increased demand for loans, contributed to the boom and the ensuing crisis, together with other supply-side explanations.

Using a panel of OECD countries from 1980 to 2005, the results show that social spending has expansionary effects on GDP. In particular, we find that an increase of 1 per cent in social spending increases GDP by about 0.1 percentage points, which, given the share of social spending in GDP, corresponds to a multiplier of about 0.6. The effect is similar to that of total government spending, and it is larger in periods of severe downturns. Among spending subcategories, social spending on health and on unemployment benefits have the greatest effects. Social spending also positively affects private consumption, while it has negligible effects on investment. The empirical results are economically and statistically significant, and robust.","[Furceri, Davide; Zdzienicka, Aleksandra] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Furceri, Davide] Univ Palermo, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",International Monetary Fund; University of Palermo,"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dfurceri@imf.org; azdzienicka@imf.org,,,,,,,34,27,31,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

However countries with the most ambitious programs of this type (Denmark, Germany and Spain) have experienced a noticeable increase in electricity costs. Quota programs, combined with some form of tradable carbon certificates, have typically produced a lesser response with lower impact on consumers. Assured access to grids has also played an important role in expediting growth. Both genres of policy instruments increase global demand for renewable technologies, thereby promoting dynamic efficiency However other inefficiencies remain. Feed-in-tariffs place primary onus of technology selection and support on governments and regulators Limitations on carbon trade reduce effectiveness and increase costs as well.

In some simulation specifications, policies benefits are monetized by accounting for projected reductions in government expenditures on medical care for pregnant women and infants. In a majority of these specifications, policies fiscal benefit-cost ratios are less than 1. However, in specifications that account additionally for projected savings to programs that provide a broader range of benefits and services to young children, all three policies have benefit-cost ratios that are comfortably greater than 1. The results from my preferred specifications suggest that the simulated policies would produce returns to taxpayers on each dollar spent of between $2 to $6.

These pilot schemes have encountered low demand. Research suggests that better-off farmers may already be insured via income diversification, their assets and social networks, and may achieve profit-maximising portfolios without formal insurance contracts. They would be interested in such contracts only if they reliably reduced their exposure to risk at lower costs than their self-insurance mechanisms. Conversely, poor farmers are not able to sell-insure adequately, have to trade-off returns for reduced risk and could, therefore, benefit from a well-designed insurance. But they are cash/credit constrained and, therefore, cannot advance the money before sowing time to buy insurance that pays Out only after the harvest. Index insurance, therefore, cannot be scaled up. Even if a few farmers purchase it, governments still will need to run relief programmes far the uninsured. Standard ways suggested to improve the index insurance, such as reducing basis risks, educating farmers and improving weather data, do not improve the ability of small farmers to purchase insurance and may not improve product design sufficiently to be competitive with self-insurance of the better-off farmers.","China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Binswanger-Mkhize, HP (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",binswangerh@gmail.com,"Binswanger, Hans/M-6883-2013","Binswanger, Hans/0000-0002-6323-1418",,,,,34,148,164,2,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

Findings suggest information content increased in 16 countries that mandated adoption of IFRS relative to 11 that maintained domestic accounting standards, although the effect of mandatory IFRS adoption depends on the strength of legal enforcement in the adopting country.

In this respect, we proceeded at the holistic analysis of the domain's inherent and specific conditions that allowed detection of influencing factors of the adoption of an ecological behavior and their synthetic structure into three groups of determinants: economic, psychosocial and organizational. In these three major coordinates, there are designed types of ecological behaviour, their effectiveness being at the intersection of the projections of different degrees of intensity considered on the chosen axes. Based on deductive reasoning there can be determined orthoscopic actions that are focused on eliminating the cause that generated behavioural deviations.","[Petcu, Monica; Miron, Dumitru; David-Sobolevschi, Iulia] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"David-Sobolevschi, I (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",iulia.david@kgaudit.ro,"Miron, Dumitru/C-6816-2012; Miron, Dumitru/AAW-4320-2020","Miron, Dumitru/0000-0003-0606-6329",,,,,17,4,4,1,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2012,14.0,31,,,,,129,141,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,900SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300910600010,0

However, a fundamental question remains: is self-governance economically beneficial, allowing it to serve as an alternative management tool? This paper uses a unique set of survey data from a territorial-user-right-based South Korean inshore (maul) fishery and applies an empirical strategy to provide some of the first quantitative evidence that self-governance benefits maul fishermen. We find that members of the self-governance group perceive the management system as having had a positive impact on four out of the eight criteria we tested: stock recovery, curtailed fishing effort, reduced disputes among fishermen and declining incidents of illegal fishing. Considering that these groups have been in existence on average for less than seven years, these results indicate that the management scheme has made good progress overall.","[Uchida, Emi; Uchida, Hirotsugu] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Lee, Jung-Sam; Ryu, Jeong-Gon; Kim, Dae-Young] Korea Maritime Inst, Seoul, South Korea",University of Rhode Island; Korea Maritime Institute,"Uchida, E (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, 216 Coastal Inst,1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",emi@uri.edu; uchida@uri.edu; jlee8793@kmi.re.kr; mobydick@kmi.re.kr; jkryu@kmi.re.kr,"Uchida, Hirotsugu/AAD-2401-2019; Kim, Dae young/ADA-1748-2022","Uchida, Hirotsugu/0000-0003-3675-806X; Kim, Dae young/0000-0001-7272-0726",,,,,28,15,18,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

This paper contributes to this literature by examining two related questions: whether venture capital firms use strategic alliances as a substitute or compliment to capital infusion, and how venture capital firms use alliances to mitigate different types of risk. Results from 2505 venture-backed startups reveal that venture capital firms treat alliance formation as a substitute for capital infusion and that the breadth of the network of syndication partners investing in the startup increases the number of its strategic alliances. We also find intentionality in alliance formation. Specifically, firms operating in industry environments characterized by technical risk are more likely to form alliances with partners capable of mitigating technical risks, and firms operating in environments characterized by market risk are more likely to form alliances with partners capable of mitigating market risk. Our findings lend additional support to the perspective that alliances represent an important mechanism through which venture capital firms add value to their portfolio companies.","[Wuebker, Robert J.] Univ Utah, David Eccles Sch Business, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Wang, Haizhi] IIT, Stuart Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60661 USA; [Han, Shu] Yeshiva Univ, Sy Syms Sch Business, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Ensley, Michael D.] Execut Assessment Inst, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Illinois Institute of Technology; Yeshiva University,"Wuebker, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, David Eccles Sch Business, 1645 E Campus Ctr Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",hwang23@stuart.iit.edu; Robert.wuebker@business.utah.edu; shan@yu.edu; michael@executiveteam.com,"sheng, chen/JEO-8801-2023",,,,,,100,19,26,2,74,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Systems of knowledge, beliefs, customs, norms and a wide range of culturally related activities, such as arts, crafts and music, can play a significant role in the everyday lives of people and contribute to the sustainability of human societies. The means through which culture can be effectively incorporated into development processes requires further research. This article develops the concept of 'cultural capital' to explore how cultural assets sustain an artisan class in three rural villages close to the city of Kandy in central Sri Lanka. The field research found that embodied cultural traditions and subsequent material outputs are vital 'resources' in achieving livelihood objectives and meeting family aspirations. We argue that the development industry needs to reconsider cultural assets and traditions and incorporate them into its work at conceptual and programmatic levels. Conceptually development needs to see itself as a cultural as much as economic or social process, and programmatically we see openings within sustainable livelihoods approaches for a greater explicit appreciation and awareness of locally-specific cultural traditions, strengths and perspectives.","[Daskon, Chandima] Univ Sri Jayewardenepura, Dept Geog, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka; [McGregor, Andrew] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand",University Sri Jayewardenepura; Victoria University Wellington,"Daskon, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sri Jayewardenepura, Dept Geog, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka.",cdaskon@yahoo.com,,"McGregor, Andrew/0000-0001-6476-346X",,,,,73,15,23,8,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

New ideas and improved services lead towards growth in service organizations. Given a choice, consumers prefer environments which offer pleasant atmosphere. In certain shopping situations the atmosphere may be more influential than the product itself in the purchase decision and can directly influence consumer behaviour. Unfortunately, many service organizations focus exclusively on some combination of traditional marketing mix, which contains product, place ( distribution), promotional activities and price, although traditional Four P's do not cover personnel, customer service, and physical facilities. The aim of the paper is to prove that music is an important element of physical evidence in service organizations, which help service organizations to separate themselves from competitors and target a specific market segment by altering its service process.

Chemin (2008) made at least one crucial undocumented and unrealistic assumption, and did not document many of his variable constructions. MP correctly identifies inappropriate members of control groups, and other problems, but his claim that his propensity score matching (PSM) results provide support for Pitt and Khandker's (1998 - PnK) most important claim is misleading as it is not robust.

Thus, we can notice it has become part of the constitution of several states within only a few decades, facilitating appropriate developments at regional and international levels. This study shows that the appearance of the global environment issues (greenhouse effect, climate changes, thinning of the ozone layer, etc.) contributed to the reinforcement of its status: a fundamental right and also the right of the humankind to survive. By our analysis of the case-law establishment, we underline the fact that the right to a healthy environment was stated by the way of interpreting the art. 8.1 in the European Convention on Human Rights, in the absence of an explicit statement in the matter. Thus, the right to a healthy environment is considered a part of the right to private and family life, protected by a bounding effect (the extension of the protection provided by certain rights warranted by the Convention to rights that are not expressly stated therein.

Consumers rely on information from other people in order to make purchasing decisions, especially in uncertain situations (Mitchell & McGoldrick, 1996). Consumers not only search for medical information online and use word of mouth (WOM) from other consumers who have similar problems or have experiences of related treatments, but also share their experiences, opinions and knowledge with other consumers through online communities such as forums and blogs. Exploratory qualitative research targeting Romanian women who are active in an online gynaecological community forum was conducted. The aim of the research is to examine the content of the messages they post, from different perspectives such as the type of support messages, the reasons they post messages and the emotions attached to the messages. The data was explored using the netnography method, and a content analysis was applied to the messages posted on the forums. Furthermore, the study focused on the linguistic behaviour of female online healthcare consumers. The findings showed that the messages posted contained more positive eWOM than negative, but that the negative eWOM postings had a powerful impact linguistically. The reasons for posting such messages were connected to the concept of frustration, and the emotion most often expressed in the messages was anger. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this purpose the paper focuses on two different fiscal tools for influencing a foreign investor's location decision, i.e. corporate tax rate and/or provision of public inputs. The paper provides a new perspective on the issue of why FDI are attracted or not by the emergent countries. The study is based on the hypothesis that the competition among countries for attracting FDI does not represent the final goal, but a means for sustainable development and economic-social welfare. In this perspective, the final objective of the paper is the answer to the following questions: Under what conditions Romania will win in the competition for FDI with other (asymmetric) country?

For instance, while the relationship between FDI and poverty reduction is positive and significant for economic communities in Central and East Africa, it is non-significant in Northern and Southern Africa.

Starting from the agency theory, the company is accountable for the decision to report environmental information, decision which is made by the management to serve for the best interest of the shareholders (Buniamin et al., 2011: 56). Within this study, we would therefore focus on certain factors related to the entity's internal characterstics, consisting mainly in how the entity is managed, in order to identify if good corporate governance practices explain the voluntary environmental reporting. The research is conducted as an empirical study which explains how the disclosure of environmental information varies across the largest entities operating in the petroleum industry and reflects factors that could account for these variations. The paper identifies the corporate governance characteristics such as the percentage of independent directors and the existence of an environmental committee as factors that explain the variation in environmental information disclosure. We conclude that in order to secure the transparency of environmental performance within a company, the board should ensure a sufficiently number of independent members able to exercise an independent reasoning for solving potential conflicts of interests. Also, the environmental committee monitors the company's activity in terms of its environmental impact, bringing about increasing transparency regarding the environmental aspects.

In particular, the paper seeks to examine whether the fiscal situation of the Malaysian state governments can be explained by the way decision process regarding expenditure and revenue collection is made. For the purpose of this study, we choose to focus on two states governments namely Penang and Kelantan. The choice of these two states was made based on the significant difference in term of their fiscal situation. This study employs ARDL or bound test procedure proposed by Pesaran and Shin (1996), Pesaran and Pesaran (1997) and Pesaran et al (2001) to test for the cointegration relationships. Our results show that in the short-run, the causality seems to run from state government expenditure to state government revenue of Kelantan. This finding is consistent with the spend-and-tax hypothesis. In other words, the state government of Kelantan decides on its expenditure first before it decides on its revenue. As for Penang, the finding seems to point to an institutional separation as no causality is found between its revenue and its expenditure in the short run. In the case of long-run causality, Kelantan is found to have a negative sign of error correction model (ECM) in the revenue equation. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the prevailing conditions that favour oyster mushroom production, there is a need to understand why many farmers are not engaged in this enterprise. This study uses cross-section data to identify factors that influence farmers' decisions of whether or not to participate in oyster mushroom production. Using two-stage probit least squares and two-stage conditional maximum likelihood estimation procedures, the results indicate that apart from the level of farm diversification and farmers' perceptions towards mushrooms, decisions of whether or not to produce are influenced mainly by institutional factors. Bearing in mind that mushrooms are not plants but fungi, farmers are bound to have mixed perceptions towards the enterprise and these perceptions are likely to have an influence on its acceptability. However, as established from the results, with improved awareness, training and mentoring, farmers are likely to develop positive attitudes as they would understand the circumstances associated with the production of edible mushrooms. Evidence drawn from this study suggests that policy interventions aimed at creating an enabling environment for the enterprise may remain ineffective unless they are paralleled by improvements in rural infrastructure and access to markets.","[Mabuza, M.

Reasons include that overconfidence reduces managers' ability to perceive risk correctly. However, although it has been addressed in several theoretical models, the impact of overconfidence on firm success has received little empirical examination. Based on a unique 10-year panel dataset of German chief executive officers (CEOs) and their companies, we investigate the relationship between overconfidence and firm success. In line with principal agent theory and the hubris hypothesis, we find negative effects of CEO overconfidence during economic recessions. However, we also find a strong positive impact of CEO overconfidence on firm profitability and stock market performance during the early phases of the business cycle. These novel insights imply that overconfidence operates using different mechanisms in routine than in one-time situations. In particular it hints at heightened individual effort and work performance of overconfident individuals as described in psychological studies. Our findings suggest a reciprocal relationship between macroeconomic developments and microeconomic decision-making, a finding that may help to illuminate aggregated patterns such as herding and investment bubbles and the current economic and financial crisis.","[Mueller, Andreas] Aachen Univ Technol RWTH, Chair Business Adm & Sci Engineers & Nat Scientis, D-52064 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"Mueller, A (通讯作者)，Aachen Univ Technol RWTH, Chair Business Adm & Sci Engineers & Nat Scientis, Templergraben 64, D-52064 Aachen, Germany.",andreas.mueller@win.rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,,63,12,12,1,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Our dataset comprises approximately 3579 observations over the period from 1985 to 2004 and covers the entire range of U.S. financial intermediaries - commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, asset managers, and financial infrastructure services firms. We use two alternative measures of geographic diversification: (1) a dummy variable whether the firm reports more than one geographic segment and (2) the percentage of sales from non-domestic operations. Our results indicate that geographic diversification is not associated with a significant valuation discount in financial intermediaries. However, when accounting for the firms' main activity-areas, we find evidence of a significant discount associated with geographic diversification in securities firms and a premium in credit intermediaries and insurance companies. All these results are robust after taking into account functional diversification of the firms, a potential endogeneity of both functional and geographic diversification, and a potential value transfer from equity to debt holders by using estimates of the market value of debt.

Both are export-intensive industries, but differ greatly in technological sophistication and labour intensity. Changes in both the productivity level and rate of growth in each industry are decomposed into the effects of technological change, technical efficiency change and scale efficiency change and then the impacts of spillovers on each component and on total productivity are estimated. The findings suggest that foreign direct investment generates a positive effect on total productivity change, technical efficiency change, technological change, and scale efficiency change in the garment industry. In contrast, foreign direct investment contributes significantly negatively to total productivity, technological change and scale efficiency change, but has no significant effect on technical efficiency change in the electronics industry.","[Salim, Ruhul A.] Curtin Univ Technol, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Suyanto] Univ Surabaya, Fac Business & Econ, Surabaya, Indonesia",Curtin University; Universitas Surabaya (UBAYA),"Salim, RA (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",ruhul.salim@cbs.curtin.edu.au,"suyanto, suyanto/B-4381-2016; Bloch, Harry/A-9591-2008; Bloch, Harry/O-1058-2019","suyanto, suyanto/0000-0001-9084-8379; Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925; Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925",,,,,31,27,29,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Their effects are manifested on sales, on customers' buying intentions, on product image or on fairness perceptions. The present paper has analyzed odd prices assigned by six important electronics and appliance retailers that operate in Romanian market. The data collection was made by observation and the product categories studied were: TV-sets, hair dryers and mobile phones. The results shows that Romanian retailers use in a very great extend odd prices, not taking into account assortment size, brand image, product value or market share.

Early age marriages reduce mother's educational attainment, which can adversely impact the education outcomes of their children. On the other hand, better marriage prospects of young brides may compensate and improve children's educational outcomes by way of resource provision. Consequently, the effect of early age marriages of girls on their children is theoretically ambiguous and warrants an empirical examination. In our empirical analysis, we use variation in age at menarche to instrument for age at marriage. Our estimates show that a delay of one year in the age at marriage of the mother increases the probability of being able to do the most challenging arithmetic and reading tasks on the administered test by 3.5 percentage points.","[Sekhri, Sheetal] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Debnath, Sisir] Indian Sch Business, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",University of Virginia; Indian School of Business (ISB),"Sekhri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",ssekhri@virginia.edu,"Debnath, Sisir/G-7772-2015","Debnath, Sisir/0000-0001-8395-8836",,,,,19,46,55,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In particular, we investigate whether local politicians' incentives to extract rents by setting their own wages are influenced by the degree of political competition and voter information. We use a sample of the largest Spanish municipalities over the years 2008-2010. The results indicate that weaker political competition and lesser voter information are related to more rent extraction. In an additional analysis, we show that higher wages do not ensure better financial management. These findings confirm that when politicians can set their own salaries, higher wages do not mean better management, but they are just political rents.","[Benito, Bernardino; Bastida, Francisco; Rios, Ana-Maria; Vicente, Cristina] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Benito, B (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",benitobl@um.es; alba@um.es; anamaria.rios1@um.es; cristina.v.o@um.es,"Benito, Bernardino/K-9416-2014; Ríos-Martínez, Ana María/L-1920-2014; Bastida, Francisco/K-9670-2014","Benito, Bernardino/0000-0003-2165-994X; Ríos-Martínez, Ana María/0000-0002-7783-288X; Bastida, Francisco/0000-0001-9875-3817",,,,,44,8,8,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2014,161.0,3-4,,,,,367,383,,10.1007/s11127-014-0206-y,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AT7XF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345147000006,0

Compared to dynamic delta hedge, which breaks down in the presence of large random jumps, the static hedge works well under both continuous and discontinuous price dynamics. Simulation exercises show that under purely continuous price dynamics, discretized static hedges with as few as three to five options perform similarly to the dynamic delta hedge with the underlying futures and daily updating, but the static hedges strongly outperform the daily delta hedge when the underlying price process contains random jumps. A historical analysis using over 13 years of data on S&P 500 index options further validates the superior performance of the static hedging strategy in practical situations.","[Carr, Peter] NYU, Courant Inst, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Wu, Liuren] CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, New York, NY 10010 USA",New York University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Wu, LR (通讯作者)，CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, 1 Bernard BaruchWay,B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA.",liuren.wu@baruch.cuny.edu,"Wu, Liuren/HGD-6691-2022",,,,,,56,30,31,0,96,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

It focuses on consolidation terminals for truckers and addresses the problem of optimising location pattern and public share in investments. This problem is solved through a Stackelberg game between the designer and the collective of road carriers. So a bilevel approach combines a system-optimum problem, at the upper level, with the carrier equilibrium problem, at the lower level. The choice behaviour of the lower-level player is simulated by a random utility model. The output of the game suggests that private companies and society should share the investments and the public contribution should be high; furthermore, transhipment and consolidation services should be concentrated at few terminals to exploit fully economies of scale at the expense of the average travel time to reach the logistic platforms.

IIN was a policy pursued by the central government that was aimed at creating locally owned technologies. TLHN was a policy pursued by some local governments that focused on restructuring local industries. Both policies sought to cultivate a viable local industry in flat panel production, but because of the conflicts, the efforts tended to offset rather than reinforce each other. IIN is a top-down policy based on import substitution which entails market entry restrictions and trade protection, whereas TLHN is a bottom-up policy of an export-promotion nature which encourages multiple entries and market competition. When the TLHN initiative is superseded by the IIN policy implemented at the central-government level, local governments are forced to make a detour from their traditional paths of industrial development. However, the objective of IIN is hard to come by because of the misaligned incentives between the upstream and downstream industries, and between the regions that host these industries. This study suggests that a top-down policy like IIN, which embraces an ambitious goal of technology leapfrogging, may undermine the efforts of local governments that take a gradual and incremental approach to industrial upgrading.","[Chen, Tain-Jy] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Ku, Ying-Hua] Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chen, TJ (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, 21 Hsu Chow Rd, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",tainjy@ntu.edu.tw; ku@cier.edu.tw,,,,,,,48,16,16,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In the age of digital nomadism, mobile technology is likely to play an important role for the new mobility and work-life arrangements put into practice by a multitude of creative knowledge professionals. What emerges from our multi-perspective exploration is the realisation that mobile technology might offer people numerous new reasons to be mobile: by making them more informed; more capable of using a larger variety of physical spaces and re-negotiating obligations in real-time; and potentially more efficient in the allocation of their travel time and resources. On the other hand, it also appears that mobile technology can impose new burdens on travellers and make travel less appealing in some ways. Additional research is called for to improve our understanding of the circumstances under which each of these opposing outcomes occurs. The findings from such research could be used to better calibrate traffic simulation models, as well as to weigh the implications of emerging forms of travel behaviour for the environment.

We found that observation coupled with feedback increased significantly dictators' propositions, while no significant effect is found for observation-only. We conclude that regard by others matters only if it linked to social factors such as communication. This complements the literature arguing that altruistic behavior is instrumental in serving other selfish (or non-purely altruistic) ends such as self-reputation or social approval.

Using a novel dataset, I study the price effects of inclusions to and exclusions from a benchmark equity index in the context of emerging market assets. While testing for a number of existing hypotheses, I am able to document evidence for the 'investor recognition' hypothesis, using event study methodology.

This paper fills a gap in the literature by investigating extensive and intensive margins of health aid allocation patterns at project- and donor-levels. We find that when the health status of a recipient country deteriorates, the total value of health aid to the country increases due in large part to an increase in the number of health aid projects and to an increase in the average aid value from each donor country.

The need to adjust for differences in risk, other than leverage, is commonly neglected. There can be substantial effects of taxation on after-tax risk when there are depreciation deductions. Among the few studies of these effects, even fewer identify all effects correctly. When marginal investment is taxed together with inframarginal, the marginal beta for the Capital Asset Pricing Model differs from the average. The problems identified here imply that currently suggested tax reforms may fail.

While many others have investigated such impacts before, the majority of the literature has focused solely on mitigation of hypothetical bias. We contribute to this literature by widening the scope of research to other behavioral aspects where consumers in CE are often found to deviate from homo economicus. We develop a theoretical model where not only Willingness to pay (WTP) measures but also decision processing can be affected by the introduction of an economic incentive. Specifically, our model allows for differential impacts on attribute processing, depending on the character of the attribute as well as self-image effects. In an empirical CE survey, we find some, though not unequivocal, support of our model. Even though we find no impact on WIP from introducing an economic incentive, we find marked benefits in relation to a number of behavioral aspects that together would favor the use of an economic incentive regardless of hypothetical bias being present or not.

If the voters are ideologically predisposed to cast their votes in favor of one political party, they may reelect an underperforming incumbent. Party polarization may magnify this effect since the median voter faces a higher cost of selecting a better, but ideologically distant incumbent. Alternatively, if the electorate is evenly divided between parties, polarization may induce parties to invest more effort in improving their election prospects. The current paper analyzes efficiency in Norwegian local governments. Efficiency has been measured by means of panel data on government service output over a 10-year period. Electoral dominance has been measured as number of elections wherein one party bloc receives at least 60 % of the votes, measured over six consecutive elections. Party polarization is defined as the ideological distance between the two party blocs, and it is measured on basis of survey data on the ideological preferences of elected politicians. Lack of party competition reduces efficiency, the effect being stronger in governments where more party polarization exists. These agency losses are larger in high-revenue municipalities.","BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, N-0404 Oslo, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School,"Sorensen, RJ (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, Nydalsveien 37, N-0404 Oslo, Norway.",rune.sorensen@bi.no,,,,,,,43,35,36,2,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2014,161.0,3-4,,,,,427,450,,10.1007/s11127-014-0168-0,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AT7XF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345147000009,0

Yet, how to achieve broader and more sustainable access by smallholder farmers to productivity-enhancing inputs for food crop production remains a largely unsolved riddle. In light of the great institutional diversity across cotton sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa, this study investigates whether cotton can be used to spur the intensification of smallholder food production. First, a conceptual framework linking cotton institutional structures to food crop intensification is developed.

Patients in high-income countries seek to solve their health problems in developing countries where the cost of medical treatment is much lower. This cost difference has led to the medical tourism industry that is currently estimated with an annual growth rate of about 20%. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide. The high cost of treating these diseases cause many patients to seek treatment options abroad. This paper presents an analysis of the medical tourism industry highlighting the factors that led to its development, barriers to medical tourism, and the economic impact of this industry. Although Romania has highly appreciated doctors it hasn't achieved yet the high level of other developing countries where medical tourism is more intense. Spa tourism is still far from Romania's potential in this area due to the very small investments and the lack of necessary infrastructure. Using statistical and econometric techniques we examined key health indicators in Romania showing the lack of correlation between the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, the development of the endowment of the health system in Romania, expenditures on health care and evolution of the number of foreign tourists coming to Romania to treat these diseases. We used statistical data series provided by N.S.I. that were processed using Eviews. We also tested whether there is a causal relationship in the Granger sense between the percentage of GDP allocated to the health care system and the number of nights spent by foreign tourists in resorts in Romania or the number of arrivals of foreign tourists.","[Andrei, Catalina Liliana; Sinescu, Crina Julieta] Univ Med & Pharm Carol Davila Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; [Tigu, Gabriela; Dragoescu, Raluca Mariana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Carol Davila University of Medicine & Pharmacy; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Andrei, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Med & Pharm Carol Davila Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",ccatalina97@yahoo.com,"Sinescu, Crina Julieta/AAA-8793-2021; Tigu, Gabriela/AEV-2179-2022","Sinescu, Crina Julieta/0000-0001-5933-8549; Tigu, Gabriela/0000-0001-6189-8027",,,,,27,7,8,0,30,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1136,1150,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900008,0

Production will have to have increased massively, but also labor productivity, requiring a vast reduction in the proportion of the population engaged in agriculture and a large move out of rural areas. The paper questions how this can be squared with a continuing commitment to smallholder agriculture as the main route for growth in African agriculture and for poverty reduction. We question the evidence base for an exclusive focus on smallholders, and argue for a much more open-minded approach to different modes of production. To allow alternative modes and scale of production to emerge, new institutional and policy frameworks are required. A rush to establish mega-farms with government discretionary allocation of vast tracts of land is unlikely to be the answer. Allowing a more dynamic agriculture to develop will require clear institutional frameworks, and not just a narrow focus on smallholders.

We develop and test a number of hypotheses related to the role of institutional shareholders and underwriters involved in the issuing process. We find that the rise in fees is related to the strengthening of the relative negotiating position of a specific underwriter in comparison to a specific issuer and to the growing influence of institutional shareholders with short-term investment horizons. Our evidence suggests that there may be reasonable grounds for considering potential conflicts of interest due to the dual role of institutional shareholders as investors and sub-underwriters. On the other hand, the ownership size of large shareholders and the reputation of underwriters have a moderating effect on fees, while the nationality of the institutional shareholders, the concentration of the investment bank industry and the experience of corporate issuers are not related to underwriting fees.

Although rehypothecation benefits the end user through cost reduction of derivative trades, it also creates additional counterparty credit risk since the end user may not receive the collateral back when the dealer suddenly defaults. To evaluate the benefits and risks of rehypothecation, we propose a derivative pricing framework with bilateral counterparty credit risk that determines the amount of rehypothecable collateral. We also model the realistic features of derivative trades: two different types of collateral, the time delay of collateral posting and the rating-dependent collateral agreement. We apply our pricing framework to cross currency swaps and investigate the impact of rehypothecation on the swap spreads. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The conceptualization is applied to a patent study of three leading companies in the lighting industry: General Electric, Osram/Siemens, and Philips. The study shows technology development patterns that are characterized by strong persistence, both within each path and across the whole technology field. These results demonstrate that multiple technological paths can co-exist in companies and industries, characterized by simultaneous long-term presence of several technologies. In such cases, path interaction takes place both between co-existing paths and when new, radically different paths are created. Although further studies are needed to identify the underlying self-reinforcing mechanisms, there is a clear indication that technological path dependency is not restricted to unitary progression patterns, as implied by previous conceptualizations.","[Bergek, Anna; Onufrey, Ksenia] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Bergek, Anna] Linkoping Univ, KITE Res Grp, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Onufrey, K (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",anna.bergek@liu.se; ksenia.onufrey@liu.se,"Bergek, Anna/A-3279-2009","Bergek, Anna/0000-0003-1952-902X",,,,,73,44,46,3,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Interactions between discounting and stress levels used in measure changes are accommodated by lowering discount rates for the higher stress levels. Acceptability parameters represent a maximal and minimal discount rate, a maximal stress level and the speed of rate reduction in response to stress. An explicit model relating credit default swap (CDS) prices to default probabilities is formulated with a view to making the default risk market acceptable. Data on CDS prices and default probabilities for the six major US banks obtained from the Risk Management Institute of the National University of Singapore is employed to estimate parameters defining acceptability and the movements in market implied recovery rates. We observe that the financial crisis saw an increase in the maximal discount rate and its spread over the minimal rate along with an increase in the maximal stress level being demanded for acceptability and a stable pattern for the speed of rate adjustment through the period. The maximal rate, rate spread and stress levels have come down but with periods in the interim where they have peaked as they did in the crisis. Recovery rates have oscillated and they did fall substantially but have recovered towards 40 percent near the end of the period. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

I will address in particular why take-up of affordable health insurance products in developing countries may be low despite their obvious benefits for the insurant. Without any doubt, (negative) attitudes toward the idea of health insurance are influenced by multiple factors and have their roots in financial, cultural, traditional, religious, cognitive, experiential, and other reasons. However, in this discussion article, I maintain that, in addition to these reasons, there are psychological causes explaining low insurance take-up that have so far been insufficiently considered in the literature and that have their roots in unfavorable decision-making patterns. Low take-up of health insurance can be partly explained by both a strong present bias when making decisions about the future, leading to difficulties to act in accordance with one's long-term interests, and the unreadiness to be part of a caring society of insurees when no direct benefit for the contributor or his close kin is immediately evident.

Despite its ubiquity, urban economic theory is rather silent on the formation of mixed land use. In particular, standard bid rent models typically predict complete segregation of land use. The two main exceptions are Fujita and Ogawa (1982) and Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg (2002), who introduce bid rent models that allow for endogenous business and residential location choice as well as employment agglomeration externalities. These models predict zones that are characterized by a restrictive type of mixed land use, where there are as many residents as jobs at every location. We extend the latter model by introducing a traffic congestion external effect that adds a degree of freedom to the shape of the bid rent curves, and allows them to coincide over contiguous locations in the city where commuting takes place. We show that this combination of congestion and agglomeration externalities leads to a general type of mixed land use zones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This institutional feature is also said to help overcome ministerial drift within coalition governments. While this literature has focused on the situation of an unconstrained environment of parliamentary government, the European Union's Member States continuously delegate policy competencies to Brussels, whose directives must in turn be transposed into national law to take effect. Because the minister in charge enjoys informational advantages and has the sole right to begin the process of implementing directives, he can completely control the agenda in this constrained environment. We evaluate the empirical implications of a ministerial gatekeeping model by investigating the (in)activities of 15 countries with respect to 2,756 EU directives adopted between December 1978 and November 2009. Our findings show that partisan ministerial approval is necessary to start the implementation process which conditions the counterbalancing response of parliaments. Accordingly, the delegation of policy competencies to the European Union changes the power relationship in parliamentary governments and increases the risk of partisan ministerial drift.","[Koenig, Thomas] Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Luig, Bernd] MZES, German Res Inst Publ Adm Speyer, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"König, T (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, POB 103462, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",koenig@uni-mannheim.de; bernd.luig@mzes.uni-mannheim.de,"Koenig, Thomas/AGG-0521-2022","Koenig, Thomas/0000-0002-1797-6662",,,,,98,5,6,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2014,160.0,3-4,,,,,501,519,,10.1007/s11127-013-0110-x,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AL7VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339344600012,0

We find that nearly 25% of households increased or decreased their cultivated land via short-term land tenancy arrangements. We use this pattern to motivate a model in which drought shocks induce the reallocation within communities of usufruct rights to land. We show how different liquidity constraints can lead some households to invest in crop production as others divest. Empirical analysis finds some support for the model but also highlights how pre-existing tenancy arrangements strongly determine a household's reliance on land tenancy markets for coping.

After relaxing the linear assumptions in the risk-return relationship by introducing a new approach that considers the current state of the market, we obtain significant evidence for a positive risk-return trade-off for low volatility states. However, this finding is reduced or even non-significant during periods of high volatility. Maintaining the linear assumption over the risk-return trade-off leads to non-significant estimations for all cases. These results are robust across countries despite the conditional volatility model used. These results also demonstrate that the inconclusive results in previous studies may be due to strong linear assumptions when modeling the risk-return trade-off.

However, an additional impact that is often omitted in PTAs evaluations is the possibility that the wedge between preferential and most favoured nation (MFN) tariffs may induce a preference rent that translates into larger prices for preferential exporters. This paper analyses empirically whether preferential exporters capture this preference rent using a unique dataset of imports in the European Union at a highly disaggregated level linked to information on the preferential regime used and the tariff applied. Our main findings suggest that on average an exporter obtains a larger price margin under a preferential regime than under MFN. However, this preference rent is only partially appropriated by exporters with a pass-through coefficient from preference to price margins that oscillates between 0.17 and 0.8, depending on the size of the margin and the type of product.","[Cirera, Xavier] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Cirera, Xavier] Univ Sussex, CARIS, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Cirera, X (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Lib Rd, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",xcirera@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,12,12,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Consequently, outsiders face lower adverse selection costs, which improves risk sharing and increases welfare. The drop in trading aggressiveness also causes market efficiency to decline. Furthermore, pretrade disclosure encourages excessive risk taking but may either encourage or discourage managerial effort.","US Secur & Exchange Commiss, Washington, DC 20549 USA",U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC),"Lenkey, SL (通讯作者)，US Secur & Exchange Commiss, 100 F St NE, Washington, DC 20549 USA.",lenkeys@sec.gov,"Mónika, Józon/AAD-7152-2021",,,,,,17,12,12,3,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

A tradition of religious education in northern Nigeria has been seen as an opportunity for expanding access to secular education. This paper demonstrates two constraining factors. First, unobserved household characteristics favoring religious education attendance are negatively correlated with secular school attendance. Second, the poor quality of secular education acts as a disincentive to secular school attendance. The findings cast doubts at policies aimed at increasing secular school enrollment through the integration of religious and secular school curricula. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Going-private firms do extensively restructure their portfolio of plants, selling and closing plants more quickly than others.

Apart from the factors representing perceived difficulties and potential litigation risks in buying back shares, and corporate governance and agency issues, we focus our attention on the undervaluation of share prices and the amount of cash holdings of the sample firms. The latter two factors turn out to be the primary drivers of the premiums paid. Our empirical evidence strongly suggests that the current phase of going-private transactions by U.S.-listed Chinese firms is most likely to be linked to arbitrage considerations, i.e., to arbitrage the undervalued share prices and the cash holdings available to the acquirers.

In this paper, I document how the liberalization of trade and agricultural policies in Guatemala has undermined the latter set of objectives, thereby compromising domestic food sovereignty and global food security. In particular, I demonstrate how neoliberal policies have undermined maize agriculture and contributed to the loss of crop genetic resources in the Guatemalan megacentre' of agricultural biodiversity. In its place, small-scale farmers have been encouraged to conform to the country's purported comparative advantage in non-traditional export crops.

My work is the first to investigate the labor supply patterns of behaviorally gay men using data that are representative of the entire behaviorally gay population. I show that ENDAs motivate behaviorally gay men to work roughly 15-20 h more per week and increase the probability that behaviorally gay men will supply any labor by approximately 7%.

Collectivization, the social structure distinguishable from the market or central planning agency, can be costly from overspending. In our analytical framework, the political order remains polycentric. The most widely acceptable institutional solution may be budgetary outlay sufficient to meet all demand, and especially when it is recognized that public criticism of market alternatives is often concentrated on moral goods, e.g., health care. The excess burden of collectivization, per se, is the excess of costs over benefits if the collectivity meets individual demand for the good beyond plausible efficiency levels. The costs of collectivization, per se, can be reduced by separated budgets, showing both revenue and outlay for individual budgetary line items, that bring collective spending decisions closer to the accompanying levy of taxes.","[Buchanan, James M.; Yoon, Yong J.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Buchanan, James M.; Yoon, Yong J.] George Mason Univ, Ctr Study Publ Choice, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University,"Buchanan, JM (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",jburgess@gmu.edu; yyoon@gmu.edu,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2014,159.0,3-4,,,,,321,326,,10.1007/s11127-013-0112-8,0.0,,,6,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AD3PD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333157200001,0

The supervisor exerts costly, unobservable effort to raise his inspection intensity, which leads to moral hazard. A non-compliant firm may exert effort in avoidance to reduce the probability of sanction. The regulatory framework is such that inspections may be announced or unannounced. Our analysis derives novel results about the response of monitoring and avoidance to changes in inspection policies, as well as conditions under which a regulator who maximizes compliance prefers unannounced to announced inspections. When the supervisor is corruptible, unannounced inspections are susceptible to a tip-off from the supervisor to the firm in exchange for a bribe. To eliminate bribery, the regulator may reduce the frequency of inspections. However, in an example, we show that eliminating tipping-off may lead to lower compliance unless the supervisor's wage is raised. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on Chinese firm-level data of more than 47,000 firms from 2000 to 2006, this paper investigates whether export spillover is localized in China. Drawing on the idea of revealed comparative advantage, six export spillover indicators are constructed to capture both the within- and between- provinces, cities as well as industries spillover effects. The multinomial logit model estimation results show that there is no sign of localized spillover effects despite the fact that domestic firms gain from export spillovers due to geographic and industrial agglomeration effects. This is especially true for those new entrants to export markets. The finding indicates that there may be export congestions resulting from over-agglomeration of local exporters due to the rapid export expansion in China.","[Bao, Qun; Shao, Min] Nankai Univ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Song, Ligang] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Nankai University; Australian National University,"Song, LG (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",baoqun@yeah.net,"shao, min/JUV-3554-2023","Song, Ligang/0000-0002-5700-2352",,,,,18,8,9,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper shows that applying distinct decision or social welfare criteria can result in different optimal policies of climate control, notably if climate change impacts are uncertain. First, decision criteria in current climate-economic studies are reviewed. Next, the most important alternatives are discussed, including their (mathematical) formalization and incorporation in economy-climate models. Most of these alternative criteria suggest more stringent climate policies to be optimal than the standard discounted utilitarianism approach. However, several important welfare criteria have not or hardly seen any application in the economic analysis of climate policy.

For students whose ACT is a decisive factor in their scholarship eligibility, reductions in college cost result in substitution away from two-year community colleges in favor of four-year institutions. This pattern is more prominent among lower income students, and treatment effects are limited to a very local window around the qualifying threshold. We find no evidence that the scholarship affects college-going at the eligibility margin, little to no evidence of substitution between in-state and out-of-state colleges, and no evidence of substitution between public and private universities. Even so, results demonstrate that merit aid encompassing the middle of the ability spectrum can improve the quality of colleges students choose to attend. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This paper integrates these two approaches by developing a new trade intensity index. This so called gravity model adjusted trade intensity (GMATI) index can reflect the short run trade barriers while controlling for the long run ones under global trade context. Based on 182 countries' export data during 1988-2005, we first estimate the expected bilateral trade level using a gravity model with comparative advantage effects. Then we apply the GMATI index for China. While the conventional trade intensity index shows that China trades less than its expected level, our GMATI index nevertheless suggests the opposite in most cases. It indicates that after considering the effect of country characteristics such as distance, economic size and comparative advantage, China's world trade face less trade barriers than the world average level.","[Chen, Bo] SHUFE, Sch Int Business Adm, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Yao] UESTC, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，UESTC, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hi Tech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",liyao@uestc.edu.cn,,,,,,,32,9,9,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This also leads their investors to face higher takeover risk, a systematic risk associated with economic fundamentals that drive takeover waves, as proposed by Cremers et al. (2009). Indeed, we find that repurchasing firms tend to face higher takeover probability in the first few years following their OMR announcements, and that the increase in takeover risk can largely explain their post-announcement long-run abnormal returns documented in the literature. The increase in takeover risk is larger for smaller firms, firms with poorer pre-announcement stock performance, and those attracting more attention of market participants.

Analogous structures and trends continue to be influential in Malaysia's contemporary commercial agricultural sector. Initially, the politics and organization of the East India Company and the pursuit of tropical commodities corresponded with the facilitation and channelling of Indian migrant labour for coffee and sugar cultivation in Malaya. The subsequent development of the rubber industry represented the first major transition to more highly capitalized large-scale farming for international markets. In the 1990s, oil palm replaced rubber as the premier crop in a second agrarian transition, consistent with Malaysia's economic and political imperatives, social policy and the global demand for palm oil. There are important continuities in the rubber and oil palm agricultural transitions. These include comparable plantation structures, labour systems and a continuing reliance on migrant labour, despite the growth of the national labour force. The correlation between plantation systems and Malaysia's foreign labour policy should be viewed through the prism of challenges to large-scale agricultural production and countervailing forces that might be acting on the Malaysian state.","Univ New England, UNE Sch Business, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",University of New England,"Kaur, A (通讯作者)，Univ New England, UNE Sch Business, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",akaur@une.edu.au,,,,,,,69,26,28,3,42,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In particular, we find that the level of financial development is beneficial to growth only up to a certain threshold; beyond the threshold level further development of finance tends to adversely affect growth.

As a consequence, bad rainy seasons have a massive impact on crop yield and regularly result in food crises. Traditional insurance policies based on crop damage assessment are not available because of asymmetric information and high transaction costs compared to the value of production. We assess the risk mitigation capacity of an alternative form of insurance which has been implemented at a large scale in India since 2003: insurance based on a weather index. We compare the efficiency of various weather indices to increase the expected utility of a representative risk-averse farmer. We show the importance of using plot-level yield data rather than village averages, which bias results due to the presence of idiosyncratic shocks. We also illustrate the need for out-of-sample estimations in order to avoid overfitting. Even with the appropriate index and assuming substantial risk aversion, we find a limited gain of implementing insurance, which roughly corresponds to, or slightly exceeds, the cost observed in India for implementing such insurance policies. However, when we separately treat the plots with and without fertilisers separately, we see that the benefit of insurance is slightly higher in the former case. This suggests that insurance policies may slightly increase the use of risk-increasing inputs such as fertilisers and improved cultivars, and hence improve average yields, which remain very low in the region.","[Leblois, Antoine] CIRED, Paris, France; [Quirion, Philippe] CIRED, LMD, Paris, France; [Alhassane, Agali; Traore, Seydou] CRA, Niamey, Niger",Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech,"Leblois, A (通讯作者)，CIRED, Paris, France.",leblois@centre-cired.fr,"Quirion, Philippe/E-9686-2011; leblois, antoine/F-3827-2014","Quirion, Philippe/0000-0003-4066-2984; leblois, antoine/0000-0003-0504-884X",,,,,45,35,40,1,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

After ascertaining a significant worsening of ratings after the crisis, the paper hypothesises the possibility that this worsening is due not exclusively to a deterioration in the banks' credit quality, but also to a change in the behaviour of the rating agencies. The study designs a methodology to separate the observed change in ratings into two multiplicative components: one associated with the deterioration of the banks' solvency itself and another associated with the change in the agencies' valuation criteria. The methodology is applied to the Spanish Banking System during the period 2000-2009. The results obtained show that the observed lowering of ratings (10.88%) is explained (75%) by the deterioration in the solvency of the banks, but also (25%) by the hardening of the valuation criteria adopted by the agencies. This shows the procyclical character of ratings. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the presence of nonfinancial firms as significant shareholders reduces financial constraints, probably because such block-holders are able to reduce asymmetric information problems that are at the origin of financial constraints.

We also examine how this relationship might be moderated by underlying cultural values. Our main thesis is that the positive effects of resource munificence of proximate institutions on early-stage entrepreneurial activity should be attenuated in countries with a more hierarchical and conservative culture.

We show, through a Monte Carlo study, that using intraday jump tests and a coexceedance criterion to detect cojumps has a power similar to the cojump test proposed by Bollerslev et al. (2008). However, we also show that we should not expect to detect all common jumps comprising a cojump when using such coexceedance based detection methods. Empirically, we provide evidence of an association between jumps in the market portfolio and cojumps in the underlying stocks. Consistent with our Monte Carlo evidence, moderate numbers of stocks are often detected to be involved in these (systematic) cojumps. Importantly, the results suggest that market-level news is able to generate simultaneous large jumps in individual stocks.

Historical and institutional factors, and particularly the informal internal dynamics that influence policy, require a depth of understanding that is often best investigated through such interview methods. At the federal level in Canada we see many trends that point to the increasing centralization and control of government information. There has been political interference in Access to Information Requests; the outcomes of scientific research have been suppressed; and media access to politicians has become highly constrained. This led us to ask whether tightening controls on information have also affected access to research interviews with government officials.

The analysis makes it possible to spell out a tight connection between the behaviour of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and the corresponding perfect foresight model.

It discerns the impacts of both scheduled and unscheduled news announcements and structural changes on changing persistence. The results show little evidence of long memory in the conditional mean but provide strong support for long memory in conditional volatility for the four Saudi exchange rates versus major currencies. Moreover, scheduled news announcements have no significant impact on both expectations and volatility, while unscheduled news announcements demonstrate significant effects on the conditional volatility for all exchange rates. Furthermore, we detect at least five structural changes for the exchange rate with the yen and four for the rest of the exchange rates. The structural breaks seem to have greater impacts on changing persistence, and that the ARFIMA FIGARCH model coupled with the dummy variables of the unscheduled news announcements and the structural changes is the most suitable for examining the long memory processes of these foreign exchange markets in in-sample. Finally, the out-of-sample forecasts provide mixed results and indicate that none of the specifications of the volatility model is appropriate for analyzing the LM dynamics in the Saudi Arabian exchange market. Overall, our results have implications for portfolio managers and policy makers in oil-producing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, we show why such a process is likely to be especially strong after a prolonged expansion based on the growth of consumer credit and endogenously low risk premia. Hence, our model offers a new perspective on the links between the real and financial sectors, and we show how it can help make sense of several macro-economic features of the 2001-09 period.

Using a combination of fixed effects and matching, we find that both process and product innovation support increased employment and wages, with a higher impact on employment. In addition, we find that product innovation support had a larger effect on wages than process innovation support.","[Castillo, Victoria] Minist Labor Employment & Social Secur, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Maffioli, Alessandro] Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Rojo, Sofia] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Unit Investment & Corp Strategies, Santiago, Chile; [Stucchi, Rodolfo] Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, Santiago, Chile",Inter-American Development Bank,"Maffioli, A (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",vcastill@trabajo.gob.ar; alessandrom@iadb.org; ana.rojo@cepal.org; rstucchi@iadb.org,,"Maffioli, Alessandro/0000-0003-1576-1817; Stucchi, Rodolfo/0000-0002-6317-9461",,,,,32,25,29,7,65,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We show that banks that relied more heavily on wholesale funding contracted lending more severely than banks that relied more on insured deposits. We then examine the effects of loan contraction on the financial positions of publicly traded firms. We find that both during and after the crisis, the change in leverage of bank-dependent firms is less than that of firms with access to public debt markets. In addition, bank-dependent firms rely more on cash than net equity issuance to finance operations. We also find that firms with established bank lending relationships weather the crisis better. Such firms are able to attain higher levels of leverage during the crisis, add to their cash holdings, secure new bank credit, and achieve higher profitability as a result. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using Japanese manufacturing data from 1975 to 2006, the analysis shows that the multiple-cone model fits well with the flying geese patterns of Japanese industrial development. The result suggests that part of the industrial upgrading can be explained by the multiple-cone HO model. This also implies that an underlying mechanism of macroeconomic growth is industrial upgrading, part of which can be attributed to capital accumulation.","Keio Univ, Keio Econ Observ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Kiyota, K (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Keio Econ Observ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",kiyota@sanken.keio.ac.jp,,"Kiyota, Kozo/0000-0001-7649-9870","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730201, 22243023] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,34,4,4,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Real asset illiquidity increases the cost of capital more for firms that face more competition, have less access to external capital, or are closer to default, and for those facing negative demand shocks. The effect of real asset illiquidity is distinct from that of firms' stock illiquidity or systematic liquidity risk.

Arnhem Nijmegen City Region, a regional planning body, in the Netherlands, aims to promote sustainable development in their region and control the current pattern of increased use of cars vis-a-vis transit for longer commutes. Planning for TOD can help achieve this aim. It is believed that measuring the existing levels of TOD is a prerequisite for TOD planning and that it can be done using a TOD Index proposed in this research. A TOD Index measures multiple spatial indicators and aggregates them under the SMCA framework to arrive at a comprehensive value depicting the existing levels of TOD at a location or an area. Using this TOD Index, TOD levels were measured over the entire City Region covering approx. 1000 km(2). High levels of TOD imply that the urban development's characteristics, at that location, are ripe for use of transit and these high levels, as expected, were found in the urban areas of Arnhem and Nijmegen. From the results of TOD Index measurement, using hot-spot analysis, those locations were identified that have high TOD levels but poor transit connectivity. These locations are accordingly recommended for better transit connectivity. As a part of our future work, it is intended to use the TOD Index to elevate TOD levels around existing transit nodes.

Until recently however, the scientific and donor community often give less attention to research on traditional vegetable crop value chains. The resurgence of traditional vegetables' importance in human nutrition is accompanied by a need to understand the interactions among various actors in their value chain to determine ways to add value to produce and improve marketing efficiency. Based on a multistage cross-sectional survey of 240 respondents in Malawi and Mozambique, this study employed participatory evaluation and market research to identify potential outlets and target crops, and define value chain processes, including choice of market outlets and mode of farmer-buyer linkages. Traditional vegetable sales contributed about 35% and 30% of smallholders' income in Malawi and Mozambique respectively. Linkages between value chain actors were found to be weak; mostly based on spot market transactions, except for those between retailers and supermarkets, which were based on relationship marketing.","[Chagomoka, Takemore] AVRDC, World Vegetable Ctr, Liaison Off Cameroon, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Chagomoka, Takemore] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Afari-Sefa, Victor] AVRDC, World Vegetable Ctr, Arusha, Tanzania; [Pitoro, Raul] Natl Inst Agr Res, Ctr Socioecon Studies CESE, Maputo, Mozambique; [Pitoro, Raul] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA",University of Freiburg; Michigan State University,"Chagomoka, T (通讯作者)，AVRDC, World Vegetable Ctr, Liaison Off Cameroon, C IITA POB 2008, Yaounde, Cameroon.",takemore.chagomoka@geographie.uni-freiburg.de; victor.afari-sefa@worldveg.org; pitorora@msu.edu,"HASSAN, MAHMOOD UL/M-6239-2019; Athar, HR/B-8717-2008","HASSAN, MAHMOOD UL/0000-0003-2889-0263; Athar, HR/0000-0002-8733-3865",Sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Program (SSA CP); Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA),Sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Program (SSA CP); Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA),"The authors wish to acknowledge the excellent editing and proof reading of this paper by Ms. Maureen Mecozzi, Head of Communications and Information of AVRDC - The World Vegetable Center, Taiwan.

We attempt to highlight various characteristics of the enforcement of corporate governance rules in the everyday practice of corporations. We identify idiosyncratic factors pertaining in the Greek market that present interesting features in the global context. On average firms comply with internationally accepted Corporate Governance Codes, as they have been adopted in Greece by the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises (SEV), even though the number of firms that gradually develop their own Corporate Governance Codes is increasing. Greek firms appear to have surprisingly- low percentages of CEO - Chairman of Board duality phenomena. On the other hand, in relation with other corporate governance best practices, we find the relative absence of committees other than the Audit Committee, which is compulsory, while the majority of firms are directed by small Boards of fewer than eight members. On the negative side we also document low presence of women in Boards and a high percentage of main stock holder family members on companies' Boards. When examining the distribution between executive and non-executive members in Boards it is found that the majority of Boards consist of executive and non-executive members, whereas independent non-executive members are constrained within the limits set by Greek corporate governance legislation. Our analysis further highlights that even though corporate governance implementation has been introduced to the local market for only approximately ten years, firms and authorities tend to be relatively strict relative to the level of conformity with internationally accepted corporate governance legislation.

In this context, the institutions of higher education try to create and form their trainings to build on international relations. Nevertheless, in this they can only be effective in cooperation with the cities and there are some cities which have recognized the advantages of this process, for example, Pecs, the centre of the Transdanubian region in Hungary, along the border with Croatia. The university has a significant role in the life of the city and it can be a major factor in the development of the new function of the former industrial city.

It will have some guidance and reference for the work of estimating the value of modern cultural artwork in developing Chinese cultural industry.","[Deng, Kai; Zhang, Chang-jun; Wang, Xiao-yan] Hubei Univ Med, Renmin Hosp, Reprod Med Ctr, Shiyan 442000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiao-yan] Hubei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Dept Clin Oncol, Shiyan 442000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jian-guo; Liu, Qi-zhi] Hubei Univ Med, Ctr Hlth Adm & Dev Studies, Shiyan 442000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jian-qiang] Beijing Sports Int Econ Conf Serv Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chen-xi] China Womens Univ, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Medicine; Hubei University of Medicine; Hubei University of Medicine,"Wang, XY (通讯作者)，Hubei Univ Med, Renmin Hosp, Reprod Med Ctr, Shiyan 442000, Peoples R China.",dkeanig@163.com,"Li, Ye/JBS-2949-2023; wang, chenxi/HMD-9902-2023",,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-188-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,298,303,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3SZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351923900048,0

Resilience seems to be the answer to a wide range of problems and threats, and therefore garners the attention of policymakers and researchers from different fields and disciplines. As a result, there seems to be a desire to build a holistic, all-encompassing model of resilience that explains which factors contribute to a society's reliable and safe functioning. Nevertheless, the concept remains subject to debate and diverging interpretations. In this paper we argue for the adoption of a social constructivist perspective on resilience management. Taking into account the influence of processes of sensemaking and framing by stakeholders involved in addressing resilience matters, it would be useful to design a reflexive management process that guides policymakers or other actors through the steps of defining and identifying both what the critical components of the system are to them, as well as understanding which factors they can influence to strengthen the resilience property of the system.

This paper explores a perspective that has previously been neglected: the political economy of the agricultural statistics. In developing economies, the data on agricultural production are weak. Because these data are assembled using competing methods and assumptions, the final series are subject to political pressure, particularly when the government is subsidizing agricultural inputs. This paper draws on debates on the evidence of a Green Revolution in India and the arguments on the effect of withdrawing fertilizer subsidies during structural adjustment in Nigeria, and finally the paper presents new data on the effect of crop data subsidies in Malawi.

The EU economy lags behind its own development goals as well as, behind the results achieved by its economic partners and competitors - USA and Japan. Due to lower competitiveness in the international market environment, the persisting or even expanding problems on the domestic labor markets are evident. Many EU countries demonstrate relatively high unemployment which leads to weakening the income situation of households and strengthening the social tension in society. Particularly worrying is situation of young graduates and also people approaching retirement age and seniors. In context of such arguments, the strategy for perspective development of the EU - the strategic document Europe2020 - has been proposed. Its key objective is to strengthen the economic competitiveness of the European Union, its member countries and particularly the competitiveness of its firms. It is expected that the Europe 2020 objectives will create favorable environment for reducing the social tension across the EU countries and finally lead to the better life of majority of its citizens.

Many previous studies showed that the impact of bank regulations on bank risks is depended on each bank's ownership structure. Banks with more powerful owners tend take greater risks. The measurement and evaluation the ownership concentration in the structure of the real joint-stock commercial banks will provide useful information for the government in making policies and restructuring the banking system. There are two major issues to analyze the ownership structure and the controlling power of the ultimate ownerships in the real joint-stock commercial banks: the lack of sufficient information and the excessive complexity of the ownership structures. This paper introduces an approach method to estimate the controlling power of the ultimate ownerships in joint-stock commercial banks in Vietnam based on calculating and updating the Banzhaf Index with the best available information in a real joint-stock commercial bank.

The concept of innovation capital draws attention of scholars and practitioners, because the ability to innovate is a key driver of a firm's performance and growth in the knowledge-based economy. The accumulation of innovation capital is a particular challenge in a knowledge intensive industry such as biotechnology which is under high pressure to produce new commercial products and processes. Nevertheless, numerous biotechnology firms fail in their attempts to bring on innovations, since the research and development activities are considered to be high-risky in this sector. To address the constraints in their internal innovation capabilities, the firms engage in inter organizational R&D collaboration resulting in co-ownership of intellectual property rights. The aim of this study is twofold. Firstly, an attempt is made to analyze theoretically the relationship between innovation capabilities and the firm's market value. Secondly, an investigation of this relationship is conducted, using a sample of 32 UE biotechnology firms. The panel data have been obtained from EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard and European Patent Register. This study utilizes R&D and patent stocks as the accurate proxies of innovation capital. In order to measure the R&D and patent stocks I have used a perpetual inventory methodology in its additive formulation. In case of patenting activity, I have included the co-patent counts in the market valuation equation to address the role of open innovation paradigm in explaining firms' financial performance. Moreover, multiple linear regression has been applied to find the answer to the research question. The main findings of the study reveal that there are positive relationships between the firm's innovation capital elements and the market value. Particularly, the results show that R&D stock and the solitary-owned patent stock have the linear and positive relationships with the market value, while the co-owned patent stock exhibits increasing marginal value.","Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Econ & Management, Lublin, Poland",University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Kijek, T (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Econ & Management, Lublin, Poland.",tomasz.kijek@up.lublin.pl,"Kijek, Tomasz/U-2584-2018","Kijek, Tomasz/0000-0002-0134-4943",,,,,47,1,1,0,16,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,78,84,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000010,0

After analyzing the internal relationship between innovation and venture capital, this paper located the path and mechanism for venture capital work on innovation. The reason for venture capital not other traditional financers promoting innovation is that venture capital has a set of unique operating mechanism, under which agent problems and moral hazard resulting from asymmetric information can be resolved efficiently. Under this mechanism, venture capital operates successfully and promotes innovative activities by ways of providing funds, setting up suitable organization and channeling information.","[Meng, Fan-hua] North China Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Sanhe, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qing-fa] North China Inst Sci & Technol, Financial Dept, Sanhe, Hebei, Peoples R China",North China Institute Science & Technology; North China Institute Science & Technology,"Meng, FH (通讯作者)，North China Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Sanhe, Hebei, Peoples R China.",mfhua818@sina.com; qfchen@ncist.edu.cn,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,15,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-188-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,33,37,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3SZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351923900006,0

Ability of exchange rates to transmit external (price) shocks to the national economy represents one of the most discussed areas relating to the current stage of the monetary integration in the European single market. The problem is even more crucial when examining crisis related redistributive effects. In the paper we analyse exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices in the European transition economies. We estimate VAR model to investigate (1) responsiveness of exchange rate to the exogenous price shock to examine the dynamics (volatility) in the exchange rate leading path followed by the unexpected oil price shock and (2) effect of the unexpected exchange rate shift to consumer prices to examine its distribution to the internal pricing chain.

Heavily affected communities were paralyzed for months following these large seismic events. The recovery process is estimated to last from several years to few decades. As a result, increased attention is being placed on strategies to design facilities that are both safe and damage resistant. It is often presumed that such an approach increases costs to an unacceptable level. The study reported herein compares the repair costs and repair times considering two designs for a typical three-story steel building: conventional fixed-base and damage resistant base-isolated moment resisting frame system. Performance-based earthquake evaluation tools are used to estimate repair costs and times for five different hazard levels considering two occupancy types critical for recovery: healthcare and school. The buildings are located in a seismic region in western North America. It is shown that using seismic isolation to enhance damage resistance results in significantly smaller repair cost, repair time, and improved resilience for the base-isolated alternative compared to a conventional fixed-base design.

The main goal is to show that economic diplomacy can contribute to national security policy as a secondary factor, since the armed forces are a major player. This is effectuated by raising security levels and improving the state's power, without causing any security dilemmas. In order to prove this point, we have used the following indicators that can lead to a secure outcome. First and foremost, we have used the political economy of Greek and Turkish security policy as a tool, by analyzing and contrasting indicators such as the Greek geopolitical and geostrategic environment, bilateral economic diplomacy (Greece and Turkey) and secondly, by contrasting military spending on both sides and the number of Turkish violations of Greek Airspace and Territorial Waters. By focusing on that field, we conclude that Turkish disputation over Greek sovereignty has reduced, although it has not been totally eliminated, and consequently Greece feels less insecure and as a result, and much more deterrence can be achieved by the Greek side. Summarizing, when there is strong economic activity between two countries national security is enhanced for both sides, unless the power of the one overcomes the status quo. (C) 2014 The Authors.

As a result, the overall economic value of R& D to society often exceeds the economic benefits enjoyed by the innovators as a result of their efforts. Economists describe this phenomena as a positive externality or spillover (Jaffe, 1996) (European Commission, 2005) (Cohen & Levinthal, 2000) (Richard Gray and Stavroula Malla, 2007). Similarly, one can say that the intended results of specific innovation programs directed at SME are usually complemented by results that were not specifically aimed at. The first type of results, which are the specified objectives of the program, are called direct impacts, and the second type of results are called the indirect impacts of the innovation program. This paper identifies and analyses the indirect impacts of an innovation program, implemented and financed by the Portuguese state under the aegis of the 6th Portuguese Framework Program, and directed at SMEs. The program, called NITEC, aimed to foster and support the creation of R& D structures inside SMEs, by providing financial support to hire research personnel and acquire research equipment. This program was conceived to address a key problem in the National Innovation System (NIS) in Portugal: the low level of in-house technology and innovation capabilities in Portuguese firms. This specific program was selected because of its features: 1) the funds are governmental; 2) promotes activities related to R& D; 3) the people involved are expert in the working and research area; 4) the project-base has a limited period of time (maximum five years); 5) each company has its own project. These features are essential to identify knowledge acquisition in the firms which participated in the program, as a main topic being evaluated in the results.","[Silva, Dorotea; Romero, Fernando] Univ Minho, Dept Ind Engn, Braga, Portugal; [Silva, Dorotea] Univ Minho, Azurem, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Silva, D (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Ind Engn, Braga, Portugal.",id3496@alunos.uminho.pt,"Silva, Dorotea/D-4902-2018; Romero, Fernando/M-7976-2014; Vieira, Filipa D/M-5093-2013","Silva, Dorotea/0000-0002-8445-3634; Romero, Fernando/0000-0002-7540-8540;",,,,,23,0,0,0,1,UNIV MINHO,GUIMARAES,"CAMPUS AZUREM, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL",2183-3974,,978-989-97050-3-6,ICOPEV INT C PROJ EC,,,2014,,,,,,,289,295,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI3DS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410764700031,0

There is increasing demand for understanding this at the community scale. The paper builds on integrative research case studies of hazard management and community resilience (CR)-building projects in the North of England and Northern Italy. It links inter- and trans-disciplinary methodologies to map stakeholders' knowledge and combine this with the best available data for disaster resilience planning, involving, for example, understanding baseline resilience and what indicators or might be used for measuring CR? Some components of CR are particularly critical, for example the functioning of social networks in contexts of disaster planning and response, and require specially designed methods. Social network analysis (SNA) has recently become used more widely in resilience research and can be compared with another complementary method, involving qualitative, participatory social network mapping (P-SNA) allowing inclusion of stakeholders in understanding their own disaster resilience planning and response. We share insights from this work: discussing drivers, barriers, governance and adaptation using networks. We also discuss how this data can be used for development of scenarios and agent-based models (ABMs) resulting in effect in participatory ABMs (P-ABM). These models can then underpin assessments of future scenarios, providing better understanding of the potential effects of natural hazards in the context of changes in resilience or vulnerability. The paper discusses recent experience using these participatory methodologies, explores stakeholders' competing ideas of vulnerability and resilience, and shows how the modelling process allow those same stakeholders to play with the idea of community resilience and what it would mean to them and their communities.

In Spain, the current economic crisis and a number of well-known corporate accounting scandals have intensified widespread concern for accounting ethics issues. However, despite their importance, specific courses and modules on accounting ethics are not common in Spanish universities. Furthermore, even in such scarce cases where these courses are taught, there is very little consensus on their objectives and methodologies. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether differences exist between the perceptions from students who have previously taken business ethics courses and the perceptions from students who have previously taken business ethics courses and those from students who have not taken these courses. This study was conducted through a survey delivered to 551 students of the Bachelor of Business Administration at the Technical University of Valencia in Spain.

Energy Management is described in the literature as reasonable and effective energy use for profit maximization (cost minimisation) and for improving the competitive position. Other sources introduce it as the set of tools and measures for conscious energy acting with the use of energy-economical potential in each of the business areas. But, no reference to process management, only the technical and environmental recommendations for energy consumption decreasing can be found there. The articles' conclusion comes from the part of thesis Energy processes management in production companies using Key Performance Indicators according to sampled methods from Performance Measurement system and it compares its own research results with the research results made by other authors in the past. The results are listed in 57 Czech production plants, in all and the selective group was 757 companies (criteria: energy departments existing in the company and energy management is available). The next data source was the case study made in 12 big industrial plants, energy managers were interviewed. The energy area in production companies is one of the key parts for ensuring the unchallenged production. The actual situation in the energy sector is not stable due to the different goals of the European Union and Czech energy conceptions. One of the key reasons for the use of process management and comprehensive performance measurement system in the energy area is the energy resources price raises influencing companies' needs for a quick reaction. Not all the production plants are prepared to deal with this problem because of missing process description, one track aimed specialist, missing professionals looking for new technologies and others. Unfortunately, due to the complexity and professional severity, not all the controllers and financial managers understand what is behind the costs rising from the energy area which is mostly functionally managed and are not able to generate pressure on this area for cost savings. As was found during the research, the energy processes are not described, managed and comprehensively measured. A lot of duplicated activities can be found in this field. Even if the whole company is declaring that it is using or implementing the Process Management system, energy areas are not touched and act only like a reporting party and as was mentioned above, functionally managed. The same situation can be found if we look at the usage or disuse of Performance Measurement system and method. Key Performance Indicators are missing or based on strictly physical units, such as the temperature, energy power, pressure, etc. Our article includes findings concerning nonexistent conception, manual and methodological procedure descriptions regarding energy processes for comprehensive and appropriate process management and performance measurement too.

We then consider some potential wider benefits from the introduction of a comprehensive system that could be highlighted to justify the cost of development and implementation as well as to improve public and political acceptability. The paper end S with conclusions and future research directions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Under the democratic ethic, individuals receive equal weighting and the global distribution of hungry people is irrelevant. Inequality aversion deliberately prefers equal levels of hunger across countries.

A standardized and straightforward risk assessment methodology is needed for public authorities in moderate seismic / high vulnerability areas to assess the potential seismic risks and to make corresponding structural strengthening plans for protecting properties and people's lives. Adopting the standardized seismic loss assessment tool HAZUS, this study aims to present the methodology for investigating the economic feasibility of the pre-earthquake structural strengthening of buildings by means of benefit-cost analysis. Therefore, the specific objectives of this study are to: (1) to assess the seismic risks with building and demography parameters which can fully represent the characteristic of local built environment, (2) to conduct benefit-cost analysis of the seismic mitigation activities, and (3) to verify the applicability of the present methodology by a case study. To assess risk from earthquake hazards, both deterministic and probabilistic earthquake scenarios were simulated, combined with micro-zoning studies, geological characteristics, building inventories, population distribution, and adaptation of the building fragility curves and casualty matrix to the local conditions. This study intends to provide public decision makers a standardized methodology for justifying the economic feasibility of seismic risk mitigation alternatives so that a cost-efficient public earthquake mitigation strategy can be achieved.

J,"Wen, Y",,,,"Wen, Yi",,,When and How To Exit Quantitative Easing?,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The essence of quantitative easing (QE) is reducing the cost of private borrowing through large-scale purchases of privately issued debt instead of public debt (Bernanke, 2009). Considering the economy has drastically recovered, it is time to consider how exiting from these private asset purchases will affect the economy. In a standard economic model, if monetary injections can increase aggregate output and employment, then the reverse action may undo such effects. But does this imply that the U.S. economy will dive into another recession once the Fed starts its large-scale asset sales (under the assumption that QE has successfully pulled the economy out of the Great Recession)? This article studies the likely impact of QE and its exit strategy on the economy. In particular, it shows that three aspects of the Federal Reserve's exit strategy are important in achieving (or maintaining) maximum gains (if any) in aggregate output and employment under QE: (i) the timing of the exit, (ii) the pace of the exit, and (iii) the private sector's expectations of when and how the Fed will exit.

In 2014, it is expected to develop a proposal of making non-taxable minimum progressive. Another possible scenario of implementation of the progressivity is introduction of a higher rate income tax band. Using the European Union tax-benefit microsimulation model (EUROMOD), and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey microdata, this paper identifies the impact of the proposed and alternative socioeconomic reforms on changes in work incentives in Latvia. In particular, this paper aims at the role of Personal Income Tax and basic allowance in influencing Marginal Effective Tax Rates assessed using various scenarios of hypothetical policy changes. Results show that the tax reform implemented since 2014 has a relatively weak impact on the work incentives of Latvians. Making PIT rate progressive that includes reduced standard tax rate results in the increase of the work incentives. The tax reform of making basic allowance progressive proposed by the Ministry of Finance does not virtually affects the work incentives of whole population, and mainly results in increased work incentives of middle-income earners.","Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Zdanovica, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",anna.zhdanovich@inbox.lv,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,465,476,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500044,0

However, ensuring the success of implementing such projects in a post-disaster setting requires investigation into the social considerations of temporary housing. This research takes a qualitative approach, focusing particularly on case studies of temporary housing experiences following the Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Christchurch Earthquake in 2011 and a field study of 2009 Black Saturday bushfire-affected communities in Victoria, Australia. Key social factors found to be significant to the success of shipping container temporary housing projects relate to flexibility in ownership, reuse and siting arrangement, in addition to robust pre-disaster planning by authorities, taking into account the varying characteristics of different types of disasters.

The research was to examine the impact of tolerance of ambiguity on perceived vulnerability and purchase intention under ambiguous product harm crises on the one hand and to examine the mediating effect of perceived vulnerability and the moderating effect of brand visibility on the other. Study one and study two utilized experimental methods under two different imaginary scenarios of fictitious product harm crises. Study three used empirical method in order to enhance the external validity of this research. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling etc. were utilized to analyze data. The results indicate tolerance of ambiguity positively impacts purchase intention on the one hand and negatively affects consumer perceived vulnerability on the other. Perceived vulnerability mediates the effect of tolerance of ambiguity on purchase intention, and at the same time perceived vulnerability negatively affects purchase intention. Study two was conducted under imaginary scenario of fictitious automobile harm crisis. The results further confirm those of study one. Results of study two also indicate brand visibility moderates the relationship between tolerance of ambiguity and purchase intention and also between tolerance of ambiguity and perceived vulnerability.

We unify the traditional approaches to testing for external sustainability considering the stock-flow system created by the variables representing the external relationships of an open economy. External sustainability is tested using several types of cointegration and multicointegration tests. The results obtained point to weak sustainability in the flows analysis, whereas some degree of strong sustainability is found for up to six countries in the stock-flow approach. Among these countries we find both non-European economies, such as Japan and New Zealand, and Euro-area members, especially those with more restricted access to financing in the international markets.

Indeed, due to the special structure of the balance sheet of a bank and to the interconnections with other institutions of the financial system, the standard pricing formulas do not apply and their use can imply severe mispricing. The pricing of credit derivatives written on a single bank name requires a joint analysis of the risks of all banks directly or indirectly interconnected with the bank of interest. Each name cannot be priced in isolation, but the banking system must be treated as a whole. It is necessary to analyze the contagion of losses among banks, especially the equilibrium of joint defaults and recovery rates at liquidation time. We show the existence and uniqueness of such an equilibrium. Then the standard pricing formulas are modified by adding a premium to capture the contagion effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we generalize the MixN-GARCH model by relaxing the assumption of constant mixing weights. Two different specifications with time-varying mixing weights are considered. In particular, by relating current weights to past returns and realized (component-wise) likelihood values, an empirically reasonable representation of Engle and Ng's (1993) news impact curve with an asymmetric impact of unexpected return shocks on future volatility is obtained. An empirical out-of-sample study confirms the usefulness of the new approach and gives evidence that the leverage effect in financial returns data is closely connected, in a non-linear fashion, to the time-varying interplay of mixture components representing, for example, various groups of market participants.

Canada is commonly seen to have resisted this trend. This view overlooks, however, that exclusion can come in different forms. In addition to direct formal exclusion from welfare programs, immigrants can also have more limited access because of indirect or informal mechanisms of differentiation. Reviewing five core welfare programs, this paper shows that direct, indirect, and informal types of exclusion exist in the Canadian welfare state, albeit with different consequences for different categories of newcomers. While this conclusion is not meant to suggest that immigrants face as much exclusion as they do in some other Western countries, it does demonstrate the need to avoid the complacency regarding immigrants' social rights in Canada.","[Koning, Edward A.] Univ Guelph, Dept Polit Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Banting, Keith G.] Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Banting, Keith G.] Queens Univ, Dept Polit Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada",University of Guelph; Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada,"Koning, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Polit Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",,,,,,,,44,19,20,0,15,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Moreover, we document that foreign institutional investors' momentum behavior is influenced (anchored) by prior foreign ownership (anchor). We also show that foreign investors' momentum behavior is strengthened when prior foreign ownership is high. However, the anchoring effect cannot improve momentum profitability.

Recently, the sample populations of these studies have expanded to include developing country currencies. The majority of these findings have been that forward rate biasedness is more pronounced for developed country currencies than it is for developing country currencies. One such paper (Frankel and Poonawala, 2010) has further suggested that this phenomenon may contradict Risk Premium Theory since developing country currencies are relatively more volatile. Our analysis first replicates the results of Frankel and Poonawala and then extends the study out of sample using an updated composition of currency classifications. The results of this extended period of analysis show that forward rate biasedness is less pronounced for developed country currencies than for developing country currencies and consequently does not establish grounds to challenge Risk Premium Theory. Furthermore, our results are consistent with another branch of literature which suggests that conflicting FRUH test results may be particular to the time period examined. It is therefore possible to speculate that period-specific factors were responsible for the results found in previous research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Historically transit equity has not considered in planning or has been an afterthought in the process; leading to the underutilization of transit and encouraging travelers to be auto dependent. In this paper, the authors propose a methodology to estimate transit equity using a number of attributes such as frequency, speed, capacity, and built environment in a multi-modal transit network. We propose a methodology to measure transit equity from a graph theoretical approach for all levels of transit service coverage integrating routes, schedules, socio-economic, demographic and spatial activity patterns. The objective of using equity is to quantify and evaluate transit service in terms of prioritizing transit locations for funding; conforming with federal regulations; providing service delivery strategies, especially for areas with large multi-jurisdictional, multi-modal transit networks; providing an indicator of multi-level transit capacity for planning purposes and assessing the effectiveness and efficiency for node/stop prioritization while choosing transit as a mode of travel. The methodology uses a stylized connectivity measure with a Gini index for equity estimation at different levels such as stop, line, zone and area. An example problem is presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology. The approach is then applied to the Washington-Baltimore region in the United States. The results show the existing transit service coverage at different locations. The proposed approach can be utilized as a tool for transit service planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we explore the countries' incentives to free-ride on agreements, find stable coalitions where free-riding is deterred, and propose alternative ways of designing stable agreements that would reduce eutrophication in the sea. We conclude that strong free-riding incentives for some countries preclude the socially optimal solution in the absence of an enforcing authority. A stable agreement can, however, be formed with some loss in efficiency. The research shows that a treaty with modest abatement targets between all the littoral countries would be more efficient than a coalition between fewer countries but with more ambitious targets. We compare the two international institutions involved in the protection of the Baltic Sea-the intergovernmental Helsinki Commission and the partly supranational European Union-and show that the European Union would not benefit from enforcing an agreement among its member states on the Baltic without Russia being involved in the conservation efforts. Our results suggest that efficient abatement and full participation could be achieved by using the power the European Union has to enforce such an agreement among its members and, simultaneously, negotiating with Russia within the Helsinki Commission.","[Ahlvik, Lassi; Pavlova, Yulia] MTT Econ Res Finland, Helsinki 00790, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Ahlvik, L (通讯作者)，MTT Econ Res Finland, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland.",lassi.ahlvik@mtt.fi; yulia.pavlova@mtt.fi,,"Ahlvik, Lassi/0000-0001-8357-6985",,,,,58,16,16,2,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We investigate the efficacy of the SEC's regulations by examining informed trading in an attractive setting for exploiting private information; the options market. Using data on the S&P 1500 industrial firms, our analysis indicates that about 38% of firms exhibited symptoms of informed option trading prior to regulatory intervention. After regulatory intervention, we observe that only 19% of firms show symptoms of informed trading. In additional testing of ADR firms - explicitly exempt from complying with Reg FD, we find no evidence of a change in informed option trading from pre- to post-regulation; suggesting that the SEC's strictures on US firms led a to a significant reduction in informed option trading. Notably, our proxies for large shareholder and financial analyst access are associated with the largest decreases in informed option trading.

The burden of the tax, applied mainly to energy, is passed forward by non-tradable industries and backward by tradable industries facing fixed world prices. The tax is thus equivalent to a real exchange rate appreciation, and since export industries are labor-intensive, reduces employment, and increases poverty, especially when labor supply is responsive to wages. The use of revenues to increase transfers to households can offset poverty increases, but does not create jobs; thus the tax will likely conflict with other development policy objectives.

It is shown how policies (i) and (ii) preserve the functional distribution of income between capital owners and resource owners, compared to the case where no climate policy is needed, while suggested demand-side policies do not.

Until 1918, British general elections were staggered over a fortnight or more. We use the eight general elections between 1885 and 1910 to investigate whether there was a general bandwagon or underdog effect as the election progressed. We find that any bandwagon effect was in favor of the party which eventually won the election, not the party gaining seats compared with last time. We also find that a typical election featured an initial bandwagon effect which peaked about halfway through the election and then declined. Its decline appears to be due both to declining enthusiasm for the leading party and to later polls occurring in places where voters were less prone to get on a bandwagon in the first place. The weakening of the bandwagon was correlated to distance of the constituency from London, although it revived to some extent in Scotland.","[Hodgson, Robert] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Maloney, John] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Streatham Court, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England",University of York - UK; University of Exeter,"Maloney, J (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Streatham Court, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",J.Maloney@ex.ac.uk,,"Hodgson, Robert/0000-0001-6962-2893",,,,,39,13,14,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2013,157.0,1-2,,,,,73,90,,10.1007/s11127-012-0027-9,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,213WI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324090700007,0

We show that cultural dimensions in the studies of Hofstede (1980, 2001) such as individualism and uncertainty avoidance closely relate to several behavioral biases widely discussed in accounting and finance research. These cultural dimensions also signal different risk preferences. We argue that behavioral biases and risk preferences influence how international investors act on firm-specific information and empirically test whether individualism and uncertainty avoidance indexes can explain the cross-country information content of stock markets. We compute R-2 from the market model to measure the general information content of stock markets in the long term, abnormal return variance, and abnormal trading volume around earnings announcements to measure the short-term information content of earnings announcements. Using more than 150,000 earnings announcements from 42 countries for the period 1990-2006, we find that the information content of stock markets is higher in more individualistic countries and in low uncertainty-avoiding countries. The relations between cultural dimensions and measures of information content are robust to the inclusion of several control variables or the use of updated cultural indexes that account for possible changes in cultures over time.

Based on an empirical framework in which each firm sets a minimum boundary of work hours and where workers hired by the firm are required to put in at least the minimum hours, we found that the minimum requirement depends on each firm's fixed costs of labor. Specifically, firms that tend to hoard labor during recessions, presumably because of higher fixed costs, require incumbent workers to work longer hours during normal times. Since Japanese firms have long been considered as incurring high fixed costs to train workers, we interpret the long work hour requirement as a rational strategy for Japanese firms in protecting high-skill-accumulated workers from dismissal. In other words, the long work hours of Japanese males reflect firms' long-term employment practices, a typical feature of the Japanese labor market. J. Japanese Int. Economies 29 (2013) 57-73.

When a firm issues shares, the controlling shareholder can either maintain or change his ownership stake depending on how many of the new shares he subscribes. Issuance predicts poor future returns and is preceded by high returns, but only when the controlling shareholder's stake is significantly reduced.

As tax rates were effectively zero, the capital market was unregulated, and there were no institutional stockholders, we can rule out these potential determinants ex ante.

It is one of the first quantitative attempts to test the cusp catastrophe model by using real stock market data of an emerging market. We test the stochastic cusp catastrophe model on the Turkish financial market data. In our analysis, the crash of October 2008 is chosen since Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 index (ISE 100) fell by 63% in 2008. To construct the catastrophe model we use daily change of ISE 100 index as a behavioral variable, total trading value and foreign investors' share in the market capitalization as control measures. However, we show that the stochastic cusp catastrophe model does not explain well the crash of October 2008 in the Turkish stock market. Therefore, it can be concluded that October 2008 Turkish stock market crash was not in a bifurcation area.","[Tutek, H.

However, if the manager is risk-averse and misreporting increases both equity values and equity risk, the sensitivity of the manager's wealth to changes in stock price (portfolio delta) will have two countervailing incentive effects: a positive reward effect and a negative risk effect. In contrast, the sensitivity of the manager's wealth to changes in risk (portfolio vega) will have an unambiguously positive incentive effect. We show that jointly considering the incentive effects of both portfolio delta and portfolio vega substantially alters inferences reported in prior literature. Using both regression and matching designs, and measuring misreporting using discretionary accruals, restatements, and enforcement actions, we find strong evidence of a positive relation between vega and misreporting and that the incentives provided by vega subsume those of delta. Collectively, our results suggest that equity portfolios provide managers with incentives to misreport when they make managers less averse to equity risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on Brazil, which instituted five changes in its capital account regime in 2008-2011. Using the synthetic control method, we construct counterfactuals (i.e., Brazil with no policy change) for each of these changes. We find no evidence that any tightening of controls was effective in reducing the magnitudes of capital inflows, but we observe some modest and short-lived success in preventing further declines in inflows when the capital controls were relaxed. We hypothesize that price-based capital controls' only perceptible effect is to be found in the content of the signal they broadcast regarding the government's larger intentions and sensibilities. In the case of Brazil, its left-of-center government's willingness to remove controls was perceived as a noteworthy indication that the government was not as hostile to the international financial markets as many expected it to be.

To this end, we study whether the capital structure and its firm-factor determinants-size, asset structure, profit, growth, and age-differ depending on the region in which the SMEs are located. For the empirical analysis, panel data methods are applied to a sample of firms from all regions of Spain for the period 2004-2007.

Using an elasticity analysis, we show that this distinctive preference component serves to underpin negative-feedback trading propensities, but cannot manifest itself in behavior directly or holistically at the individual-choice level. We then propose and demonstrate that the market interaction between prospect-theory investors and regular CRRA investors allows this preference component to dominate in equilibrium behavior and hence helps to reestablish the intuitive link between prospect-theory preferences and negative-feedback trading patterns. In the model, the interaction also reconciles the contrarian behavior of prospect-theory investors with asymmetric volatility and short-term return reversal. The results suggest that prospect-theory preferences can lead investors to behave endogenously as contrarian noise traders in the market interaction process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Thanks to CHNS data, we estimate the impact of this health insurance on household savings for each quartile of income by using ordinary-least-square and two-stage-least-square estimations. We find a significant negative impact of the participation in NCMS on savings for middle-income households only. This result remains when we control for a possible endogeneity arising when we build savings on health expenses. As NCMS has no impact on health expenditures for all quartiles of income, we conclude that the decrease in savings, associated to NCMS participation, results from a reduction of households income risk rather than a reduction of health expenses.","[Cheung, Diana; Padieu, Ysaline] Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Cheung, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Sorbonne, B314,106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",diana.cheung75@gmail.com; ysaline.padieu@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,24,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

First, prospectus conservatism is positively related to underpricing, with the relation more pronounced for technology than nontechnology firms. Second, for nontechnology IPOs, prospectus conservatism is able to predict the firm's post-IPO operating performance. Specifically, we find that conservatism is inversely related to the firm's operating performance for the 3 years following the IPO. However, this predictability is limited to nontechnology IPOs. Finally, we find some evidence that for nontechnology IPOs conservatism is inversely related to the firm's post-IPO abnormal stock return. We conclude that the conservatism contained in an IPO's prospectus contains useful information about pricing and subsequent operating and stock return performance. Moreover, prospectus conservatism for nontechnology IPOs deserves more attention from investors.","[Ferris, Stephen P.; Hao, (Grace) Qing; Liao, (Stella) Min-Yu] Univ Missouri Columbia, Columbia, MO USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Ferris, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri Columbia, Columbia, MO USA.",,"Hao, Grace/AHC-6246-2022",,,,,,48,69,78,3,77,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Using a dynamic model for the yield curve with time-varying-parameters to the Japanese data, we provide three insights. First, the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates is generally supported even during the QEMP period. Second, the estimation results reveal that the contribution of macroeconomic variables on the variation of the yield curve is relatively small, especially during the QEMP period. As for the feedback effect, the yield curve factors contribute only marginally to inflation variation. However, they account for more relevant part of output gap dynamics. Third, the monetary policy shock has a significant effect on yield curve level factor only during the high interest rate periods. However, the decline in the level factor during the QEMP period, while insignificant, indicates a strengthening credibility of the Bank of Japan and thus the effectiveness of its policy.

We firstly use Kalman smoothing technique to obtain time-varying global and national systematic risks for the once-restricted A- and unrestricted B-share indices in China's stock exchanges. Then we investigate how these risks are priced while controlling for possible structural changes using the Markov regime-switching technique. We find evidence of partial integration in terms of positively priced global and national systematic risks in most cases. However, the unrestricted Shanghai B-share market is found to be generally segmented from the global market. The degree of integration is therefore not simply a matter of the degree of restriction, confirming that documenting barriers to investment (or the lack of them) is insufficient to prove segmentation (or integration). Given that the domestic systematic risk is still priced, there is scope for international portfolio diversification into China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The authors explore cross-sectional variation in cash holdings of U.S. publicly traded firms to shed light on the reasons for this recent trend. First, they identify factors that correlate with cash holdings and then examine the evolution of these factors over the past decade. Several factors, including research and development expenditures and idiosyncratic uncertainty, are important in accounting for cross-sectional differences in cash holdings. However, these factors do not increase over time as cash holdings do; thus, it seems unlikely that they underlie the increase in cash holdings. Aggregate uncertainty, however, has recently reached record levels. This uncertainty, combined with the fact that (idiosyncratic) uncertainty correlates well with cash holdings in the cross section of firms, suggests aggregate uncertainty may be an important factor accounting for the recent trend in increased cash holdings.","[Sanchez, Juan M.; Yurdaguel, Emircan] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Yurdaguel, Emircan] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Washington University (WUSTL),"Sanchez, JM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"YURDAGUL, EMIRCAN/ABE-1762-2020; Sanchez, Juan/I-5752-2016","YURDAGUL, EMIRCAN/0000-0003-1994-4653; Sanchez, Juan/0000-0003-0048-9128",,,,,12,13,16,0,6,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

In this paper we analyze the effect of progressive taxation on individual tax morale using a cross-country approach-a research question that has not been investigated in the existing literature. Our theoretical analysis leads to two testable predictions. First, an individual's tax morale is higher, the more progressive the tax schedule is. Second, the positive impact of tax progressivity on tax morale declines with income. In our empirical analysis we make use of a unique dataset of tax progressivity measures, namely the World Tax Indicators, and follow most of the tax morale literature by employing the World Values Survey to measure individual tax morale. Controlling for a wide range of potential confounders, we are able to confirm both hypotheses in our empirical analysis.","[Doerrenberg, Philipp; Peichl, Andreas] Univ Cologne, Cologne Grad Sch Management Econ & Social Sci CGS, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Doerrenberg, Philipp; Peichl, Andreas] Inst Study Labor IZA, D-53072 Bonn, Germany; [Peichl, Andreas] ISER, Colchester, Essex, England; [Peichl, Andreas] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Cologne; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut,"Peichl, A (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, POB 7240, D-53072 Bonn, Germany.",doerrenberg@wiso.uni-koeln.de; peichl@iza.org,"Peichl, Andreas/D-7829-2018",,,,,,59,67,77,3,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2013,155.0,3-4,,,,,293,316,,10.1007/s11127-011-9848-1,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,138NQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318515700006,0

Results show that personality plays a larger role in explaining behavior in choice experiments than in auctions. Agency, neuroticism, and conscientiousness are the least relevant personality traits influencing bidding behavior while agreeableness and neuroticism are the least relevant traits influencing choice behavior. The trait with the strongest positive effect in auctions is extraversion, while agency matters the most in choice experiments. Certain personalities behave differently in real and hypothetical environments, suggesting that personality could explain a significant portion of hypothetical bias. This indicates that market outcomes may be influenced by the types of people participating in the market and the way they interact with the market structure based on their underlying personality.

The trouble with such a neutrality view is that it is focused on one margin among others. The economics of start-up firms is, however, fundamentally different from the economics of established corporations. In particular, the opportunity cost of an entrepreneur should be stated in terms of forgone earnings in the labor market, adjusted for the option value of abandoning the firm throughout the lifetime. Moreover, the future-exit option interferes with the early start-up decision when a nascent entrepreneur is forward-looking. The paper shows that the requirement of start-up neutrality is not satisfied by any of the well-known investment-neutral tax systems, including the comprehensive income tax, the dividend tax, the Johansson-Samuelson tax, the cash-flow tax, and the ACE tax.","[Kanniainen, Vesa] Univ Helsinki, CESifo, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kanniainen, Vesa] Univ Helsinki, HECER, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Panteghini, Paolo M.] Univ Brescia, CESifo, I-25122 Brescia, Italy; [Panteghini, Paolo M.] AccounTax Lab, I-25122 Brescia, Italy",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Brescia,"Kanniainen, V (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, CESifo, POB 17, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",vesa.kanniainen@helsinki.fi; pan-teghi@eco.unibs.it,"Panteghini, Paolo/P-4581-2015","Panteghini, Paolo/0000-0001-6564-0816",,,,,63,4,4,0,25,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2013,69.0,2,,,,,167,193,,10.1628/001522113X666926,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,170FH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320835300003,0

Our empirical analysis, using an extensive firm-level data, suggests that the impact of business subsidies on employment growth differs more between high-growth start-ups and other firms than between start-ups and incumbents. On average, all subsidies relate positively to the contemporary employment growth for both start-ups and incumbents. Furthermore, after subsidy reception, the employment of both start-ups and older incumbents receiving employment or other subsidies grows more than that of non-subsidized firms. However, we find that business subsidies do not provide a significant additional boost to either contemporary or after-subsidy growth for young high-growth companies. There are apparently some other factors that promote growth in young high-growth firms; these factors help foster strong growth in many cases with or without subsidies.","[Koski, Heli; Pajarinen, Mika] Res Inst Finnish Econ ETLA, Helsinki 00120, Finland",,"Koski, H (通讯作者)，Res Inst Finnish Econ ETLA, Lonnrotinkatu 4 B, Helsinki 00120, Finland.",heli.koski@etla.fi,,,,,,,31,40,44,2,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In the energetic sector, the product offered (electricity) is absolutely homogeneous, allowing only consumer protection through price. Our study analyzed the presence of this phenomenon in the 27 countries of the European Union. Data was collected from official institutions, such as the World Bank, Europe's Energy Portal and the National Institutes of Statistics of the member states. Based on OLS regressions we demonstrated the existence of price-based protection for domestic consumers at EU level. Prices are regulated in such a way as to be correlated with the average wage. As an additional argument, we demonstrated that the energy price for industrial consumers follows a different formation mechanism, with main influence factor the energy import dependence.","[Mare, Codruta; Dragos, Simona Laura; Lazar, Dan Tudor; Dragos, Cristian Mihai] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Dragos, Cristian Mihai] Univ Orleans, LEO, F-45067 Orleans, France",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Universite de Orleans,"Dragos, CM (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",cristian.dragos@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Dragos, Cristian/IAO-9689-2023; Dragos, Simona Laura/B-4689-2016; Mare, Codruta/ADC-6680-2022; MARE, Codruta/AAZ-9390-2020; Lazar, Dan Tudor T./B-1434-2013","Dragos, Simona Laura/0000-0002-3037-3401; Mare, Codruta/0000-0002-4920-7462; MARE, Codruta/0000-0002-4920-7462; Lazar, Dan Tudor/0000-0002-6884-9110",,,,,36,7,7,0,27,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2013,15.0,34,,,,,327,341,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,156XV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319858100003,0

By spatially relating located experiences to the availability of bicycle facilities and other aspects of the urban environment, their influence on cyclists' experiences can be analysed. 398 cyclists responded and sketched their most recent cycle route and a total of 890 points to locations along the route where they had had positive and negative cycling experiences. The survey was implemented as an online questionnaire built on Google Maps, and allowed up to three positive and three negative experience points to be mapped and classified. By relating the characteristics of the experience points and the routes to the traversed urban area in general, the significance of the preconditions for obtaining positive or negative experiences could be evaluated. Thereby urban spaces can be mapped according to the potential promotion of positive or negative experiences. Further, the method might be applied to assess the effect of proposed changes to the urban design in terms of cyclists' experiences. Statistical analysis of the location attributes, traffic environments and conflicts, bicycle facilities, urban density, centrality, and environmental amenities indicates that positive experiences, or the absence of negative experiences, are clearly related to the presence of en-route cycling facilities, and attractive nature environments within a short distance of large water bodies or green edges along the route.

The analysis reveals substantial differences in the role of self-employment among low-skilled workers across gender and nativity-women and immigrants are shown to be of particular importance from both the perspectives of trends and policy relevance.

Alongside two supplementary capital buffers, the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision imposed severe pressure on the Value-at-Risk based Internal Models Approach in order to increase. This is to increase the capital base by adding the stressed Value-at-Risk component in an effort to reduce reliance on internal models while keeping the Standardized Approach avenue open. However, even though those measures might appear theoretically correct, evidence gathered for long and short exposures in Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain highlights several defects in Basel III. We emphasize that leptokurtic models, primarily those derived from Extreme Value Theory, should be enforced in the regulations given their superior performance in market crises, and that Basel II could have shielded against 2008 mayhem provided that heavy-tailed techniques had been employed.

We obtain a closed-form representation for the parameters of the contemporaneously and temporally aggregated process as a function of the parameters of the original one. These results are useful due to the close analogy between the integrated GARCH (1,1) model for conditional volatility and the IMA (1,1) model for squared returns, which share the same autocorrelation function. In this framework, we present an application dealing with Value-at-Risk (VaR) prediction at different sampling frequencies for an equally weighted portfolio composed of multiple indices. We apply the aggregation results by inferring the aggregate parameter in the portfolio volatility equation from the estimated vector IMA (1,1) model of squared returns.

Moreover, large trades.account for a significant proportion of daily stock price changes in the last 2 days. The evidence is consistent with the prediction by Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992) that, when multiple informed investors acquire the same piece of information, they will trade aggressively.

This study is one of the first to empirically examine the role of partnership diversity in nascent green-technology ventures in a quantitative empirical study by systematically applying a resource-based view (RBV) theoretical perspective. Partnership diversity relates to the variety of partnerships with different sectors with which a green-technology venture engages in order to mobilize resources and be successful. RBV suggests that the accumulation and combination of such resources leads to success.

When using the Fama-French three factor (3F) model (with no market timing) we find that at most 0.5% of funds have truly positive alpha-performance and about 27% have truly negative-alpha performance. However, the use of the FDR in model selection implies inclusion of market timing variables and this results in a large increase in truly positive alpha funds. However, when we use a measure of total performance, which includes the contribution of both security selection (alpha) and market timing, we obtain results similar to the 3F model. These results are largely invariant to different sample periods, alternative factor models and to the performance of funds investing in German and non-German firms - the latter casts doubt on the 'home-bias' hypothesis of superior performance in 'local' markets.

We examine whether the 2006 regulatory requirement of disclosing compensation peers mitigated firms' opportunistic peer selection activities. We find that strategic peer benchmarking did not disappear after enhanced disclosure. In fact, it intensified at firms with low institutional ownership, low director ownership, low CEO ownership, busy boards, large boards, and non-intensive monitoring boards, and at firms with shareholders complaining about compensation practices. The effect is also stronger at firms with new CEOs. These findings call into question whether disclosure regulation can remedy potential problems in compensation practices.","[Faulkender, Michael] Univ Maryland, RH Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Yang, Jun] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business,"Yang, J (通讯作者)，Kelley Sch Business, 1309 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jy4@indiana.edu,,,,,,,52,56,67,1,68,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Based on a new corporate microsimulation model, ZEW TaxCoMM, we assess the heterogeneous effects of the tax reform on firms, varying according to some of the firms' key characteristics. This is important for understanding the reform's implications in view of the recent economic crisis. Moreover, the model also allows for the behavioral responses of firms to a new tax environment. The 2008 reform has indeed been targeted at affecting firm behavior, in particular profit-shifting incentives. By means of a detailed reform costing, the model can investigate the extent to which the 2008 reform can actually be considered self-financing. The simulation results show that in times of economic downturn, with shrinking profitability and increasing demand for external financing, the 2008 reform might indeed exert a procyclical effect on the economy: Companies losing from the reform are exactly those that feature a low profitability, a high debt ratio, and high capital intensity. With regard to revenue consequences, the reform provisions are simulated to lead to a 19.7% decline in aggregate tax revenue. However, taking into account behavioral responses of firms with respect to their financing, investment, and profit-shifting behavior, total revenue is simulated to reach again 84.7% of the 2007 benchmark revenue, even in the short term. In a rather long-term perspective, the reform might even be 92.4% self-financing.","[Finke, Katharina] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Heckemeyer, Jost H.; Spengel, Christoph] Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Reister, Timo] Fuchs Petrolub AG, Harvey, IL 60426 USA",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Mannheim,"Finke, K (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7-1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",finke@zew.de; heckemyer@uni-mannheim.de; treister@fuchs.com; spengel@uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,55,9,9,0,30,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2013,69.0,1,,,,,72,114,,10.1628/001522113X663488,0.0,,,43,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,115VH,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316839500004,0

We provide an early assessment of whether (and to what extent) this was the case in 2010, the first year of the Greek crisis. We distinguish between two interrelated factors: on the one hand, the austerity policies taken to reduce fiscal deficits; on the other hand, the wider recession. Using a taxbenefit model, we attempt to quantify the distributional implications of both. With respect to the austerity policies, we focus on the changes affecting taxation, pension benefits and public sector pay. With respect to the wider recession, we model the effects of rising unemployment and inflation, as well as of lower earnings for self-employed workers and for employees of private firms. In simulating the impact of these changes on the distribution of incomes (and in estimating how the total burden of the crisis is shared across income groups), we take into account tax evasion and benefit non-take-up.

We answer the question by analyzing Fed policy following the recessions of the early-to-mid-1970s, the early 1990s and the early 2000s, in the context of both Taylor's original rule and latter variants of Taylor rules. While Taylor's original rule, which can be justified by historical experience during and following the recessions, does not produce negative prescribed interest rates for 2009-11, variants of Taylor rules with larger output gap coefficients, which do produce negative interest rates, cannot be justified by the same historical experience.

This paper emphasizes that causality may also run in the opposite direction, in particular, that higher incomesarising for reasons having nothing to do with human capitalmay allow for increased prevention and treatment of malaria, and therefore contribute to the negative correlation. We analyze the malaria-income relationship for 100 endemic countries over a 17-year period using a simultaneous equations model that accounts for reverse causality and incidental associations. For most countries, income growth has been the most important driver of the negative correlation between malaria and income. Although reducing malaria may be its own reward, it takes much more than reductions in malaria to foster development.

Based on the results of the MDSA, the countries were classified into three different groups in two-dimensional space according to the analyzed health variables. For healthcare indicators, Turkey was placed in the same group as Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. Turkey was dissimilar to Luxembourg, France, Sweden, Austria and Germany and was most similar to Romania and Bulgaria with respect to the analyzed health parameters. As to the results of the NHCA, the countries were divided into four clusters according to their healthcare indicators. Turkey was placed in the same cluster as Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Poland and Romania. Countries in the same clusters /groups were similar to one another for both techniques.","Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, IIBF, Isletme Bolumu, TR-26480 Eskisehir, Turkey",Eskisehir Osmangazi University,"Girginer, N (通讯作者)，Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, IIBF, Isletme Bolumu, Mesel Kampusu, TR-26480 Eskisehir, Turkey.",ngirginer@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,5,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

A major unresolved question for laypeople and scholars alike resulting from this research, however, is the neglect of saturation and scarcity effects in this area of study. To fill this gap, we apply methods from optimisation research to the field of SWB. Combining utility functions with DRM data allows us to generate an optimal day schedule: It differs considerably from how people usually spend their time, whereby the distribution of activities is remarkably even. The results show how a paradigm shift away from a focus on increasing Gross Domestic Product towards greater well-being at the macrolevel could play out at the microlevel with potential consequences for how we might live our day-to-day lives.

Experience suggests such policies often fail to increase access and quality of education, and illegal fees are widely prevalent. The literature identifies several reasons including the lack of replacement funding in place of fees and the loss of quality due to overcrowding and subsequent high drop-out rates. This article, using evidence from Indonesia's experience, argues that the underlying problem is political. We suggest that fee-free education is an attainable goal, but only if pro-UFBE interest groups are empowered to influence policy, demand accountability and seek redress against illegal fees.","[Rosser, Andrew] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Joshi, Anuradha] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England",University of Adelaide; University of Sussex,"Joshi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",a.joshi@ids.ac.uk,,"Joshi, Anuradha/0000-0003-0990-7701; ROSSER, ANDREW/0000-0002-7219-4479",,,,,62,16,17,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

FOREX market is a complex domain and an ability to forecast future price movements based on past data is highly fundamental to profitable trading by the practitioners. In order to assist traders to achieve minimal loss and high profitability, there are existing automated FOREX prediction robots which are based on technical data. Analysis using technical data involves the adoption of graphs and reoccurring patterns of price movement to forecast currency pair rate. Despite some positive results that have been recorded with this approach, technical analysis and the robots that are based on them only give scanty meaning to the market movements. The optional approach to market prediction being adopted by traders is fundamental analysis. In this method, the impact of fundamental data (such as cash flow, geopolitical factors, economic indices, government policies and news) on price movements are considered for trade forecasting. However, there are currently very little research efforts that focus on automation of FOREX prediction using fundamental data. Therefore, in this work, we are developing an online FOREX robot based on artificial neural network (ANN) and fundamental data to forecast the exchange rate of Great Britain Pound (GBP) and US dollar (USD) pair using six fundamental indices. The preliminary experimental results of the scale conjugate gradient ANN engine we developed is very encouraging and the platform promises to be a good and reliable tool for accurate exchange rate prediction when it is fully developed and deployed.","[Adetiba, Emmanuel; Ike, Dike U.] Covenant Univ, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Ota, Nigeria; [Owolabi, Folashade O.] Covenant Univ, Dept Accounting, Ota, Nigeria",Covenant University; Covenant University,"Adetiba, E (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Ota, Nigeria.",emmanuel.adetiba@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; engineerdikeike@yahoo.com; folashade.owolabi@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"Adetiba, Emmanuel/AAC-4129-2022; Owolabi, Folashade/AAQ-2448-2020","Adetiba, Emmanuel/0000-0001-9227-7389",Covenant University Management,Covenant University Management,We appreciate Covenant University Management for providing support for this work.,,3,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1135,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500111,0

Research has identified three levels of approach of health services to the audit implementation. These were the variables used for determining the levels: audit outputs of health services, relation to the public relations budget, the person conducting the audit and the typical characteristics of audit realization.

On the other hand, it increases the demand for precautionary savings. The latter may imply higher capital accumulation in response to a rise in oil price uncertainty depending on whether agents have access to an international bond as an alternative asset. The investment decline because of higher oil price volatility under financial integration is almost twice as much as the decline under financial autarky. Moreover, the interaction between shocks to the level and volatility of oil prices is quantitatively important.

Using data for four major economies, namely the USA, the UK, the Euro Area, and Japan, we allow for nonlinearity and discriminate between long-run and time-varying short-run dynamics. Thus, we conduct a Markov-switching vector error correction model (MS-VECM) approach for a sample period ranging from January 1970 to December 2011. Our main findings are threefold: first, we show that gold is partially able to hedge future inflation in the long-run and this ability is stronger for the USA and the UK compared to Japan and the Euro Area. In addition, the adjustment of the general price level is characterized by regime-dependence, implying that the usefulness of gold as an inflation hedge for investors crucially depends on the time horizon. Finally, one regime approximately accounts for times of turbulence while the other roughly corresponds to 'normal times'. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Critical thought is needed about the underlying assumptions and frameworks informing policy and critique. While key aspects of populist, Left and liberal ideologies helped mobilize support for land reform after 1994, they framed questions of equitable transformation and justice in ways that obscured the terrain of struggle rather than revealing it. The broad consensus on the legitimacy of land reform in the initial decade after 1994 was underpinned by narratives about redress and reconciliation that privileged reparative justice above distributive equity. It tended to obscure the complex trade-offs and impacts involved in implementation. Coherent policy-making was further undermined by simplistic oppositions between 'market and rights-based approaches that often led to ill-targeted policies. Land and agrarian reform needs to be liberated from this symbolic burden. It should be informed by an understanding of the nature of inequality in South Africa and the contribution that agrarian change can make to reducing it.","Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"du Toit, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",adutoit@plaas.org.za,,"du Toit, Andries/0000-0001-5845-0774",,,,,19,9,10,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The problem is that some data may have different data format in the imported file than it is expected in the table after importing. Internal MS Excel functions for mathematical operations ignore cell values that are not numeric and do not enter into the function calculation. Though internal functions ignore cells whose data type is not numeric, they do not inform the user about this fact. This paper therefore aims at not only informing about this adverse effect of certain internal mathematical functions, but also at explaining the way to eliminate the problem. The Visual Basic for Application tool (VBA), which is an MS Office internal tool, will be used for it. The outcome of the paper Will be the design, analysis and creation of a sample function in the VBA environment that would warn the user of the input data inconsistency, thus eliminating irrelevant results.

Using the financial data of 137 companies both from the financial and the non financial sectors of the economy, this study uses the weighted logistic regression method of analyses to evaluate the type of relationship that exists between corporate governance voluntary disclosure practices of companies in Nigeria with size and financial performance. The study reveals that there is a significant positive relationship between firm financial performance and corporate governance voluntary disclosure.

Despite this fact, it generates a balance sheet loss. Revenues, which are mainly generated by the transit charge, do not cover its operating expenses. This situation raises the question how the current charging system could be redesigned to make the canal generate a balance sheet profit. In this paper, we focus solely on the canal's revenue. Because the canal is a monopoly that allows, in principle, for perfect price discrimination, we contrast the current charging system with an optimal charging system based on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach. We devise a general approach to calculate optimal transit charges and apply it in a case study that includes four ship types on three routes. The findings of the case study indicate that, in principle, much higher revenues could be generated if the transit charges were based not only on ship size but also on fuel prices and a ship's departure and destination ports, as these affect a ship's costs in terms of fuel costs and required sailing time.

There is also a significant relationship between academic staff's perception of technology characteristics and their attitude towards using the technology in the educational system.","[Khasawneh, Mohammad] World Islamic Sci & Educ Univ, Amman, Jordan",,,mohammad.khasawneh@wise.edu.jo; huda753@uum.edu.my,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,952,962,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100102,0

It is argued that despite the fact that during the recent recession there were very strong objections among a number of reputed economists against the fiscal stimulus, this intervention probably contributed to prevent advanced economies from a long and painful depression.

The sector is characterised by a lack of market links and innovation, low levels of design capacity and faces environmental problems and improper design processes. This paper contains both a quantitative study of 305 companies and in-depth interviews with different stakeholders in the country's craft industries in order to explore the different perspectives and insights of those involved, such as business owners, business support organisations, designers and buyers. Data analysis from 305 survey questionnaires revealed that there is a significant positive relationship between market demand and craft design.

Although it is possible to formulate the relationship with output gap or unemployment gap instead of real marginal costs, it is the formulation with real marginal costs which dominates both in theoretical and empirical analysis. The paper uses VAR models with measures of real activity, inflation, exchange rate and interest rate as endogenous and measures of output of the German economy and oil price as exogenous variables to examine the behavior of real unit labor costs as a proxy for real marginal costs in a business cycle framework in cases of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia.

This concept can be understood as so called negative or positive approach to purchasing The essence of a negative attitude to final purchasing decision is a moral boycott of unethical products. Consumers who want to implement a positive socially responsible shopping, do actively seek ethical products in the manufacture of which the abuse of employees, cruelty to animals or environmental destruction were avoided. There is a number of issues that affect the ours. Among the most important are global warming, environmental pollution, loss of animal and plant species. This is of course reflected in the global economic environment. The tendency of these influences is high and during the time even more intensive. On one side there is the corporate social responsibility in terms of ethical production. It's also the noninfringement of basic principles of sustainable development, on the other hand, it is important not to neglect social responsibility of the consumers themselves. The interest in ethical consumerism and ethical shopping, the effort to help in ethical, human and environmental terms would be, in our opinion, higher in the case of providing consumers with sufficient information about the products, individual brands, principles of their functioning but also about the issues of trade and environmental protection, animal abuse, violations of rights, etc. The proposals are defined by implementing more effective promotion and advertising in the mass media.

In tandem with the increase in computer usage, Malaysia's 2012 Budget tabled a significantly surge in ICT expenses. Doubtlessly, online public services are crucial to a country's socio-economic development as this offsets other important criteria to catapult the country's growth and wellbeing toward Vision 2020. As a consequence, each government agency has formalized their annual ICT allocations including outsourcing services and state-of-the art peripherals that they are unable to cater to. Thus, this study is significant in providing the empirical evidence for ICT usage by assessing the feasibility of outsourcing an agency's e-government services. Also, the findings from the qualitative inquiries and analyses would provide the evidence in outsourcing, particularly for e-government services. This is to ensure that the e-service delivery is as effective and efficient as other non-outsourced online services. Therefore, the agency chosen for this case study research project is the Malaysia Department of Insolvency (MdI). In MdI's quest to be at par excellence with other federal agencies, ensuring the accuracy, relevancy and timeliness of the department's core responsibilities are of top priority. Of particular contemporary interest are issues on bankruptcy where there have been calls to review the Bankruptcy Act 1967 in order to allow bankrupts to apply to be discharged from bankruptcy after three years. By putting the bankruptcy clearance processes online, this will reduce the red tape and hence, increase efficiency.","[Samsudin, Nurulain Mohd] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Adm Sci & Policy Studies, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Fuzi, Sharifah Faatihah Syed Mohd; Hashim, Rugayah] Univ Teknol MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Samsudin, NM (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Adm Sci & Policy Studies, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",ain_safar33@yahoo.com; guy73106@yahoo.com,"Hashim, Rugayah Gy/C-9708-2010; Syed Mohd Fuzi, Sharifah Faatihah/GQB-3486-2022","Hashim, Rugayah Gy/0000-0002-4807-9024;","Research Management Institute (RMI), Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) through the Excellence Research Grant Scheme; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia","Research Management Institute (RMI), Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) through the Excellence Research Grant Scheme; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)","We would like to thank the Research Management Institute (RMI), Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) for the initial support of our study through the Excellence Research Grant Scheme (Dana Kecemerlangan).

The analysis focuses on the Czech Republic industry. Data sources were taken from the Czech Republic national accounts in the period of 1996-2011. It was found that the share of industry in the GVA added is continuously growing. The most important part of the industry is the manufacturing industry (90% of the GVA industry). The development of the total factor productivity mirrors the development of the GVA. The dynamics of the both variables GVA and TFP is influenced by the business cycle. The performed analysis confirmed two hypotheses primarily in the manufacturing industry. The first hypothesis assumes that the intensive factor prevails if the value of the TFP is greater than the GVA index and, at the same time, the TFP is greater than 1. The second hypothesis assumes that the extensive factor prevails if the value of the GVA index is greater than the TFP and, at the same time TFP, is less than 1.","[Volek, Tomas; Novotna, Martina] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,,volek@ef.jcu.cz; novnotna@ef.jcu.cz,"Volek, Tomas/AAS-4302-2021",,,,,,13,0,0,0,12,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1492,1501,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100150,0

The composite indicators combine several individual economic indexes and can be divided into the leading, coincident and lagging ones with regard to the reference time series (usually GDP or industrial production index). The attempts of constructing the composite indicators for Czech economy have been based mostly on the OECD methodology with only slight alterations so far. This traditional approach uses algorithms like Hodrick-Prescott filter for the decomposition of the time series. However there are other very often neglected ways how to compute the cyclical component, e. g., analysis of month-to-month or year-to-year growth rates of the individual economic indexes. We compare traditional methodology and usage of month-to-month (and year-to-year) growth rates and discuss how these approaches affect the structure and performance of leading composite indicator constructed for the Czech Republic.","[Vrana, Lenka] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,lenka.vrana@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1502,1511,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100151,0
