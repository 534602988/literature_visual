Multiple currency crises and force majeure offer anecdotal evidence contradicting the historical perception of Germany being the poster child of European public finance. Given these corresponding breaks in time series, the empirical analysis is conducted for the sub-periods 1872-1913 and 1950-2010. In addition to anecdotal historical analysis, we conduct formal tests on fiscal sustainability, including tests on stationarity and cointegration and the estimation of Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Models (VECM). While we cannot reject the hypothesis that fiscal policy was sustainable in the period before the First World War, the tests allow for a rejection of the hypothesis of fiscal sustainability for the period from 1950 to 2010. This evidence leads to the conclusion that Germany's public debt is in dire need of consolidation. Albeit constituting a much needed reform to this development, the incompleteness of the German debt brake and fiscal federalism will have to be addressed in the coming years, in order to ensure that fiscal consolidation actually takes place for the sake of public debt sustainability.","[Burret, Heiko T.; Feld, Lars P.; Koehler, Ekkehard A.] Walter Eucken Inst eV, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany; [Feld, Lars P.] Univ Freiburg, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Burret, HT (通讯作者)，Walter Eucken Inst eV, Goethestr 10, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",burret@eucken.de; feld@eucken.de; koehler@eucken.de,,"Burret, Heiko/0000-0003-2483-9049",,,,,148,9,9,1,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Using a panel of twelve manufacturing industries across ten OECD economies, we investigate whether ignoring spillovers leads to bias in the estimated private returns to R&D. We compare results from a common factor framework, which accounts for spillovers and other unobserved shocks, to those from a standard Griliches approach. Our findings confirm that conventional estimates conflate own-R&D and spillover effects, implying that spillovers cannot be ignored even when the interest lies exclusively in evaluating private returns to R&D.","[Eberhardt, Markus] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Helmers, Christian] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Strauss, Hubert] European Investment Bank, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",University of Nottingham; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Eberhardt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Eberhardt, Markus/IQV-0257-2023","Eberhardt, Markus/0000-0002-0945-0759",ESRC [ES/G014469/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G014469/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,51,140,153,1,32,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Specifically, we focus on the pricing implication of market comovement because comovement tends to be stronger in financial crisis when investors are especially sensitive to price declines. We find that real estate price increases with expected financial asset return but only in weak market comovement (i.e., a normal market environment) when investors enjoy diversification benefit. When market comovement is strong, real estate price strictly declines with expected financial asset return. More importantly, contrary to the conventional positive relationship from real option studies, real estate price generally declines with expected financial asset risk. With realistic market parameters, we show that there is a nonlinear relationship between real estate price and financial risk. When the market comovement is strong, real estate price only increases with financial asset risk when the risk is low but eventually declines with the risk when it becomes high. Our cross-country empirical results also show that the relationship between financial market risk and real estate price is non-monotonic, conditional on the degree of market comovement.","[Fan, Gang-Zhi] Konkuk Univ, Dept Real Estate, Seoul 143701, South Korea; [Huszar, Zsuzsa R.; Zhang, Weina] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Finance, NUS Business Sch, Singapore 119245, Singapore; [Huszar, Zsuzsa R.; Zhang, Weina] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore 119245, Singapore; [Huszar, Zsuzsa R.; Zhang, Weina] Natl Univ Singapore, Risk Management Inst, Singapore 119245, Singapore",Konkuk University; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Zhang, WN (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Finance, NUS Business Sch, 15 Kent Ridge Dr, Singapore 119245, Singapore.",fan10@konkuk.ac.kr; bizhzr@nus.edu.sg; weina@nus.edu.sg,"Huszar, Zsuzsa Reka/P-4211-2015; Zhang, Weina/P-4216-2015","Huszar, Zsuzsa Reka/0000-0002-4325-5295;",,,,,45,7,8,6,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Based on the findings of a manufacturing industry survey, the evidence suggests that all manufacturing firms were affected by the crisis and that there is no single and dominant transmission channel. Crisis reactions were significantly related to participation in international markets, although participation in trade, in external borrowing or FDI cannot explain recession by themselves. The reversal of growth was mainly caused by demand shock and, following that, by financial constraints. Thus the hypothesis that blames overheating of internal demand in the years prior to the crisis seems to receive statistical backing. Globalised companies, though hit by external shocks, were better prepared to pay the cost and balance the consequences of the crisis.",,,,,"Ksenia, Gonchar/H-1444-2015","Ksenia, Gonchar/0000-0002-3059-6023",,,,,35,2,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,MAY 1,2013,65.0,3,,,SI,,508,527,,10.1080/09668136.2013.779454,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,121UN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317270000008,0

The key policy differences related to public budgets and support for a demand stimulus. Responses fall broadly into two categories that we link to a social-democratic and a neo-liberal response. The distinction indicates that the policy responses were linked to the party affiliation of the government on the leftright spectrum. There were some remarkable common trends that cannot be explained by the logical requirements of the economic situation alone. There are differences in timing and in severity, but every country has at some point moved towards a policy of balancing the budget by making cuts. In all cases there were cuts in benefits for marginal groups in society and a switch towards indirect rather than direct taxes. These carry clear distributional implications.","[Myant, Martin] European Trade Union Inst, Brussels, Belgium; Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Mannheim; Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Myant, M (通讯作者)，European Trade Union Inst, Brussels, Belgium.",,,"Drahokoupil, Jan/0000-0003-1686-1748",,,,,33,27,28,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,MAY 1,2013,65.0,3,,,SI,,383,410,,10.1080/09668136.2013.779460,0.0,,,28,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,121UN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317270000002,0

Yet very little is known about the appeal of indirect rule among the ruled themselves. Why do people in some places demand more indirect rule and local autonomy, whereas others seem content to be governed directly by rulers of an alien culture? This is a crucial question with important implications for determining the form of governance that is most likely to provide social order in culturally heterogeneous societies. Although much attention has been given to consider the relative costs and benefits of direct versus indirect rule for the central authorities, the other side of the coin - namely, the variable demand for indirect rule among the members of distinctive cultural groups - has hardly been examined with systematic empirical data. This paper presents a theory of the differential demand for indirect rule and offers an initial test of its principal empirical implications using original micro-level data from the North Caucasus region of Russia. The theory's core claim is that the middle class should express the greatest demand for indirect rule, while both the upper and lower classes should prefer more direct rule. The theory therefore predicts that there will be an inverse parabolic relationship between the demand for indirect rule and economic class. The findings are largely consistent with these theoretical expectations.","[Siroky, David S.; Dzutsev, Valeriy; Hechter, Michael] Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Siroky, DS (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",david.siroky@asu.edu,"Siroky, David/M-4219-2019","Siroky, David/0000-0002-6234-0460; Dzutsati, Valery/0000-0002-1610-6585",,,,,52,12,14,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

In this paper, we aim to build appropriate distribution models for start-up lost time and effective departure flow rate, by considering their relations with the frequently mentioned departure headway distributions. The motivation behind is that distribution models could provide richer information than the conventional mean value models and thus better serve the need of traffic simulation and signal timing planning. To reach this goal, we first check empirical data collected in Beijing, China. Tests show that the departure headways at each position in a discharging queue are very weakly dependent or almost independent. Based on this new finding, two distribution models are proposed for start-up lost time and effective flow rate, respectively. We also examine the dependences of departure headways that are generated by three popular traffic simulation software: VISSIM, PARAMICS and TransModeler. Results suggest that in VISSIM, the departure headways at different positions are almost deterministically dependent and may not be in accordance with empirical observations. Finally, we discuss how the dependence of departure headways may influence traffic simulation and signal timing planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The data used cover the seasonally adjusted real export and real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the 1957:1-2009:1 period. Standard Granger causality tests indicate no causality between export and real GDP series. On the contrary, full sample-modified Granger causality tests based on bootstrap, which are applicable irrespective of integration-cointegration properties of the data, indicate a bi-directional causal link between exports and real GDP. Accordingly, export growth should be an important factor behind Japan's high-economic growth in the last three decades. Using parameter stability tests, we show that these results are not uniform for different sample periods and results vary due to structural changes. Using bootstrap rolling window estimation, we find that there is a positive bi-directional predictive power from the mid 1970s to the late-1980s between the series, while from the late 1990s to 2009 there is a positive predictive power only from export growth to output growth.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Turkey; [Ozdemir, Zeynel Abidin] Gazi Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06500 Ankara, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University; Gazi University,"Ozdemir, ZA (通讯作者)，Gazi Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06500 Ankara, Turkey.",mehmet.balcilar@emu.edu.tr; zabidin@gazi.edu.tr,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196; ozdemir, zeynel abidin/0000-0001-8600-0463",,,,,85,173,177,0,41,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The concentrations of near-road atmospheric pollutants vary depending on traffic patterns, environmental conditions, topography and the presence of roadside structures. In this study, the vertical and horizontal variation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and benzene (C6H6) concentration along a major city ring motorway were analysed. The main goal of this study is to try to establish a distance from this urban motorway considered safe concerning the air pollutants human heath limit values and to study the influence of the different forcing factors of the near road air pollutants transport and dispersion. Statistic significant differences (p = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) were observed between sub-domains for NO2 representing different conditions of traffic emission and pollutants dispersion, but not for C6H6 (p = 0.335). Results also suggest significant lower concentrations recorded at 100 m away from roadway than at the roadside for all campaigns (p <0.016 (NO2) and p <0.036 (C6H6), Mann-Whitney test). In order to have a safe life in homes located near motorways, the outdoor concentrations of NO2 must not exceed 44-60.0 mu g m(-3) and C6H6 must not exceed 1.4-3.3 mu g m(-3). However, at 100 m away from roadway, 81.8% of NO2 receptors exceed the annual limit value of human health protection (40 mu g m(-3)) and at the roadside this value goes up to 95.5%. These findings suggest that the safe distance to an urban motorway roadside should be more at least 100 m. This distance should be further studied before being used as a reference to develop articulated urban mobility and planning policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In chapter 13 of the first edition and in an appendix in the second section of 1913, he introduced a rule to maintain the stability of the level of prices, known as the compensated dollar. According to this rule, the legal definition of money is changed. In other words, the weight in gold of the dollar is modified once a month in order to impede the frequency of price changes on a basket of goods. According to Fisher, this plan would offer stability for the purchasing power of money. He sought to find an alternative system to the fixed price of gold under the Gold Standard. He wanted to introduce a dollar fixed in terms of its purchasing power, but variable in terms of its metallic weight. In this paper, we will focus on Fisher's analysis of the stability of money value and his position in the debate on the compensated dollar from 1909 to 1922. We will study the anticipations of Fisher's compensated dollar, the critical reception of Fisher's project and the evolutions it gave rise to, the gold exchange standard and the algebraic evidence. We also examine the debate's connections to the question of whether or not the compensated dollar plan is compatible with the quantity theory of money. We end with the analysis of the gold price elasticity of the net supply of gold, with an explanation of the relationship between the Yellowbacks and the varying price of the gold reserve.","[Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez] Univ Lyon 2, Triangle ISH, F-69363 Lyon 07, France; [des Roches, Jerome de Boyer] Univ Paris 09, F-75016 Paris, France",Universite Lyon 2; Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Betancourt, RG (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 2, Triangle ISH, 14 Ave Berthelot, F-69363 Lyon 07, France.",Rebeca.GomezBetancourt@univ-lyon2.fr; jdbdr@free.fr,"Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/K-9494-2019; Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/B-5910-2019; Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/S-5957-2019","Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/0000-0002-5238-6705; Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/0000-0002-5238-6705; Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/0000-0002-5238-6705",,,,,67,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

On the one hand, higher progressivity distorts individual labour supply decisions at the hours-of-work margin, on the other hand, it reduces unemployment by exerting downward pressure on wages. This trade-off is quantitatively assessed using a numerical model for Germany. The model combines a microsimulation module, which captures the labour-supply decisions of approximately 4,600 individual households, and a macro (computable general equilibrium) module, which features collective wage bargaining and involuntary unemployment. In the simulations carried out using this model, the optimal degree of tax progressivity turns out to be higher than the one in the actual German tax schedule. The optimum is located at marginal tax rates that are 6 percentage points higher than the actual rates (combined with a transfer that balances the public budget). The welfare gain from such a reform is modest, however. It amounts to no more than two euros per person per month.","[Boeters, Stefan] Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, CPB, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Boeters, Stefan] Ctr European Econ Res, ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Boeters, S (通讯作者)，Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, CPB, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",s.boeters@cpb.nl,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The preferred empirical specification restricts the data to neighborhoods that have numerous sales of recently constructed single-family detached homes located both within and outside development districts. The empirical results indicate that house prices for homes located within development districts are lower than house prices for similar homes located outside of development districts, but the amount of property tax capitalization is significantly less than full.

This paper focuses on an analysis of the forces transmitted to the baby carriages and their behavior during normal operation and critical maneuvers by public buses. The article presents partially the results obtained from a research project conducted by the Institute of Design and Manufacturing (IDF) of the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (Spain) in cooperation with the Institute for Automobile Research (INSIA) of the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Spain). The aim was to establish the technical requirements for accessibility and safety of baby carriages (US) or prams (UK) in public buses that could help national and international community to develop standards and provisions on this type of people mobility. A series of tests with different types of baby carriages were carried out in public transportation buses in closed tracks and open roads to simulate the behavior of critical maneuvers in urban traffic. From an analysis of the testing results it was possible to identify situations where restraint systems should be used, as well as the safest orientation and location within a bus for baby carriages, and enabled the development of a 'Code of Good Practice' for bus operators, users, and baby carriage manufacturers. Furthermore, the analysis of the dynamic forces allowed the development of a new restraint device for securing carriages inside the vehicle's passenger compartment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

First, economic size and multilateral trade liberalisation of countries are found to be the most important drivers of MEA participation across all clusters. Second, adjustment costs turn out to deter and, in particular, cross-cluster spillovers turn out to stimulate MEA participation across countries and clusters.","[Egger, Peter H.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Taxat, Said Business Sch, KOF,ETH Zurich,CEPR,WIFO,CESifo, Oxford, England; [Egger, Peter H.; Larch, Mario] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Globalisat & Econ Policy, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Jessberger, Christoph] Bauhaus Luftfahrt eV, Munich, Germany; [Larch, Mario] Univ Bayreuth, Ifo Inst Econ Res, CESifo, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Nottingham; University of Bayreuth; Ifo Institut,"Egger, PH (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Taxat, Said Business Sch, KOF,ETH Zurich,CEPR,WIFO,CESifo, Oxford, England.",,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",,,,,73,9,9,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2013,36.0,3,,,SI,,331,348,,10.1111/twec.12054,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,107OY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316229000005,0

Second, it analyses the environmental impacts in terms of the activities undertaken by the miners.

These were possibly side effects of the food control system.

The strength and direction of causal paths between psychological determinants and the acceptability of these policies are measured with survey data from students in New Jersey, USA and London. The estimated models show that a number of well-established psychological determinants provide an explanation for the acceptability of both policies and in both locations despite various differences in the policy scenarios. Scenario fairness appears to be the most important direct determinant of acceptability in both countries. We further verify the effect of specific trust in government on scenario fairness and other direct determinants that indicate the important role of government performance for achieving acceptability for these measures. Our findings further suggest that awareness of wider environmental issues, such as climate change, can lead to the support of specific sustainable transport policies, such as road pricing, which do not address climate change issues directly.

The Nordic countries, with their strong trade unions and well developed systems of social partnership around collective bargaining and vocational education and training, are found to be particularly advanced when it comes to developing more autonomous job roles.

Drawing upon qualitative research, the article compares the job of fitness instructor in Norway and the UK. The study finds little evidence of a clear country-level difference in job design, suggesting that if there is a national employment 'logic' it has been overwhelmed by specific industry dynamics.","[Lloyd, Caroline] Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales; [Payne, Jonathan] De Montfort Univ, Leicester Business Sch, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England",Cardiff University; De Montfort University,"Lloyd, C (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, SKOPE, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales.",lloydc4@cardiff.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,37,9,9,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

They propose an auction mechanism that results in an interval of possible individual contributions whose lower bound is the equal division. Here, instead we take a cooperative stand point by modelling this problem as a cost sharing game that turns out to be a 'reverse' airport game whose core is shown to have a regular structure. This enables an easy calculation of the nucleolus that happens to define the upper bound of the Kleindorfer-Sertel interval.

Very nice applications can be found in areas that rely on modeling via stochastic processes, such as finance. However, as for any other approach, the most crucial step is feeding the assumed model with data and estimation of model parameters. It is a matter of fact that financial processes are instable in time and often switch their regimes. Several scholars therefor suggest to specify some parts of financial models by means of fuzzy set theory. In this contribution the recent knowledge of fuzzy numbers and their approximation is utilized in order to suggest fuzzy-MC simulation to option price modeling in terms of fuzzy-random variables. In particular, we suggest three distinct fuzzy-random processes as an alternative to a standard crisp model and show application possibilities of one of them on illustrative example.","[Holcapek, Michal] Ctr Excellence IT4Innovat, Ostrava 70103 1, Czech Republic",,,michal.holcapek@osu.cz; tomas.tichy@osu.cz,"Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Holcapek, Michal/AAV-9459-2021; Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330;",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,273,278,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000047,0

The discomfort is usually proportional to the sum of demand-weighted network distances between the users and the nearest source of provided service. We assume that all facilities have equal setup cost and enough capacity to serve all users. Real instances of the weighted p-median problem are characterized by big number of possible service center locations, which can take the value of several thousands. In such cases the location-allocation approach usually fails due to enormous computational time or huge memory demands. This weakness has led to the approximate covering approach based on specific model reformulation. The disutility values are here estimated by some upper and lower bounds given by so called dividing points. Deployment of dividing points influences the solution accuracy. It is based on the idea that some disutility values can be considered relevant and are expected to obtain in the optimal solution. Hereby, we are studying various approaches to the relevance with their impact on the solution accuracy and saved computational time.","[Janacek, Jaroslav; Kvet, Marek] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,,Jaroslav.Janacek@fri.uniza.sk; Marek.Kvet@fri.uniza.sk,,,,,,,11,15,15,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,332,337,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000057,0

To do so, we study optimal incentive payments in a dynamic principal-agent framework in which the principal cannot observe the agent's investment, but only completed projects, and faces a Samaritan's Dilemma: he cannot commit to terminate the contract before completion of the project. The agent decides whether to undertake a (discrete) investment or consume all received funds. We find that the optimal contract is stationary, and that either transfers equal to investment cost are incentive compatible or the cost of the contract is decreasing with the agent's valuation of the projects.

For this purpose governments of transition countries try to encourage the inflow of foreign direct investment by various measures. Foreign direct investment, with other benefits, brings also many advantages such as new technologies, manufacturing processes, know-how and others. Despite this positive feedback, the theme of foreign direct investment and its impact on the economy is being discussed at many levels. In evaluating the impact of foreign direct investment on development, however, a key question is whether foreign direct investment crowd in domestic investment, or foreign direct investment crowd out domestic investment. The aim of this paper is to examine whether foreign direct investment in the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) crowd in or crowd out the domestic investment. For this purpose we apply theoretical model of investment that incorporates foreign direct investment as an exogenous variable. Data were tested with panel regression for the period 1993 - 2009. We found out that for the time period 1993 - 2009 there was an evidence of the effect of crowding out domestic investment by foreign direct investment in the Baltic States.","[Szkorupova, Zuzana] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,szkorupova@opf.slu.cz,"Szkorupova, Zuzana/AAA-6031-2021","Szkorupova, Zuzana/0000-0003-1328-7437",,,,,9,3,3,1,5,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,893,897,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000151,0

This study measures productivity to evaluate the effect of the deregulation reform. Using data from 205 firms from 1993 to 2004, we find that the deregulation effect differs depending on firm size.

In addition, mismodelling variable (assuming linear relation instead of non-linear one) or omission of another adjustment variable may result in generating spurious interactions in the model. For these reasons, it is necessary to pay attention to correct transformation of independent variables and thoroughgoing examination of all identified potential interactions. Presuming a linear negative-binomial model of claim frequency for given policy insurance portfolio, we demonstrate the effect of these two issues on the model and we analyse the altered model to examine the potential interactions. First and foremost, using treatment-effect plot and likelihood ratio test, we identify the potential interaction between risk factors and thereafter we perform the sensitivity analysis to assess the stability of interaction on variable transformation and on inclusion of other adjustment variables into the model Finally, we conclude which interactions may be considered as spurious and which should not be included into the model.","[Valecky, Jiri] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,jiri.valecky@vsb.cz,"Valecký, Jiří/I-3625-2018","Valecký, Jiří/0000-0002-5978-6111",,,,,20,0,0,0,0,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,980,985,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000166,0

As of July 2012, ten states and the District of Columbia enforce laws banning the use of hand-held cell phones while driving. Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have banned text messaging while driving. Recent studies of driver behavior suggest that hand-held wireless device usage negatively impacts driver performance. However few studies at the aggregate level address the plausible link between the use of hand-held wireless devices while driving, increased risk of automobile accidents, and government legislative efforts to reduce such risk. This paper analyzes data at the aggregate level and builds a regression model to estimate the long term accident rate reduction due to a hand-held ban. This model differs from previous studies, which consider short term accident rate reduction, by considering time trends in the accident rate due to the ban. Additionally, counties considered in this analysis are placed into groups based on driver density, defined by the number of licensed drivers per centerline mile of roadway, and a separate analysis is performed within these groups. This approach allows one to better quantify the effect of hand-held bans in counties of different driver densities. Results from this paper suggest that bans on hand-held wireless device use while driving reduce the rate of personal injury accidents in counties with high levels of driver density, but may increase accident rates in counties with low driver density levels. These results can inform transportation policymakers interested in reducing automobile-accident-risk attributable to the use of hand-held wireless devices while driving. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors apply the most up-to-date and robust method available in the literature to distinguish vertically and horizontally differentiated products: the Azhar and Elliott method (2006). The results clearly show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, a large proportion of European countries simultaneously exports and imports comparable amounts of tourism services. Moreover, the predominance of vertical differentiation in these intra-tourism flows suggests that international specialization is taking place in Europe within the tourism sector itself, along the spectrum of quality.","[Nowak, Jean-Jacques] Univ Lille 1, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, Lab EQUIPPE, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Petit, Sylvain] Univ Valenciennes, IDP, Valenciennes, France; [Sahli, Mondher] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand",Universite de Lille; Universite Polytechnique Hauts-de-France; Victoria University Wellington,"Nowak, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 1, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, Lab EQUIPPE, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",jean-jacques.nowak@univ-lille1.fr,"Petit, Sylvain/AGF-1646-2022","Petit, Sylvain/0000-0003-3391-5285",,,,,76,9,11,2,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Whereas Slovakia joined the common currency in January 2009 the Czech Republic has adopted a more sceptical attitude with the question of Euro adoption postponed indefinitely. Given the relative similarities of the two states' institutional apparatuses and economic structures it is unsurprising that standard accounts of monetary policymaking struggle to explain the divergence in attitudes towards the EMU. This article presents a constructivist understanding of the politics of Eurozone accession strategies by focusing on the role of legitimising discourses in the political process. These are conceptualised as the historically-informed sum total of inter-subjectively held beliefs held by elites and masses within a particular political system. By focusing on the ideational aspects of Euro adoption we are able to understand how each country's early experience with EU accession fed into differing perceptions of national purpose and the relative importance of European integration. Whereas the Czech Republic increasingly favoured greater national assertion and policy independence, Slovakia came to understand Eurozone membership as an important tool in reversing the feelings of isolationism experienced during the Meciar period. A focus on these competing discourses helps us to understand the divergence in Euro-adoption strategies and in turn serves to enrich the debate on EU economic and monetary integration by highlighting the limitations of rationalist analyses.","London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Pechova, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,,,,,78,11,11,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In multi-level bargaining, principalagent and bureaucratization theories focus on loss of control and constructivists suggest that governments can become trapped in rhetoric. This article shows that paradoxical agreements can be voluntary and explains them by showing the rationale behind multi-games that include ambiguity about the future. In particular, increasing the flexibility of the agreement allowed negotiators to escape present-day constituent pressures by remaining ambiguous and betting on shifting coalitions.","[Woll, Cornelia] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Woll, Cornelia] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Max Planck Society,"Woll, C (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,50,1,1,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We argue that ownership of reputation signals by prestigious banks rendered them able and willing to monitor government borrowing. Monitoring was a source of rent, and it led bankers to support countries facing liquidity crises in a manner similar to modern descriptions of relationship lending to corporate clients by parent banks. Prestigious bankers ability to implement conditionality loans and monitor countries financial policies also enabled them to deal with solvency. We find that, compared with prestigious bankers, bondholders committees had neither the tools nor the prestige required for effectively dealing with defaulters.

Until 1940, mission schools, mainly run by African converts, provided the bulk of education at extremely low costs. Given the limited financial capacity of missionary societies, the Africanization of the mission was a prerequisite for rising enrolment rates and this only occurred in areas where the demand for Western education was high.

The vast majority of visitors to Venice are foreigners (both tourists and day-visitors) who come from all over the world. In this research they are mainly categorized as non-Italian Europeans or non-Europeans. A specific theoretical model, in which quality conservation is provided publicly and also privately through donations, is presented for nationals and for foreigners. The data are obtained from a contingent valuation survey carried out in Venice, the aim of which was to estimate visitors' willingness to donate (WTD) to the Venice flood defence programme. Demand functions are estimated by applying a two-stage regression model. The authors show that the majority of visitors are willing to donate. On average, Italians and non-Europeans would donate more than non-Italian Europeans. As expected, these visitor categories have different mean WTD and different behavioural functions which are affected by attitudinal and economic variables. Bequest value is the main donation motive. Those who identify this as a donation motive, on average, state the highest WTD and the highest degree of certainty to donate. This result seems to confirm empirically the validity of the sustainable development principle applied to the management of Venice as a cultural tourist site.","[Brandolini, Silva Marzetti Dall'Aste] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Disegna, Marta] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Bolzano, Italy",University of Bologna; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Brandolini, SMD (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",silva.marzetti@unibo.it,"Disegna, Marta/O-8210-2018","Disegna, Marta/0000-0002-3638-6772",,,,,38,9,10,0,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This is relevant for issues of social choice: if two individuals hold different beliefs then we might want to find a compromise that lies somewhere between them. We propose a set of axioms that determine a measure of distance uniquely. This measure differs from the widely used Hamming metric. The difference between Hamming's metric and ours boils down to one axiom. Given judgment sets A and B, this axiom says that if the propositions in jointly imply that the propositions in A-B share the same truth value, then the disagreement between A and B over those propositions in A-B should be counted as a single disagreement. We consider the application of our metric to judgment aggregation, and also use the metric to measure the distance between preference rankings.","[Duddy, Conal; Piggins, Ashley] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Piggins, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Galway, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",conal.duddy@nuigalway.ie; ashley.piggins@nuigalway.ie,"Duddy, Conal/IYS-6034-2023","Duddy, Conal/0000-0002-7801-9305",,,,,24,21,21,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2012,39.0,4,,,,,855,867,,10.1007/s00355-011-0565-y,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,015VE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309473700009,0

When the buyer of an owner-occupied home spends a large amount of money on a house, he pays the bill to cover not only construction costs but also the premium for an at-the-money call on the house. With loss aversion, he believes that if the house price rises from its current price (i.e., the strike price), he may make a profit by selling the house. On other hand, if the house price drops, he just keeps the house to wait for a better selling price, and treats the house as a durable good that provides him with shelter. The dual role of houses enables the homebuyer to enjoy the upside potential from the viewpoint of investment, but to eliminate the downside risk from the viewpoint of consumption. As a result, we propose that homebuyers are often willing to pay more for a house as a call premium. In addition, both the homeownership constraint and the homebuyer's ambiguity aversion will influence his subjective evaluation of the call.","[So, Leh-chyan] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Hung, Mao-wei] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Management, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University; National Taiwan University,"So, LC (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, 101 Sect 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",lcso@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,16,4,5,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

There are also important social costs which stem from passengers feeling unsafe, not to mention the environmental costs of removing graffiti and repairing vandalism.

First, we consider the definitions of graffiti and vandalism that are often conflated. After providing some clarification on terminology, and proposing a media-centred approach to vandalism and graffiti, we consider various theorisations of the psychosocial determinants of vandalism and graffiti behaviour. We then turn to an empirical discussion of different technical and social, non-technical prevention programmes that have been trialled. With a focus on identifying what works and under what circumstances, we refer to international case studies of successful vandalism reduction initiatives from Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Australia. Based on a review of literature and practice, we outline a future research agenda to address vandalism and graffiti. We recommend lines of further research covering: theory, empirical data collection and practical initiatives. Specifically, we note the need for a trans-theoretical model of vandalism and graffiti, further ethnographic research and improved evaluation and benchmarking strategies. This is the first review dedicated to the topic of vandalism and graffiti in the rail industry and the first review of non-technical, social deterrents to vandalism and graffiti broadly.

When exchange rate changes are higher than the threshold value, the coefficient is positive. This means that continued tourism development can greatly enhance economic growth. If a currency continues to depreciate dramatically, the correlation between the two will disappear. The interactions between tourism development and economic growth are different under various ratio threshold values of exchange rate changes. This study shows that, if the government pays attention to trends in exchange rates and implements appropriate policies, tourism can effectively boost economic growth; at the same time, inflation suppresses economic growth. Tourism can potentially contribute to economic development and so it is advisable for governments to dedicate strategic resources to tourism in order to boost short-term economic growth.","Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, Kaohsiung 81164, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Wang, YS (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, 2 Juo Yue Rd, Kaohsiung 81164, Taiwan.",yushan@nkfust.edu.tw,,,,,,,11,27,27,0,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Through a detailed analysis of IMF Board discussions surrounding the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), this article sheds light on the mechanics of power in this often overlooked venue of global economic governance. By exploring the key issues of default liability and loan conditionality, I demonstrate that whilst the Boardroom is a more active site of contestation than has hitherto been recognized, material power is a prime determinant of both Executive Directors' preferences and outcomes reached from discussions. And as the decisions reached form the backbone of the 'instruction sheet' used by Fund staff to guide their everyday operational decisions, these outcomes-and the processes through which they were reached-were factors of primary importance in stabilizing the operational norms at the heart of a controversial phase in the contemporary history of IMF concessional lending.","Univ York, Dept Polit, Derwent Coll, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Clegg, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Polit, Derwent Coll, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",liam.clegg@york.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I018603/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I018603/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,79,13,15,3,53,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The ability to disentangle the joint effect of dividend yield and dividend size on ex-dividend stock prices is thus of central importance in assessing existing theories. Fortunately, the REIT asset class provides data having a low correlation between dividend size and dividend yield allowing for a cleaner assessment of the extant theories. Evidence from the present study indicates that results that are typically interpreted as confirmatory of the tax-induced clientele effect may be spurious. Instead, transaction costs and limit order adjustments are likely the determinants of the observed relationships between the change in price to dividend ratio, dividend yield, and dividend size.","[Hardin, William G., III] Florida Int Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Huang, Gow-Cheng] Alabama State Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Montgomery, AL 36101 USA; [Liano, Kartono] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Alabama State University; Mississippi State University,"Hardin, WG (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, 11200 SW 8th St,MARC 231, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",hardinw@fiu.edu; ghuang@alasu.edu; kliano@cobilan.msstate.edu,,,,,,,26,5,5,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

(Real Estate Economics, 30, 165-183, 2002a, Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 24, 59-87, 2002b) it has become practice to treat the compound variable occupied stock as a supply variable. In this study we show that this variable deserves a more critical investigation and that the general view of a supply variable may be misleading. Using panel data covering 30 urban areas for 17 years, we investigate the rental adjustment process in the German office market. The application of recently developed cointegration techniques for non-stationary panel data in conjunction with the corresponding error correction model (ECM) enables us to overcome the data limitations, particularly existent for most European real estate markets. Hence, our primary motivation is (a) to demonstrate how occupied stock should be interpreted correctly and (b) to provide useful insights into the long-term relationships and short-run dynamics of real office prime rents. The empirical evidence suggests that a one percent rise in office employment increases real rents on average by 1.64% through higher demand for office space. On the other hand, a one percent increase in the supply of office space decreases real rents in the long run by 2.25%. The results from the error correction model show that deviations from the long-run equilibrium lead to an adjustment process which restores equilibrium within approximately 3 years.","[Adams, Zeno; Fuess, Roland] European Business Sch, Oestrich Winkel, Germany",European Business School (EBS) University,"Adams, Z (通讯作者)，European Business Sch, Oestrich Winkel, Germany.",zeno.adams@ebs.edu; roland.fuess@ebs.edu,,,,,,,48,11,11,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Focusing on the case of Germany, the article argues that debates on enlargement at the EU and national levels have been growing apart since the 1970s, and discusses the implications of this discursive gap for the public legitimization of past and future enlargements.","IBEI, E-08001 Barcelona, Spain",,"Herranz-Surrallés, A (通讯作者)，IBEI, Elisabets 10, E-08001 Barcelona, Spain.",Aherranz@ibei.org,,"Herranz-Surralles, Anna/0000-0002-2871-1782",,,,,45,10,12,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this article, we explore the effects of urban villages on the formal housing market. For this purpose, we develop a hedonic housing price model to investigate whether the proximity to urban villages affects the selling price of urban housing units. Controlling for the structure and other characteristics of urban housing units, we find that housing prices are lower the closer the buildings are from urban villages. We then carry out a survey of households living nearby and explore how they are affected by urban villages.

We present new, comparable data on school inputs and outputs for BRIC drawn from contemporary surveys and government documents. Recent studies emphasize the importance of political decentralization, and relatively broad political voice for the early spread of public primary education in developed economies. We identify the former and the lack of the latter to be important in the context of BRIC, but we also outline how other factors such as factor endowments, colonialism, serfdom, and, especially, the characteristics of the political and economic elite help explain the low achievement levels of these four countries and the incredible amount of heterogeneity within each of them.

Our findings are threefold. First, the results show that international real estate mutual funds perform better and are less risky than domestic real estate mutual funds before Jun 2007. That is, diversification benefits outweigh the information costs, and investors therefore gain from investing in international real estate mutual funds. However, the benefit is reduced because of the economic shock of sub-prime financial crisis. Second, on average, neither international mutual fund managers nor domestic mutual fund managers possess market timing abilities. Finally, we find that fund flows are driven by investors' return-chasing behaviors and fund size, but not by diversification purpose.","[Lu, Chiuling] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Shen, Yang-pin; Lin, Zong-Han] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Finance, Chungli 320, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; Yuan Ze University,"Lu, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",chiulinglu@management.ntu.edu.tw,"Lin, Zong-Han/HSG-0504-2023",,,,,,23,12,15,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The approach, which facilitates welfare analysis of exogenous policy and price changes, is used empirically to study the effects of an increased CO2 tax. In particular, we focus on the effect of including substitution between households choice of the number of trips and days to spend at a destination in the welfare analysis. The analysis reveals that the equivalent variation (EV) measure, for the count data demand system, can be seen as an upper bound for the households welfare loss. Approximating the welfare loss by the change in consumer surplus, accounting for the positive effect from longer stays, imposes a lower bound on the households welfare loss. The difference in the estimated loss measures, from the considered CO2 tax reform, is about 20%. This emphasizes the importance of accounting for substitutions toward longer stays in travel demand policy evaluations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This article examines democracy in the Union from the perspective of citizens by asking what determines satisfaction with EU democracy? Two key models of regime support are applied to the European Union: the output-oriented performance model and the input-oriented procedural model. Contrary to previous work, it is argued here that there is a positive spillover effect from confidence in national institutions to the European level. These propositions are tested using survey data from 27 EU Member States.

Subjects include 2151 schoolchildren aged 7-13 derived from cross-sectional waves of the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Surveys in 1995 and in 2002. Diet was assessed by 24-h recall and physical activity (h/week) and household income by parental questionnaire. Hours spent in vigorous activities were low (1.0-1.5 h/week), and time spent in sedentary behaviors increased from 31 to 37 h/week between 1995 and 2002. In 1995 there was a direct relationship of income to energy and fat intake, and time spent in vigorous activity, and an inverse relationship of income to h/week spent in moderate activities (such as walking to school). The effect of having low income parents was less in 2002 than in 1995. Overweight prevalence did not differ significantly by income in either year, but there was a significant decline in overweight among high income children. Only hours spent in moderate physical activity was moderately protective against overweight. Income disparities do not explain trends in overweight among Russian children.

As obesity is a confirmed risk factor for a number of diseases, its increasing prevalence nurtures the supposition that obesity may present a growing and significant economic burden to society. The objective of this study is to analyse the correlation between body mass index (BMI) and future direct and indirect costs, as well as the correlation between changing BMI and future in(direct) costs. Health care utilisation and productivity losses were based on data from 2581 participants aged 25-65 years (1994/95) from two cross-sectional, population-representative health surveys (MONICA/KORA-survey-S3 1994/95 and follow-up KORA-survey-F3 2004/05) in Augsburg, Germany. The predicted average adjusted total direct costs per year and per user were estimated to be is an element of 1029-(healthy weight), is an element of 1093-(overweight) and is an element of 1040-(obesity). There are significantly greater future costs in the utilisation of general practitioners per user and per year at higher obesity levels (is an element of 72; is an element of 75; is an element of 96). The average total direct costs per person for those who stay in the same BMI class are is an element of 982, is an element of 1000 and is an element of 973. An overweight participant who becomes obese incurs significant costs of internists of is an element of 160 compared with those who remain overweight (is an element of 124). An overweight user incurs indirect costs of is an element of 2474, compared with is an element of 2136 for those who remain a healthy weight. There is a trend for higher predicted (in)direct costs when people are overweight or obese compared with healthy weight persons 10 years earlier.

The article argues that the social construction of professionalism is linked to servicing, organizing and political campaigning models of internal trade union activity. Moreover, the increasing importance of the organizing model is associated with a shift away from a traditional conceptualization of professionalism towards the managerial professional model described by Faulconbridge and Muzio in which concepts such as strategy, targets and efficiency prevail. There is, however, fragmentation between the socially constructed conceptualizations of professionalism held by organizers and senior organizers. These conflicting conceptualizations are linked to both organizers' and senior organizers' everyday practices and concerns in the context of change and uncertainty.","Univ Hull, Sch Business, OB HRM, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Hull,"Thursfield, D (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Business, OB HRM, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",d.thursfield@hull.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,11,11,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Peak oil from an energy perspective means that there will be progressively less fuel. Our work treats changes in oil supply as a risk to transport activity systems. A virtual reality survey method, based on the sim game concept, has been developed to audit the participant's normal weekly travel activity, and to explore participant's travel adaptive capacity. The travel adaptive capacity assessment (TACA) Sim survey uses avatars, Google MapTM, 2D scenes, interactive screens and feedback scores. Travel adaptive capacity is proposed as a measure of long-range resilience of activity systems to fuel supply decline. Mode adaptive potential is proposed as an indicator of the future demand growth for less energy intensive travel. Both adaptation indicators can be used for peak oil vulnerability assessment. A case study was conducted involving 90 participants in Christchurch New Zealand. All of the participants were students, general staff or academics at the University of Canterbury. The adaptive capacity was assessed by both simulated extreme fuel price shock and by asking, do you have an alternative mode? without price pressure. The travel adaptive capacity in number of kilometers was 75% under a 5-fold fuel price increase. The mode adaptive potential was 33% cycling, 21% walking and 22% bus. Academics had adaptive capacity of only 1-5% of trips by canceling or carrying out their activity from home compared to 10-18% for students. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, inter-organizational knowledge networks and collaborations may incur costs, challenges and risks to organizations and their individuals. To build up stable and sustained inter-organizational networks and inter-organizational electronic knowledge sharing, these obstacles must be overcome. Most prior theoretical and empirical research on knowledge sharing has focused on the within-firm context. Most theoretical studies on inter-organizational systems (IOS) have focused on organizational adoption, and most empirical studies have mainly focused on supply-chain organizations, those that are vertically-linked. The objective of this research is to develop a model of the key antecedents of knowledge workers' adoption of IOKSS in organizations that are horizontally-linked. Based on KM and IOS literature, these factors include the characteristics of the knowledge workers, their relationships with peers, the organization, the proposed IOKSS system and the sector/industry.","[Al-Busaidi, Kamla Ali] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Al Khoud, Oman",Sultan Qaboos University,,kamlaa@squ.edu.om,"Al-Busaidi, Kamla Ali/R-6435-2017",,,,,,42,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,247,258,,,,,,12,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700027,0

However, this result may at least partially be due to the coarseness of the measures of direct real estate returns or the relatively short return horizons used in previous studies. This study takes a different and unique perspective. Unlike earlier studies we do not use aggregated, average appraisal based returns on direct real estate investment. Instead, we use the MIT TBI indexes, which are transaction based price indexes, available both on the aggregate and sub-index levels. We find that the relation between REIT and direct real estate returns appears to be stronger at longer horizons. More specifically, using a cointegration framework, we find robust evidence that REITs and the underlying real estate are related and that they share a long run equilibrium. Interestingly, we find that both REITs and direct real estate returns adjust towards this long run relationship. When we examine property type level data we find similar results.","[Boudry, Walter I.; Liu, Crocker H.] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Coulson, N.

The first component, the specific structure of the bureaucracy and state-industry relations, has been the focus of intense research. However, the second, the particular industrial economic ideology defining the correct role of the state in industry and industry in a state, is at least as important, if under-researched. In order to do empirically advance the argument the paper merges a cognitive-based constructivist argument with a neo-developmental state structuralist one, to present a new understanding of the role of the state in the Irish miracle that explains not only its success and failures but its internal dissonances, such as the continuous discrimination of the local, Irish-owned, industry in favor of foreign-owned MNCs. The paper illustrates how a particular industrial economic ideology has been formed and crystallized in Ireland. Focusing on the IT industry and using a multimethod research strategy, it traces the influence and evolution of this ideology at five critical decision points over a fifty-year period.","[Breznitz, Dan] Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Breznitz, Dan] Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Management, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Breznitz, D (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",,,,,,,,96,18,19,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, these conflicts evolved into bilateral ones between two popular-nationalist movements with competing territorial claims: newly independent nation states, on the one hand, and minority groups with autonomous status, on the other.","CIMERA, CH-1211 Geneva 1, Switzerland",,"Cheterian, V (通讯作者)，CIMERA, 1 Rue Vuache,POB 1242, CH-1211 Geneva 1, Switzerland.",vicken.cheterian@cimera.org,,,,,,,69,1,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,9,,,SI,,1625,1649,,10.1080/09668136.2012.718415,0.0,,,25,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,015ET,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309429000002,0

Although we support the idea that Hume was in some way a hedonist - evidently different from Bentham's or Jevons' way - we lay emphasis less on continuity than on the specific kind of hedonism encountered in Hume's writings (chiefly the Treatise, the second Enquiry, the Dissertation, or some of his Essays). Such hedonism clearly contrasts to its standard modern inheritance, expressed by the relation between preferences and utility. The reason for such a difference with the usual approach lies in the mental process that Hume puts to the fore in order to explain the way pleasure determines desires and volition. Whereas pleasure is primarily, in Hume's words, an impression of sensation, it takes place in the birth of passions as reflecting an idea of pleasure, whose force and vivacity is precisely a belief, transferred to the direct passions of desire or volition that come immediately before action. As a result, from a Humean point of view, belief deals with decision under risk or uncertainty, as well as with intertemporal decision and indiscrimination problems. The latter are explored within a formal framework, and it is shown that the relation of pleasure is transformed by belief into a non-empty class of relations of desire, among which at least one is a preorder.","[Diaye, Marc-Arthur] CREST ENSAI Ensai, F-35172 Bruz, France; [Lapidus, Andre] Univ Paris 01, PHARE, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Lapidus, Andre] CNRS, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information (ENSAI); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Diaye, MA (通讯作者)，CREST ENSAI Ensai, Campus Ker Lann,Rue Blaise Pascal, F-35172 Bruz, France.",marc-arthur.diaye@ensai.fr; lapidus@univ-paris1.fr,,"Lapidus, Andre/0000-0003-4412-821X",,,,,31,5,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

We consider the fully non-linear dynamics following large aggregate shocks in a calibrated OLG model with standard preferences. We find that the main effect of a down payment constraint is to make house price dynamics asymmetric between large positive and large negative income shocks: prices increase rapidly following the impact effect of a large adverse income shock but decline slowly following the impact effect of a positive income shock. This asymmetry stems from the fact that the share of borrowing constrained households changes over time. However, the down payment constraint does not substantially magnify the impact effect of adverse income or interest rate shocks.","[Maattanen, Niku] Helsinki Ctr Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University,,essi.eerola@vatt.fi; niku.maattanen@etla.fi,,"Maattanen, Niku/0000-0003-4026-648X",,,,,29,0,0,1,18,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

This is especially true for various sequential procedures used in spatial sampling and for fixed-cost (or sum-quota) schemes. Such a phenomenon presents a significant challenge for constructing estimates of finite population totals based on the Horvitz-Thompson approach. Such a challenge may be overcome by replacing unknown first-order inclusion probabilities with estimates computed in a simulation study which is enabled by the knowledge of the sampling scheme. Such estimates may be calculated in several ways, which influences stochastic properties of the Horvitz-Thompson statistic. Available auxiliary information may also be used to improve their accuracy. In this paper isotonic regression algorithms are applied to capitalize on limited auxiliary information and to improve the accuracy of simulation-assisted design-based estimates for finite population totals.","[Gamrot, Wojciech] Univ Econ Katowice, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,,wojciech.gamrot@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,16,4,4,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,207,212,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900036,0

More recently, scholars have sought to challenge this binary view by examining how nationalists have employed neoliberal policies for nationalist reasons. However, while showing how neoliberal policies can be compatible with nationalist values, these approaches have not examined whether the reverse might also be true, whether certain nationalist policies (and discourses) might be genuinely compatible with neoliberal values. To address this gap in the literature, this paper makes two arguments. The first is that certain nationalist policies are not only compatible with neoliberal values, but that these values may actually be dependent on certain nationalist policies. The second argument made is that neoliberal nationalism may be on the rise due to a shift among social democratic forces from a broad strategy of economic nationalism to one of social democratic multilateralism. To demonstrate these points, the paper challenges the equation of neoliberalism with internationalism as well as showing why neoliberal nationalism is distinct from the nationalism of both populist and neoconservatives.","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Polit Sci, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Harmes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Polit Sci, London, ON, Canada.",,,"Harmes, Adam/0000-0002-1531-3574",,,,,71,90,102,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

According to this, the international competitiveness of the Hungarian agriculture broke down and today the question arises regarding how the Hungarian agriculture could compete with the foreign companies. The technical development in agriculture is the fishbone of complex development activities. It originates from the fact that the technical development in agriculture covers and integrates the biological, chemical and technical factors. In addition to that we have to calculate with the ecological conditions and the tasks of human resources management on the micro level. These factors are strengthened by the effects of the social-political-economic surroundings.

Income inequality itself is a problem that needs to be addressed. Yet, the dilemma whether economic freedom and income inequality actually help to explain the corresponding differences in and across countries economic growth rates are still in debate. Thus, the aims of this study were to examine the link between income inequality and economic growth, and to determine the effect of economic freedom on economic growth. Data were gathered from 44 developing countries from year 1976 to 2005 and analysed using a dynamic panel GMM estimation technique. Besides, the economic freedom, income inequality and economic growth data, data on institutional, investment, population and human capital are added to control variation in economic growth. It is argued that there are interactions between economic freedom, income inequality and economic growth. The empirical results reveal that economic freedom and income inequality are statistically significant determinants of economic growth. Improvement in both economic freedom and income equality lead to economic growth. Increasing the economic growth had been the centre of economic policymaking in many countries around the globe. As such, the issues presented in this study would serve as important guidelines towards understanding the influence of the economic variables and provides a platform for debate on the experiences of developing countries in increasing the economic growth in their countries.","[Ismail, Norhazlin] Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Melaka, Malaysia; [Hook, Law Siong] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Multimedia University; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Ismail, N (通讯作者)，Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Melaka, Malaysia.",,"Law, Siong Hook/AAF-6672-2020","Law, Siong Hook/0000-0002-6058-4883",,,,,23,1,1,8,36,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,683,+,,,,,,4,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600059,0

The focus of the first phase was on the impact on macroeconomic fluctuations of errors in time (Fanno 1933) or, which comes to the same, of the disappointment of expectations (Hicks 1933). This was in line with the replacement of the paradigm of General Equilibrium Theory - which took place in those years and whose framework is logical time - by the new paradigm of Uncertainty and Expectations - whose framework is historical time and whose initial centre of gravitation was the fluctuations of effective demand (Keynes 1936). The scope of this paper is to evaluate the role assigned to errors in time or disappointment of expectations in the theory of macroeconomic fluctuations. The paper is divided in two parts. The first is concerned with the achievements of the 'years of high theory', the second with the achievements of the 'years of rational expectations'. The first part provides a benchmark for evaluating the achievements discussed in the second part. The paper shows that the focus on errors in time has been replaced in recent times by a set of assumptions and arguments which either neglect the impact on fluctuations of the disappointment of expectations or even exclude the very possibility of this disappointment. The paper concludes by comparing the achievements of macroeconomic theory in the two phases of its development and by ranking their different relevance for the modern theory of fluctuations.","Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali M Fanno, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Meacci, F (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali M Fanno, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",ferdinando.meacci@unipd.it,,,,,,,69,0,0,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

We assume that there are three following scenarios: 1) there is no supporting research fund for the researcher, 2) there is a supporting fund to use without any restrictions, and 3) the researcher has to seek for his own research fund through his applied research with firms in the industry. This paper, in particular, focuses on the first and second scenarios. Then it explores academic researchers' behaviors that optimize their utility functions, the satisfaction obtained by their research outputs. This paper characterizes these outputs as the results of researchers' 3C: Competence (the ability to implement the research), Commitment (the effort to do the research), and Contribution (finding meaning in the research). While most of the previous research utilized the empirical methods to study researcher's motivation to collaborate, the literature cannot develop a coherent insight of researcher's behavior without a supporting economic theory. To help fill this gap, we explore the interval factors formulating academic researcher's utility function, and examine how these factors affect individual motivation to collaborate. Our contribution is important both conceptually and practically because it provides the first theoretical framework to study the mechanism of researcher's behavior.","[Nguyen Huu Phuc; Matsuura, Yoshiyuki; Kubo, Motonobu] Yamaguchi Univ, Grad Sch Innovat & Technol Management, Ube, Yamaguchi 7558611, Japan",Yamaguchi University,,phuc@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp; matu@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp; kubomo@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,5,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-3854-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,869,876,,,,,,8,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDF49,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313020500137,0

Nearing spatial equilibrium would imply that site-specific factors such as amenities and location within the urban hierarchy substantially subside in their influence on net-migration and relative population growth because their values have been capitalized into prices, causing interregional utility levels to become approximately equal. Yet, in an examination of U.S. counties, we find empirical evidence of only slight ebbing of natural amenity-based migration after 2000 and little slowing of population redistribution from peripheral towards core urban areas. Instead, the primary finding is a downward shift in the responsiveness of relative population growth to spatially asymmetric demand shocks post-2000, and associated increased responsiveness of local area labor supply, more consistent with European regional labor markets. Additional sensitivity analysis, including instrumental variable estimation, confirms the result. Quantile regression analysis suggests that our findings are not due to a difference in regional labor market tightness between the 1990s and post-2000. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the sample and theoretical autocorrelations implied by short and long memory SV models peak at the same power transformation, which is close to one for realistic values of the model parameters. Consequently, we suggest that the power that maximizes the sample autocorrelations could be used as an additional descriptive tool for the adequacy of a SV model.

As the research result, an improvement proposal model is presented. In the model, the continuous improvement activity and suggestion scheme are combined into a single operating model. The operating model combines the requirements of the continuous improvement activity, which have been indicated in the literature, and the observations on the best functioning continuous improvement operating model made in the empirical section. The cornerstones of a successful continuous improvement model are the swift and equal evaluation of the suggestions, encouraging rewards, recognition, and feedback. A supportive organisational culture will make it easier for the continuous improvement model to succeed. The support of the management is crucial for the activities.

However, traditional approaches such as ordinary least squares (OLS) have limitations in investigating such patterns. Unlike OLS regression, geographically weighted regression (GWR) allows the coefficients of explanatory variables to differ by locality by giving relatively more weight to geographically close observations. GWR depicts spatial patterns. This paper examines the pattern of height and crude death rate in the United States prior to the Civil War by this method.

Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), I report three new findings. First, family income and childhood obesity are generally negatively correlated, but for children in very low-income families, they are positively correlated. Second, the negative association between family income and Body Mass Index (BMI) is especially strong and significant among high-BMI children. Third, the difference in obesity rates between children from low- and high-income families increases as children age. This study further investigates potential factors that might contribute to a rapid increase in the obesity rate among low-income children. I find that their faster weight gain, rather than slower height growth, is a greater contributor to the rapid increase in their BMI over time. On the other hand, I also find that the faster weight gain by low-income children cannot be attributed to any single factor, such as participation in school meal programs, parental characteristics, or individual characteristics. These findings add to the current obesity debate by demonstrating that the key to curbing childhood obesity may lie in factors generating different obesity rates across income levels.

Understanding the extent to which the crucial factors influence tourists' choice of overnight trip can be a key to successful marketing and strategic planning in the domestic travel industry. To understand the characteristics of the domestic overnight tourists, this paper analyses the data by means of a proposed new impact analysis approach, which overcomes some limitations of the conventional impact analysis approach. It also investigates how socio-demographic factors, fuel price and domestic airfares affect the probability of tourists opting for domestic overnight trips. Impact analysis is a method for analysing the association of the impact factor with the response variable in terms of estimated probability. This research demonstrates that household income, country of birth, life-cycle stage and home state are four of the most significant categories that generate the highest maximum impact on the overnight trip decision.","Tourism Res Australia, Dept Resources Energy & Tourism, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,"Pang, KP (通讯作者)，Tourism Res Australia, Dept Resources Energy & Tourism, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",benpang@netspace.net.au,,,,,,,19,3,3,0,8,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We identify four structural shocks by combining a single long-run restriction to identify a permanent output shock with three sign restrictions to identify demand- and supply-side transitory shocks. We show that during both the inter-war and post-war periods the structural correlation between inventories and real interest rate conditional on identified interest rate shocks is systematically positive; the reduced-form correlation between the two series is positive during the post-war period, but in line with the predictions of theory it is robustly negative during the inter-war era; during that era the correlations between inventories and either of the two other series exhibit a remarkably strong co-movement with output at business cycle frequencies.

This paper attempts to reconcile the empirical evidence with the theoretical predictions by introducing a model where South-South trade can produce the observed patterns of skill premia in the South. In this context, South-South trade expands the import range of the country that reduces the tariff. This increases the demand for and the cost of skilled workers in the other country. This also leads the country that reduces the tariff to expand its export range and reduce its import range. Therefore, the country that reduces the tariff experiences an increase in its export range, which leads to an increase in the skill premium. As the impact on the import range is ambiguous, it is possible that the other country experiences a decline in the skill premium. Thus, trade liberalisation between Southern countries can cause an increase in the skill premium in one and a decrease in the skill premium in another.","Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Steven G Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Khalifa, S (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Steven G Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2014,37.0,11,,,,,1634,1648,,10.1111/twec.12184,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AU3JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345510100008,0

In parallel, academic research on purchase intentions has dramatically increased. Originally, most studies have focused on utility attributes and price. More recently, several hybrid choice models have been estimated to include the impact of attitudes on choice probabilities. In addition, a few studies have caught the attention to social influence. In contributing to this line of research, this paper reports the results of an expanded hybrid choice, which simultaneously estimated all these different effects in a single integrated model of purchase intention. Results indicate that the model performs well. Costs considerations contribute most to the utility of electric cars. Social influence is less important, but there is also evidence that people tend to take it into consideration when there are positive public opinions about electric cars and the market share becomes almost half of friends of their social network. The intention to purchase an electric car is also influenced by attitudes about environmental concerns and technology acceptance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Most studies on these associations used questionnaires to determine environmental perceptions, but such tools may be subject to bias due to unreliable recall. Moreover, questionnaires only measure separate environmental characteristics, while real environments are a combination of different characteristics. To overcome these limitations, the present proof of concept study used panoramic photographs of cycling environments to capture direct responses to the physical environment. We examined which depicted environmental characteristics were associated to environments' invitingness for transportation cycling. Furthermore, interactions with gender and participants' cycling behavior were examined. Methods: Fifty-nine middle-aged adults were recruited through purposeful convenience sampling. During a home visit, participants took part in a structured interview assessing demographics and PA during the preceding seven days, followed by an intuitive choice task and a (cognitive) rating task, which both measured 40 photographed environments' invitingness to cycle along. Multi-level cross-classified analyses were conducted using MLwiN 2.26. Results: Both tasks' multivariate results showed that presence of vegetation was identified as the most important environmental characteristic to invite people for engaging in transportation cycling, even when the amount of vegetation was relatively small. In the bivariate analyzes, some differences between results of the cognitive rating task and the intuitive choice task were found, showing that invitingness measured by the rating task was associated with environmental maintenance and cycling infrastructure, whereas invitingness determined by the choice task was associated with more traffic-oriented characteristics. Moreover, only for the choice task's results, moderating effects of gender and participants' cycling behavior in the preceding week were observed. Conclusion: The present study provides proof of concept that capturing people's less cognitive, more intuitive responses to an environment's invitingness for transport-related cycling may be important for revealing environment-behavior associations. If replicated in future studies using larger samples, results of our innovative measurements with photographs, especially those on vegetation, can complete the existing knowledge on which environmental characteristics are important for transportation cycling in adults and could form a basis to inform health promoters and local policy makers. However, future studies replicating our study method in larger samples and other population subgroups are highly encouraged. Moreover, causal relationships should be explored. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Such biases are probably not large enough to impact game outcomes but could affect gambling markets. Our findings support the conclusion that relatively shorter NBA referees officiate basketball games differently than their taller peers.

This study utilizes a hurdle travel cost model to investigate the demand for and economic benefits of agritourism. The analysis includes an estimation of consumer surplus as one means to estimate the market size for this sector. The standard travel cost model assumes a single-purpose recreational trip; but, as is the case with a number of categories of tourism, this assumption may not hold for all agritourism outings as travellers often visit other destinations. This paper analyses and compares four different models, each using different methods to distinguish between multiple-destination and primary-purpose trips. The findings reveal that consumer surplus ranges from $93 to $164 per person per trip for primary purpose travellers. Implications for accurately estimating the market size of agritourism, as well as a broader set of recreational sectors, are discussed.","[Hill, Rebecca; Loomis, John; Thilmany, Dawn] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Sullins, Martha] Colorado State Univ Extens, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Hill, R (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 305-B Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",rebec.l.hill@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,15,16,4,39,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The authors investigate the festivals of 'Kuruma-ichi' and 'Suisha-matsuri' in the Yamane area of Kuji city, Iwate prefecture, Japan. They estimate a travel demand model to infer the value of these festivals for visitors and apply the chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) method to analyse the reasons for visiting. The results indicate that the consumer surplus of these festivals is (sic)3,627 (US$45.3) for a tourist per trip. From the CHAID analysis it follows that the annual frequency of visits depends on the opportunity for exchange among tourists and the local residents. It appears that the festivals are important occasions for the gathering of former residents in this depopulated and aged mountainous area.","[Okubo, Kenji] Tokyo Univ Agr, Dept Int Biobusiness Studies, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568502, Japan; [Gardebroek, Cornelis; Heijman, Wim] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Tokyo University of Agriculture; Wageningen University & Research,"Heijman, W (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",kuboken@nodai.ac.jp; koos.gardebroek@wur.nl; wim.heijman@wur.nl,,,,,,,5,8,8,0,18,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This paper demonstrates that these contracts are sometimes the reason why teams do not form. Formally, we study the team formation problem in which the agents' efforts are not verifiable and the size of teams does not exceed quota . We show that if the team members cannot make transfers, then moral hazard affects stability positively in a large class of games. For example, a stable team structure exists if teams produce public goods or if the quota is two.

This model features a simple way to capture the regime-switching evolution of the parameters as well as the memory property of the data. Concentrating on the second-order WMC framework, we derive the filters of the WMC and other auxiliary processes through a change of reference probability measure. Optimal estimates of model parameters are provided by employing the EM algorithm. The h-step ahead forecasts under our proposed set-up are examined and compared with those under the usual Markovian regime-switching framework. We obtain better goodness-of-fit performance based on our numerical results generated from the implementation of WMC-based filters to a 10-year dataset of weekly short-term-maturity Canadian yield rates.

This article contributes new knowledge by focusing on the variation between four different trio Presidencies that have ended their terms since the function was launched in 2007. A typology is developed to classify past and future trio Presidencies. It is shown that there are considerable variation between past trio formations with regard to whether they follow the same objectives (scope) and how much they co-ordinate to achieve these (depth). The observed variation is linked to the environment in which the trio Presidency operates, the individual trio members' attitude toward European integration, their territorial structuring of the state, their size, the ideology of the government and personality of the involved actors.","[Jensen, Mads Dagnis; Nedergaard, Peter] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Jensen, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",MCDJ@ifs.ku.dk,"Jensen, Mads Dagnis/AEA-0712-2022; Jensen, Mads Christian Dagnis/AAZ-9090-2020","Jensen, Mads Dagnis/0000-0002-4226-4114; Jensen, Mads Christian Dagnis/0000-0002-4226-4114; Nedergaard, Peter/0000-0001-5363-3301",,,,,28,18,18,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This multi-method survey consisted on a combination of user's willingness to change, stated tolerance and contingent valuation experiments. Random parameter probit models were used to analyze data on willingness to cycle. Willingness to change to cycling is related to travel purpose, transportation mode, travel time and education level. Policies for promoting the use of bicycles should target these profiles so as to be more effective. Random parameter ordered probit models were used to study how different cycling measures were valued by respondents. The protection and maintenance of cycle lanes are significantly more valued than other improvement measures. The design of future cycling facilities should consider increasing safety and travel time reduction. Senior citizen's willingness to change to cycling value to a lesser extent cycling improvement measures than people traveling to work or study. Strategies to promote cycling in each case are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, particularly those citizens with extreme rightist orientations are more likely to support democracy promotion via military means. Regarding the impact of socio-economic background variables, higher education and working skills are positively associated with democracy promotion in general, but make citizens less likely to support democracy promotion via military means.

Observational studies in the public health literature fail to account for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity and dynamics of weight, leading to biased estimation of the effect of physical activity on obesity. To overcome this limitation, we propose dynamic fixed-effects models to account for unobserved heterogeneity bias and the dynamics of obesity. We use nationally representative longitudinal data on the cohort of adults aged 18-50 years in 1994/95 from Canada's National Population Health Survey and followed them over 16 years. Obesity is measured by BMI (body mass index). After controlling for a wide range of socio-economic factors, the impact of four alternative measures of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and work-related physical activity (WRPA) are analyzed. The results show that each measure of LTPA exerts a negative effect on BMI and the effects are larger for females. Our key results show that participation in LTPA exceeding 1.5 kcal/kg per day (i.e., at least 30 min of walking) reduces BMI by about 0.11-0.14 points in males and 0.20 points in females relative to physically inactive counterparts. Compared to those who are inactive at workplace, being able to stand or walk at work is associated with a reduction in BMI in the range of 0.16-0.19 points in males and 0.24-0.28 points in females. Lifting loads at workplace is associated with a reduction in BMI by 0.2-0.3 points in males and 0.3-0.4 points in females relative to those who are reported sedentary. Policies aimed at promotion of LTPA combined with WRPA like walking or climbing stairs daily would help reduce adult obesity risks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The initial results suggest that there is a positive relationship between tourism and output volatility. Then, to test whether or not the impact of tourism is uniform across SIDS, the author divides the sample of SIDS by their regional groupings. The positive relationship between tourism specialization and volatility seems to be isolated to states in the Asia and Pacific region; that is, the region with the lowest level of tourism specialization on average. However, an evaluation of the fluctuations in tourism receipts indicates that the average volatility of tourism is highest in this region. This implies that the impact of tourism on economic volatility depends greatly on the level of volatility in tourism and, to a lesser extent, on the level of specialization.","Antilles Econ, St George, Barbados",,"Jackman, M (通讯作者)，Antilles Econ, St George, Barbados.",mjackman@antilleseconomics.com,"Jackman, Mahalia/J-3572-2019","Jackman, Mahalia/0000-0002-4522-664X",,,,,49,10,13,1,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The current paper develops multi-server queuing models to estimate border crossing delay in support of a predictive traveler information system for the crossings. Two classes of multi-server models are considered: (1) models with exponential inter-arrival times and Erlang service times; and (2) a more generic model with a Batch Markovian Arrival Process (BMAP) and phase types (PH) services. As a case study, the models are developed based on real-time traffic volume and inspection time data collected at one of the major US Canada border crossings, the Peace Bridge, and their transient solution is obtained using heuristic methods. For validation, the queueing models' estimates are compared to the results from a detailed microscopic traffic simulation model of the Peace Bridge border crossing. The comparison shows that the transient queueing model, along its heuristic solution algorithm, is capable of predicting border crossing delay. Finally, a set of sensitivity analysis tests are conducted, and the developed models are incorporated within an optimization framework to help inform border crossing management strategies.

Migrant workers engaged in mushroom picking were interviewed in the context of wider research investigating forced labour in Northern Ireland. The research found that, while the boundaries between exploitation and forced labour are complex and difficult to discern, there was some evidence of borderline forced labour, according to ILO definitions. However, workers found themselves on a 'continuum of exploitation', where initial engagement with the prospect of decent work was superseded by increasing endurance of exploitative practices, brought about by unequal power relationships with employers originating in immigration status. This is examined in the wider theoretical context of precarity, of which precarious employment comprises a part.","[Potter, Michael] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Studies & Philosophy, Belfast BT7 1PD, Antrim, North Ireland; [Hamilton, Jennifer] Univ Ulster, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast; Ulster University,"Potter, M (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Studies & Philosophy, Univ Sq, Belfast BT7 1PD, Antrim, North Ireland.",mpotter02@qub.ac.uk,,"Potter, Michael/0000-0003-0655-7072",,,,,56,49,51,1,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The purpose of this research was to investigate the stability of cost structure by capacity utilization in the tourism industry, using the accommodation sector in Taiwan as an example. Panel data consisting of firm-level financial information based on 13 individual cost categories from 2000 to 2009 were analysed to reveal the magnitude and direction of cost structure changes with respect to occupancy rate. The results indicated that income multipliers and profit multipliers fluctuated substantially but compensated for each other, while IO technical coefficients were very stable. In a situation involving a tourism event, type I and type II sales multipliers and the value added multipliers of the accommodation sector remained relatively stable, but the standard income multipliers were greatly overestimated, or underestimated for tourism recession scenarios. Applying a regional IO model to estimate short-term tourism demand should therefore take into consideration the substitution pattern between personal income and business profits.","[Sun, Ya-Yen] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Transportat & Commun Management Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Wong, Kam-Fai] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Inst Stat, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; National University Kaohsiung,"Sun, YY (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Transportat & Commun Management Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",yysun@ncku.edu.tw; wongkf@nuk.edu.tw,"Sun, Ya-Yen/N-2051-2018","Sun, Ya-Yen/0000-0001-6788-7644",,,,,39,10,11,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Agglomeration improves the productivity of each plant through positive externalities which shift plant-level productivity distribution to the right. Selection expels less productive plants through competition, which truncates the distribution on the left. We find evidence of agglomeration effects that benefit less productive plants and selection effects in clusters. Here, a cluster is defined by the density of own-industry plants within an area. The results complement previous studies that find positive agglomeration effects in the most productive firms, but no selection effects in cities (Combes et al., 2012; Accetturo et al., 2011). Our results suggest that the sources of productivity improvements in localized industrial clusters might be different from those in cities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To obtain a correct identification of monetary policy changes, the paper follows Kuttner in separating the surprise element from the expected element of the target rate changes. The surprise element is expected to have a strong influence on HIRs because the surprise component is not yet priced in the market. Test results show that funds target rate surprises can have a significant impact on airline, gambling, hotel and travel and leisure index returns, but actual funds target rate changes and the expected component have no strong impact on HIRs. Moreover, the significant influence of funds target rate surprises on HIRs depends on business conditions and is much greater in size and statistical significance in business contraction. In particular, the significant effects of federal funds target rate surprises on airline, hotel and restaurant index returns are found to exist only during periods of business cycle contraction.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, MH (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan.",finmhc@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Birth registration laws were enacted by U.S. states in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Using 1910-1930 census data, this study finds that minimum working age legislation was twice as effective in reducing under-aged employment if children had been born with a birth registration law, with positive implications for school attendance. There is some evidence that registration laws also improved the enforcement of schooling laws for younger children. A retrospective analysis with the 1960 census shows that the long-term effect of registration laws was to increase educational attainment by approximately 0.1 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Since the late nineteenth century there has been plenty of debate about the ownership of the public debt. But the empirical evidence offeredto support the various arguments has been scant. As a result, political economistshave few answers to questions first raised by Adams over centuryago: how has the pattern of public debt ownership changed? Can we still speak of apowerful 'bondholding class'? Does public debt redistribute income from taxpayers topublic creditors? This article develops a new framework to address these questions. Anchored within a 'capital as power' approach, the research indicates astaggering pattern of concentration in the ownership of US public debt in thehands of the top one per cent of US households over the past three decades. Accordingly, the bondholding class is still alive and well in contemporary US capitalism.","York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",York University - Canada,"Hager, SB (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",sbhager@yorku.ca,,"Hager, Sandy Brian/0000-0002-1205-3623",,,,,53,23,23,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Since the EEAS is composed of officials originating from different institutions, this contribution discusses the challenges associated with aggregating different beliefs and values within the Service. The article examines five factors that have the potential to promote organizational esprit de corps, including communication, leadership, public image, trust and training.

This article provides such evidence from a new data set on differentiation in European Union treaty law. In addition, it is argued that two logics of treaty-based differentiation are at work. Instrumental differentiation' originates in enlargement and is motivated by efficiency and distributional concerns. Constitutional differentiation' has its origins in treaty revisions and is motivated by concerns about national sovereignty and identity. It is driven by Eurosceptic Member States that are opposed ideologically, or fear popular resistance, to the supranational centralization of core state powers.","[Schimmelfennig, Frank; Winzen, Thomas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Schimmelfennig, F (通讯作者)，European Polit Res Grp, IFW D 45-1,Haldeneggsteig 4, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",frank.schimmelfennig@eup.gess.ethz.ch,"Schimmelfennig, Frank/HLG-1745-2023; Schimmelfennig, Frank/J-5339-2013","Winzen, Thomas/0000-0003-4489-8943",,,,,21,78,80,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

When the elderly are no longer able to drive, they rely on alternative forms of transportation, including public transportation systems. Currently, such systems are usually not good substitutes for driving a private car, especially in rural areas. Because expanded rural transportation systems would likely be funded by taxpayers, an understanding of their preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for non-medical transportation options is essential. To help understand WTP and preferences, a choice experiment survey was administered to taxpayers in three counties (Atascosa, Polk, and Parker) in Texas. Results indicate taxpayers' value transportation services for the elderly and are willing to support them. They value more flexible options over base levels of the attributes presented, but they may not always prefer the most flexible options. Respondents' WTP for the same transportation attribute was similar across counties, but differences in socio-demographic coefficients suggest that transportation systems may need to be customized to meet local needs. Furthermore, county residents' WTP may not cover the cost of desired improvements to the transportation systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Schwarzlose, Alicia A.

The panel data set includes the annual data of 15 OECD countries for the period 1995-2010. The empirical results indicate that the relationships between growth and its determinants are non-linear and vary with time and across countries. Although the TLGH remains valid, the tourism elasticities of growth are small and vary inversely with the one-period lagged exchange rate return and proportionally with the two-period lagged inflation rate. There is a trade-off between employing export policies and employing tourism policies to promote economic growth, and the main impetus behind growth in the sample countries is the increase in human capital.","[Pan, Sheng-Chieh] China Univ Technol, Dept Leisure & Recreat Management, Hukou Township, Hsinchu County, Taiwan; [Liu, Shiao-Yen] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Coll Business, Chungli 320, Taiwan; [Wu, Po-Chin] Dept Int Business, Chungli 320, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University,"Wu, PC (通讯作者)，Dept Int Business, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Chungli 320, Taiwan.",pochin@cycu.edu.tw,,,,,,,12,14,14,0,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The fungi were applied individually or in combination using a coconut husk carrier substrate, and were compared with the synthetic nematicide Furadan (R) (5 g/m(2)) under a double-cropping system of either tomato-carrot or carrot-lettuce, under farming conditions. Results were variable across sites; however, application of some native microorganisms alone or in combination resulted in significant suppression of nematode multiplication and root galling damage, improving crop yields and quality. Root galling severity on tomato and carrot was reduced by up to 70 and 30% in tomato-carrot cropping, and 16 and 40% on carrot and lettuce in carrot-lettuce cropping, respectively, compared to the Furadan treatment. Yields of tomato, carrot and lettuce were significantly improved by up to 70, 57 and 37%, respectively, following the application of various biocontrol agents. This study provides evidence that some beneficial microorganisms native to West Africa provide better protection for vegetables against root-knot nematode damage than the synthetic nematicides. This was observed especially in the poor sandy soils typical of urban and peri-urban sites of coastal cities in Benin, which reflect the situation in most West African countries. The results are highly encouraging, demonstrating the strong potential of the fungal isolates as an alternative to pesticides and a complementary crop protection component for the intensive (peri) urban vegetable systems.","[Affokpon, A.; Agbede, R.

We find that the leverage and maturity choices of all listed real estate firms are interdependent, but in contrast to industrial firms, they are not made simultaneously. Across the different types of real estate firms considered, we find substantial differences in the nature of the relationship between leverage and maturity. Leverage determines maturity in non-REITs, whereas maturity is a determinant of leverage in REITs. We suggest that the observed differences reflect the effects of the REIT regulation, rather than solely being a function of real estate as the underlying asset class. We also present novel evidence that the relationship between leverage and maturity in both firm types can be used to moderate the effects of other exogenous financing policies.","[Alcock, Jamie; Steiner, Eva] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Alcock, Jamie] Univ Queensland, Sch Math & Phys, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Tan, Kelvin Jui Keng] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Cambridge; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Alcock, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",jta27@cam.ac.uk; es434@cam.ac.uk; j.tan@business.uq.edu.au,"Tan, Kelvin Jui Keng/J-3778-2015; Steiner, Eva/GQP-3194-2022; Alcock, Jamie/D-8850-2013","Tan, Kelvin Jui Keng/0000-0001-6923-1200; Alcock, Jamie/0000-0002-9194-2129",,,,,48,15,17,1,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

From a theoretical point of view, the impact of the business cycle on firms' training behaviour is ambiguous. There are reasons for an increase of training during a downturn (e.g., declining opportunity costs of training, fewer exit options for trained workers) as well as arguments for a decrease of training (e.g., uncertain future benefits of training). The existing empirical evidence on the relationship between training and economic downturns is relatively scarce. In particular, we are not aware of any empirical study investigating the effects of the most recent crisis on firms' training activities in Germany. Our paper aims to fill this gap by using data from the IAB Establishment Panel, a representative German panel data set with annual information about almost 16,000 establishments. In particular, we analyzed the provision and the intensity of further training and apprenticeship training in firms which were affected by the crisis and in those which were not. Our empirical investigation revealed that the establishments, irrespective of whether or not they were hit by the economic crisis, decreased their further training and apprenticeship training efforts in 2009 compared to 2008. However, establishments directly affected by the great recession tended to reduce their training activities more often than those which were not affected. Furthermore, we found much stronger variations in the development of firms' further training activities than in the development of their apprenticeship training.","[Bellmann, Lutz] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Bellmann, Lutz; Gerner, Hans-Dieter; Leber, Ute] Inst Employment Res, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Bellmann, L (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",lutz.bellmann@iab.de; hans-dieter.gerner@iab.de; ute.leber@iab.de,,,,,,,27,15,15,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Advertisers are not in a position to enforce consumption on a target group, but they have the power to dominate by transmitting their messages through television programmes, magazines and other media. Having proven its force in the movement of economic goods and services, nowadays, advertising has been directed in increasing quantity towards matters of social concern. Furthermore, modern advertising is a complex segment of urban industrial civilization, reflecting contemporary life in its real aspects. Advertising has changed in its culture, due largely to the switch from informational to a more expressive conceptual way of communication with consumers. This change has offered the audience less cognition about products and more sensory orientated heuristics about positions, branding and ethical standards of companies. The purpose of the research is to develop a framework for an analysis of new media advertising that focuses on its social implications and its switch from a pure contextual aspect to hybrid, a bridge between types of informational and emotional advertising which refined the way consumers make decisions about products and services. This assessment will perform analyses of a real balance between ways to persuade consumers and, their belief and feelings.","[Bondrea, Aurelian A.; Stefanescu-Mihaila, Ramona Olivia] Spiru Haret Univ, Bucharest, Romania",Spiru Haret University,"Bondrea, AA (通讯作者)，Spiru Haret Univ, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,9,24,,,,,,16,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800002,0

Business Friendly Certificate (BFC), an internationally recognized quality standard is a process promoting favourable business environment in line with international standards contributing to creating cities with standardized systems for the provision of services and information to potential investors. Business Friendly Certification is a process allowing the evaluation of the quality of service and information the cities provide to investors and businesses. Criteria of Business Friendly Certification can be seen as a reminder of what a city or municipality needs to develop as its own capacity and which operative segments of city or municipal organisations need to be functional. This process is expected to serve to increase competitiveness with respect to the cities and municipalities in the region inside and outside the country borders helping them compete with competitors that started reforms during the transition process much earlier. In this work, we study the concepts of City Information Systems aimed at managing data and information flow in supporting investors and businesses enabling quick response to client request, faster and easier dealing with papers required for issuance of location and building permit, municipal requirements and other activities necessary to investors and businesses. In 2013, eight cities from the Southeastern Europe, among which Croatia's Bjelovar and Ivanec, were certified as cities with favourable business environment. Cloud computing along with Information and communications technology has now emerged to become a recognized method for dealing with given criteria at city or municipal authority level ultimately serving to all interested cities. Implementation of solutions that are continuously upgraded with innovative ideas is a process contributing to the development of project.","[Capko, Zvonko; Vukmirovic, Slavomir; Babic, Ana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Capko, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",zvonko.capko@efri.hr; vukmirovics@gmail.com; ana.babic@efri.hr,"Babić, Ana/S-7556-2018; Vukmirovic, Slavomir/GVS-3894-2022; Čapko, Zvonko/S-2095-2018","Babić, Ana/0000-0002-2736-9022; Vukmirovic, Slavomir/0000-0002-2713-2447;",,,,,4,0,0,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,235,244,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600022,0

Although the effects of the crisis are most visible in the financial sector, it is essentially a structural crisis and the result of the transition from industrial economy to the new information age. Under the influence of globalization on the one hand and the development and application of the ICT on the other hand, the Western World has experienced a major decline in employment opportunities. Consequently, the consumption potential of the population dropped, causing economic stagnation. Today, primarily due to relatively expensive labour, this part of the world is practically unsuitable for any kind of agricultural and industrial production because it is not profitable. In pursuit of low farm product prices characteristic of modern times, almost entire agricultural production is sustained on mass production and the redirection of resources through the system of incentives and subsidies. The industrial production has not fared much better. It does not come as a surprise then that many industries are trying to survive through assistance system similar to the one used for agriculture. Shipbuilding and automotive industry in some countries are good examples of this. In the current situation, neither agriculture, nor large parts of the industrial production are able to survive without government intervention and assistance from profitable sectors. If we take into account that in order to be competitive in the global market, besides having quality products it is necessary to have an adequate quantity of products and competitive prices, a legitimate question arises as to whether the Western World has industrial products that are able to meet these criteria. If it does not, or if it does not have them in sufficient quantities, it is necessary to identify parts of the economic system that are cost-effective and provide for the survival of modern society. The economic situation in the Republic of Croatia, in particular in eastern Croatia, is much more difficult. It is obvious that, in terms of agricultural and industrial production, eastern Croatia is not competitive in the global market so the question arises as to which economic sectors can provide for economic development.","[Dukic, Branimir; Segetlija, Zdenko] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Dukic, Stojanka] Dux MISSION Doo Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Dukic, B (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",bdukic@efos.hr; seget@efos.hr; dux-mission@os-t-com.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,18,27,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600001,0

Since a moral-hazard-in-team problem plagues production on the latter and the household head extracts his income from it, he faces a trade-off between efficiency and capture. We show, within the framework of a patriarchal farm household model, that private plots become profitable for the head once land becomes sufficiently scarce. Specifically, greater land scarcity raises both the probability to find private plots in afarm and the share of farmland allocated to these plots. On the basis of firsthand data collected in southern Mali, we test and confirm the two predictions yielded by the above theory. Moreover, we show that a higher number of married men within the household has the same effect as land scarcity, thus suggesting an interesting refinement of the moral-hazard-in-team argument.","[Guirkinger, Catherine; Platteau, Jean-Philippe] Univ Namur, Namur, Belgium",University of Namur,"Guirkinger, C (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, Namur, Belgium.",catherine.guirkinger@unamur.be,,"Guirkinger, Catherine/0000-0003-4055-7746",,,,,43,25,28,0,23,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

Our approach involves analysing data on approximately 9000 overweight British adults from between 1997 and 2002. We estimate the effect of income on the probability that an overweight individual correctly recognises their overweight status and the effect of income on the probability that an overweight individual attempts to lose weight. The results suggest that high income individuals are more likely to recognise their unhealthy weight status, and conditional on this correct weight perception, more likely to attempt weight loss. For example, it is estimated that overweight high income males are 15 percentage-points more likely to recognise their overweight status than overweight low income males, and overweight high income males are 10 percentage-points more likely to be trying to lose weight. An implication of these results is that more public education on what constitutes overweight and the dangers associated with being overweight is needed, especially in low income neighbourhoods.

Example of such goods can be motor vehicles which are also crucial for numerous Central and Eastern European countries. In this paper we will focus on how China's growing car exports influence the exports of Visegrad countries into their main export destinations. The gravity model using panel data regression will be used to assess the impact of China's rise on economies of Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. It is showed that despite the growing Chinese exports in the vehicle sector, a decline of Visegrad countries exports due to Chinese competition is not straightforward. One of the plausible explanations is that Chinese cars are not outright substitutes to cars produced in the European Union. This paper is organized as follows: The first part briefly presents the main changes in the Chinese car exports and summarizes the literature review. The following part focuses on the methodology and describes gravity approach and data used in our analysis. The main findings are presented in the next part and conclusion and discussion of our results is offered at the end of the paper.","Masaryk Univ, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Konciková, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,443,449,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900057,0

By now, the former Soviet states as a group are similar to the EU-15 and OECD countries in terms of the overall employment protection legislation index, although they differ in terms of contributions to the overall employment protection legislation of its three major components, namely, regulation of permanent contracts, temporary contracts and collective dismissals.","[Muravyev, Alexander] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Muravyev, Alexander] Inst Study Labor, Bonn, Germany",Saint Petersburg State University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Muravyev, A (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",,"Muravyev, Alexander/D-7846-2013","Muravyev, Alexander/0000-0001-8936-2582",,,,,49,9,9,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2014,66.0,8,,,,,1270,1294,,10.1080/09668136.2014.941705,0.0,,,25,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AP7WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342288400004,0

In general terms, the value of literature reviews resides in their ability to provide scholars, students, and practitioners with a critical appraisal of the existing research, helping to identify and develop other studies. Country-of-origin maintains his interest regarding the effects and their impact in terms of relevant aspects such as globalization and the relocation of production, trade agreements between countries and regional blocs and even the hybrid character of many products. So, country-of-origin becomes a potential competitive differentiator in their respective markets. We witnessed a growth in studies since the mid-90s of last century looking for an approach to redefming the concept taking us to research topics such as brand origin, product-country image and product-place image. And this growth of interest and research spread into services and not exclusively in relation to tangible products. It is accepted that in post-industrial economies, the service sector is changing daily and globalization is one of the main drivers of this. But after 1995/6, some authors argue that brand origin must also be considered. Brand origin can be more or less salient for some brands or others. The use of origin cues should be subtle and implicit sometimes, and more explicit others. However, the origin is incentivized by some politic entities being they regional, national or multinational like the European Union, for instance when fomenting the protected denomination of origin or the protected indication of origin for some products. As important or even more is the perceived brand origin as a source of brand appeal, relegating to the background the question about where the company produces its goods or services, and giving importance to this perception, even for reasons of stereotyping.","[Pinheiro Francisco e Silva, Carlos Antonio] ISLA Higher Educ Inst Leiria, Leiria, Portugal; [Pinheiro Francisco e Silva, Carlos Antonio] CIEO Ctr Org & Spatial Dynam, Faro, Portugal; [Mendes Monico, Lisete dos Santos] Univ Coimbra, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal; [Ferreira Porfirio, Jose Antonio; Alves de Almeida, Maria do Rosario] Aberta Univ, Social Sci & Management Dept, Algarve, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Silva, CAPFE (通讯作者)，ISLA Higher Educ Inst Leiria, Leiria, Portugal.",,"Mónico, Lisete S.

In the absence of the dollar's international reserve currency status, foreigners' willingness to purchase US debt would diminish sharply. 'Declinists' have argued that this Achilles' heel of US power has become increasingly fragile, with the 2008 financial crisis further eroding US monetary privileges and bearing profound implications for international security and the distribution of power in the international system. However, contrary to these accounts, this paper shows that dollar hegemony not only remains strong, but that US monetary power has in fact increased. How do we explain this? In important areas, the US' economic decline is nowhere near as pronounced as is commonly assumed. Also, its strategic power in economically important regions, particularly in East Asia, helps incentivize both allied and potential contender states into its broader monetary regimes. To the extent that a weakening of dollar hegemony forms a primary component of the declinist case, it is thus overstated. This 'deal' will not last forever, but rising powers continue to face strong incentives to remain within a US-centric order, even after the financial crisis of 2008.","Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Stokes, D (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Exeter, Devon, England.",,,,,,,,54,35,37,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We use a novel data series of loan servicing records from 2002 until 2010 to identify such borrowers and find evidence that the default behavior of these borrowers significantly differs from borrowers without second loans. Estimating a discrete-time proportional odds hazard model, we find borrowers with a second loan were 62.7% more likely to default each month on their primary loan when conditioning alone on the attributes of the primary loan. However, borrowers of second loans were 58.3% less likely to default on their primary loan as compared to single-loan borrowers with equivalent current combined attributes (i.e., loan-to-value, balance and interest rate). We hypothesize and provide empirical evidence that this occurs because borrowers with second loans have the option to sequentially default on each loan since subordinate lenders will not pursue foreclosure if borrowers have insufficient equity. Lenders of defaulted subordinate debt may revisit their decision to foreclose in the future after housing markets start to recover, thus prompting a new round of foreclosures.","[Eriksen, Michael D.; Kau, James B.] Univ Georgia, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Keenan, Donald C.] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Dept Econ & Management, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Keenan, Donald C.] THEMA, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Eriksen, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",eriksen@terry.uga.edu; jkau@terry.uga.edu; donald.keenan@u-cergy.fr,,,,,,,20,10,13,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,DEC,2013,41.0,4,,,,,858,886,,10.1111/reec.12016,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,273PU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328549000005,0

We show that the cost-of-carry hypothesis between spot and futures prices holds for the trial period. In this period we focus on how fast a deviation from equilibrium due to shocks is restored. We derive testable restrictions on the loading coefficients and the short term dynamics within a vector error correction model. Previous studies in this field did not take into account the effects of lagged differences in the determination of the speed of adjustment. The results indicate that deviations from equilibrium are restored faster for the futures price series maturing in 2006 than for the futures price series maturing in 2007. Furthermore, we conduct an impulse response analysis using local projections with conditional confidence bands. Finally, we give an outlook for the Kyoto commitment period which is already running.

The PO model with cardinality and bounding constraints is a mixed quadratic and integer programming problem for which no exact algorithms can solve in an efficient way. Consequently, various heuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, have been proposed in the past. This paper aims to examine the potential of a BFO algorithm in solving the PO problem. BFO is a new swarm intelligence technique that has been successfully applied to several real world problems. Through three operations, chemotaxis, reproduction, and elimination-dispersal, the proposed BFO algorithm can effectively solve a PO problem. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated in computational tests on five benchmark data sets, and the results were compared to those obtained from existing heuristic algorithms. The proposed BFO algorithm is found to be superior to previous heuristic algorithms in terms of solution quality and time.","[Kao, Yucheng; Cheng, Hsiu-Tzu] Tatung Univ, Dept Informat Management, Taipei 104, Taiwan",Tatung University,"Kao, YC (通讯作者)，Tatung Univ, Dept Informat Management, 40 Chungshan N Rd,Sec 3, Taipei 104, Taiwan.",ykao@ttu.edu.tw,"LI, WEI/ISS-1208-2023",,"National Science Council, Taiwan [NSC 101-2410-H-036-001]","National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work is supported in part by the National Science Council, Taiwan, under Grants NSC 101-2410-H-036-001.",,20,8,8,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Second, we show that the optimal GMM estimator (GMME) formulated from this set is the most efficient estimator within the class of GMMEs formulated from the set of linear and quadratic moment functions.

Trust is measured by the general trust question like in most other economic studies based on surveys. We find that strict working time regulations, monitoring and lack of autonomy - all indicators for control at the workplace - are negatively associated with trust. Monitoring also moderates the relation between the existence of a formal performance appraisal system and individuals' trust. Moreover, we contribute to the literature on trust by gathering hints to other potential correlates of trust.","[Grund, Christian; Harbring, Christine] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Econ & Business, D-52062 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"Grund, C (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Econ & Business, Templergraben 64, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",christian.grund@rwth-aachen.de; christine.harbring@rwth-aachen.de,"Grund, Christian/JNE-8500-2023; Harbring, Christine/ABD-5174-2020",,,,,,31,2,2,0,20,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The analysis focuses on contingent liability of bank owners for losses incurred by their firms and how the elimination of this liability influenced leverage and lending by commercial banks. Using a new panel data set, we find contingent liability reduced risk taking. In states with contingent liability, banks used less leverage and converted each dollar of capital into fewer loans, and thus could survive larger loan losses (as a fraction of their portfolio) than banks in limited liability states. In states with limited liability, banks took on more leverage and risk, particularly in states that required banks with limited liability to join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the long run, the New Deal replaced a regime of contingent liability with deposit insurance, stricter balance sheet regulation, and increased capital requirements, shifting the onus of risk management from bankers to state and federal regulators.

Consequently, school nutrition programs such as the School Breakfast Program (SBP) have come under scrutiny. The identification of the causal effects of such programs, however, is difficult owing to non-random selection into the program and the lack of exclusion restrictions. Here, we propose two new estimators aimed at addressing this situation. We compare our new estimators to existing approaches using simulated data. We show that while correlations might suggest that SBP causes childhood obesity, SBP is likely to reduce childhood obesity once selection is addressed.

Scalar continuity is shown to be sufficient for representability of a monotone preference order and easy to verify in concrete examples. Generalizing this result, we show that a condition, which restricts the extent of scalar discontinuity of a monotone preference order, ensures representability. We relate this condition to the well-known order dense property, which is both necessary and sufficient for representability.","[Mitra, Tapan; Ozbek, M.

Earlier contributions have established that (finitely) anonymous and strongly Paretian quasiorderings exist that verify non-interference axioms together with weak preference continuity and further consistency. Nevertheless Mariotti and Veneziani (2011) prove that a fully liberal non-interfering view of a finite society leads to dictatorship if the weak Pareto principle is imposed. We first prove that this impossibility result vanishes when we extend the horizon to infinity. Then we investigate a related problem: namely, the possibility of combining standard semicontinuity with efficiency in the presence of non-interference. We provide several impossibility results that prove that there is a generalised incompatibility between relaxed forms of continuity and non-interference principles, both under ordinal and cardinal views of the problem.","Univ Salamanca, Salamanca 37007, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Alcantud, JCR (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Edificio FES,Campus Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",jcr@usal.es,"Alcantud, José Carlos/E-3258-2010","Alcantud, José Carlos/0000-0002-4533-9281",,,,,18,6,6,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2013,41.0,2,,,,,381,396,,10.1007/s00355-012-0687-x,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,155TE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319770300009,0

The participation axiom states that the sincere report of a voter's preferences cannot cause an outcome that the voter regards as less attractive than the one that would result from the voter's non-participation. This article identifies three binary distinctions in the types of circumstances in which failures of monotonicity or participation can occur. Two of the three distinctions apply to monotonicity, while one of those and the third apply to participation. The distinction that is unique to monotonicity is whether the voters whose changed rankings demonstrate non-monotonicity are better off or worse off. The distinction that is unique to participation is whether the marginally participating voter causes his first choice to lose or his last choice to win. The overlapping distinction is whether the profile of voters' rankings has a Condorcet winner or a cycle at the top. This article traces the occurrence of all of the resulting combination of characteristics in the voting methods that can exhibit failures of monotonicity.","[Felsenthal, Dan S.] Univ Haifa, Sch Polit Sci, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Tideman, Nicolaus] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",University of Haifa; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Felsenthal, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Sch Polit Sci, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",msdanfl@mscc.huji.ac.il; ntideman@vt.edu,,"Tideman, Nicolaus/0000-0002-3971-5965",,,,,18,17,17,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2013,75.0,1,,,,,59,77,,10.1007/s11238-012-9306-7,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,179KV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321520100004,0

Evidence from German Open-ended Property Funds,JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Liquidity; Open-ended Property Funds; REITs; Temporary suspension of share redemptions,STOCK RETURNS; LIQUIDITY,"Besides the more commonly used REITs, German investors can also invest in a lesser-known real estate vehicle, Open-ended Property Funds. OPFs are considered a compromise between listed and direct real estate investments. OPF fund managers generally provide daily (perfect) liquidity. However, if liquidity falls below 5%, share redemptions in these funds can be temporarily suspended for a period of up to two years. During this time, investors will only be able to sell shares on the secondary market (exchange), and are thus subject to significant liquidity risk. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether OPFs add value to investor portfolios above that provided by REITs. We show that OPFs have a diversification advantage over REITs in low-risk portfolios, despite their larger potential liquidity risk. REIT liquidity is comparable to that of ordinary common stock, but OPFs exhibit an average initial discount to funds' NAV of about 6% when share redemptions are temporarily suspended. However, in the long-run, this potential redemption suspension does not negatively influence OPF performance (in case OPFs reopen again). This makes OPFs an attractive investment alternative to REITs for investors who have a high level of risk aversion and a long-term investment horizon, such as endowments, insurance companies, and pension funds.","[Schweizer, Denis; Hass, Lars Helge; Johanning, Lutz] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany; [Rudolph, Bernd] Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; University of Munich,"Schweizer, D (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany.",Denis.Schweizer@whu.edu,,,,,,,27,8,10,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We construct a measure of firms' total factor productivity by adopting an augmented Olley-Pakes semi-parametric methodology to correct the simultaneity bias from reverse causality and selection bias from firms' exits. Even when controlling for the endogeneity, trade liberalisation increases productivity for firms that produce complex goods (highly differentiated products). In contrast, we found that trade liberalisation has an opposite effect on the productivity of the producers of simple goods. Moreover, the effect of trade liberalisation on exporting firms is found to be smaller than that on non-exporting firms.

Ecological economists see Mill's stationary state' as seminal, while Marxists have brought capitalism back in' to debates on growth and climate change, sparking a Marxological renaissance that has overturned our understanding of Marx/Engels' opus. This article explores aspects of Mill's and Marx/Engels' work and contemporary reception. It identifies a resemblance between their historical dialectics. Marx's communism is driven by logics of agency' and structure' (including the tendency of profit rates to fall'). In Mill's dialectic a thesis', material progress, calls forth its antithesis', diminishing returns. The inevitable Aufhebung' is a stationary state of wealth and population; Mill mentions countervailing tendencies but fails to consider their capacity to postpone utopia's arrival. Today, Mill's schema lives on in ecological economics, shorn of determinism but with its market advocacy intact. It appears to contrast with the productive forces expansion' espoused by Marx/Engels. They stand accused of Promethean arrogance', ignoring natural limits' and gambling on abundance'. But I find these criticisms to be ill-judged, and propose an alternative reading, arguing that their work contains a critique of the growth paradigm', and that their cornucopian' ends do not sanction Promethean' means.","Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University,"Dale, G (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Marie Jahoda Bldg,Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",gareth.dale@brunel.ac.uk,"Dale, Gareth/AAV-7142-2020","Dale, Gareth/0000-0003-4991-6063",,,,,90,8,8,0,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It argues that scholars of international political economy (IPE) need to engage more fully with the role of nature in driving forward the logics of neoliberalism. Most scholars view nature as a source of accumulation or as an object of governance, but this paper uses the neoliberalisation of nature debate to extend our understandings of neoliberalism. In particular, global tourism has targeted and opened up new frontiers in nature, which serves to expand and deepen neoliberalism to a wider range of biophysical phenomena. This paper uses the case of elephant tourism to demonstrate how tourism is not just reflective of neoliberalism, but is in fact a key driver of it, acting as an environmental fix for capitalism. Further, this paper takes up the challenge of research on actually existing neoliberalisms' via engagement with locally specific contexts and emerging forms of socio-nature in the Thai tourism industry. It reveals how neoliberalism redraws the boundaries of access to nature, thereby shifting the distribution of costs and benefits. Hence, nature is one of the primary ways in which neoliberalism is constituted, albeit in a highly differentiated way. This reminds us not to reify neoliberalism and accord it a greater degree of power and coherence than it really has.","Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Duffy, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,,"Duffy, Rosaleen/0000-0002-6779-7240",,,,,53,39,40,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Tourism's contribution to economic growth is highest in Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. It is slightly negative in Europe, North America and Oceania.

We build a model which focuses on the embedded call option associated with home ownership that allows owners to delay the (irreversible) sale. When prices are low, the (opportunity) cost of a sale, i.e., a higher implied gain from a future sale, likely exceeds its immediate trade benefit and an owner is better off waiting for market conditions to improve. The model also highlights the importance of supply conditions: a more constrained supply is associated with a longer delay. Using state-level residential housing data, we find evidence consistent with the model. Transaction volume is increasing (decreasing) in the rental growth rate (volatility) in the cross section; their effects are amplified in areas with low supply elasticities, and in times with low market prices.

The main data set includes 50,000 households that received housing allowances during the period 2000-2008. In addition, we utilize repeated cross-sections of all Finnish households for 1989-2008, the annual sample exceeding 10,000. Estimation results suggest that a part of the subsidies will indeed go into rental prices. A conservative estimate of the size of the shift is one-third, but it is certainly possible that the number is as high as 50 %. On the other hand, the subsidy seems to have increased housing demand more than the subsidy-induced income effect would have implied, which is in accordance with the goals of the subsidy program. Our results seem to be consistent with other studies, which have also indicated relatively large rent effects. If this is indeed the case, we are advised to reconsider the need for reforming the system of housing subsidies, at least with respect to the share of costs that remains on households' own accounts and the implicit indexation of the system.","[Viren, Matti] Univ Turku, Dept Econ, Turku, Finland; [Viren, Matti] Univ Turku, Publ Choice Res Ctr, Turku, Finland; [Viren, Matti] Bank Finland, Monetary Policy & Res Dept, Helsinki, Finland",University of Turku; University of Turku; Bank of Finland,"Viren, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Dept Econ, Turku, Finland.",matvir@utu.fi,,,,,,,18,14,14,0,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This is because of the context in which the crisis occurred and the way that the leadership, particularly President Medvedev, and many of its critics described the crisis. The oil-fuelled boom that preceded the crisis had the effect of deepening it. Economic recovery based on rising energy prices looks like a failure, rather than a success, and highlights the underlying structural problems of the Russian economy. Arguments about the need for modernisation from within government exacerbated this perception.

In particular, there is limited understanding about crime responses. This article investigates the causal relation between hosting the 1990 Football World Cup and crime rates at the province level. Using a fixed effect estimator to control for province-level differences in crime, we find that hosting the Football World Cup leads to a significant increase in most property crimes (bag-snatching, pick-pocketing, shoplifting, and burglary) but only in one violent crime (intentional personal injuries).","[Campaniello, Nadia] Univ Turin, I-10024 Turin, Italy; [Campaniello, Nadia] Coll Carlo Alberto, Ceris CNR Natl Res Council, I-10024 Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Campaniello, N (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Via Real Collegio 30, I-10024 Turin, Italy.",nadia.campaniello@unito.it,"Campaniello, Nadia/AAE-3971-2019","Campaniello, Nadia/0000-0001-9497-7194",,,,,45,29,36,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

If so, what is the essence of this alternative consensus and why does it matter? This article argues that efforts at a definitive description of a Chinese model of stateeconomy relations, especially as it compares to the original policy recommendations of the Washington Consensus, have and will continue to prove unsatisfying. This is because any such comparative exercise is inherently political and prone to various angles of critique. Instead, this article argues that it is precisely because of the politics of such comparison that competing and often contradictory portrayals of a Beijing Consensus or China Model have taken on importance inside and outside of China. This article further argues that western accounts of a Beijing Consensus or China Model alternative to the Washington Consensus too often ignore or minimize the contentious debates within China about how best to describe Chinese economic governance. This study, in contrast, seeks to understand China's relationship to the Washington Consensus by exploring how concepts like the Beijing Consensus or China Model are deployed and contested outside and inside of China. The article concludes by offering suggestions for further research on the domestic Chinese and international policy implications of debates about the Beijing Consensus.","Tsinghua Univ, Dept Int Relat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Ferchen, M (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Int Relat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",,"Ferchen, Matthew G/I-2627-2012",,,,,,89,67,75,2,80,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It is often the result of a very compound choice process that can take place consciously or unconsciously and that includes objective as well as subjective determinants. Despite its significance in our daily life, there is no uniform way to define and analyze the concept of modal choice. The aim of this review is to fill this gap by elaborating a common modal choice definition and by providing a comprehensive review on the concept of modal choice through linking it to Kaufmann's motility concept. By doing so, this review will not only contribute to an improved knowledge on different modal choice determinants and their interdependencies, but can also assist to the understanding and modeling of modal choice decisions. The review can therefore help increasing the effectiveness of policy measures taken by environmental, urban and transport policy makers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The framework is based on the integration of indigenous and scientific knowledge to reflect the sustainability of candidate projects. This is achieved through a participatory approach to integrate inputs from system users and providers to produce a term defined as the Localized Sustainability Score (LSS). The LSS of the projects are then used to produce a relative ranking of potential projects, for use as a decision support for project screening and selection. Proof-of-concept development of the proposed LSS framework is presented via a preliminary case study in Accra-Ghana and the results indicate that the framework adequately represented local sustainable transport needs, priorities and perceptions. The LSS determined for some selected projects maintained the original relative rankings that were already derived using conventional methods. The LSS also has the added advantage of evaluating projects of different scales, which were not easy to evaluate together by conventional methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared to the cross-sectional study, the before-after study has lower within-subject variability since it directly accounts for changes that have occurred at the study sites. However, although this kind of study may offer superior performance, it can still be plagued by important methodological limitations, which could significantly alter the study outcome. They include the regression-to-the-mean (RTM) and site-selection effects. The primary objective of this study consists of presenting a method that can reduce the selection effects when an entry criterion is used in before-after studies for continuous data (e.g. speed, reaction times, etc.), without relying on the use of a control group. The distribution of the data could follow a normal or lognormal distribution. The study objective was accomplished using simulated and observed speed data collected in Florida. The proposed method documented in this paper was compared to the Naive, Control Group (CG) and the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) methods. The simulation results show that the proposed method provides a more precise estimate than the Naive method, as expected. In addition, the method performs better than the CG and the ANCOVA methods when similar control group data are not available. The results also show that higher entry criteria, lower between-subject variances, and higher within-subject variances cause higher selection biases. When traffic engineers and urban planners evaluate or compare different strategies, the proposed method can be applied to adjust naive estimators of treatment effectiveness documented in previous studies without similar control group data.

Comparing Continental Identification in Europe and Beyond,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IDENTITY; EUROSCEPTICISM; MOBILIZATION,"European identification has previously been explained by the selective gains brought by the European integration process, by personal transnational experiences and by the influence of political programmes aiming at increasing levels of identification. All these explanations imply that identification with one's continent would be specific in extent and distribution across the social structure in Europe compared to other continents. These assumptions are tested using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and a longitudinal analysis using Eurobarometer. Results show that, first, the extent of continental identification in Europe is not higher than in other continents. Second, they reveal that there has been no increase in European identification in recent decades. And third, the socio-structural distribution of continental identification is similar on all continents. Accordingly, explaining European identification with respect to policy output of the European Union is questioned by the findings. The results rather hint at the possibility that European identification is independent of political integration.","[Roose, Jochen] Free Univ Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Roose, J (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Inst Sociol, Garystr 55, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",jochen.roose@fu-berlin.de,,/0000-0001-5301-4754,,,,,40,20,21,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In the context of cooperative games this trade-off can be framed as one of choosing to allocate according to the Shapley value or the equal division solution. In this paper we provide three different characterizations of egalitarian Shapley values being convex combinations of the Shapley value and the equal division solution. First, from the perspective of a variable player set, we show that all these solutions satisfy the same reduced game consistency. Second, on a fixed player set, we characterize this class of solutions using monotonicity properties. Finally, towards a strategic foundation, we provide a non-cooperative implementation for these solutions which only differ in the probability of breakdown at a certain stage of the game. These characterizations discover fundamental differences as well as intriguing connections between marginalism and egalitarianism.","[van den Brink, Rene] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van den Brink, Rene] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Funaki, Yukihiko] Waseda Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Ju, Yuan] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Waseda University; University of York - UK,"den Brink, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jrbrink@feweb.vu.nl; funaki@waseda.jp; yuan.ju@york.ac.uk,,"van den Brink, Rene/0000-0001-8570-3706","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19046001, 23530231] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,32,71,71,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2013,40.0,3,,,,,693,714,,10.1007/s00355-011-0634-2,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,072HX,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313662000004,0

However, not all non-production workers are highly skilled. This paper disaggregates non-production workers into the following three categories: (i) skilled non-production workers, (ii) unskilled non-production workers and (iii) non-production workers with special skills for offshoring and other overseas business management. By linking our offshoring survey data with firm-level data for Japanese manufacturing firms, this paper finds that the share of skilled non-production workers tends to be significantly high in offshoring firms but that of unskilled non-production workers is not. As offshoring has expanded from production to non-production tasks, this result implies that the distinction between skilled versus unskilled workers becomes critical among non-production workers. Using our unique data on supplier types in offshoring, this paper finds that the share of non-production workers for the management of overseas activities tends to be high in foreign direct investment firms and in firms outsourcing to foreign independent suppliers, but not in Japanese firms outsourcing to offshore suppliers located abroad but owned by other Japanese firms. This difference indicates that coordination burdens are likely to be at least partly mitigated by common languages or shared business practices. These findings suggest that offshoring has different impacts on employment depending on suppliers and the worker's skill. The principal results are confirmed robust even after various firm characteristics are controlled for in panel regressions, though we should not give any causal interpretations.","[Tomiura, Eiichi] Yokohama Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Yokohama, Kanagawa 240, Japan; [Tomiura, Eiichi] RIETI, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Ito, Banri] Senshu Univ, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan; [Ito, Banri] RIETI, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan; [Wakasugi, Ryuhei] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan; [Wakasugi, Ryuhei] RIETI, Kyoto, Japan",Yokohama National University; Kyoto University,"Tomiura, E (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Yokohama, Kanagawa 240, Japan.",,"Tomiura, Eichi/AAT-8223-2021","Ito, Banri/0000-0003-3912-9947; Tomiura, Eiichi/0000-0002-7409-6741; Wakasugi, Ryuhei/0000-0002-9767-1470",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22530218] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,19,6,7,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2013,36.0,2,,,,,180,193,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01477.x,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,090KI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314977600003,0

In the sea culture of Chinese nation, a duel mentality respecting and fearing of sea is mixed together. Absent knowledge and low productivity are the fundamental reasons for the emergence of all fears. The natural rejection of sinister natural environment and superior continental civilization to sea civilization made Chinese ancestors terrified by sea. Meanwhile, they showed respects to the natural world as an alien power. Subsequently, a cultural psychology worshiping sea is generated in the minds of Chinese ancestors. In thousands of years of the historic development of China, Chinese nation not only created a splendid continent culture, but also bred a brilliant sea culture. As a maritime power, China's sea culture also has produced its own profound and distinctive characteristics along with the long history of Chinese nation in recognizing, exploring, developing and utilizing sea.

This paper explores the relationship between internet disclosure, profitability and financial structure in the shipping sector. Its value added lies in treating the disclosure-profitability relationship as a two-way relationship: while previous research concentrates on profitability as the main driver for greater internet disclosure, we argue that the higher the degree of internet disclosure of financial information, the more likely it is that the firm will experience enhanced profitability. Studying the websites of 171 international listed shipping corporations in 2010 we construct a disclosure index to measure the quantity of disseminated information for each firm in the sample and we explore the cross sectional determinants of disclosure performance. Measuring corporate performance with profitability, we develop a simultaneous equation model and our GMM results produce evidence of a statistically significant positive relationship between the extent of internet disclosure and corporate performance. Our finding largely explains why shipping firms are keen on making more and more financial information available via the web and has significant policy implications for executives, as it suggests that greater internet disclosure is not a mere effect of sound financial performance, but also, and perhaps more importantly, a requirement for it.

If a firm switches from exporting to FDI, domestic activity and tax payments may decrease, stay constant or even rise because of intra-firm trade. It turns out that, in contrast to recent claims, in all three cases, the optimal tax system implies full taxation after deduction of foreign tax payments. If the country accounts for the effects of its policy on the foreign price level, the case for taxing foreign income becomes even stronger. However, the globally optimal tax system may require exemption of foreign income from tax.","Univ Munster, Inst Publ Econ, D-48143 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Becker, J (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Publ Econ, Wilmergasse 6-8, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",,,,,,,,38,5,5,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2013,36.0,1,,,,,76,92,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01474.x,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,073NQ,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313750100006,0

Using a large sample of Indian districts from the 19831999 period, we find that urbanization has a substantial and systematic poverty-reducing effect in the surrounding rural areas. The results obtained through an instrumental variable estimation suggest that this effect is causal in nature and is largely attributable to the positive spillovers of urbanization on the rural economy rather than to the movement of the rural poor to urban areas.

The aim of this paper is to find out whether there is significant human capital effect on economic output in Visegrad group countries during the period 1999-2011. Augmented standard aggregate production function linking output to productive inputs - labour, physical capital, human capital and total factor productivity is used according to the new theories of economic growth. Many researchers express human capital as investment in education, schooling enrollments or average length of education. From our point of view, these variables do not seem to be appropriate indicators of human capital. The value of it is expressed by tertiary graduates. Annual data collected from Eurostat were employed. Due to shortcoming of observations panel data model was performed. We found out negligible, but positive and statistically significant influence of human capital on economic growth.","[Chudarkova, Silvie; Verner, Tomas] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Econ, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,chudarkova@opf.slu.cz; verner@opf.slu.cz,"Verner, Tomas/GRJ-3425-2022","Verner, Tomas/0000-0003-4011-0549",,,,,20,4,4,0,5,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,321,325,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000055,0

Customers incoming to the system are served according to the FCFS discipline, service times are considered to follow the Erlang distribution defined by the shape parameter and the scale parameter. Customers can wait for the service in the queue which length is limited by (m-1) places, that means the total capacity of the queueing system is equal to m places. Further, we assume that the server can break down. Breakdowns of the server are considered to be non-preemptive that means when a breakdown occurs during customer servicing it is possible to finish it before server repair is started. Times between breakdowns and repair times are assumed to follow the exponential distribution. We model the queue as a quasi-birth death process for which we present steady-state diagram and equation system describing the system behaviour in the steady-state. Solving the equation system in Matlab we get stationary probabilities which are used for computing basic performance measures.

In general, taking into account game-theoretical approach, any parliamentary voting can be described as a cooperative game with transferable utility function. Moreover, in real world, agents of the game - usually political parties - act not strictly as predicted in theory. As all real systems are full of an uncertainty, also parliamentary voting can be described up to some degree of freedom. The concept of Shapley value, first introduced by L. S. Shapley in 1953, was the first attempt to evaluate players of these game types. Since then, many adjustments to the basic theory were done in order to improve real data results. One of such a transformation, the Owen and Shapley spatial index, took into account both the effect of agenda and the distribution of power. Adjustments of the index were done by Barr, Pasarelli and Benatiand, Marzetti, who tested the theory on the decision-making process in the European Union. To incorporate the coalition forming influence, Bilal, Albuquerque and Hosli proposed to consider additional weights to possible coalitions into power indices. This article applies the concept of additional weights to calculate power in a real voting, namely the data from the Lower House of the Czech Parliament with the emphasis on the State Budget voting issues.","[Mielcova, Elena] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,mielcova@opf.slu.cz,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,624,629,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000106,0

We use data on agricultural policy from 69 countries spanning a wide range of development stages and media markets to test these predictions. Our empirical results are consistent with theoretical hypotheses that public support for agriculture is affected by the mass media. In particular, an increase in media (television) diffusion is associated with policies that benefit the majority to a greater extent and is correlated with a reduction in agriculture taxation in poor countries and a reduction in the subsidization of agriculture in rich countries, ceteris paribus. The empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased competition in commercial media reduces transfers to special interest groups and contributes to more efficient public policies.","[Olper, Alessandro] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Swinnen, Johan] Univ Leuven, Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Louvain, Belgium",University of Milan; KU Leuven,"Olper, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",alessandro.olper@unimi.it; Jo.Swinnen@econ.kuleuven.be,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978",,,,,47,17,17,2,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

When the individual demands are smaller than the vehicle capacity, it is possible to formulate this task as the well-known vehicle routing problem. Apart from their private fleet of vehicles the managers may, in substantiated cases, consider using an external common carrier. This problem is called the vehicle routing problem with a private fleet and a common carrier (VRPPC) in the existing literature. The purpose of this contribution is to formulate a new variety of this problem, which is interesting from the point of practice and which was formulated on the basis of an authentic case of a local logistic firm. Let us suppose that it is possible to consider, with each individual customer, meeting his demand by means of one's own private fleet or by means of a common carrier, but also by sharing both these ways. In the contribution a mathematical model of this VRPPC variety has been developed.

Currently there is no agreement on the explanation of economic evolution. From the perspective of the history of economic thought, at first the theoretical approaches of Schumpeter and Marshall with regard to economic development or evolution are dealt with in detail. For both authors technical and economic innovations are the engine of economic change. According to Schumpeter, they are created through newly established firms as the agents of change. For Marshall, innovations and economic development are a side effect of the manufacturing process and the division of labour. Technical and economic changes go off both gradually (Marshall) or discontinuously (Schumpeter). After that, a concept of neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary economics is elaborated. Evolution is understood as a process of change that leads to the adaptation of complex systems, the result of the causal interaction between variation, selection and retention of variety leading to continuity over time. It has gained wide application to the theory of innovation and later to resource-based theories of the firm. Modern evolutionary economics includes the determinants of new knowledge and innovations into its analysis. Business enterprises not only follow their routine behaviour, in a dynamic view they also show capabilities to restructure their given resources and to build new ones. To sum up, technical and economic evolution are both the result of the unintentional market selection through competitive forces of the environment, and of the intentional, voluntary entrepreneurial choices, based on the firm's resources and dynamic capabilities.","Univ Augsburg, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, Wirtschaftswissensch Fak, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Rahmeyer, F (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, Wirtschaftswissensch Fak, Univ Str 16, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany.",Fritz.Rahmeyer@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,,,,,,,121,0,0,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We analyze the case in which three parties can hold office in the form of two-party coalitions. We define a family of weighted rules that select political agreements as a function of the bliss points of the parties and electoral results (Gamson's law and equal share among others are included). We show that every weighted rule yields a stable coalition. We use implementation theory to design a protocol (in the form of a mechanism) that guarantees that a stable coalition will govern. We find that no dominant solvable mechanism can be used for this purpose, but there is a simultaneous unanimity mechanism that implements it in Nash and strong Nash equilibrium. Finally, we analyze the case of a larger number of political parties.","Univ Malaga, Fac Econ, Dpto Teoria & Hist Econ, Malaga 29013, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Puy, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Fac Econ, Dpto Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus Ejido, Malaga 29013, Spain.",mps@uma.es,"Puy, M.

The first stage of a priori tariffication is based on observable risk factors. In Poland these factors are the region of car registration and the car engine displacement. The second stage involves tariffication built on the claim record of the insured. Bonus-malus systems form an a posteriori stage in defining a tariff policy in car insurance. Each bonus malus system is comprised of classes which are defined by the rate of premium and have specified rules of transition. In the paper we explored the influence of changes in transition rules between classes on tariff effectiveness of bonus malus systems. For effectiveness evaluation we used stochastic measures based on the Markov chain theory.

The model takes an integrated portfolio perspective and addresses uncertainty in future prices. Decision variables include investments and disinvestments in infrastructure and vessels, chartering of vessels, the timing of contracts, and spot market trades. The model accounts for various contract types and vessels, and it addresses losses. The underlying mathematical model is a multistage stochastic mixed-integer linear problem. Industry-motivated numerical cases are discussed as benchmarks for the potential increases in profits that can be obtained by using the model for decision support. These examples illustrate how a portfolio perspective leads to decisions different than those obtained using the traditional net present value approach. We show how explicitly considering uncertainty affects investment and contracting decisions, leading to higher profits and better utilization of capacity. In addition, model run times are competitive with current business practices of manual planning.","[Werner, Adrian; Uggen, Kristin Tolstad; Fodstad, Marte; Lium, Arnt-Gunnar; Egging, Ruud] SINTEF Technol & Soc, Dept Appl Econ & Operat Res, Trondheim, Norway; [Fodstad, Marte; Egging, Ruud] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Fodstad, M (通讯作者)，SINTEF Technol & Soc, Dept Appl Econ & Operat Res, Trondheim, Norway.",AdrianTobias.Werner@sintef.no; KristinTolstad.Uggen@sintef.no; Marte.Fodstad@sintef.no; Arnt-Gunnar.Lium@sintef.no; Ruud.Egging@sintef.no,"Egging-Bratseth, Ruud/AAF-3005-2020","Egging-Bratseth, Ruud/0000-0002-5061-636X; Werner, Adrian/0000-0003-0842-1531; Tolstad Uggen, Kristin/0000-0002-3209-1272",Norwegian Research Council [187340],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"We are grateful to The Norwegian Research Council (grant 187340) and two industry partners for providing funding for this project.

Using data from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study, a survey of more than 3000 adults ages 25-74 in 1995, we contrast underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese I, and obese II/III persons along five psychosocial outcomes: positive mood, negative mood, perceived interpersonal discrimination, self-acceptance, and self-satisfaction. We further assess whether these relationships are contingent upon one's body mass index (BMI) at age 21. We find a strong inverse association between adult BMI and each of the five outcomes, reflecting the stigma associated with high body weight. However, overweight adults who were also overweight at age 21 are more likely than persons who were previously slender to say they were very satisfied with themselves. Results from 40 in-depth semi-structured interviews reveal similarly that persons who were persistently overweight or obese accept their weight as part of their identity, whereas those who experienced substantial weight increases (or decreases) struggle between two identities: the weight they actually are, and the weight that they believe exemplifies who they are. We discuss implications for stigma theory, and the ways that stigma exits and entries affect psychological well-being. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the financial backlash experienced by strategic defaulters is less than anticipated, causing strategic defaulters not to regret their actions. State-specific bankruptcy exemption levels and real estate laws only marginally explain the decision to strategically default, partly because the decision to walk away from a mortgage is emotional, and partly because the implementation of these laws is uncertain and confusing to distressed borrowers. Rather, we find key strategic default drivers include the homeowner's expectation of future real estate price movements, frustration with the lender, moral evaluation of the decision to strategically default, loan knowledge, political ideology, gender, income and age.","[Seiler, Michael J.; Lane, Mark A.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Finance, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Seiler, Vicky L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Real Estate, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Harrison, David M.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Finance, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Old Dominion University; Johns Hopkins University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Seiler, MJ (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Finance, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",mseiler@odu.edu; vickyseiler@cox.net; malane@odu.edu; david.m.harrison@ttu.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,30,46,54,0,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,DEC,2012,40.0,,,1,,,S199,S233,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2012.00349.x,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,062UO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312948500007,0

CDDs finance infrastructure through tax-free bonds, which are paid by property owners.

Our results suggest that in a recession Canadians sleep an average of 3 h more per week, or 26 min more per day. Given the importance of even small changes in sleep time on measures of cognitive functioning such as reaction time and concentration, our findings may help explain the countercyclical nature of mortality. Further, as we find that sleep is affected by the same economic variables (notably the unemployment rate) that affect market work time, our results also contribute to the limited literature that shows that sleep time should not be treated as exogenously determined, but, like any other resource, determined by its relative cost.","[Brochu, Pierre; Armstrong, Catherine Deri; Morin, Louis-Philippe] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Armstrong, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",pbrochu@uottawa.ca; cdarmstrong@uottawa.ca; lmorin@uottawa.ca,"Morin, Louis-Philippe/AAM-7333-2020","Morin, Louis-Philippe/0000-0002-9204-1277",,,,,22,22,27,0,21,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In Ireland too, the multifaceted nature of health production has been acknowledged, but this has not led to real policy change in respect of prioritisation and consequent resource allocation. The emphasis in Ireland remains narrowly focused on access to acute health care services as the core strategy for equalising health opportunities across the population. While equal access for equal need is an essential component in ensuring better, and more equal, health outcomes, particularly in relation to accessing new technologies, it is insufficient in its own right to deal with many of the economic and social determinants associated with health production. This paper argues for a comprehensive health reform programme to encompass the many determinants of population health; such an approach would provide the opportunity for all citizens to maximise their health potential.","[O'Shea, Eamon; Connolly, Sheelah] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"O'Shea, E (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland.",,,"Connolly, Sheelah/0000-0002-8539-6424",,,,,44,2,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2012,35.0,10,,,SI,,1359,1371,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01488.x,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,021MY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309890100010,0

An individual emigrates if his domestic utility is less than his utility abroad net of migration costs, utilities and costs both depending on productivity. Three average social criteria are distinguished-national, citizen and resident-according to the agents whose welfare matters. A curse of the middle-skilled occurs in the first-best, and it may be optimal to let some highly skilled leave the country under the resident criterion. In the second-best, under the Citizen and Resident criteria, preventing emigration of the highly skilled is not necessarily optimal because the interaction between the incentive-compatibility and participations constraints may cause countervailing incentives.

This fact still holds true if equal weights are used for the construction of the composite indicator in order to reflect the uncertainty about the origin of future crises.,"[Knedlik, Tobias; Von Schweinitz, Gregor] Halle Inst Econ Res, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Von Schweinitz, Gregor] Univ Halle Wittenberg, D-4010 Halle, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Knedlik, T (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res, Kleine Maerkerstr 8, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",Tobias.knedlik@iwh-halle.de,"von Schweinitz, Gregor/CAA-5344-2022","von Schweinitz, Gregor/0000-0001-9293-3470",,,,,33,37,38,0,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Does the heterogeneity persist over time? Using data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 censuses, this paper finds that the performance of migrants from countries with lower initial occupational placement levels improves at a higher rate compared with that of migrants originating from countries with higher initial performance levels. Nevertheless, the magnitude of convergence suggests that full catch-up is unlikely. Country specific attributes affect the immigrants' occupational placement primarily through their effect on initial performance and they lose significance when initial occupational levels are controlled for in the estimation.

We empirically investigate whether trends in residential real estate prices affect headquarters-city stock pricing phenomena for companies across U.S. metro areas for 1989-2004. Specifically, we hypothesize that stocks of firms headquartered in 'hot' residential real estate markets experience higher returns compared to stocks of firms from 'cold' markets. We also hypothesize that stocks of firms headquartered in hot real estate markets display stronger return comovement with same-city stocks. We find support for these hypotheses during the 1999-2004 sample period which coincides with the start of the housing bubble of the 2000 s; we find mixed results in earlier periods. Our findings indicate that city-specific home price patterns conditionally affect stock pricing of local firms, suggesting that investor behavior is influenced by localized shocks to household real estate wealth.","[Beracha, Eli] E Carolina Univ, Coll Business, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Anderson, Christopher W.] Univ Kansas, Sch Business, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University of Kansas,"Beracha, E (通讯作者)，E Carolina Univ, Coll Business, 3129 Bate Bldg, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",cwanderson@ku.edu; berachae@ecu.edu,,,,,,,51,10,12,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Nonlinearity testing for this specification uses a search over a plausible set of weight function parameters, combined with bootstrap inference. Finite-sample results show that the recommended wild bootstrap heteroskedasticity-robust testing procedure performs well, for both homoskedastic and heteroskedastic data-generating processes.

We also find that conflict-induced migration intensity is considerably higher for composers than for the overall population and demonstrate that the share of composers in the overall population drops due to the incidence of war.

Nevertheless, research in industrial organization that has focused on the influences on firm survival has largely ignored the potential effects from agglomeration. Recent studies in urban and regional economics suggest that agglomeration effects may be very localized. Analyses of industry concentration at the MSA or county-level may fail to detect important elements of intra-industry firm interaction that occur at the sub-MSA level. Using a highly detailed dataset on firm locations and characteristics for Texas, this paper analyses agglomeration effects on firm survival over geographic areas as small as a single mile radius. We find that greater firm density within very close proximity (within 1 mile) of firms in the same industry increases mortality rates while greater concentration over larger distances reduces mortality rates.

Firm inefficiency is estimated by comparing a benchmark Tobin's Q of a hypothetical value-maximizing firm to the firm's actual Q. We find that the average inefficiency of equity REITs is around 45.5%, and that institutional ownership can improve the firm's corporate governance, and hence reduce firm inefficiency. Moreover, we highlight the importance of heterogeneity in institutional investors-certain types of institutional investors such as long-term, active, and top-five institutional investors, and investment advisors are more effective institutional investors in reducing firm inefficiency; whereas hedge funds and pension funds seem to aggravate the problem. In sub-sample analysis, we find that these effective institutional investors can reduce inefficiency more effectively for distressed REITs, and for REITs with high information asymmetry, and with longer term lease contracts. Lastly, we find that the negative impact of institutional ownership (except for long-term institutional investors) on firm inefficiency reduces over time, possibly due to strengthened corporate governance and regulatory environment in the REIT industry.","[Fung, Scott; Hung, Szu-Yin Kathy] Calif State Univ E Bay, Dept Accounting & Finance, Hayward, CA 94542 USA; [Chung, Richard] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",California State University System; California State University East Bay; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Hung, SYK (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ E Bay, Dept Accounting & Finance, Hayward, CA 94542 USA.",kathy.hung@csueastbay.edu,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,,,,,74,37,37,3,57,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Technical efficiency is analysed by using the inverse B-convexity model, comparing and contrasting it with traditional DEA methods.

Indeed, if team A plays against team B, and subsequently against team C, A's performance against C may have been affected by B, and we say that team C receives a carryover effect from B. For instance, if team B is a very strong team, then team A could be exhausted and discouraged after this game, which could benefit its next opponent, team C. Clearly, any schedule will lead to carryover effects. In practice, the perceived influence of carryover effects has been used as an argument when producing a schedule. In this work, we develop an approach to measure whether carryover effects have an influence on the outcome of football matches. The authors apply this method on the highest division in Belgium, using data from over 30 seasons, amounting over 10,000 matches.

We account for structural instability by use of country-specific intercept shifts, the timings of which are identified taking into account both statistical evidence and our knowledge of historic economic conditions and events. Using this model, we compute both central forecasts and scenario-based probabilistic forecasts for a range of events of interest, including the sign and trajectory of the balance of trade, the achievement of a short-term inflation target, and the incidence of recession and slow growth. The forecasting performance of the GVAR model in relation to the ongoing financial crisis is quite remarkable. It correctly identifies a pronounced and widespread economic contraction accompanied by a marked shift in the net trade balance of the Eurozone and Japan. Moreover, this promising out-of-sample forecasting performance is substantiated by a raft of statistical tests which indicate that the predictive accuracy of the GVAR model is broadly comparable to that of standard benchmark models over short horizons and superior over longer horizons. Hence we conclude that GVAR models may be a useful forecasting tool for institutions operating at both the national and supra-national levels.

Results show that changes in expected inflation explain a large share of the time series variation of the mispricing component of the dividend yield. Also, while both inflation hedging and inflation illusion effects exist for REITs, the inflation illusion effect tends to dominate the hedging effect during the 1980 to 2008 period. These results suggest that investors are unable to quickly reconcile changes in discount rates and dividend growth rates associated with inflation into stock prices.

Analyzing tail dependence is of primary interest to portfolio managers who systematically monitor the co-movements of asset markets. However, the relevant literature on real estate securities markets is very thin. Our study extends the literature by using the flexible symmetrized Joe-Clayton (SJC) copula to estimate the tail dependences for six major global markets (U.S., U.K., Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore). In implementing the SJC copula, we model the marginal distributions of returns through a semi-parametric method which has never been applied to real estate returns. Our major findings suggest that international markets display different strength and dynamics of tail dependence. We extensively discuss the implications of our findings for financial practices such as portfolio tail diversifications, portfolio selections, portfolio risk management and hedging strategies. Our study also demonstrates that the widely used linear correlation is an inadequate measure of market linkages, especially during periods of crisis.","[Zhou, Jian] Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Gao, Yanmin] Univ Alberta, Sch Business, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Alberta,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jian@uoguelph.ca; yanmin@bus.ualberta.ca,,"Gao, Yanmin/0000-0003-4686-1781",,,,,38,35,39,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The United States has recently devoted substantial financial support to EBED efforts. Although early assessments of these efforts are promising, the discipline is at risk of becoming compromised or discredited. It lacks a basic framework, common definitions, and clear goals, which is problematic for a field that requires cross-disciplinary coordination and collaboration. Most EBED evaluation efforts take place before a project is underway; without enough postproject analyses, practitioners are left with unreliable impact estimates. Finally, like early-stage energy technologies themselves, EBED relies heavily on potentially unpredictable or inconsistent funding. These factors render many practitioners ill-equipped to effectively plan, implement, and evaluate specific EBED initiatives.

The route choice decision of commuter drivers is often modelled with one objective, to reduce their generalised travel cost, which is a monetary value representing the combined travel time and vehicle operating cost. Commuter cyclists, on the other hand, usually have multiple incommensurable objectives when choosing their route: the travel time and the suitability of a route. By suitability we mean non-subjective factors that characterise the suitability of a route for cycling, including safety, traffic volumes, traffic speeds, presence of bicycle lanes, whether the terrain is flat or hilly, etc. While these incommensurable objectives are difficult to be combined into a single objective, it is also important to take into account that each individual cyclist may prioritise differently between travel time and suitability when they choose a route. This paper proposes a novel model to determine the route choice set of commuter cyclists by formulating a bi-objective routing problem. The two objectives considered are travel time and suitability of a route for cycling. Rather than determining a single route for a cyclist, we determine a choice set of optimal alternative routes (efficient routes) from which a cyclist may select one according to their personal preference depending on their perception of travel time versus other route choice criteria considered in the suitability index. This method is then implemented in a case study in Auckland, New Zealand. The study provides a starting point for the trip assignment of cyclists, and with further research, the bi-objective routing model developed can be applied to create a complete travel demand forecast model for cycle trips. We also suggest the application of the developed methodology as an algorithm in an interactive route finder to suggest efficient route choices at different levels of suitability to cyclists and potential cyclists.

The functions are then estimated using penalized spline estimation. The bivariate approach will allow to compare business cycles, check and compare phase lengths and visualize this in forms of loops in a bivariate way. Moreover, the focus is on separation of long and short phase fluctuation, where only the latter is the classical business cycle while the first is better known as Friedman or Goodwin cycle, respectively. Again, we use nonparametric models and fit the functional shape with penalized splines.

Difference-in-difference analyses investigate whether this shift in preferences triggered taste-based discrimination in one of the world's most elite professional settings: applications to trade at the NYSE. This analysis indicates that changes in preferences more than doubled the probability that applicants with German-sounding names would be rejected. Placebo regressions for other non-German minorities yield no evidence of taste effects. Equivalent regressions that distinguish German Jewish from other Jewish applicants, however, indicate that German Jewish applicants were similarly affected as were other Germans.

The focus is on how gender is used by political youth groups as an organizing principle for exhibiting or withholding support for state leaders and opposition leaders.","Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Sperling, V (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",,,,,,,,59,20,21,0,19,BELLWETHER PUBL LTD,COLUMBIA,"8640 GUILFORD RD, STE 200, COLUMBIA, MD 21046 USA",1060-586X,,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Policy action appeared justified by evidence that older workers are less likely to participate in training, and more likely to have never been offered training by employers - a key finding of Taylor and Urwin's (2001) review of Labour Force Survey (LFS) data from 1997. This article models LFS data from 2007 to assess whether age remained a predictor of inequalities in training. It finds that men over 50 remained among those least likely to have been offered training by employers. There were other significant inequalities in participation, suggesting a polarization in access to jobs that offer opportunities for training and progression. The article concludes that policies promoting 'active ageing' need to challenge negative employer attitudes and acknowledge fundamental inequalities in access to skills.","[Lindsay, Colin] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, HRM, Glasgow G1 1XU, Lanark, Scotland; [Canduela, Jesus; Dutton, Matthew; McQuaid, Ronald W.] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Inst Employment Res, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Johnson, Steve] Univ Hull, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Strathclyde; Edinburgh Napier University; University of Hull,"Lindsay, C (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, HRM, Glasgow G1 1XU, Lanark, Scotland.",colin.lindsay@strath.ac.uk,"McQuaid, Ronald/K-6219-2012; Dutton, Matthew/C-5763-2017; canduela, jesus/E-8677-2019","McQuaid, Ronald/0000-0002-5342-7097; Lindsay, Colin/0000-0003-2493-6797; CANDUELA, JESUS/0000-0002-9898-5367",,,,,33,40,44,1,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The authors use a less restrictive econometric technique - the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test - to test for cointegration among the variables in the tourism demand equations. The empirical results from the bounds test indicate the existence of a unique long-run relationship between tourist arrivals, per capita real income, tourism prices and transport costs. The estimated results show that changes in tourists' income, tourism prices, travel costs, the 9/11 2001 terrorist attacks on the USA and the 2003 US-Iraq War significantly affect tourists' travel decisions. The results also show that tourism demand for Caribbean destinations is highly income elastic in both the short run and the long run, but relatively price inelastic in both periods. The price inelasticities suggest that if policy makers and/or tourism stakeholders increase the prices of the tourism products and services, this would not decrease the number of tourist arrivals proportionally but would increase total tourism receipts or revenues. Overall, the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ stability tests reveal that the parameters of the international tourism demand models are stable and, as such, they can be used for policy analysis and forecasting.","[Owoye, Oluwole] Western Connecticut State Univ, Dept Social Sci Econ, Danbury, CT 06810 USA; [Onafowora, Olugbenga A.] Susquehanna Univ, Dept Econ, Selinsgrove, PA 17870 USA",Connecticut State University System; Western Connecticut State University; Susquehanna University,"Owoye, O (通讯作者)，Western Connecticut State Univ, Dept Social Sci Econ, Danbury, CT 06810 USA.",Onafowor@susqu.edu; Owoyeo@wcsu.edu,,"onafowora, olugbenga/0000-0002-0761-7244",,,,,63,27,29,1,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Citizens rightly demand simple, easy to understand, voting systems. The alternative, though, seems to have simple, but unsound electoral laws. We propose the following way out of this dilemma: leave to a mathematically sophisticated algorithm the task of producing an optimal apportionment, but attach to it a certificate of optimality, that is, describe a simple procedure whereby anybody can check, through some elementary operations, that the seat allocation output by the algorithm is indeed an optimal apportionment.

In doing so, there is a problem when teachers with a positive attitude to students, requiring a similar approach also from their students, tend to receive a negative evaluation from inferior students, thereby distorting the results.

Dealing with this dilemma, Customs significantly changed its role and position in the international supply chain. Mainly, Customs replaced its gatekeeper's role, with the new modernized, complex and very sophisticated risk management approach. The main characteristic of customs risk management approach is determining which persons, goods, and means of transport should be examined and to what extend. High-risk persons, goods and means of transport are subject of high-level controls and interventions; despite of low-risk ones that receive high-level trade facilitation. The Customs Administration of the Republic of Macedonia, as an institution involved in all international modernization processes related to trade facilitation and efforts to ensure duty collection and social security and safety, implements contemporary improvements and developments in standardization and harmonisation of customs procedures and management systems.

It is universally usable, in human diet (source of inulin), for livestock feeding and as an energy crop. In field trials performed in Valecov Research Station belonging to PRI Havlickuv Brod, during 2008 - 2010 an effect of genotype and growing technology was studied on Jerusalem artichoke production characteristics. Totally, 13 clones were used. The harvest of aboveground mass was done in autumn, tubers were harvested in spring (though deep soil freezing, the tubers are not frost-killed). In dependence on year and clone, yields of aboveground part reached 34,2 - 71,9 t FW/ha (12,4 - 24,7 t DW/ha). The yield of spring-harvested tubers ranged between 21,8 and 38,3 t/ha (4,4 - 7,9 t DW/ha). Growing technologies for Jerusalem artichoke were verified, in relation to optimization of cultural practices for obtaining high yields. The most effective fertilization variant was 100 kg N/ha and foliar application of urea, between planting densities no significant differences were recorded for yields. The trials were established to determine soil conservation and ecological function of Jerusalem artichoke crop. On two dates intensive rainfall was simulated on Jerusalem artichoke crop grown on slope. On the first date (July) reduced water runoff and a half soil loss (0,405 t/ha) were found compared to potato crop (0,84 t/ha). On the second date (September), when potato crop is already lodged, the more favourable situation was determined in potatoes compared to Jerusalem artichoke crop. Biogas recovery of aboveground part was studied in two clones, differing in production of aboveground biomass and stem:leaf ratio. Biogas recovery in the sample A was 103-110 m(3)/t FW, corresponding to methan recovery 68-70 m(3)/t FW. Biogas recovery in the sample B was 69-84 m(3)/t FW, corresponding to methan recovery of 41,8-54,5 m(3)/t FW. The results of trials indicated relatively high potential of Jerusalem artichoke in regard to possibilities for non-food use.","[Cepl, Jaroslav; Kasal, Pavel; Souckova, Helena; Svobodova, Andrea; Bucher, Petr] Potato Res Inst Havlickuv Brod, Havlickuv Brod 58001, Czech Republic",Potato Research Institute Havlickuv Brod,"Cepl, J (通讯作者)，Potato Res Inst Havlickuv Brod, Dobrovskeho 2366, Havlickuv Brod 58001, Czech Republic.",cepl@vubhb.cz,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,6,AGRONOMSKI FAKULTET SVEUCILISTA U ZAGREBU,10000 ZAGREB,"SVETOSIMUNSKA 25, 10000 ZAGREB, CROATIA",1848-4425,,,ACT TASKS AGRIC ENG,,,2012,40.0,,,,,,517,526,,,,,,10,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BCA45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309447100051,0

We have also studied a series of indicators of intangible capital, made up of human, relational, and structural capital, in order to identify the extent to which the Romanian and Spanish accounting environments meet the challenges concerning the acknowledgement of intangible elements. Methodology - We have analyzed the annual financial statements corresponding to the fiscal year closed on 12.31.2011, drawn according to IAS/IFRS provisions, for 19 companies listed in the Bucharest Stock Exchange and 26 Spanish companies quoted in the Madrid Stock Exchange, components of the IBEX 35 market index, and we have computed the mean degree of dissemination of the information on intangible assets based on the points obtained by each company to a set of questions, designed in the spirit of the IAS 38 provisions.

The data was processed using the SPSS-Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. Conclusions - After analyzing the collected data using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), we have seen significant differences in what concerns the reporting of intangible assets.

It also gives a summary review of selected key elements needed in assessing the country risk. Further the paper stress some of the basic indicators for assessment of the country risk (The Debt Service Ratio, Import Ratio, Investment Ratio, VAREX-Variance of Export Revenue, Domestic Money Supply Growth), and their indicative calculation for Macedonia, based on relevant available data. Than follows an overview of basic macroeconomic indicators in Macedonia that are included in the calculation of country risk, and through which an attempt is made to monitor and predict changes in risk exposure of Macedonia in the 2007-2014 period. Proposals for possible reduction of the Macedonia risk exposure in terms of unstable environment are moving toward determination of the underlying strengths and weaknesses of the Macedonian economy, and in direction of developing strategies for promotion of the advantages and reducing the vulnerabilities. That is in order to change the perception of Macedonia in the immediate and wider environment and to attract foreign direct investments and various other forms of investment in the country. Shortly, the goal of the paper is to point the importance of country risk assessment, to determine and compute the basic indicators of country risk in Macedonia, and having in mind those indicators and main macroeconomic indicators to suggest some strategies for its reduction.

This creates an asymmetric information problem because of hidden knowledge on the part of the primary lenders, who naturally have much better access to this information. This is aggravated by the free rider problem when there are multiple investors. We discuss to what extent the secondary market then seeks to sort the loans to ameliorate this problem and what role reputations play. More importantly, however, the actions of the primary lender in terms of which kinds of loans they choose to approve are partly hidden, and this typical principal-agent situation importantly aggravates the incentive problem. To judge the nature and magnitude of this moral hazard dilemma, we use data to compare how well investors in the secondary mortgage market can predict default given the information they typically have access to as compared to the ability of primary lenders to similarly predict default given the larger set of information they typically will have access to. Finally, the implications of these results are indicated, particularly in light of the recent mortgage crisis.","[Kau, James B.; Lyubimov, Constantine] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Keenan, Donald C.] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Dept Econ & Management, Cergy Pontoise, France; [Keenan, Donald C.] THEMA, Strasbourg, France; [Slawson, V.

In two of the three cities institutional arrays that legally establish unified decision making have shown little capacity to launch fare or physical coordination between modes. In two of the three cities the concentration of public transportation supply to historical downtowns has not been an attraction factor, and downtown uses have expanded to less accessible areas. Gentrification in Chicago is also another process showing that land use changes are related to many factors, transportation being only one of them, and not always a necessary one. In all three cases the use of railways, as a set of inherited infrastructures, has seen an increase whose magnitude suggests a link to modal reassignment due to increasing congestion. Scarcity of space in old downtown areas is being counteracted through more intense use, or through the expansion of vertical space for transportation operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas one side has recommended (in the spirit of Keynes) the exit from the euro area to regain rapidly international competitiveness, exchange rate stability cum structural reforms have been argued (in the spirit of Schumpeter) to be a beneficial long-term strategy towards the reanimation of a robust growth performance. Previous literature has estimated the average growth performance of countries with different degrees of exchange rate volatility. We augment this literature by econometrically separating between the short-term and long-term growth effects of exchange rate volatility based on a panel-cointegration framework for a sample of 60 countries clustered in five country groups. The estimations show that countries with a low degree of exchange rate volatility exhibit a higher long-term growth performance, whereas over the short-run exchange rate flexibility provides some benefits.","[Kocenda, Evzen] Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Prague 11121, Czech Republic; [Maurel, Mathilde] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, CES, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Schnabl, Gunther] Univ Leipzig, Gunther Schnabl, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Leipzig University,,evzen.kocenda@cerge-ei.cz; mathilde.maurel@univ-paris1.fr; schnabl@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,"Maurel, Mathilde/AAN-2096-2021; Kocenda, Evzen/R-9674-2017","Maurel, Mathilde/0000-0003-4543-4286; Kocenda, Evzen/0000-0003-4110-1169",GACR [403/11/0020],GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),We benefited from comments byyresentation participants at Prague and Shanghai.

The first part creates a broader context in which cultural tourism should be a part of the tourist offer. The second section focuses on a specific tourist destination, the city of Ohrid, which defines the necessary activities in order to ensure successful development of the cultural tourism. The analysis is based on the application of the SWOT methodology, applied for the wider area of Macedonia, with a detailed case study elaboration for the Ohrid area as most suitable for development of cultural tourism. The analysis differentiates the basic areas: the supply side, the scope of governance, marketing and promotion, with numerous indicated activities necessary to ensure the sustainable development of cultural tourism in an area protected by UNESCO. Generally it should be accepted that if cultural tourism is a complex type of tourism, then for its development the cluster approach should be essential which will ensure involvement of all stakeholders. If a variety of relevant activities are provided in the basic domains of operation which are addressed to each participant in cultural tourism, then its success will be very certain.

This paper will focus on the gold-inscribed code of the Glagolitic culture, which is present in its different expressive means, from artistic features of graphemes, historiographic-literary works, to construction of sacral buildings. When considering the golden inscription, we will follow the definition (Pejakovic 2000, 17) which states that the golden inscription is the geometric proportion or scale that divides a given length in such a way that any smaller segment is related to the larger one as this larger segment is related to the whole length. The introductory assumption that, beauty. was a crucial component of the Glagolitic culture is confirmed in the conclusion, i.e. beauty was part of expressiveness in which canonical principles of proportion, executed in a certain format, are meticulously observed (Pejakovic 2000, 125).

Rather than overseeing policy implementation itself like the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, the WTO relies much more heavily than other high-profile IOs on a legalist method of surveillance. This article suggests that the notion of a 'member-driven legalism' is central to how the WTO 'sees' the world. In particular, the WTO's processes reflect a strong institutional belief that neo-liberal policies can be implemented by a consensus- and member-driven legalistic WTO system. To illustrate the importance of understanding how the ways in which the WTO 'sees' the world of trade both enable and constrain its influence over trade relations, the article examines how the WTO constructs and classifies the world economy into enforceable trade issues, despite political impasse in the Doha Round. Examining the cases of trade in biofuels and trade in electronic 'cultural products', the article puts forward the argument that the WTO exercises cognitive authority in the world economy via the organisation's distinctive classification and framing activities.","[Mortensen, Jens L.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Mortensen, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark.",jlm@ifs.ku.dk,,,,,,,52,4,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the nexus between monetary stability and financial stability, in the experience of several Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania), during 2004M01-2012M02. Using a Vector Autoregressive model, we analyze the impact of monetary policy interest rate (proxy variable for monetary stability) upon the short term interest rates, exchange rates, share prices and loan to deposit ratio (proxy variables for financial stability). We want to test if key policy rate instrument is conducive to financial stability. The main findings of the paper emphasize that monetary policy interest rate is conducive to financial stability only in the case of Czech Republic and Poland, countries with a high degree of monetary policy autonomy. In the case of Bulgaria and Lithuania, the changes in European Central Bank (ECB) refinancing interest rate are not in accordance with specifically countries conditions. In Latvia, there are similarities between the monetary condition and the currency board strategy and, in Hungary and Romania, the interest rate instrument, used for inflation targeting, is not conducive to financial stability.","[Nucu, Anca-Elena] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,nucu.anca@yahoo.com,"Nucu, Anca/AAU-7713-2020",,,,,,14,0,0,0,6,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,652,657,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900112,0

First, it provides an assessment of the factors framing entrepreneurship in Croatia and how they influence the predominantly necessity-oriented entrepreneurship in the nation. The factors considered include - economics, formal institutions, culture, the industrial structure, human capital and social capital. The second purpose is to present possibilities on how different institutions, through their policies, programs and implementing organizations, impact the above factors. Understanding the sources influencing necessity entrepreneurship is important because the Croatian government's goal is to reach 75% of the EU25 mean GDP by 2013, partly using entrepreneurship development as an engine of this growth.(35) The method of research supports national economic strategies for increasing growth-oriented entrepreneurship because entrepreneurship is considered to be an effective way to raise national GDP (van Stel, Carree et al. 2005), increase employment (van Stel, Carree et al. 2005) create more robust industrial structures (Marshall 1919; Saxenian 1994; Uzzi 1997) as well as increasing social capital (Dakhli and De Clercq 2004). There are even benefits of growth-oriented entrepreneurship specific to the transition context. Researchers believe that it is a key factor in insuring the success of transition from Socialism to Capitalism (Ireland, Tihanyi et al. 2008; Smallbone and Welter 2009). The main results include three effects CEE that entrepreneurs have on economic development: being mechanisms for privatizing and restructuring state-owned enterprises; helping to transform the distorted and monopolistic centrally-planned industrial structure; and finally, establishing a private enterprise sector (Smallbone and Welter 2006).",,,,lromic@open.telekom.rs,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,128,136,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600014,0

In an efficient market, consistent prediction of the next outcome of a financial time series is problematic because there are no reoccurring patterns that can be used for a reliable prediction. This research offers an alternative test of the weak form of the EMH. It uses a universal prediction algorithm based on the Variable Order Markov tree model to identify re-occurring patterns in the data, constructs explanatory models, and predicts the next time-series outcome. Based on these predictions, it rejects the EMH for certain stock markets while accepting it for other markets. The weak form of the EMH is tested for four international stock exchanges: the German DAX index; the American Dow-Jones30 index; the Austrian ATX index and the Danish KFX index. The universal prediction algorithm is used with sliding windows of 50, 75, and 100 consecutive daily returns for periods of up to 12 trading years. Statistically significant predictions are detected for 17% to 81% of the ATX, KFX and DJ30 stock series for about 3% to 30% of the trading days. A summary prediction analysis indicates that for a confidence level of 99% the more volatile German (DAX) and American (DJ30) markets are indeed efficient. The algorithm detects periods of potential market inefficiency in the ATX and KFX markets that may be exploited for obtaining excess returns.","[Shmilovici, Armin] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Ben-Gal, Irad] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Tel Aviv University,"Shmilovici, A (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",armin@bgumail.bgu.ac.il; bengal@eng.tau.ac.il,"SHMILOVICI, ARMIN/F-2136-2012","Shmilovici, Armin/0000-0002-7202-6360",,,,,52,3,3,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

We demonstrate, using a case study based on the ISO New England system, that near-optimal solutions that are very close to one another in terms of overall system cost can yield very different generator surpluses and prices. We further demonstrate that peaking generators are more prone to surplus differences between near-optimal solutions and that transmission buses that are most prone to binding transmission constraints experience the greatest price fluctuations.

Compared to the aggregate data, the estimated own-price elasticities for all fuels and the cross-price elasticities for fossil fuels are considerably higher for thermal heating processes. Nonetheless, electricity is found to be a poor substitute for other fuels based on both aggregate data and, separately, for the heating process. An increase in real fuel prices from the Climate Change Levy in 2001 resulted in higher substitution elasticities based on aggregate data, and lower substitution elasticities for the thermal heating process. The results of a counterfactual decomposition of change in the estimated elasticities indicate that technological change was the major determinant of the differences in observed elasticities before and after the energy price increase. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol33-No1-1","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Steinbuks, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jsteinbu@purdue.edu,,"Stenbuks, Jevgenijs/0000-0003-3548-2196",U.K. Engineering and Physical Science Research Council,U.K. Engineering and Physical Science Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The author thanks Michael Grubb, Aurelie Mejean, four anonymous referees, and especially the editor, Lester Hunt, for their significant contributions that resulted in significant improvement of this manuscript.

Sustainable development requires the involvement of all people/parties in the agenda and the accounting profession cannot be exempted. Accounting takes place in the center of business information system. Since sustainable development agenda requires significance involvement of business entities, accounting profession should respond to the movement seriously. This study utilized qualitative content analysis as the method to examine ideological mind-sets and themes in the sources studied. The results indicated that, viewed from sustainable development spirit, theoretisation of conventional accounting was deficient. It stays away from the spirit of seeing the world as a system, since it does not include social and environmental aspects from its conception of the world. To support and convince the movement of business venture toward sustainability agenda, the accounting profession should be able to overcome the deficiencies in conventional accounting. Reconstruction of accounting reports, intended to overcome the deficiencies, should be based on efforts directed to incorporate the spirit of sustainable development into the conceptual framework underlying accounting standards and practices.","[Sudana, I.

In terms of operation research, the evacuation vehicle assignment problem (VAP) comprises the key part of the evacuation plan design problem. VAP represents nonlinear problem. This problem is solved by iterative method which is commonly used in fuzzy optimization to handle a nonlinearity model. With using this method in YAP, we fix the total evacuation time in order to obtain reduced vehicle assignment problem (RVAP) model. RVAP represents the hard combinatorial problem, which is computationally demanding. The branch and bound method is used for solving RVAP. The efficiency of this method is determined, among other things, by the method which serves to obtain the upper bound of the optimal solution. In this paper, we propose the use of the genetic algorithm to obtain the upper bound instead of the simply rounding heuristic. Numerical experiments were performed and the results draw the comparison between both of methods and illustrate the effectiveness/ineffectiveness of the proposed method which serves to obtain the upper bound of the optimal RVAP solution.","[Toman, L'ubomir] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Transportat Networks, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,,lubomir.toman@fri.uniza.sk,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,903,908,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900155,0

This essay argues for the importance of analysing how women's perceptions of human rights are formed in situ in order to understand the ways in which location and gender create particular constraints for women in terms of their perceived and actual access to rights protection and ability to use rights to resolve their problems. Drawing on data generated during in-depth interviews conducted with women living in the provincial Russian city of Ul'yanovsk in 2005, this essay reveals women's complex engagements with the meaning and role of human rights in their daily lives. In particular, this analysis shows how women's perceptions of their positionalities in a post-Soviet provincial city informs how they think about where, when and why human rights apply to women.","Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow G12 8RS, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Turbine, V (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, 1216 Adam Smith Bldg,40 Bute Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RS, Lanark, Scotland.",Vikki.Turbine@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Turbine, Vikki/0000-0002-0375-8103",,,,,62,4,5,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,10,,,SI,,1847,1869,,10.1080/09668136.2012.681245,0.0,,,23,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,030ZD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310607800003,0

This calls into question whether an individual measure delivers a reliable signal. To reduce idiosyncratic measurement error, we propose using common information contained in different measures derived from survey data, a variety of forecast models, and volatility models. We show that all measures are driven by a common component, which constitutes an indicator for inflation uncertainty. Moreover, our results suggest that using only one individual disagreement measure may be misleading, particularly during turbulent times. Finally, we study the Friedman-Ball hypothesis. Using the indicator, we show that higher inflation is followed by higher uncertainty. By contrast, we obtain contradictory results for the individual measures. We also document that, after an inflationary shock, uncertainty decreases in the first two months, which is traceable to the energy component in CPI inflation.","[Grimme, Christian; Henzel, Steffen R.; Wieland, Elisabeth] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Henzel, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Munich, Germany.",grimme@ifo.de; henzel@ifo.de; wieland@ifo.de,,"Henzel, Steffen R./0000-0003-0914-1275",,,,,57,6,6,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In a labour market increasingly characterized by insecurity, where bottom end service employment often demands a feminized service with a smile' performance, young working class men from minority communities are often disadvantaged in their search for work. It has been argued that in these circumstances a version of protest masculinity and involvement in urban unrest are typical responses. This argument is explored in a racialized minority area of Luton, where right wing organizations attempt to provoke street-based reactions by young men. Instead, radical privatism', constructed through communal regulation, is a reaction to exceptional provocation, although young men's involvement in low level street unrest is also common in more normal' times.","[McDowell, Linda; Hardgrove, Abby] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Rootham, Esther] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore",University of Oxford; National University of Singapore,"McDowell, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",linda.mcdowell@geog.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,76,38,40,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The sample upon which the analysis is based comprised those participants in the 2005/2006 Portuguese National Health Interview Survey (n = 28,433) aged 25-79. Logistic regressions measured the association of height with ten chronic diseases, adjusting for age, lifestyle, education, and other socioeconomic factors. Among women, an additional centimeter in stature significantly decreased the prevalence of asthma, chronic pain, and acute cardiac disease, by 0.057, 0.221, and 0.033 percentage points, respectively. Also, mental disorders were significantly less prevalent in the last quartile of height. Among men, an additional centimeter in height was associated with a 0.074 lower prevalence of asthma, and men in the last quartile of height were significantly less at risk of acute cardiovascular disease. There was no significant association between height and the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and pulmonary diseases. As for the impact of education, women with a tertiary level were on average 5.3 cm taller than those with no schooling; among men, the difference was almost 9 cm. Adjusting for education reduced the height-related excess risk of ill health by 36% on average among men, and by 7% among women. The analysis indicates that there is a significant association of height with several chronic conditions, and that education plays a mediating role in the height-health connection. By emphasizing the role of height and education as determinants of chronic conditions, this paper also highlights the role of conditions related to childhood health and socioeconomic background.

Such was the case, this paper argues with respect to the Basel Accords and the regulation of the bank-based shadow-banking system. Securitization-activities by banks, driven by regulatory arbitrage have been an integral part of the shadow banking sector and a central transmission mechanism during the financial crisis. They have been identified as problematic by the international regulatory community since 1999, motivating reforms in Basel 2. This paper investigates why, nevertheless, regulatory loopholes that allowed banks to engage in these activities without core capital charges persisted in almost all Western jurisdictions pre-crisis. It lays emphasis on the global nature of the securitization business in conjunction with its national regulation, and shows that these national regulations on the fringes of global banking regulation were driven by competitiveness concerns. The Basel Accords were central in this dynamic, as they guaranteed the global nature of this market and gave national banking regulators the leeway to exempt securitization-activities from global regulation. Rather than eliminating competitive inequity concerns, the Basel Accords channelled them to its fringes, where they introduced a regulatory race to the bottom.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Sociol, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Thiemann, M (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Sociol, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,83,55,57,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Yet industrial land may still play an important role in the 21st-century economy. This article describes how industrially-zoned land shapes the dynamics of business relocation and expansion in four San Francisco Bay Area cities. The analysis combines two unique data sets (the National Establishment Time Series and historic zoning maps) and uses multivariate analysis to examine the role of zoning in firm expansion, controlling for firm characteristics, industry, building characteristics, and location. Firm size plays the most important role, but the availability of industrially-zoned land and large buildings also helps firms to expand. The article concludes by outlining land use and economic development strategies that help cities target firms creating jobs on industrial land.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Chapple, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, 228 Wurster Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",chapple@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,33,32,37,3,47,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Recognizing spatial heterogeneity captured by semi-parametric cost function models can impact economies of scale estimates. We estimate several cost function models, using panel data for Connecticut's 30 hospitals over a 10 year time period. We consider a variety of fixed effects and semi-parametric models. One innovation is that we address both the space and time dimensions in the kernel weights of our panel data semi-parametric regression models. We find that a life expectancy measure for years above average lifespan is positively and significantly related to hospital costs. We also address endogeneity of life expectancy. Our instrumental variable (IV) estimation approach uses locally weighted regressions in panel data models, as Baltagi and Li (2002) suggest for endogeneity in general semi-parametric panel data models. With our semi-parametric IV approach the elasticities of scale estimates are smaller than with fixed effects estimation, but still less than 1, implying a greater degree of economies of scale. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that our semi-parametric IV estimator performs well. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that foreign investors are more productive than German MNEs and purely domestic firms, with the gap narrowing in the manufacturing sector, but growing in the service sector during the recovery period. We also contrast those firms for whom productivity growth is related to greater use of intangible assets, compared with those for whom productivity is linked to cash flow. Productivity of inward investors is driven by cash flow rather than intangible assets, these being limited to high-technology investors from the EU and the USA.","[Driffield, Nigel; Temouri, Yama] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Driffield, N (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",n.l.driffield@aston.ac.uk; y.temouri1@aston.ac.uk,,,,,,,48,1,1,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

In the disruptions of the Japanese occupation and the Korean War it is believed many families switched their bon-guan to more distinguished ones. Nevertheless from 1960 onward, when bon-guan became fixed again, there is a correlation between the average prestige of bon-guans by region in Korea and average educational attainment. This paper uses that correlation, and its decline over time, to measure the implied rate of social mobility in modern Korea.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the different ways to predict the bus comfort, in addition to the variable experimental techniques used. It was found some environment parameters like noise, vibration, thermal comfort and the acceleration would affect the passengers' experience. In this model, both the measurement of objective physical parameters and subjective questionnaire survey were conducted to gather the practical environment date, as well as to distribute questionnaires on board city buses during the same trips, By comparing the subjective views of bus passengers to objective physical parameters, a combined bus comfort model was established. This model helps to calculate the concrete value of passengers' perceived bus comfort. An effective approach integrated the comfort model, measuring instrument and the driver monitor could greatly improve the bus service quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Are they risk averse, or have high discount rates, such that they are hard to motivate? We have conducted a set of field experiments in Denmark that will allow a direct characterization of small business entrepreneurs in terms of these traits. We build on experimental tasks that are well established in the literature. The results do not suggest that small business entrepreneurs are more or less risk averse than the general population under the assumption of Expected Utility Theory. However, we generally find an S-shaped probability weighting function for both small business entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs, with entrepreneurs being more optimistic about the chance of occurrence for the best outcome in lotteries with real monetary outcomes. The results also point to a significant difference in individual discount rates between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs: entrepreneurs are willing to wait longer for certain rewards than the general population.","[Andersen, Steffen; Lau, Morten I.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Di Girolamo, Amalia] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Lau, Morten I.] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England",Copenhagen Business School; University of Birmingham; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Durham University,"Lau, MI (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",sa.eco@cbs.dk; a.digirolamo@bham.ac.uk; gharrison@gsu.edu; mla.eco@cbs.dk,"Andersen, Steffen/B-1646-2014","Lau, Morten/0000-0002-6060-8769",,,,,18,17,18,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2014,77.0,3,,,SI,,341,357,,10.1007/s11238-014-9446-z,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AO8VB,,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341632000006,0

We refer to someone who holds this view as a Bipolar Behaviorist, exhibiting pessimism about the axiom when it comes to characterizing how individuals directly evaluate two lotteries in a binary choice task, but optimism about the axiom when it comes to characterizing how individuals evaluate multiple lotteries that make up the incentive structure for a multiple-task experiment. We reject the hypothesis about subject behavior underlying this stance: we find that preferences estimated with a model that assumes violations of the IA are significantly affected when one elicits choices with procedures that require the independence assumption, as compared to choices elicited with procedures that do not require the assumption. The upshot is that one cannot consistently estimate popular models that relax the IA using data from experiments that assume the validity of the RLIM.","[Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Swarthout, J.

Also, we proposed amethod for shedding light on that question by using a small macro-econometric model in a quadratic linear tracking stochastic control framework with an implicit feedback rule to compare a scenario in which fiscal policy was changed quarterly to a scenario in which it was only changed once a year. In this paper we first report on the use of counterfactual experiments in the 2007-2010 period of a major downturn in the economy. We find in one experiment that quarterly changes in policy stabilize output levels in the economy better than annual changes with a slightly larger increase in debt over the counterfactual period. In a second experiment we find that when weight changes are used to get roughly equal stabilization results, the increase in the debt level over the counterfactual periods is substantially less with quarterly than with annual policy changes. In the second part of the paper we repeat the two experiments but do so in a Monte Carlo framework. The results in this more general framework also point the way to a finding that a relatively simple shift from annual to quarterly fiscal policy could provide either better stabilization results with a slightly larger increase in the debt level or similar stabilization results but with a smaller increase in the debt level.","[Kendrick, David A.; Shoukry, George] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Kendrick, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",kendrick@austin.utexas.edu; gshoukry@utexas.edu,,"Shoukry, George/0000-0002-3955-9288",,,,,2,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Theoretically, exchange rates are only expected to follow a random walk under restrictive assumptions. However, most traditional unit root tests cannot reject a unit root in exchange rates, and time series tests that allow for fractional integration have given inconclusive results. To increase the power of the test of the integration order we develop two panel data tests of the fractional integration order. Monte Carlo simulations show that these tests are correctly sized and have relatively high power compared to other similar tests. Moreover, our empirical results show that we can reject a unit root in exchange rates with a high probability, but the integration order is close to one. This indicates that exchange rates are mean-reverting, although the reversion is slow, resulting in long swings.","Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Andersson, FNG (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden.",ngf.andersson@nek.lu.se,,"Andersson, Fredrik NG/0000-0001-6327-7785",,,,,45,1,1,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

A large literature has studied various aspects of this phenomenon. Until recently, however, many large-N studies have paid only scant attention to variation across PTAs in terms of content and design. Our contribution to this literature is a new dataset on the design of trade agreements that is the most comprehensive in terms of both variables coded and agreements covered. We illustrate the dataset's usefulness in re-visiting the questions if and to what extent PTAs impact trade flows. The analysis shows that on average PTAs increase trade flows, but that this effect is largely driven by deep agreements. In addition, we provide evidence that provisions that tackle behind-the-border regulation matter for trade flows. The dataset's contribution is not limited to the PTA literature, however. Broader debates on topics such as institutional design and the legalization of international relations will also benefit from the novel data.","[Duer, Andreas] Salzburg Univ, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Baccini, Leonardo] LSE, London, England; [Elsig, Manfred] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",Salzburg University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Bern,"Elsig, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",manfred.elsig@wti.org,"Baccini, Leonardo/A-2852-2011; Dür, Andreas/HTN-9240-2023","Dür, Andreas/0000-0001-6621-7243; Elsig, Manfred/0000-0001-6950-108X; Baccini, Leonardo/0000-0002-6027-9192",,,,,52,342,379,15,115,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We distinguish between the short-run and long-run effects of changes in aid. Our results are very different from those based on cross-country variation in aid inflows. We find evidence of large differences between the effect of aid for political reform and the effect of other types of aid in aggregate. These effects also depend on the recipient country's initial level of political development. There is no evidence that aid intended for political reform has achieved its objective, and in some countries, it may be counterproductive.

This paper presents the overall results of the research focusing on the pros and cons of the use of ISA as a restrictive measure for serious speed offenders, and on the preconditions for deployment. The results showed that the ISA systems tested have a huge effect on driver behavior and have the potential to improve road safety by reducing the level of speeding, mean speed, as well as the standard deviation of speed. However, there are also cons: the behavioral change in driving behavior was only temporary. In addition the tested technology proved too easy to override, raised issues of equity, and a substantial back office is required when implementing the system for serious speed offenders.

In addition to issues of capital and running costs, crucial questions remain over the specifications of such vehicles, particularly the required driving range, recharge time, re-charging infrastructure, performance, and other attributes that will be of importance to consumers. With this in mind, this paper assesses (hypothetically) the extent to which current car travel needs could be met by BEVs for a sample of motorists in Sydney assuming a home-based charging set-up, which is likely to be the primary option for early adopters of the technology. The approach uses five weeks of driving data recorded by GPS technology and builds up home-home tours to assess the distances between (in effect) charging possibilities. An energy consumption model based on characteristics of the vehicle, and the speeds recorded by the GPS is adapted to determine the charge used, while a battery recharge function is used to determine charging times based on the current battery level. Among the most pertinent findings are that over the five weeks, (i) BEVs with a range as low as 60 km and a simple home-charge set-up would be able to accommodate well over 90% of day-to-day driving, (ii) however the incidence of tours requiring out-of-home charging increases markedly for vehicles below 24 kWh (170 km range), (iii) recharge time in itself has little impact on the feasibility of BEVs because vehicles spend the majority of their time parked and (iv) effective range can be dramatically impacted by both how a vehicle is driven and use of electrical auxiliaries, and (v) while unsuitable for long, high-speed journeys without some external re-charging options, BEVs appear particularly suited for the majority of day-to-day city driving in big cities where average journey speeds of 34 km/h are close to optimal in terms of maximising vehicle range. The paper has implications for both policy-makers and auto manufacturers in breaking down some of the (perceived) barriers to greater uptake of BEVs in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study draws on evidence from 72 TIF projects in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Metroplex to subject the recently proposed administrative theory of TIF performance to empirical validation. Regression analysis is used to determine the correlation between two key TIF district management practices (preimplementation risk assessment and postimplementation performance measurement) and project performance. The authors empirically examine differences in management practices across TIF districts within the same regional economy, and findings lend support to the theory that TIF management practices play an important role, alongside other factors, in determining project performance.","[Hall, Jeremy L.] Rutgers State Univ, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Bartels, Christopher E.] US Internal Revenue Serv, Dallas, TX USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Hall, JL (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, 111 Washington St,Room 332, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",Jeremy.Hall@rutgers.edu,"Hall, Jeremy/X-6780-2019",,,,,,20,8,9,2,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Yet, relationships between wider ill-health concepts and employment are poorly investigated. This article presents an empirical investigation into the impacts of poor mental and physical health on the propensity to be employed. The results indicate that activity-limiting physical health and accomplishment-limiting mental health issues significantly affect the propensity to be employed. Further investigations reveal the significance of an interacted variable that captures the multiplicative effect of both physical and mental health, illustrating that the combined effect of both health domains can be more influential than separate pathways. Additional empirical analysis highlights gender and ethnicity divides. It is also found that mental health is mostly exogenous to employment propensity.

We conclude that the monetary policy in a group of small open economies (including Australia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and New Zealand) is rather similar to that observed in closed economies. Our results also indicate, however, that there are strong differences due to the shocks from the international financial markets (mainly risk premium shocks). These differences explain most of the variability of the real exchange rate, which has important reallocation effects in the short run. Our results are consistent with an old idea from the Mundell-Fleming model: namely, a real depreciation to confront a risk premium shock is expansive or procyclical, in contradiction to the predictions of the balance sheet effect, the J curve effect, and the introduction of working capital into RBC models. In line with this last result, we have strong evidence that only in one of the five countries analyzed in this study does not intervene the real exchange rate, the case of New Zealand.","[Garcia, Carlos J.] Georgetown Univ, ILADES, Santiago, Chile; [Garcia, Carlos J.] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile; [Gonzalez, Wildo D.] Banco Cent Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Garcia, CJ (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, ILADES, Almirante Barroso 6, Santiago, Chile.",cgarcia@uahurtado.cl,,,,,,,55,9,11,0,22,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In this paper I argue that it does, to some but also limited extent. Evolutionary theories of economies, and of culture, have acquired considerable following, but have also been subject to considerable criticism. Most criticism has been aimed at inappropriate biological analogies, but recently it has been claimed that a 'universal Darwinism', purged of all such mistaken analogy, is both useful and viable. Why should we try to preserve evolutionary theory, and will such theory stand up to sustained critical analysis? How useful is it for theory of the firm? Evolutionary theory appears to be the most adequate theory around for solving the problem of agency and structure, avoiding both an overly rational, managerial 'strategic choice' view of organizations and a 'contingency' view of organizations as fully determined by their environment. Whether universal Darwinism stands up to critical analysis remains to be seen. Here, the focus is on evolutionary theory of organization.

It is shown that news organisations largely sustained the bubble until the property market collapsed. As such, news stories reflected the views and interests of the Irish corporate and governmental sectors, which had adopted neoliberal policies during the 'Celtic Tiger' years (1990s to 2007). A political economic conceptualisation of the Irish media outlines four factors explaining why this is so: (1) news organisations have multiple links with the political and corporate establishment, of which they are part, thus sharing similar interests and viewpoints; (2) just like elite circles, they hold a neoliberal ideology, dominant during the boom years; (3) they feel pressures from advertisers, in particular, real estate companies; and (4) they rely heavily on 'experts' from elite institutions in reporting events. The last section presents a detailed empirical analysis of Irish media coverage (newspapers and television) of the housing bubble that confirms the above claims. It is shown that prior to the bubble's collapse, the media made little mention of it, remained vague about it or tried to refute claims that it even existed, thus sustaining it.","Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Mercille, J (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Newman Bldg, Dublin 4, Ireland.",julien.mercille@ucd.ie,,,,,,,63,40,41,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The Bank's change of approach includes the 2009 decision to review and subsequently remove its labour market flexibility indicator (used to score the extent of labour market flexibility amongst its member-states) from its flagship publication, Doing Business. The aim of this article is to chart the softening of the Bank's emphasis on labour market flexibility and distil the contributing factors. With reference to the global financial crisis and the Bank's organizational characteristics, the article evaluates the work of international trade unions and the ILO as agenda-setters and compliance monitors and pro-labour industrialized states as 'insider advocates' in broadening the Bank's commitment to the CLS. The article demonstrates the influential nature of tacit coalitions between state and non-state actors representing a coalescence of normative values and economic interests. The Bank's changing approach to labour markets also contributes new evidence to the emerging, yet tentative, consensus that the neoliberal paradigm is undergoing a rebalancing, rather than an overhaul, in the post-crisis era.","Univ Tasmania, Sch Social Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Murphy, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Sch Social Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",,"Murphy-Gregory, Hannah L/J-7235-2014","Murphy-Gregory, Hannah/0000-0002-9993-3331",,,,,82,9,9,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

All those aspects of nutritional behavior are important inputs to the production of health. A dynamic panel data model is used to estimate demand functions for fat, protein, alcohol, cigarettes and diversity of the diet. The results suggest the existence of strong habits in drinking and smoking, and the absence of habits in fat and protein consumption. We also found evidence of habit formation for food diversity. Comparing nutritional behavior of younger and older consumers, we find significant differences in the demand for fat and cigarettes. Older consumers seem to be more persistent in their drinking and smoking behavior. Similarly, men show higher habit persistence for alcohol and cigarette consumption. The results also suggest that among individual determinants, especially education, income and employment have statistically significant impacts on consumption behavior. Regarding the macroeconomic variables, economic growth is negatively related to protein consumption, while regional unemployment rate is negatively affecting the demand for protein and food diversity. Finally, Russian consumers react to the price changes of alcohol, cigarettes, fat and protein as suggested by theory. Consumer demand for food diversity responds negatively to price changes of alcohol and cigarettes, but positively to the price of fat. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In our view, this seriously questions the validity of laboratory findings. We depart from this by auctioning off player roles via the incentive compatible random price mechanism thus avoiding the selection effect of competitive second price auctions. Our experiment employs the generosity game where the proposer chooses the size of the pie, facing an exogenously given own agreement payoff, and the responder is the residual claimant. We find that entitlement crowds out equality seeking and strengthens efficiency seeking. More generally, we find that inducing entitlement for the roles in which participants find themselves makes a difference. Interpreting participants' willingness to pay for their role as their aspiration level further allows to test satisficing and explore mutual satisficing. We find that responder participants apparently do not anticipate proposer generosity in aspiration formation.","[Baeker, Agnes; Pull, Kerstin] Univ Tubingen, Sch Business & Econ, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Gueth, Werner] Max Planck Inst Econ, Strateg Interact Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Stadler, Manfred] Univ Tubingen, Sch Business & Econ, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Max Planck Society; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Bäker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",a.baeker@warwick.ac.uk,"Pull, Kerstin/AEA-1913-2022","Pull, Kerstin/0000-0002-7682-3703",,,,,22,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2014,76.0,2,,,,,225,240,,10.1007/s11238-013-9364-5,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA1AW,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330829500005,0

In this article, I advance these literatures in three ways. First, I bridge the two approaches by elaborating an exchange-theoretic conceptualization of inter-firm power that is latent in the two literatures. This conceptualization focuses narrowly on the determinants of inter-firm power asymmetries and is useful for explaining why actual production networks vary in terms of the relative power of buyers and producers. Second, I develop an empirical framework to advance basic research on the link between globally networked forms of economic organization and national economic development. In particular, I derive cross-nationally and temporally comparable country-level measurements of the average bargaining power of a country's resident firms using industry-specific international exchange (trade) networks. I demonstrate the validity of these indices through a historical analysis of trade networks in the transport equipment and garment industries and by analysing cross-national variations in wages in the two industries. Finally, I conclude by charting a parallel path for GCC/GVC and GPN research that implicates global models of network organization in macro-comparative analyses of economic development.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Sociol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Mahutga, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Sociol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",,,,,,,,80,45,51,3,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

So, the study analyses the trips actually made by the entire population without resorting to sample data or aggregate behavioural studies, confirming as an added value of smart technologies their potentialities as a source of information. To determine the reasons for travelling, only journeys made on Saturdays and Sundays were studied for all weekends in 2010 and 2011. Multiple linear regression results showed that wind and rain could result in a decrease in the number of trips, while a temperature rise caused an increase in the number of trips, in agreement with the results of previous survey-based studies.

It compares the Slovak economy's openness rate with the openness of the V4 countries and other EU countries and explains the development of the openness from the year 1993 until present, when SR takes the 4th place in rankings. Slovakia's position was slightly weakened by the economic crisis. From the territorial point of view, the foreign trade of the Slovak republic focuses mainly on the EU countries, while exports to those countries represent approximately 90% and imports 65%. The commodity structure of foreign trade is largely concentrated in a few industries (manufacture of motor vehicles, manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products), which also corresponds to a high proportion of large firms in the foreign trade. The Slovak economy is import intensive, and as a result Slovakia is still dependent on the supply of strategic raw materials, mainly oil and natural gas from Russia. This dependence in relation to the development of unstable prices on world markets, leads to the negative development of the balance of trade. Foreign trade policy of the Slovak republic is conditioned by the membership in the EU and Eurozone, what determines also the Slovak proexport policy.","[Brincikova, Zuzana; Darmo, L'ubomir] Univ Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Brinciková, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",,"Darmo, Ľubomír/M-1085-2019",,,,,,4,2,2,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,43,50,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900006,0

The main determinant investigated is the share of foreign capital in the enterprises' capital structure. The process of the economic integration and globalization is taking form of foreign direct investment (FDI). This transfer of capital is usually accompanied by the transfer of technologies and knowledge. The so-called knowledge spillover in the area of HR planning is the phenomenon the paper focused on. Using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test we found the share of foreign capital is a relevant determinant of enterprises's approach to HR planning. The enterprises with the higher share of foreign capital are adopting different approach to HR planning when compared to domestic enterprises and enterprises with low share of foreign capital in their ownership structure.,"[Cheben, Juraj] Metropolitan Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Lancaric, Drahoslav; Savov, Radovan] Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra, Slovakia",Metropolitan University Prague; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Cheben, J (通讯作者)，Metropolitan Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Lancaric, Drahoslav/AAD-8710-2019; Cheben, Juraj/O-2699-2014","Cheben, Juraj/0000-0002-2624-8659",,,,,15,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,421,426,,,,,,6,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900054,0

This principle has caused malfunctions by achieving the sites outside the general tourist frame, demonstrating that this practice jeopardizes much part of the investment made until today, given that the development of rural infrastructure involves structuring the infrastructure elements in other perimeters. The directions of Romanian health tourism development are determined by overall macroeconomic development, by a better reglementation, from a legal perspective, of the issue of this form of tourism and by the involvement of the Romanian Government in supporting Romanian tourism and health tourism.

Increasingly, we are told, the world is moving toward a multicurrency system with several poles, implying that the system is becoming more competitive. Polarity, however, is a notoriously crude measure of the level of competition in any kind of system, economic or political. If analysis is to be at all accurate, it should take into account not only the number of poles in a system but also the inequalities among them - an alternative approach encompassed by the concept of concentration. In this paper we make use of the concept of concentration to provide a more accurate picture of the competitive structure of the currency system today. When taking account of concentration as well as polarity, our results suggest that the competitive structure of the system is little changed over a period stretching back more than two decades.","[Cohen, Benjamin J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Benney, Tabitha M.] Univ Utah, Dept Polit Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Cohen, BJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,,37,45,47,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We show how urban development patterns highly depend on the intensity of surrounding farms and their ability to produce amenities. We also show that, even in the absence of a particular landscape feature or any exogenous source of amenities, fragmented urban sprawl is a natural development pattern for a city surrounded by a spatially varying agricultural environment.

We utilize longitudinal data from the NLSY79 covering the period 1985-2010. Non-parametric techniques are applied to investigate the relationship between exit from obesity and spell duration. Multivariate discrete hazard models are also estimated, taking into account duration dependence and observed and time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. In all cases, the probability of exiting obesity is inversely related to the duration of the obesity spell. Without controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, the probability of exit after one wave in obesity is 31.5 per cent; it is reduced to 3.8 per cent after seven or more waves. When time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity is taken into account, the estimated probabilities are slightly larger and broadly similar (36.8 and 10.3, respectively), which suggests that the identified negative duration dependence is not primarily due to composition effects. The obtained results indicate that public health interventions targeting the newly obese may be particularly effective at reducing incidence of long durations of obesity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We randomly selected villages in one of the poorest districts in rural India in which to establish SHGs for women. Two years of exposure to these programs increased women's participation in group savings programs as well as the non-agricultural labor force. Compared to women in control villages, treated women were also more likely to participate in household decisions and engage in civic activities. We find no evidence however, that participation increased income or had a disproportionate impact on women's socio-economic status. These results are important in light of the recent effort to expand official support to SHGs under India's National Rural Livelihood Mission.","[Desai, Rajm.; Joshi, Shareen] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Desai, Rajm.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Desai, Rajm.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Georgetown University; Georgetown University; Brookings Institution,"Joshi, S (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",desair@georgetown.edu; sj244@georgetown.edu,"Desai, Raj/A-2326-2008","Desai, Raj/0000-0002-1202-1680; Joshi, Shareen/0000-0001-5693-7140",Wolfensohn Center for Development and the Development and Governance Initiative at the Brookings Institution; Georgetown University's Engaging India Initiative,Wolfensohn Center for Development and the Development and Governance Initiative at the Brookings Institution; Georgetown University's Engaging India Initiative,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA).

In our model, parents make decisions about whether or not their children should remain in school, and they monitor the performance of the teachers. We analyze a unique data set from El Salvador, which expanded the role of communities in school management through its Educacioon con Participacioon de la Comunidad ((EDUCO)) program. While we use nonrandomized data, we carefully examine biases arising from endogenous program placements and program self-selection. We find that EDUCO had a positive and robust influence on students, encouraging them to continue their schooling. Our results suggest that community participation, a better classroom environment, and careful teacher management are largely responsible for the positive effect of the EDUCO program. We conclude that in El Salvador the decentralization of responsibilities to communities seems to have had significant positive effects on school continuation.","[Jimenez, Emmanuel] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Sawada, Yasuyuki] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",The World Bank; University of Tokyo,"Jimenez, E (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ejimenez2@worldbank.org; sawada@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Sawada, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-4167-7697",,,,,63,6,7,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

We find that, for most firms, profitability increases with specialization and decreases with diversity.

One of these marketplaces was created by Amazon, Inc. and it operates on a website called mturk.com. We distributed a survey on mturk.com and asked participants about their experiences 388 as students. Some of the results of our survey were unexpected, leading to the conclusion that the university-educated people participating in the micro-tasking marketplace differ in certain ways from the average students in general. According to our survey, there are participants (about 33% from the total) stated that they or other students asked for the professors to add to the curriculum items that they were interested in learning about. There was also a majority that responded that they actively sought internships and ways to gain experience in the field they are well-studied. Also, none of the participant agreed with the statement that the school is solely responsible for making sure that the students gained the most skills and knowledge.

SMEs better adapting to the changes generated by the digital age is beneficial not only for their survival and development but also for economic growth and reduction of unemployment in developed and developing countries. The emergence of digital products and services creates new opportunities for enterprises and individuals alike an example of that bing the fact that for every job eliminated by the adoption of new digital technologies 2.6 new jobs are created [2].

As working methodology we used a questionnaire aimed to identify perceived obstacles in the adoption of digital instruments by SMEs. Following the interpretation of our results and also studying policies supporting the adoption of digital instruments in over 600 SMEs worldwide we proposed a number of relevant measures for improving the strategic management of SME's. Since the adoption of digital instruments is no longer a choice but a necessity [5]. SMEs need to innovate not only by offering products and/or unique services but also by adopting the latest technologies dynamically able to highlight their capabilities and possibilities.

The first one is consisted of six motivational variables (controlled motivation, autonomous motivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, and intrinsic motivation) out of which four predictor variables were singled out. The multiple regression was used to establish that the variable of identified regulation significantly predetermined the variable of handling relationships. Combined with external regulation, it led to a decrease in efficiency of cooperative and interactive performance of basketball players. The other significant finding was the fact that top basketball players from the Western Balkans differed among themselves in the level of reading and managing emotions. This finding may prove to be useful to managers and coaches as they can apply it through education and interactive workshops in order to establish positive mutual influencing among team members, i.e. to facilitate those with lower levels of managing emotions to be able to learn from the players who possess higher levels of managing emotions and reading emotions as well.","[Suzic, Nenad] Univ Banja Luka, Fac Philosophy, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg; [Simovic, Slobodan] Univ Banja Luka, Fac Phys Educ & Sports, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Banja Luka (UNIBL); University of Banja Luka (UNIBL),"Suzic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Banja Luka, Fac Philosophy, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg.",nenad_szc@yahoo.com; s.simovic2011@gmail.com,"Suzic, Nenad/J-6578-2019","Suzic, Nenad/0000-0001-8330-6678",,,,,39,0,0,0,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",1951-6851,,978-94-6252-006-6,ADV INTEL SYS RES,,,2014,112.0,,,,,,37,43,,,,,,7,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BB0XS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340827300011,0

It annually grants over USD 20 billion of different kinds of loans and credits to the EU Member States. Among other investments, it also significantly participates in tourism development of less developed countries at the global level. As a result of globalisation changes in the world, the World Bank has become a strong financial factor whose business operations are oriented to all business sectors, and this especially refers to development of world tourism. Business activities of the World Bank keep expanding and changing former business habits, behaviours and thinking patterns. In its business activities, the World Bank connects large multinational companies which possess growing economic and political power with certain developing countries. For example, financial results of only one large corporation are several times higher than national budgets of many world countries. In its activities, the World Bank devotes special attention to tourism development in developing countries, mostly located in Asia and Africa, and to these countries, this is the only way to realise foreign currency income and settle their high debts. This kind of activity in the above-mentioned countries has proven very successful and stimulated strong economic activity. The conclusions of this paper are that the World Bank provides all forms of financial aids and preparation for education of employees who would be able to accept and further develop granted and realised projects by the World Bank, but also able to prevent harmful consequences which originate from ignorance and primitivism. Tourism is one of the first economic branches which stimulated creation of new economic processes. Tourism creates large international hotel chains, fast food chains, transport companies, etc. At the same time, it trains suitable employees, managers and workers alike.","[Vizjak, Maja; Peranic, Antonio] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Vizjak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Rijeka, Croatia.",,"Vizjak, Maja/ABE-4392-2021",,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,829,841,,,,,,13,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900107,0

Moreover, it is the first analysis of this kind which focuses on transition economies. The paper deals with export credit promotion in the Czech Republic. The development and structure of Czech trade and export support is presented first, followed by an econometric analysis of the gravity model of Czech Republic trade. A panel of 160 countries in 1996-2008 is analysed and two gravity models of exports for the Czech Republic are estimated, the static model by fixed effects (LSDV estimator) and the dynamic model by System GMM. Due to ambiguous conclusions we assume that the behaviour of our explanatory variables is not uniform and our data set behaves as a mixture of countries with heterogeneous behaviour. This means that traditional techniques of estimation which include all observations into one model do not give significant results. Thus, we use robust techniques of estimation that solve the problem of heterogeneous patterns in data sets. Out of several possibilities we use the Least Trimmed Squares estimator (LTS) with a leverage point. We show that guarantees are a significant factor that influences positively the volume of exports in the Czech Republic. Moreover, there exist more variables that affect the size of exports in the Czech Republic. Market forces described by GDP, distance, political risk or gross fix capital formation are significant in our econometric model. We find that higher GDP, shorter distance or lower political risk have a positive impact on Czech exports.","[Janda, Karel; Michalikova, Eva; Skuhrovec, Jiri] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Janda, Karel] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic; [Michalikova, Eva] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business; Brno University of Technology,"Janda, K (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"janda, karel/GNP-1410-2022; janda, karel/A-3951-2008","janda, karel/0000-0001-7096-6300",,,,,35,29,30,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2013,36.0,12,,,,,1588,1610,,10.1111/twec.12061,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,273CN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328511500007,0

What explains this phenomenon? Drawing on international relations scholarship, this article develops predictions involving the capabilities of states, or a matter's salience to states. The predictions are tested with a new and original dataset that captures, for the first time, variation in the roles that international bureaucrats play in the institutional design arena. Statistical analyses find that states' need for expertise, as well as the design negotiations' distance from high-politics, leave openings for international bureaucrats to enter institutional design processes.

Aiming at testing its effectiveness, we benchmark the forecasting performance of our genetic programming implementation with three traditional strategies (naive strategy, MACD, and a buy & hold strategy) plus a hybrid evolutionary artificial neural network approach. The proposed genetic programming technique was found to demonstrate the highest trading performance in terms of annualized return and information ratio when compared to all other strategies which have been used. When more elaborate trading techniques, such as leverage, were combined with the examined models, the genetic programming approach still presented the highest trading performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that genetic programming is applied in the problem of effectively modeling and trading with the EUR/USD exchange rate. Our application now offers practitioners with an effective and extremely promising set of results when forecasting in the foreign exchange market.

This article aims to explain why the Council does not vote and what consensus' means. Given that consensus is often used by international organizations and EU institutional bodies, it is important to explain how it differs from unanimity. The article argues that formal voting is avoided because it would disclose the identity of opponents and would be detrimental to the negotiation process. Furthermore, ministers tend not to register their opposition even when they remain unsatisfied with an adopted measure because they expect to be blamed by their constituencies for having failed to defend national interests. Consensus is not necessarily used to signal that a general agreement is reached. It sometimes results from a strategy of blame avoidance that conflicts with democratic accountability.","[Novak, Stephanie] Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany",Hertie School,"Novak, S (通讯作者)，Hertie Sch Governance GmbH, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",novak@hertie-school.org,"Novak, Stephanie/K-8668-2016","Novak, Stephanie/0000-0001-5918-1836",,,,,45,72,73,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

A democracy index constructed from the Freedom House indices. A variety of panel data unit root and cointegration tests are applied. The variables are found to be integrated of order one and cointegrated. The Blundell-Bond system generalized methods-of-moments is employed to conduct a panel error-correction mechanism based causality test within a vector autoregressive structure. Economic growth is found to cause democracy in the short-run, while bidirectionality is uncovered in the long-run. In addition, the long-run coefficients are estimated through the panel fully modified ordinary least squares and dynamic ordinary least squares methods. Democracy has a positive impact on GDP and vice versa. These results lend support to the virtuous cycle hypothesis.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Energy Policy & Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Jaunky, VC (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Energy Policy & Econ, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",vjaunky@ethz.ch,,,,,,,88,30,34,1,54,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using data from Prosper.com, an online lending marketplace, I investigate the effects of these laws. The key to my empirical strategy is that there was initially substantial variability in states' interest rate caps, ranging from 6% to 36%. A behind-the-scenes change in loan origination, however, suddenly increased the cap to 36%. The main findings of the study are that higher interest rate caps increase the probability that a loan will be funded, especially if the borrower was previously just outside the money. I do not find, however, changes in loan amounts and default probability. The interest rate paid rises slightly, probably because online lending is substantially, yet imperfectly, integrated with the general credit market.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Rigbi, O (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",,"RIGBI, OREN/F-1690-2012","Rigbi, Oren/0009-0001-4035-0107",,,,,26,30,35,0,27,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We study redistribution behavior in a real effort-task experiment, where luck influences production in three versions that differ in their effort-relatedness: luck comes either as wage luck, endowment luck or payment luck. We confirm that in a base treatment, i.e., in absence of luck, subjects base their allocation decisions largely on effort. When luck is present behavior changes. While we find that redistribution behavior of high performers in the real effort-task is affected by wage luck, we find that endowment luck affects mostly redistribution behavior of low performers. Furthermore, when introducing payment luck, i.e., redistribution of certain versus probabilistic payments, we find that allocations are more selfish for probabilistic payments.","Max Planck Inst Econ, Strateg Interact Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Becker, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Strateg Interact Grp, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",becker@econ.mpg.de,,,,,,,34,10,12,2,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2013,41.0,3,,,,,685,699,,10.1007/s00355-012-0702-2,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,202XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323254900011,0

A probabilistic rule chooses a probability distribution over the interval for each preference profile. We investigate strategy-proof probabilistic rules in the case where distributions are compared based on stochastic dominance relations. First, on a minimally rich domain, we characterize the so-called probabilistic generalized median rules (Ehlers et al., J Econ Theory 105:408-434, 2002) by means of stochastic-dominance (sd) strategy-proofness and ontoness. Next, we study how much we can enlarge a domain to allow for the existence of sd-strategy-proof probabilistic rules that satisfy ontoness and the no-vetoer condition. We establish that the domain of convex preferences is the unique maximal domain including a minimally rich domain for these properties.","Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Ibaraki 5670047, Japan",Osaka University,"Morimoto, S (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Ibaraki 5670047, Japan.",morimoto@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2013,41.0,3,,,,,637,669,,10.1007/s00355-012-0700-4,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,202XT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323254900009,0

Existing estimates of tourism's carbon footprint are however incomplete as they fail to holistically assess the additional, 'indirect' carbon requirements. These arise from the non-use phases of a tourism product or service life cycle and can be further magnified by supply chain industries. Under-development of methods for carbon impact assessment in tourism is the primary reason for the omission of 'indirect' GHG emissions. This study develops a new approach for comprehensive appraisal of GHG emissions which incorporates and advances the methodological advantages of existing assessment techniques. It tests the applicability of this approach in tourism by conducting a holistic analysis of a standard holiday package to Portugal, based on the British tourism market. The new approach demonstrates the significance of the 'indirect' GHG emissions in the total carbon footprint from the holiday package, thus emphasising the necessity for more comprehensive future assessments.

The analysis takes advantage of the extensive Danish IDA data which provides wage information on the entire working population in a 27-year period. We find that the major part of wage dispersion in the Danish labor market can be explained by differences in worker characteristics. However, the relative contributions of the three components vary across subgroups of workers. The match effect constitutes a non-negligible part of the overall wage dispersion. An analysis of inter-industry wage differentials shows that firm characteristics are more important at the industry level than at the worker level. Similarly, we find evidence that high-wage workers tend to sort into high-wage industries to a larger extent than they sort into high-wage firms within industries. The mobility pattern of workers is related to the quality of the firm and the match. Finally, we find that firms' wage policies differ across subgroups.","[Sorensen, Torben] Jyske Bank, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Sorensen, Torben; Vejlin, Rune] Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Vejlin, R (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",tosoerensen@econ.au.dk; rvejlin@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,34,10,12,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The article focuses on three aspects of attitudinal change. First, it analyses whether the gender role beliefs have changed during the past decade. Second, it examines whether these changes have been equally experienced by men and by women of different age categories. Third, it analyses whether the gender gap in attitudes towards gender roles diminishes over time. The outcomes of the analysis reveal that during the past 10 years Luxembourg's residents have become significantly less traditional when it comes to attitudes towards the childcare and economic aspects of gender roles. Young women are the strongest supporters of more egalitarian division of labour between the sexes, while young men lag behind their female counterparts.

They are reflective of higher-level orientations, or lifestyles, that are hypothesized to influence all dimensions of an individual's travel and activity behavior. The objectives of this paper are to understand and quantify different modality styles, and to show how the modality styles construct can be operationalized within the context of traditional models of travel mode choice. We employ the six-week MOBIDRIVE travel diary and estimate behavioral mixture models in which the modality style provides a behavioral rationale to the way in which unobserved heterogeneity is specified in the travel model. Our analysis consists of two stages: First, we explore the presence and types of modality styles suggested by the data through the means of a descriptive analysis. Next, we develop a model that captures the influence of modality styles on two dimensions of an individual's travel behavior: travel mode choice for work tours and travel mode choice for non-work tours. The modality styles are specified as latent classes; heterogeneity across modality styles include both the modes considered (choice set) and the values of taste parameters. The modality style of an individual then influences all of his/her travel mode choice decisions for work and non-work tours. In addition, error components capture unobserved correlation across travel mode choice decisions made by the same individual. Results indicate the presence of habitual drivers who display a strong bias for using the automobile and multimodal individuals who exhibit variation in their modal preferences. Multimodal behavior is further distinguished by those who appear to be sensitive to travel times and those who appear to be insensitive. Estimation results further find that modality styles are strongly correlated with more long-term travel decisions and life-cycle characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

There are two approaches within the said models: the state space-based approach, which takes into account the possible states of nature and the correspondence between states and outcomes; and the set-based approach, which ignores such information, and solves certain difficulties arising from the state space-based approach. Kelsey (Int Econ Rev 34:297-308, 1993) incorporates into a state space-based framework the assumption that the agent has ordinal information about the likelihood of the states. This paper incorporates this same assumption into a set-based framework, thus filling a theoretical gap in the literature. Compared to the set-based models of choice under complete uncertainty we introduce the information about the ordinal likelihood of the outcomes while, compared to Kelsey's approach, we incorporate the advantages of describing uncertainty environments from the set-based perspective. We present an axiomatic study that includes adaptations of some of the axioms found in the related literature and we characterize some rules featuring different combinations of information about the ordinal likelihood of the outcomes and information about their desirability.","[Alcalde-Unzu, Jorge; Arlegi, Ricardo] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Ballester, Miguel A.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Arlegi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia, Pamplona 31006, Spain.",rarlegi@unavarra.es,"Ballester, Miguel Angel Gonzalez/D-1349-2013; Alcalde-Unzu, Jorge/S-9390-2017; UNZU, FERNANDO/Y-7458-2019","Ballester, Miguel Angel Gonzalez/0000-0002-9227-6826; Arlegi, Ritxar/0000-0002-7664-2742; Alcalde-Unzu, Jorge/0000-0003-1839-6245; Unzu Martinez, Fernando/0000-0002-9479-554X; UNZU, FERNANDO/0000-0003-1232-8540",,,,,22,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2013,41.0,2,,,,,397,425,,10.1007/s00355-012-0689-8,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,155TE,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319770300010,0

Drawing on leadership theory, the article identifies three factors providing opportunities and setting constraints, as decisive for exercising political leadership: the institutional setting, the situational context and the personal qualities of the office holders. It analyzes to what extent these factors, and the interplay among them, shape the leadership of the Commission Presidents, and which of these factors are conditional for the exercise of transforming leadership. It concludes that only Delors was able to act as a transforming leader, whereas Santer and Prodi mainly performed as transactional leaders.

The essential component of designing any IMF program, assessing the extent to which a borrowing country is likely to fulfill its policy commitments, is based partly on informal staff judgments subject to informal incentives and normative orientations not dictated by formal rules and procedures. Moreover, when country officials are unable to commit to policy goals of the IMF, the IMF staff may bypass the formal channel of policy dialogue through informal contacts and negotiations with more like-minded actors outside the policymaking process. Exercising informal governance in these ways, the staff are motived by informal career advancement incentives and normative orientations associated with the organization's culture to provide favorable treatment to borrowers composed of policy teams sympathetic toward their policy goals. The presence of these sympathetic interlocutors provides the staff both with greater confidence a lending program will achieve success and an opportunity to support officials who share their policy beliefs. I assess these arguments using a new dataset that proxies shared policy beliefs based on the professional characteristics of IMF staff and developing country officials. The evidence supports these arguments: larger loan commitments are extended to countries where government officials and the Fund staff share similar professional training. The analysis implies informal governance operates in IOs not just via state influence but also through the evolving makeup, incentive structure, and normative orientations of their staffs.","London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Chwieroth, JM (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.m.chwieroth@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,60,60,68,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The resulting logistic regression model, developed from a forward stepwise selection procedure, is able to classify sampled firm-year observations into cash-poor and cash-rich groups with a 73.4% accuracy rate. The authors find that cash-rich restaurant firms tend to have greater investment opportunities, which make cash in hand appealing. However, cash-poor restaurants are more likely to be larger, to hold more liquid-asset substitutes, to make greater capital expenditures and to display more robust cash flows characteristics that enhance borrowing power and/or reduce the need to hoard funds. Hence, the findings suggest a prominent role for the precautionary and transaction motives in restaurant cash-holding decision making.","[Kim, Jiyoung; Woods, David; Kim, Hyunjoon] Dong A Univ, Dept Tourism Management, Pusan 602760, South Korea",Dong A University,"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Dong A Univ, Dept Tourism Management, 2-1 Bumin Dong, Pusan 602760, South Korea.",hyunjoon@dau.ac.kr,,,,,,,39,14,14,1,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This paper integrates literature from international political economy, international business and economics, and linguistics, to examine the transaction costs of languages under three different measures of language closeness, same language, direct communication, and language distance. Language is both a tool in international economic transactions and a vehicle to transmit cultural values, but our results point out that major trade languages are employed differently in international trade and in FDI. Communication costs, for both FDI and international trade, show a hierarchy, with English the most inexpensive among major trade languages. We introduce the concept of language intensity to explain why communication costs are much more important in FDI than in international trade. Major trade languages may obtain considerable power from their economic use; we examine the asymmetric nature of this power. We empirically test these ideas in gravity equation models.","[Selmier, W.

We develop the spectrum of intergovernmental arrangements to show the wide variation in the formalization of international institutions and theorize when states will choose informal arrangements such as an IIGO over (or in combination with) a FIGO. A paired case comparison illustrates our claims that states use IIGOs when they need flexibility, to protect their sovereignty, to maintain close control of information, to lower short term transaction costs for speed, to minimize bureaucracy and to manage uncertainty during times of crisis.

Authorities interconnected by cross-border banks considered unilateral policies that minimised losses for domestic stakeholders at the expense of their foreign counterparts. This is at odds both with the assumption behind financial integration which presumes multilateral responses to cross-border shocks and with the typical definition of political risks that ignores the fact that not only host-country, but also home-country authorities can create such risks. This paper recasts the definition of political risk and reviews instances when political risk materialised within the EU banking market between 2007 and 2011. The analysis reveals that the EU regulatory framework needs to be enhanced to contain resurgent political risks systematically rather than through ad hoc interventions of the EU and international bodies.","[Kudrna, Zdenek] Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; Univ W England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of Vienna; University of West England,"Kudrna, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",,,,,,,,58,13,14,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,MAY 1,2013,65.0,3,,,SI,,548,566,,10.1080/09668136.2013.779458,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,121UN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317270000010,0

This article fills this gap using data from the British Workplace Behaviour Survey, which found that employees with disabilities and long-term illnesses were more likely to suffer ill-treatment in the workplace and experienced a broader range of ill-treatment. Different types of disability were associated with different types of ill-treatment. The survey also showed who employees with disabilities blamed for their ill-treatment and why they believed the ill-treatment had occurred. Drawing on the existing literature, four possible explanations for ill-treatment are considered: negative affect raises perceptions of ill-treatment; ill-treatment leads to health effects; ill-treatment results from stigma or discrimination; ill-treatment is a consequence of workplace social relations. Although some of these explanations are stronger than others, the discussion shows that more research is required in order to decide between them.","[Fevre, Ralph; Robinson, Amanda; Jones, Trevor] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales; [Lewis, Duncan] Univ Plymouth, Sch Management, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",Cardiff University; University of Plymouth,"Fevre, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Social Sci, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales.",fevre@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Robinson, Amanda/0000-0002-5071-850X",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E009549/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/E009549/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,53,87,110,1,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

At the same time, skilled workers, with their high opportunity cost of time, spend a larger fraction of their budget in these services. Given the skill asymmetry between consumers and providers in this market, product demand shifts-such as those arising when relative skilled wages increase-should boost relative labor demand for the least-skilled workforce. We estimate that this channel may explain one-third of the growth of employment of noncollege workers in low-skill services in the 1990s.","[Mazzolari, Francesca] Ctr Studi Confind, Rome, Italy; [Ragusa, Giuseppe] Luiss Univ, Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Mazzolari, F (通讯作者)，Ctr Studi Confind, Rome, Italy.",,,"Ragusa, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6964-6278",,,,,40,84,98,1,40,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

However, in recent years intercity and interstate bus companies have been facing a growing competition with other forms of transportation such as bus companies competitors, illegal transportation companies, chartered buses, and, more recently, air companies. In this scenario characterized by growing competition, it is essential to evaluate the quality of road transportation of passengers. In order to contribute to the analysis of this issue, this paper presents a methodological approach to assess the quality of intercity road transportation of passengers, according to the customers' perspective. By conducting a case study in a city of almost 500,000 inhabitants from the interior of Rio de Janeiro, an Importance-Satisfaction Analysis (ISA) and an assignment procedure were used in order to obtain: (i) the main factors (criteria) that influence the quality of service intercity road transportation of passengers, (ii) the importance degree of criteria related to road transportation of passengers, (iii) the satisfaction of the users of road transportation under the considered criteria, (iv) the critical criteria/items, and (v) the categories which best represent the quality of service intercity road transportation according to the passengers' perspective. Finally, several possible corrective actions to improve the quality of services considering each critical item/criterion were highlighted and special recommendations were done for the critical process (ticket sales).

We introduce two new innovations. First we are able to incorporate two macroeconomic factors that greatly impact cap rates besides treasury rates and local market fundamentals - the variables most commonly used in such research. These are the general corporate risk premium operating in the economy, and the growth rate of debt relative to GDP in the general economy (liquidity). The addition of these factors greatly adds to the ability of previous models to explain the secular fall of cap rates in the last decade and their recent rise - in terms of traditional measures of within-sample fit. Our second innovation is methodological; our analysis uses a large and robust quarterly panel data set of over 30 US metropolitan areas from 1980q1 through 2009q3. With this data we compare 3 models: a base model and then one that selectively adds each of our macro-economic variables. We test the ability of each of these models to fit the 2002-2009 period using back test dynamic forecasts. Our conclusion is that much of the secular decline in cap rates from 2000 through 2007 and their subsequent rise seem attributable to the macro-economic factors and less to movements in market fundamentals.","[Chervachidze, Serguei] CBRE Econometr Advisors, Boston, MA 02110 USA; [Wheaton, William] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Chervachidze, S (通讯作者)，CBRE Econometr Advisors, 260 Franklin St,Suite 400, Boston, MA 02110 USA.",serguei.chervachidze@cbre.com,,,,,,,24,37,38,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We test the validity of this hypothesis by first studying variations in equity flows from global investment funds to emerging markets in periods surrounding elections. Second, we interpret changes in democracy score as another event potentially creating political uncertainty and assess their effects on equity flows. Our results corroborate our hypothesis. They indicate that the period following an election is generally characterized by a fall in equity flows, and that this occurs only where the incumbent is not re-elected, suggesting continuity is valued by investors. We also find that this effect is confined to presidential regimes, a result we interpret as further evidence that potentially radical swings in policy affect investors choices. Finally, a decrease in the democracy score implies lower equity flows, while democracy in itself does not affect equity flows, which is consistent with our view that equity funds are vigilant when potentially adverse changes in the political environment arise.","[Frot, Emmanuel] Stockholm Inst Transit Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Frot, Emmanuel] Microeconomix, Paris, France; [Santiso, Javier] ESADE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE),"Frot, E (通讯作者)，Stockholm Inst Transit Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,,37,20,24,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

For all, job loss was a considerable trauma leading to a fragmentation of identity; this was compounded by subsequent rejection and perceived discrimination. Few were able to resume their earlier careers; the majority had to adjust their expectations downwards and opt for either virtual deskilling in less well paid and less demanding jobs or for an assortment of part-time, casual and voluntary work.

To this end a test was made of a two-part hierarchical model of train-use intentions positing influences from general values and beliefs as well as specific beliefs about the new railway line. A questionnaire was sent to a randomly selected sample of 1238 citizens residing in seven municipalities along the new railway line. In order to also investigate potential generation differences participants were sampled in four age groups, young adults, young middle-aged, middle-aged, and pensioners. The results supported the proposed hierarchical model showing that general values and beliefs influence intentions primarily through the specific beliefs about the railway line. In addition, the results showed that the youngest age group is more open to change and has stronger intentions to use the new railway. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

For this we build an agent-based model, inspired by a wholesale market on which we had performed some qualitative field study. In this model we define a very simple negotiation procedure for wholesalers and retailers, who are divided in two populations: loyal retailers who always visit the same seller first and opportunistic retailers who look for the best prices. In this setting, the presence of opportunistic retailers increases the quantity of waste and reduces global earnings for all agents. We then endogenize the attitude of retailers with a reinforcement learning mechanism and show that the number of loyal retailers reaches 80-100% of the population, depending on the difference of prices between expensive and cheap goods, which is the interval in which the production of waste is minimal.","GREQAM, CNRS, F-13002 Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Rouchier, J (通讯作者)，GREQAM, CNRS, 2 Rue Vieille Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France.",juliette.rouchier@univmed.fr,,"Rouchier, Juliette/0000-0002-4022-6720",CNRS; British Council; DIME network,CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); British Council(The British Council in India); DIME network,"I thank the CNRS, the British Council and the DIME network for supporting this research and making this publication possible.

While our results support the commonly accepted view in economic diplomacy that smaller nations are pressured to accept trade outcomes desired by larger nations, we also find support for a new perspective: smaller nations obtain more favourable trade outcomes, as members of a regional trade bloc, which cannot be achieved as individual nations. We find that ASEAN's conversion to a fully fledged regional trade agreement in 1992 significantly enhanced this capacity.

However, it has been widely observed that the global retail revolution is accelerating the exclusion of small producers from export markets and (increasingly) from many domestic retail chains due to rising entry barriers. Small producers are thus often only able to sell their produce on to relatively low price traditional markets. This paper is based on data collected from a recently emerged fruiticulture sector in north-east Brazil. It shows that (a) export fruiticulture does generate significant economic benefits, (b) that modern domestic retail markets are increasingly demanding and exclusionary, but also, and counter to much of the literature concerned with export promotion, that (c) small-farms producing fruiticulture products for traditional domestic markets do generate positive local economic impacts. Policymakers should, therefore, consider new ways of assisting smaller producers to enter these markets.","Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Int Relat, Brighton BN19SN, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Selwyn, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Int Relat, Brighton BN19SN, E Sussex, England.",,,,,,,,54,6,7,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

I argue that these experiments are a manifestation of a new politics of solidarity that has emerged in the wake of the financialisation process in Germany. What unites the employee-shareholder activists is a strong rejection of short-term shareholder value maximisation, particularly as it affects the corporation's employees. To this end, they have created of a new form of interest organisation, the so-called employee shareholder associations (Vereine der Belegschaftsaktionare or ESAs) that have institutionalised local practices of employee-shareholder activism within German corporations. In this article, I will take a closer look at three ESAs and their activities, each representing a different type of employee-shareholder activism: a front door strategy' at Deutsche Telekom, a back door strategy' at Siemens, and peeking through the window' at TUI. This article will demonstrate that shareholder activism by local employee representatives offers an innovative variation on the typical conflict lines within the corporation identified by scholars of corporate governance.","Wake Forest Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",Wake Forest University,"van der Zwan, N (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Tribble Hall C315, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",vandern@wfu.edu,,"van der Zwan, Natascha/0000-0002-7967-0757",,,,,47,2,2,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The main contribution is to provide methods for computing and tools for analyzing the equilibrium paths and payoffs in repeated games. We introduce the concept of a first-action feasible path, which simplifies the computation of equilibria. These paths can be composed into a directed multigraph, which is a useful representation for the equilibrium paths. We examine how the payoffs, discount factors and the properties of the multigraph affect the possible payoffs, their Hausdorff dimension, and the complexity of the equilibrium paths. The computational methods are applied to the 12 symmetric strictly ordinal 2 x 2 games. We find that these games can be classified into three groups based on the complexity of the equilibrium paths.","[Berg, Kimmo] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Syst Anal Lab, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Kitti, Mitri] Univ Turku, Dept Econ, Turku 20014, Finland",Aalto University; University of Turku,"Berg, K (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Syst Anal Lab, POB 11100, Aalto 00076, Finland.",kimmo.berg@aalto.fi,"Kitti, Mitri/AAP-8132-2020; Berg, Kimmo/K-1545-2016","Berg, Kimmo/0000-0002-7054-5095",,,,,33,10,12,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

We control for maternal height, ethnicity, education, and wealth, and for differences observed across Bolivian regions in educational and health outcomes, demographic indicators, and altitude.

We find that the racial gap in 1997 and 2005 is mostly explained by differences in housing characteristics of white- and black-owned houses but that the variation in the racial gap is explained by racial differences in implicit prices of housing characteristics.

In addition, the incorporation of web based learning (WBL) tools into the teaching environment may be an excellent way of responding to the problems posed by the ever-increasing numbers of students at many a university with over-crowded laboratories and classrooms. Many problems, however, may be associated with the use of IT in higher education, such as the lack of quality in courses delivered by IT techniques, poorly functioning equipment and the many factors that may inhibit computer access for many students. The conclusion that one can safely draw from this review is that while it may not be wise not to benefit from the application of the methods and techniques of information technology in education, these are best used to supplement rather than supplant traditional methods of education.","[Ibrahim, Hassan Al-Haj] Al Baath Univ, Homs, Syria",Al Baath University,,hasahi123@hotmail.com,"Al-Haj Ibrahim, Hassan/A-5471-2010; Ibrahim, Hassan Al-Haj/AAH-5553-2019","Ibrahim, Hassan Al-Haj/0000-0002-1816-7955",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,"INFORMATION ENGINEERING RESEARCH INST, USA",NEWARK,"100 CONTINENTAL DR, NEWARK, DE 19713 USA",,,978-1-61275-049-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,69,77,,,,,,9,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BGC88,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322346200013,0

Since the beginning of the mathematical programming science the up-to-date mathematical methods were applied to create decision support for natural resources management. However, where the optimal policies have been determined, these often fail. It was shown that this is due to the shortcomings of the models' structure stemming mainly from neglecting of nonlinearities of real systems and miss identification of constraints among relevant variables. This contribution serves as an introductory study of constrained systems arising in the natural resources modeling. We focus on two non-equivalent treatments of such constrained dynamical systems (so called vakonomic and nonholonomic approaches), we discuss the possibility to improve the optimal control models for natural resources systems using nonlinear techniques and, as a test case, we formulate a generalized anti-pollution policy problem.","[Janova, Jitka] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Brno, Czech Republic; [Musilova, Jana] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Tech Phy Astrophy, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Janová, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Brno, Czech Republic.",janova@mendelu.cz; janam@physics.muni.cz,"Janová, Jitka/F-9166-2016",,"Czech Science Foundation [13-25897S, GA 201/09/0981]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The research is supported by the Czech Science Foundation grants nr. 13-25897S and GA 201/09/0981.,,20,1,1,0,7,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,344,349,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000059,0

For all the models the accurate prediction of returns' volatility is fundamental.

Using parity progression ratios (a fertility measure) and age specific mortality for children and parents, model families are predicted in two reference periods 1650-1700 and 1750-1800. These models yield two levels of interesting results. At the individual family level, we can measure how different families' real wages changed over the family life cycle as additional children were born. At the aggregate level, we can predict thousands of families using Monte Carlo simulation, creating a realistic distribution of median family real wages in the economy. There are two main findings. First, pregnancy and lactation do not create cyclical effects in the family's income. Instead, most families' welfare ratios decline steadily across the family life cycle until children begin to leave the household, increasing the welfare ratios. Second, Allen's real wages understate or match the median of the predicted demography-adjusted distributions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

DEA method measures numerical grades of efficiency of economical processes within evaluated countries, and therefore it becomes a suitable tool for setting an effective/ineffective position of each country. The main aim of the paper is to measure efficiency changes over the reference period and to analyse a level of productivity in individual countries based on the Malmquist Index, and then to classify the EU Member States to homogeneous units (clusters) according to efficiency results. The theoretical part of the paper is devoted to the fundamental basis of efficiency theory and DEA method - especially the Malmquist Index. The empirical part is aimed at measuring the degree of productivity and level of efficiency changes of evaluated countries by the Malmquist Index, measuring the change of technical efficiency and the movement of the production possibility frontier. The final part of the paper offers a comprehensive comparison of results obtained by calculating the Malmquist Index.","[Stanickova, Michaela] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,michaela.stanickova@vsb.cz,"Stanickova, Michaela/ABE-6334-2020","Stanickova, Michaela/0000-0001-6210-2377",,,,,8,9,9,0,2,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,844,849,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000143,0

Such cases are described in terms of cyclic candidate triples. Sometimes election theory considers intricate patterns of intersecting cyclic triples. In practice, cyclic triples are rare, but they may be created as part of strategic voting against a Condorcet winner. This strategy, often called burying, is difficult to apply, but critics will detect a missed opportunity and regard it as a punishment for honest voting. A new Condorcet method, SV, lets a cyclic triple be won by the candidate with the smallest opportunity to defeat a Condorcet winner this way. A new geometric model allows visual comparison of the opportunities under various methods.","NHH, Dept Finance & Management Sci, Norwegian Sch Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Stensholt, E (通讯作者)，NHH, Dept Finance & Management Sci, Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",eivind.stensholt@nhh.no,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2013,40.0,1,,,,,229,262,,10.1007/s00355-011-0596-4,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,070BC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313479800012,0

The extension is a'posteriori ratemaking, in which claim experience of the policyholder is taken into account. At present, the typical statistical technique used in classification ratemaking is the generalized linear model (GLM). In GLM we can only deal with fixed effect in linear predictor. But for some insurance data, there is a need to treat one or more parameters as random effects, e.g. in situation when the independent assumption is not satisfied. In this paper we consider HGLM model for claim severity with gamma distribution. As the method of estimation we use an extended likelihood for canonical scale h-likelihood [8].

We show that access to mortgage credit increased between 2004 and 2006 for the borrowers we focus on in our study and declined dramatically thereafter. Trends in access to credit were driven primarily by the changing credit mix of mortgage applicants and secondarily by the replacement of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) for subprime as the dominant mode of nonprime originations and tighter underwriting standards. Throughout our entire period of study, these borrowers also consistently paid higher prices for their mortgages; however, the extent of this differential varied considerably over time and across groups. These pricing trends were driven primarily by changes in the FHA and subprime shares as well as by the market's increasingly aggressive pricing of credit risk.","[Courchane, Marsha J.] Charles River Associates Inc, Washington, DC 20004 USA; [Zorn, Peter M.] Freddie Mac, Mclean, VA 22102 USA",Charles River Associates; Freddie Mac,"Courchane, MJ (通讯作者)，Charles River Associates Inc, Washington, DC 20004 USA.",mcourchane@crai.com; peter_zorn@freddiemac.com,,,,,,,13,6,8,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,DEC,2012,40.0,,,1,,,S115,S158,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2012.00353.x,0.0,,,44,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,062UO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312948500005,0

As an alternative to existing measures, we propose a predicted wage approach that relaxes some of the strong assumptions underlying both the standard opportunity cost approach and the housekeeper wage approach. We also propose a method of adjusting the number of hours spent on home production to reduce the bias arising from multi-tasking and joint production in time-use data. Sensitivity analyses comparing results among different approaches provide indications of method effects. Although this study supports the evidence that considering home production leads to a reduction in inequality, we show that the size of this effect differs according to the variations in the mean and distribution of the estimated monetary value of home production across the three approaches.

This paper uses hedonic techniques to examine the effect of production of alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs) on the implicit price of fuel economy. This study finds that, after AFVs came to market, the marginal value of fuel economy from companies producing them decreased. This finding suggests that manufacturers who produced AFVs were willing to offer a lower price for fuel economy, because automakers had an additional way to achieve fuel economy standards beyond improving the fuel efficiency of conventional cars. These findings bolster the argument that a major role of the AMFA credit for AFVs is to allow automakers to increase their production of fuel-inefficient vehicles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on sex ratios (number of women per man) in Kazakh population between 1898 and 1908, in the midst of large-scale Russian in-migration into Kazakhstan that caused a sharp exogenous increase in land pressure. The resulting severe economic crisis made the nomadic organization of the Kazakh economy unsustainable and forced most Kazakh households into sedentary agriculture. Using a large novel dataset constructed from Russian colonial expedition materials, we document a low and worsening sex ratio (in particular, among poor households) between 1898 and 1908. The theoretical hypothesis that garners most support is that of excess female mortality in poorer households (especially among adults), driven by gender discrimination under the increasing pressure for scarce food resources.

For instance, consider the 6-sided dice whose sides are labeled (4,4,4,4,0,0), (3,3,3,3,3,3), (6,6,2,2,2,2), and (5,5,5,1,1,1). Each die has a 2/3 probability of rolling a higher number than the next one in the list and the last has the same 2/3 probability of rolling a higher number than the first. The non-transitivity of games involving non-identical dice was popularized by Gardner (Sci Am, 223:110-114, 1970). Although Gardner and other authors have observed that non-transitive dice serve to illustrate the complexities of the theory of voting, it does not seem that much attention has been paid to the corresponding voting system. Our purpose in this article is to present this voting system and compare its properties with those of other voting systems. One of the most interesting properties is the fact that cancellation with respect to the Efron dice voting system can replace cancellation with respect to pairwise preferences in Young's characterization of the social choice function associated with the Borda Count.","[Follett, M.; Traldi, L.] Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Gilson, E.; Cooley, C.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Ella, W.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Lafayette College; Northwestern University; George Washington University,"Traldi, L (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",traldil@lafayette.edu,"Traldi, Lorenzo/AAJ-5816-2020",,,,,,10,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2012,39.0,4,,,,,931,959,,10.1007/s00355-011-0562-1,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,015VE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309473700014,0

Among these, the Markov Switching AR model has a strong substantiation in international finance. Our contribution to the literature is fivefold: First, ESTAR and MSAR models from a unit root perspective are compared. To this end, a new unit root test against MSAR is proposed as the second contribution. Thirdly, the case of misspecified alternatives in a Monte Carlo setup with real world parameter constellations is studied. The ESTAR unit root test is not indicative, while the MSAR unit test is robust. Fourthly, the case of correctly specified alternatives is considered and low power of the ESTAR but not for the MSAR unit root test is observed. Fifthly, an empirical application to real exchange rates suggests that they may indeed be explained by Markov Switching dynamics rather than ESTAR.","[Kruse, Robinson] Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, CREATES, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Frommel, Michael] Univ Ghent, Dept Financial Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Menkhoff, Lukas] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Econ, Inst Money & Int Finance, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Sibbertsen, Philipp] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Econ, Inst Stat, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Aarhus University; CREATES; Ghent University; Leibniz University Hannover; Leibniz University Hannover,"Kruse, R (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, CREATES, Bldg 1322,Bartholins Alle 10, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",rkruse@creates.au.dk; michael.froemmel@ugent.be; menkhoff@gif.uni-hannover.de; sibbertsen@statistik.uni-hannover.de,"Froemmel, Michael/B-8334-2008",,,,,,31,8,8,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

A model in which a principal contracts two agents who work in a sequence on a project, have soft information and can collude is considered. Side-contracts between agents can be signed at any stage of the game. It is shown that in this setting both a decentralized contracting structure, in which contracting of the agents at the initial production stage is delegated to the agent at the final production stage, and a centralized structure, in which the principal directly contracts both agents, can be superior for the principal. The article derives the conditions under which this holds.

On average, male migrants earn 30.2% more hourly wages than female migrants. The gender wage gap is not uniform across migrants' wage distribution, and wage differentials are found to be much higher at the top end than at the bottom and the middle of the wage distribution. Using newly developed methods, we decompose the distributional gender wage differentials among rural migrants into endowment effects, explained by differences in productivity characteristics, and discrimination effects attributable to unequal returns to covariates. We find that discrimination effects contribute more to the wage gap than endowment effects throughout the wage distribution. Although the raw gender wage differential is the largest at the higher end of migrants' wage distribution, our decomposition results show that the relative gender wage discrimination problem is most serious among low income migrants.

Uncertain indemnity tends to increase the demand for insurance for precautionary reasons, but it also tends to decrease the demand due to the risk created by indemnity uncertainty. When the coefficient of relative prudence is not too large, uncertain indemnity reduces the demand for insurance and partial coverage is optimal even at actuarially fair premiums. In addition, insurance may be an inferior good or a normal good, depending on the behavior of absolute risk aversion and the magnitude of the coefficient of relative risk aversion.","San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",klee@mail.sdsu.edu,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2012,73.0,2,,,,,249,265,,10.1007/s11238-012-9316-5,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,969RI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306073300004,0

One reason for which preferences may be less than fully determinate is the lack of confidence in one's preferences. In this paper, a representation of confidence in preferences is proposed. It is used to develop and axiomatise an account of the role of confidence in choice which rests on the following intuition: the more important the decision to be taken, the more confidence is required in the preferences needed to take it. This theory provides a natural account of when an agent should defer a decision; namely, when the importance of the decision exceeds his confidence in the relevant preferences. Possible applications of the notion of confidence in preferences to social choice are briefly explored.","[Hill, Brian] HEC Paris, CNRS, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France; [Hill, Brian] HEC Paris, GREGHEC, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris,"Hill, B (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, CNRS, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France.",hill@hec.fr,,,,,,,36,7,8,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2012,39.0,2-3,,,SI,,273,302,,10.1007/s00355-011-0637-z,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,968FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305963200003,0

In this model, the lobbyist moving first suffers from a second mover advantage and will make an offer to a panel of legislators only if it deters any credible counter-reaction from his opponent, i.e., if he anticipates to win the battle. This paper departs from the existing literature in assuming that legislators care about the consequence of their votes rather than their votes per se. Our main focus is on the calculation of the smallest budget that the lobby moving first needs to win the game and on the distribution of this budget across the legislators. We study the impact of the key parameters of the game on these two variables and show the connection of this problem with the combinatorics of sets and notions from cooperative game theory.","[Le Breton, Michel] Toulouse Sch Econ, Gremaq, Idei, Toulouse, France; [Le Breton, Michel] Toulouse Sch Econ, Iuf, Toulouse, France; [Sudholter, Peter] Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Sudholter, Peter] Univ So Denmark, COHERE, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Zaporozhets, Vera] Toulouse Sch Econ, LERNA, INRA, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE,"Le Breton, M (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Gremaq, Idei, Toulouse, France.",lebreton@cict.fr; psu@sam.sdu.dk; vzaporoz@toulouse.inra.fr,"Sudhölter, Peter/JDV-4959-2023","Sudholter, Peter/0000-0002-9928-6672",,,,,63,9,9,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2012,39.0,2-3,,,SI,,491,520,,10.1007/s00355-012-0660-8,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,968FR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305963200012,0

To this end we rely on a survey comprising behavior and attitudes at the individual level. The sample matches some demographic characteristics of the German population with high-speed internet access with regard to gender and age composition. It also maps the share of foreign nationals in Germany. Self-selection in the drawing of our sample is assessed by a control experiment. In contrast to existing studies, we sharply discriminate between frequency and extent of pirating digital media. We find no significant gender difference in the propensity to pirate. However, male individuals are prone to pirate at a significantly larger scale. We attribute this finding to male individuals acting more frequently as hubs in the social prestige enhancing distribution of pirated media. It is particularly important in the light of the recent development of the distribution process from peer-to-peer online networks to offline forms of file swapping. Our findings are confirmed by recent piracy related crime statistics of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (Bundeskriminalamt).","[Mandel, Philipp] Univ Leipzig, Inst Empir Res Econ, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Suessmuth, Bernd] Univ Leipzig, Inst Empir Res Econ, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Suessmuth, Bernd] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany",Leipzig University; Leipzig University; Ifo Institut,"Mandel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Empir Res Econ, Grimmaische Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",mandel@wifa.uni-leipzig.de; suessmuth@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,27,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

In order to do this the following questions need to be addressed: How is robustness defined? Against which disturbances should the network be made robust? Which factors determine the robustness of a road network? What is the relationship between robustness, travel times and travel time reliability? Which indicators can be used to quantify robustness? How can these indicators be computed? This paper addresses these questions by developing a consistent framework for robustness in which a definition, terms related to robustness, indicators and an evaluation method are included. By doing this, policy makers and transportation analyst are offered a framework to discuss issues that are related to road network robustness and vulnerability which goes beyond the disconnected definitions, indicators and evaluation methods used so far in literature. Furthermore, the evaluation method that is presented for evaluating the robustness of the road network against short term variations in supply (like incidents) contributes to the problem of designing robust road networks because it has a relatively short computation time and it takes spillback effects and alternative routes into account.

This cycle is present across a wide variety of causes and demographic groups. A similar cycle exists for a range of economic activities, suggesting the mortality cycle may be due to short-term variation in levels of economic activity. We provide evidence that the within-month activity cycle is generated by liquidity. Our results suggest a causal pathway whereby liquidity problems reduce activity, which in turn reduces mortality. These relationships may help explain the procyclical nature of mortality.","[Evans, William N.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Moore, Timothy J.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Notre Dame; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Evans, WN (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",,,,,,,,57,39,52,0,13,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This paper shows that political regularities also existed. The main reasons for these regularities are explained in terms of a political exchange hypothesis according to which interest groups express a demand for inflation (or deflation) and political parties seek to gain power by representing the interests of certain groups. A political equilibrium that leads to stabilization is a situation where a coalition of parties supported by social groups interested in disinflation obtains the majority. In the stabilizations that took place in European countries during the 1920s, marked political regularities can be seen and are econometrically tested. The differences in the way this equilibrium was achieved can explain the different paths to stabilization and its forms. Three stylized types of stabilizations can be identified, each of which is closely related to the historical experience of France, Germany, and Great Britain.","[Pittaluga, Giovanni B.] Univ Genoa, Dept Polit & Social Sci, I-16124 Genoa, Italy; [Seghezza, Elena] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, I-16126 Genoa, Italy; [Seghezza, Elena] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Genoa; University of Genoa; Harvard University,"Pittaluga, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Largo Zecca 8-16, I-16124 Genoa, Italy.",pittagb@unige.it; seghezza@unige.it,,,,,,,70,4,4,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

As has been shown recently based on four decades of data from the German soccer premiership by Wagner (2010), the incentive change in professional soccer leagues enacted by the FIFA in 1995/96 rendered the drastic measure of firing a coach a more efficient instrument in the clubs' striving for success. In contrast to existing approaches, our model by accommodating the role of media interest is able to jointly explain (i) the impact of introducing an asymmetric reward scheme, (ii) of managerial turnover and (iii) of the perceived degree of ambition of a club on the athletic output of the team. It is shown that the rule change induces a higher agency cost, which is temporarily economized by clubs that change their management. This cost reducing effect temporarily enhances the efficiency of generating athletic output for top league clubs.","[Suessmuth, Bernd] Univ Leipzig, Inst Empir Res Econ 8c Econometr, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Wagner, Stefan] ESMT European Sch Management & Technol Berlin, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Leipzig University; European School of Management & Technology,"Süssmuth, B (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Empir Res Econ 8c Econometr, Grimma Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",suessmuth@wifa.uni-leipzig.de; stefan.wagner@esmt.org,"Wagner, Stefan M./E-9598-2010; Wagner, Stefan/W-9776-2019","Wagner, Stefan M./0000-0002-2223-679X;",,,,,10,0,0,0,13,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

If the snow sports company increases the resort's attractiveness by investing in new infrastructure, such as ski lifts or snowmaking facilities, its investment has positive external effects on the revenue of local accommodation businesses. If the cost of these external effects is not compensated by the accommodation businesses, this situation typically creates an underinvestment problem at the expense of the snow sports company. In this context, the authors analyse the extent to which revenue-based and quantity-based compensation payments can mitigate the problem. First, they identify conditions under which such payments increase the profits of both the snow sports company and the accommodation businesses. They further show that a revenue-based compensation payment dominates a quantity-based compensation payment with respect to company profit maximization, because it distorts neither the price nor the quantity decisions of the accommodation businesses.","[Lohmann, Christian; Crasselt, Nils] Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany",,"Lohmann, C (通讯作者)，Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, Gaussstr 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany.",Lohmann@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de; Crasselt@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de,,,,,,,60,5,6,0,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Multiple sources of ancillary fees related to ticketing refunds and exchanges, checked baggage, on-board pets, preferred and/or advanced seating assignments, frequent flyer ticket redemptions, and day of departure standby policies are reviewed. Despite the fact that both low cost and network carriers stress the importance of future ancillary fees in their investor reports, our assessment suggests that these fees will be more broadly adopted by low cost carriers. We anticipate that many network carriers will eliminate ancillary fees, particularly as they begin to recognize how these fees can impact other system performance objectives such as minimizing the number of misconnecting passengers.

Specifically, we ask whether or not NAFTA increased the concentration of economic activity in Mexico. Unlike previous work which uses state-level data, we identify the effect of NAFTA on economic activity at the municipal level allowing us to observe detailed growth patterns across space. To explicitly identify the effect of the trade agreement, we contrast changes in economic activity in regions and sectors more and less likely to be affected by trade. Given the spatial nature of these data, we make use of spatial panel econometric methods. We find that NAFTA caused wealthy regions nearest to the border to grow faster than others, increasing regional disparity. We also find that economic activity in densely populated regions grew less quickly after NAFTA, particularly in the case of traded sectors. Thus, we see evidence that agglomeration lost some of its draw after NAFTA. We also find that regions with a smaller portion of high school graduates and lower levels of infrastructure saw their growth increase after the trade agreement, decreasing regional disparity. We notice these redistributive effects are strongest in the non-traded sectors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Russia and the Institutionalisation of Islam in Comparative Perspective,EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Muslim integration in Russia is traditionally treated as a distinct field of research due to the diverse nature of Muslim communities and particular state approaches to ethnic and religious tolerance. The essay discusses Russia's historic engagement with Islam and suggests that some of its contemporary developments should be examined through a comparison of similar and different attempts to institutionalise Islam in Britain and France. The value of such a comparison lies in better understanding similar challenges to promoting moderate forms of Islam and engaging with Muslim representative institutions within different national contexts. Although the three countries developed different policies for integrating Muslim citizens, there is a degree of convergence in state determination to impose tighter security measures while using more integrationist rhetoric. Russia's engagement with Muslim communities provides an interesting hybrid which is partly reminiscent of Britain's multicultural aspirations and partly of France's drive for regulatory efficiency.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Braginskaia, E (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Room 4-14,Crystal Macmillan Bldg,15A George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland.",ekaterina.braginskaia@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,98,12,12,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,3,,,SI,,597,620,,10.1080/09668136.2012.661920,0.0,,,24,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,943ZT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304167900010,0

Insufficient awareness of management and low level of awareness of the benefits brought by the standards of social responsibility implemented in organizations are the main reason for the small number of organizations certified to SA 8000 standards in Croatia. In comparison with developed economies the proportion of organizations with the SA 8000 standard implemented in Croatia is very low, namely the number of certified companies is less than 1% of all registered businesses in Croatia. In addition to internal competitive advantages which are achieved through compliance with the guidelines of international standards with SA 8000, socially responsible organizations often use the opportunity to take advantage of implemented standard for marketing. In the most developed world economies, organisations are rising the levels of socially responsible marketing in three directions, which are based on appropriate legal, ethical and socially responsible behaviour. International standard SA 8000 and International Standard ISO 26000: 2010 give guidance to organizations and offices on how to improve their business and working relations. Mentioned standards provide concrete tools for improving until an internationally recognized certification bodies carry out certification audits to issue certificates to organizations that are arranged in accordance with the guidelines SA 8000. Application of standards for social responsibility in organizations has brought additional changes in the areas of health and safety at work, interpersonal relations and internal and external communication, also there was an increase in the level of transparency and the general openness. It also changed the way of working through the control of working conditions. These improvements have a positive impact on the overall business of organizations, their position in the labour market and the overall position in the community. SA 8000 and ISO 26000: 2010 are regulating human rights as well as reducing possibility of sexual, racial and other discrimination. The fundamental difference between the standard SA 8000 and ISO 26000: 2010 is that ISO 26000: 2010 is not intended for certification and it is used as a set of instructions for establishing socially responsible businesses SA 8000 is intended for certification and is compatible with other ISO standards, so it can be implemented as an integrated management system along with other ISO standards (ISO 9001: 2008, ISO 14001: 2004). The aim of this paper is to increase awareness and knowledge on standards for socially responsible business and the benefits organizations receive after the implementation of these standards.","[Britvic, Josip; Blazevic, Zrinka; Tubic, Dejan] Virovitica Coll, Virovitica 33000, Croatia",,,josip.britvic@vsmti.hr; zrinka.blazevic@vsmti.hr; dejan.tubic@vsmti.hr,"Britvic, Josip/AGO-2173-2022; Britvic, Josip JB/E-4111-2018",,,,,,18,0,0,0,9,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,356,364,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600040,0

It is argued that both the European tradition and the Uzbek case indicate that land consolidation as an isolated measure may trigger many unfavourable side-effects, and that in a transitional environment it requires even more careful tailoring of measures and embedding in various institutional settings.","[Djanibekov, Nodir; van Assche, Kristof] Univ Bonn, ZEF Ctr Dev Res, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [van Assche, Kristof] Wageningen Univ, Commun & Innovat Studies Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bobojonov, Ihtiyor] ICARDA, Aleppo, Syria",University of Bonn; Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA),"Djanibekov, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, ZEF Ctr Dev Res, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",nodir79@gmail.com; kristof.vanassche@wur.nl; ihtiyorb@yahoo.com; j.lamers@zef.uzpak.uz,"; Djanibekov, Nodir/G-3468-2012","Bobojonov, Ihtiyor/0000-0003-2166-6234; Djanibekov, Nodir/0000-0002-8249-4926; Van Assche, Kristof/0000-0003-1745-0043",,,,,84,50,52,2,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,6,,,,,1101,1126,,10.1080/09668136.2012.691720,0.0,,,26,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,968IX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305973400006,0

Due to the specificity of our work, the research methodology chosen is case study research, applied to seven contracts. Our research showed that IT Outsourcing providers suffer from several sources of variance in services, increasing contract costs. However, due to economic downturn and competition, organizations are pursuing cost reductions, and providers should take this opportunity to trade-off customization (a characteristic of IT Outsourcing contracts) for standardization (a quality of cloud offering). The conclusions of our research show that providers need to have a well developed cost management system, and mechanisms to control services variance in order to gain useful information about how their performance in a contract might affect a different one, because some contracts are silos, but others can use a common structure.","[dos Santos, Joao Correia] Inst Super Tecn, Dept Management Sci, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [da Silva, Miguel Mira] Inst Super Tecn, Dept Comp Engn, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"dos Santos, JC (通讯作者)，Inst Super Tecn, Dept Management Sci, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",joao.p.c.santos@ist.utl.pt; mms@ist.utl.pt,"Mira da Silva, Miguel/A-2892-2009; dos Santos, João Correia/O-2085-2013; Mira da Silva, Miguel/ABA-4774-2021","Mira da Silva, Miguel/0000-0002-0489-4465; Mira da Silva, Miguel/0000-0002-0489-4465",,,,,51,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,202,+,,,,,,4,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700023,0

This article seeks to explore how and why the initiative debuted through close attention to the interdependence between power and language in diplomatic practice. It takes the concept of cognitive framing to explore the relationship between political legitimacy and mobilisation capacities. The genesis of cotton as 'an issue' is critically examined, focusing on how the WCA countries constructed a novel 'competitive victim' frame to define themselves and the problem. While this opening move was effective, it also featured tensions that were exploited by Northern actors who were threatened by the campaign. I argue that what followed was the introduction of a politically driven 'counterframe', which divided the problem into a 'trade-related' component and a 'development-related' component. It is important to understand why and how this distinction was constructed and monitored. By scrutinising the relationship between framing and institutional power, I suggest that the counterframe won over the original frame, leading to a re-positioning of the demanders and a re-calibration of their expectations.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Eagleton-Pierce, MD (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.eagleton-pierce@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,91,11,11,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The extraction of oil from seeds or plant parts, is accomplished by mechanical pressing, sometimes followed by chemical extraction, because the mechanical pressing alone does not remove all the oil from the seed. Optimization of mechanical oil presses exploitation involves adjusting the constructive and functional parameters, so that power consumption for compression to be minimal and the degree of separation of oil to be larger, in terms of processing capacity (productivity) as large as possible. This paper presents the results of experimental researches conducted in the laboratory, for which was used a continuous mechanical press PU-50 type, with two exhaust ends, having a processing capacity of 40 kg/h, oil yield of 40% and a supply tank capacity of about 37 dm(3). The material used for the experiments were sunflower seeds with following characteristics: oil content 36%, hectoliter mass 41 kg/hl and shell content 26%. Independent adjusted parameters during the experiments were: cross-section area at the exit of the cake from the pressing chamber, respectively the pressure from the pressing chamber. Thus, were utilised three different nozzles, with diameters of 8, 10 and 12 mm. Processing the experimental data allowed the identification of domain in which constructive, functional and material parameters must be found so that the residual oil yield to be lowest, power consumption at pressing to be smallest and productivity of the press to be as highest possible.","[Ionescu, M.; Biris, S.

The latest reincarnation of the 'end of the developmental state' thesis proposes that industry policies are losing their strategic long-term oriented character due to the state's lack of legitimacy to play a guiding role after the economic recovery. I test this view in light of the Korean state's role, since the early 2000s, in the promotion of a new mobile communications software standard known as the Wireless Internet Platform for Interoperability (WIPI). I argue that the Korean state retains a strategic long-term approach to techno-industrial governance. The argument is developed through examining how bureaucratic actors gained the legitimacy to challenge Qualcomm, the strategy involved in promoting WIPI, and how the bureaucracy supported domestic firms under an increasingly open international trading environment. The findings reveal the state's ability to renew its legitimacy to play a developmental role through re-articulating policy goals from catching-up to nurturing innovation. Furthermore, the state has experimented with new forms of cooperation between government and business to nurture the growth of new infant technological growth sectors such as telecommunications.","Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Kim, SY (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, H04 Merewether Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",sungyoung.kim@sydney.edu.au,,"Kim, Sung-Young/0000-0002-8245-7156",,,,,77,12,14,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

For this reason, the Bishop Strossmayer, as the lord of the Episcopal Manor, stimulated the colonisation of the clearings and founding of new settlements in the nearby of Dakovo: Josipovac, Jurjevac and Krndija. A thorough research of the archival documents on the founding of these villages was conducted by Andrija Suljak, but because of his sudden passing he never completed and published his paper. This paper, based on the documents he came by, deals with the economic and legal aspects of colonisation of the village of Josipovac and the contracts between the settlers and the Manor. The archival documents give the significance even to the oral tradition on the initial contacts between Strossmayer and the colonists, recorded by the parish priest of Punotovci, Josip Lukic. The plan of cultivation of the clearings was impossible to implement without leasing the aforesaid land. Thus the initial contact, according to Lukic, between the Slovaks and Strossmayer came in the ideal moment and results in colonisation of Josipovac in 1881. Strossmayer's plan was conducted in agreement and with permission of the ecclesiastical and civil authorities: Cathedral Chapter of Dakovo, Royal Provincial Government in Zagreb and Royal Subcounty in Dakovo. The first conditions of colonisation, kept in the Archiepiscopal Archives in Dakovo, were modified in part, in order to be adjusted to the needs and interests of both the settlers and the Manor, before the Sale Contracts were signed with each of the settlers in 1889. Strossmayer provided the newly founded villages with common land for the needs of their rural districts and the local Church communities (subsidiaries). The effect of the economic and legal measures and actions taken by the Episcopal Manor and the settlers were concluded in 1894, when the Royal District Court in Dakovo, as the land registry authority, confirmed the registration of the new villages, that is, the registration of the transfer of the land to new legal and natural entities based on the legal effects of the contracts and donations.","[Kusen, Drazen] State Arch Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia",,,drazen.kusen@dao.hr,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,347,354,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600039,0

Corporate scandals, reflected in excessive management compensation and fraudulent accounts, have been cited as some of the factors causing such controversy. The proposition of the Agency theory to link compensation of the directors as closely as possible to firm performance is a major benchmark to contain the scope of controversial decisions of the bank Boards (Bruno and Margit, 2004). Against this background, present paper reports findings of its analysis on the determinants of Board of Director Compensation (BODC) of banks in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand (IMT-GT countries). The data of 18 banks in Indonesia, 9 banks in Malaysia and 12 banks in Thailand were analyzed over eight year period of 2000-07. Size of banks, measured in terms of total assets, level of BOD education, and Balance of Payment (BOP) are found to be the significant driver of BODC for banks in the IA/IT-GT countries. Interestingly, Growth Domestic Product (GDP) is not found to be significant determinant. Significance of other parameters like pre-tax income, operating expenses, net income, age, number of employees, number of insider board member, number of outsider board member, tenure, education, experience, inflation etc. included in the analysis, vary from country to country.","[Murugiah, Logasvathi; Saha, Asish] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintoh, Kedah, Malaysia; [Ahmad, Nor Hayati] Univ Utara Malaysia, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch, Sintoh, Kedah, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia; Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Murugiah, L (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintoh, Kedah, Malaysia.",,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,2,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,263,+,,,,,,4,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600024,0

This study investigates the demand of regional tourists from Thailand, Vietnam and China visiting the Lao PDR. Income, tourism price and substitution price are the factors that included in the tourism demand model. The sample period of the study is from 2005 - 2010. Bounds testing cointegration procedure or autoregressive distributed lagged model (ARDL) is used in the method. The result shows that income has a positive relationship with demand of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese tourists to Lao PDR. Then, regional tourism in Lao PDR indicates that is a luxury service. On the other hand, substitution price has a positive relationship demand with Vietnamese tourists. However, it has a negative relationship demand with tourists from China. Therefore, Thailand is a competitor for basically the same tourism market with Lao PDR which is competing for tourists from Vietnam; but it is also a complementary tourism market with Lao PDR for China's tourists. This study suggests that Lao PDR should improve the infrastructure and develop new tourism destinations and products continuously. In addition, it should integrate the tourism market with Thailand for sustainable tourism in Lao PDR.","[Nonthapot, Sakkarin; Lean, Hooi Hooi; Mohd, Saidatulakmal] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Pulau Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,,"Mohd, Saidatulakmal/J-1535-2014; Lean, Hooi Hooi/A-5754-2010","Mohd, Saidatulakmal/0000-0002-7947-7324; Lean, Hooi Hooi/0000-0002-6847-0274",,,,,18,0,0,0,2,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,661,670,,,,,,10,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600057,0

Though whether policies improve the core-periphery productivity gap hinges on this question, no consensus is found in theoretical models. This paper uses plant-level data covering all regions in Japan during the period of active relocation policies. Our estimation results from plant-level regressions and propensity-score matching show that the average productivity of plants is significantly low in regions targeted by relocation policy programs. By comparing productivity distributions across plants before and after the start of each policy program, we find that low-productivity plants are attracted to targeted regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The study applies the multivariate cointegration methodology to establish the possible causal relations between these variables. The cointegration test and the vector error correction model demonstrate the evidence of a positive long-run relationship between consumption and environmental degradation while energy consumption is negatively related to environmental degradation. The long-term elasticity coefficients of the independent variables on environmental degradation display relationships that are theoretically grounded.

When mounted into the shell, the teatcup liner is elongated by 5.4%. The use of a 2 nun thick washer placed at the top of the shell allowed the increase of the liner stretch to 6.9%. A high milk line milking machine was used, operated at a vacuum level of 47 kPa (54.32 kPa absolute pressure). The system was equipped with an electronic STIMO IQ pulsator, at a fixed pulsation rate of 60 cycles/min; two pulsation ratios were tested: 60/40 and 70/30 %. An artificial teat, according to the specifications of the ASAE EP445.1 standard, was mounted into the teatcup. The artificial teat was equipped with an A201 FlexiForce (Tekscan) force transducer in order to measure the contact pressure between the liner and the teatcup. During each test the following parameters were evaluated: the real pulsation ratio and rate; the duration of the cycle phases; the maximum contact pressure between the liner and the artificial teat; the critical collapsing pressure difference. The experimental results showed that liner tension had no significant effect over the duration of the a+b and c+d phases of the pulsation cycle, while the a and d phases were affected by the increased liner tension.

So far studies have focused on the linear relationship between sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. However, the results of such studies are mixed and only few studies examined the non-linear relationship between sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. Further, most studies adopted sustainability performance either as a predictor variable or as an outcome variable. Understanding the direct relationship between corporate sustainability and corporate financial performance is becoming important as firms are identifying corporate sustainability as a strategic goal and is increasingly being embedded into firm operations. Subsequently, it is of importance to understand whether the relationship between corporate sustainability and corporate financial performance is influenced by other factors and whether the relationship can be explained better through such interacting factors. Hence, this paper focuses on whether a firm's integration capability, drawn from dynamic capability theory can explain whether firms with higher level of integration capability can demonstrate a direct relationship between corporate sustainability and corporate financial performance. Thus a conceptual framework incorporating corporate sustainability adoption as a predictor variable, corporate financial performance as a criterion variable, sustainability performance as a mediator between corporate sustainability adoption and corporate financial performance and integration capability as a moderator between corporate sustainability adoption and corporate financial performance is proposed. The conceptual framework proposed in this study provides the opportunity to test the model in different contexts using primary data and should promote further discussion on investigating the non-linear relationship between corporate sustainability adoption and corporate financial performance and to propose theoretical frameworks incorporating constructs from other organizational theories.","[Shamil, M.

Theoretical studies and experimental researches developed within this paper emphasized the fact that 2-D contact area is elliptical when tire deflection is small, but it becomes rectangular with curved edges as the deflection increase. The model predictions were verified by means of the experimental results obtained using the tires of an agricultural trailer.

For this purpose, in this paper we analyze models applicable to the modelling of counter variables. In the first part of the paper we present the classical Poisson regression and a modified regression model for data, where there is a large number of zeros in the values of the counter variable, which is a common situation in the insurance data. In the second part we expand the classical Poisson regression by adding the random effect. The goal is to avoid an unrealistic assumption that in every class all insurance policies are characterized by the same expected number of claims. In the last part of the paper we propose to use k-fold cross-validation to identify the factors which influence the number of insurance claims the most. Then, setting the parameters of the Poisson distribution, we create the ranking of polices using estimated parameters of the model, which give the smallest cross-validation mean squared error and we classify using the regression tree.

Continuous-time econometrics is based on the argument that as economic systems are largely continuous they can be better represented and estimated by differential equation rather than difference equation systems. This paper reviews the development of full-information Gaussian estimators of non-linear systems which may then be extended to the estimation of models of intertemporally optimizing agents and other boundary point models, and models where the parameters of the stochastic innovation process enter the deterministic part of the model or vice versa. The long-properties of these models may be studied by calculating the Lyapunov exponents which give information on the form of the attractor the model, the dynamic stability of the model for given parameter values and whether it is structurally stable. The critical dependence of some attractors, and particularly strange attractors, on parameter values emphasizes the need for consistent, efficient estimation. A structural approach provides a rigorous alternative to using single time series to determine whether economic systems exhibit aperiodic or chaotic dynamical behavior.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Wymer, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.",wymer@mail.com,,,,,,,42,0,0,1,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Tourists from the region's two advanced economies, Australia and New Zealand, find Fiji a more affordable tourist destination than distant European and Asian holiday resorts. The development of the tourism sector in Fiji owes much to foreign direct investment (FDI) in hotels, resorts and other infrastructural facilities. This paper uses bounds cointegration technique and investigates the contribution of FDI to Fiji's tourism sector. The analysis identifies positive associations between FDI and tourism earnings as well as between currency depreciation and tourism earnings.","[Jayaraman, T.

We contribute to the debate on the optimal composition of public expenditure, an issue that can be controversial in times of financial crises. We discriminate between two funding regimes through the reallocation of public spending. The first proposes financing the marine restoration programme by reducing public expenditure for investments in renewable energy, and the second by reducing public expenditure for civil servants' training. The results reveal that the marginal value of public money depends on the funding source. Furthermore, attribute values are sensitive to the trade-off implied by the funding scheme. The magnitude of the results differs in the two countries considered, because of their heterogeneity in political and cultural dimensions.","[Remoundou, Kyriaki] Aberystwyth Univ, Sch Business & Management, Aberystwyth SY23 3AL, Dyfed, Wales; [Adaman, Fikret] Bogazici Univ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Koundouri, Phoebe] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens 10434, Greece; [Koundouri, Phoebe] London Sch Econ & Business, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Nunes, Paulo A.

This is surprising, as trade credits are generally more expensive than bank credits and thus a costly substitute for bank financing. In this paper, we investigate the relation between trade credits and bank credits for exporting firms. We develop a theoretical model and show that trade credits convey a quality signal which reduces the risk of the transaction and may thus facilitate obtaining additional bank credits. Hence, exporters who are not able to obtain bank credits in the first place use trade credits and bank credits complementarily. Using panel data on large German manufacturing firms, we provide supportive evidence for our theoretical predictions. In general, trade credits and bank credits are substitutes. For financially constrained exporters, the overall substitution effect is attenuated which is consistent with a positive signalling effect.","[Engemann, Martina] Univ Munich, Munich Gradual Sch Econ, Munich, Germany; [Eck, Katharina] Univ Munich, Bavarian Grad Program Econ, Munich, Germany; [Schnitzer, Monika] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; University of Munich; University of Munich,"Engemann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich Gradual Sch Econ, Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,,41,22,25,6,49,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2014,37.0,11,,,,,1507,1540,,10.1111/twec.12167,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AU3JX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345510100002,0

The estimation approach relies on Bayesian methods to model the latent process followed by risk exposures and idiosynchratic volatility. Our application to monthly, 1979-2009 U.S. data for stock, bond, and REIT returns shows that both market and real consumption growth risks are priced throughout the sample by the cross-section of asset returns.

The article traces the socialization processes offered by the EU's development policy rule-making and subsequent national rule implementation. The conclusions reveal three reasons why socialization has been weak: perceptions among the new Member States on the procedural legitimacy of the development acquis; low domestic resonance with the development acquis; and inconsistencies in the activities of norm entrepreneurs.

Some floated their shares in Hong Kong, while others were listed on Mainland China stock exchanges. This paper empirically examines the determinants of their initial public offering (IPO) location choice. Based on probit analysis, we found that developers with better unobserved quality are more likely to list in Hong Kong than in the Mainland. State ownership, gearing ratio, and property market performance are other significant determinants of IPO locations. A further test shows that the degree of IPO underpricing is larger for firms listed in Mainland China than those listed in Hong Kong. All these findings are consistent with the signaling hypothesis-good firms signal their quality to investors by listing in market with more stringent regulatory environment where other firms cannot afford to imitate.","[Wong, S.

Our model extends the standard meta-regression model for detecting genuine effects in the presence of publication biases using the statistical power trace by controlling for the tendency to over-fit vector autoregression models in small samples. Granger causality tests in these over-fitted models have inflated type I errors. We cannot find a genuine causal effect in the literature as a whole. However, there is a robust genuine effect from output to energy use when energy prices are controlled for.","[Bruns, Stephan B.; Gross, Christian] Max Planck Inst Econ, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Stern, David I.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Max Planck Society; Australian National University,"Stern, DI (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",stbruns@econ.mpg.de; gross@econ.mpg.de; david.stern@anu.edu.au,"Stern, David I/B-4700-2009","Stern, David I/0000-0001-6595-4268",Australian Research Council [DP120101088]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG-GK-1411],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Ariane Bretschneider, Maria Hennicke, Clemens Klix, Susanne Kochs, Natalija Kovalenko, Katja Mehlis, Stefanie Picard, Annemarie Strehl, and Silvia Volkmann for research assistance.

In this paper, I aim to understand whether and how ethnic diversity affects communities in these cities. A general equilibrium model is built in which people of many ethnic groups interact in the housing market through both price signals and non-market mechanisms. An endogenous correlation between neighborhood house price and the Herfindahl index of ethnic concentration arises because of social interactions. After addressing the endogeneity issue, I find that neighborhoods with more homogeneous minority populations command higher prices using a dataset of housing transactions and neighborhood socio-economic characteristics in Vancouver, Canada. This and other findings support the notion that non-market social interactions influence people's preference and behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This article tries to fill the gap between practice and theory. It first describes the properties of rail capacity (rigidity and non-homogeneity) and shows that because of its very nature, this capacity must be allocated through combinatorial auctions. As identified by the economic literature, using combinatorial auctions introduces a lot of complexity (winner determination and information burden) into the allocation process. To deal with this complexity, some form of centralized planning is necessary to design the right market mechanisms and to allocate capacity. This could have strong consequences on the current deregulation process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze the interaction between the rental and resale housing markets under conditions of bilateral asymmetric information regarding housing quality and the type of residents. Home ownership is associated with a trade-off between the loss caused by asymmetric information and rent exploitation by landlords in a holdup problem. With perfect protection for tenants, adverse selection in the resale housing market becomes problematic, and the market disappears. Conversely, the absence of tenancy protection mitigates adverse selection in the resale housing market and leads to a separating equilibrium. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that this resulted in governing through crime - the outflow of criminal justice practices and logics into other unrelated policy spheres. We demonstrate this by looking at responses to the issue of safety in schools. We show that up to 2007, despite a moral panic surrounding school violence, policy-makers were able to resist knee-jerk punitive reactions in favor of evidence-based, preventive approaches in the relatively transparent atmosphere of Mikheil Saakashvili's first term. By 2008, however, schools increasingly began to become the objects of central government intervention and education policy became harsher and more punitive. In 2010, Police Academy-trained School Resource Officers were introduced into all schools throughout Georgia, with troubling consequences for both teachers and students. The paper shows that this move was primarily the result of the more interventionist, executive-driven, and opaque policy-making process in Saakashvili's second term, which left unchallenged the circulation of personnel, expertise, and policy from the hypertrophied criminal justice institutions into the education sphere.","[Tangiashvili, Nodar] Tbilisi State Univ, Ctr Social Sci, GE-380086 Tbilisi, Georgia; [Slade, Gavin] Univ Toronto, Ctr Criminol & Sociolegal Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada",Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University; University of Toronto,"Slade, G (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Ctr Criminol & Sociolegal Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada.",gavin.slade@utoronto.ca,"Slade, Gavin/V-9757-2019",,,,,,86,2,3,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

This study thus adopts Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) as a case study to identify passengers' perceptions regarding key factors that affect the channel preference through which they receive their services, particularly across a four-stage ticket purchasing process, including information enquiry, booking, payment, and ticket pick-up. To investigate these key factors, we base the framework of our research model upon customers' perceived value perspective, adopting a multinomial logit model to examine the influence of channel attributes on HSR passengers' preferences. The relationship among the decisions made by these passengers at each ticket purchasing stage is also examined. The findings of our study demonstrate that perceived risk, perceived benefit, and perceived ease of use are critical factors influencing passengers' channel preference throughout the ticket-purchasing process. Perceptual differences are proven to exist due to various demographic factors and trip characteristics. The conclusions of this study have implications for THSR management to design appropriate ticketing channel services for certain types of passengers and can also be generally applied to multiple distribution channels in conventional railway system and intercity bus services.

An error component random Parameter model with correlated errors was used to estimate the effect of the attributes on consumers' utility and derive their WTP. Results suggest that consumers positively value both attributes and are willing to pay a premium of 9 % price increase for the locally grown lamb meat (Ojinegra from Teruel) and 13 % price increase for the Ternasco lamb meat. If we assume a market where only Ternasco lamb meat without indication of the local origin is sold, and then a new Ternasco lamb is introduced in the market with the Ojinegra from Teruel label, this new local lamb meat would capture 18 % of the market if the package is assumed to be sold at 3.5 and a 10 % market share if the package is assumed to be sold at 4 .","Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Unidad Econ Agr & Recursos Nat, Zaragoza 50059, Spain",,"Gracia, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Unidad Econ Agr & Recursos Nat, Avda Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",agracia@aragon.es,", Azucena/N-6263-2019",,,,,,56,51,59,0,68,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Compensation structures are only indirectly related to shareholder wealth maximization when share prices are unobservable. Liquidity options for investors are limited in the absence of an exchange listing. Using a hand-collected database for public non-listed REITs, an empirical sequence considers the impact of management compensation contracts on equity fundraising and success in capital deployment. Evidence is provided that high asset management fees and high acquisition fees diminish managerial success at generating revenue from invested capital. Successful revenue flows are deterministic factor in the level of distributions paid and the likelihood of achieving a fund exit. Closing the gate on share redemption plans is synchronized with the slowdown in new equity flows.

Such an alternative also endows each country with the freedom to determine and develop its own pathway under its emissions budget while ensuring that global climate targets are met. Within this context, this paper integrated economic growth theory with the optimal control model and simulated the optimal abatement pathway as well as the economic growth trajectory for China within the allocated emissions budget. The study found that research and development (R&D) investment is an effective way of improving energy efficiency. Our simulation showed that the R&D intensity of the gross domestic product (GDP) would see a slight decline for the inceptive period, followed by an aggressive rise to a relatively high level before decreasing again. Under the 450 ppm carbon concentration target, the R&D investment intensity would have to increase significantly beginning from 2014 because of the more stringent demands as compared to other less rigorous targets such as 500 ppm. The economy would continue to grow, although growth would occur less rapidly under rigorous targets: relative to 2007 levels, the GDP would grow by 11-fold and 15-fold under the 450 and 500 ppm scenarios, respectively. Before enforcement of an effective R&D investment, the carbon emissions would increase rapidly, while after enforcement, the speed of carbon emissions would slow down.","[Zhu, Yongbin; Wang, Zheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zheng] E China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development; East China Normal University,"Wang, Z (通讯作者)，E China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",zhuyongbin@casipm.ac.cn; wangzheng@casipm.ac.cn,,,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2012CB955804]; National Science Foundation of China [41201594]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05150502],National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"Financial support was provided by Grant No. 2012CB955804 from the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), Grant No. 41201594 from the National Science Foundation of China, and Grant No. XDA05150502 from the Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",,28,1,2,3,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Some authors, however, conclude that the New Keynesian Phillips Curve does a better job of describing Chinese inflation behaviour in recent decades. This paper conducts an analysis of China's inflation behaviour from the late 1980s onwards by estimating both traditional and new Phillips curves using improved econometric techniques. We find that the New Keynesian Phillips Curve performs poorly in explaining China's inflation behaviour, whereas the traditional 'old' Phillips curve does significantly better.","Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",Wake Forest University,"Mazumder, S (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7505, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",mazumds@wfu.edu,,,,,,,38,0,0,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JUL,2014,66.0,5,,,,,689,709,,10.1080/09668136.2014.898431,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AJ8AJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337924100001,0

Cohort effects are particularly relevant for women with those born in the late 1960s and early 1970s more likely to participate over the life-cycle. Our results suggest that cohort effects can be interpreted as evolving social norms or preferences towards participating in the labour market according to Fernandez (NBER working paper no. 13373, 2007). We find substantial variation in the estimated age and cohort effects across European countries: cohort effects can account for a substantial part of the recent increase in participation in Spain, the Netherlands and Germany, and a positive, but smaller part of in the increase in participation of the UK, Italy and France. Looking forward, positive cohort effects could help counteract the downward impact of population ageing on participation.","[Balleer, Almut] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, LuF Empir Wirtschaftsforsch, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Balleer, Almut] Stockholm Univ, IIES, S-10961 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gomez-Salvador, Ramon] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Turunen, Jarkko] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",RWTH Aachen University; Stockholm University; European Central Bank; International Monetary Fund,"Balleer, A (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, LuF Empir Wirtschaftsforsch, Templergraben 64, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",almut.balleer@rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,,25,18,19,0,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Various structures have been implemented in several countries, e.g. Ireland, France, The Czech Republic, and Denmark. In many countries the tax reforms have been followed by a steep change in new vehicle purchases toward more diesel vehicles and more fuel-efficient vehicles. The paper analyses to what extent a vehicle tax reform similar to the Danish 2007 reform may explain changes in purchasing behaviour. The paper investigates the effects of a tax reform, fuel price changes, and technological development on vehicle type choice using a mixed logit model. The model allows a simulation of the effect of car price changes that resemble those induced by the tax reform. This effect is compared to the effects of fuel price changes and technology improvements. The simulations show that the effect of the tax reform on fuel efficiency is similar to the effect of rising fuel prices while the effect of technological development is much larger. The conclusion is that while the tax reform appeared in the same year as a large increase in fuel efficiency, it seems likely that it only explains a small part of the shift in fuel efficiency that occurred and that the main driver was the technological development.

The aim is to evaluate the effect of different proposals for the CAP Post-2013 on Italian farms, particularly on the processing tomato sector Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) is used to simulate different hypotheses of convergence and greening as proposed by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. Commission proposals are shown to have different impacts compared to the other two. Commission proposals would significantly influence the regional production plan, leading to big reductions in cereal production and farm income. Parliament and Council two proposals would have lower impact on arable crop dynamics. In terms of land use, the tomato sector is relatively unaffected by the reform, but the payment convergence process significantly reduces tomato farm income.","[Solazzo, Roberto; Petriccione, Gaetana] INEA, Rome, Italy; [Donati, Michele; Arfini, Filippo] Univ Parma, Dept Econ, Parma, Italy",University of Parma,"Solazzo, R (通讯作者)，INEA, Rome, Italy.",,"Solazzo, Roberto/ABE-2795-2020; Arfini, Filippo/AAG-4715-2020; Donati, Michele/L-4171-2019","Solazzo, Roberto/0000-0003-1445-6044; Donati, Michele/0000-0002-3957-842X; Arfini, Filippo/0000-0002-5179-2541; Petriccione, Gaetana/0000-0001-9467-8194",,,,,16,27,27,0,18,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2014,13.0,2,,,,,9,19,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AM7XC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340081000002,0

Furthermore, the extent of market power varies significantly among regional markets, with China's northeast region as the strongest, followed by the eastern and western regions, and the central area as the weakest. We also find a hub-premium effect similar to the result found in the US airline market.

In this paper, we review sociological contributions to the literature on travel and 'mobilities'. We summarise four key themes which supplement or contradict arguments made in mainstream transport debates on behaviour change. The first involves focusing on travel 'practices' as social entities with dynamics of their own, rather than on individual behaviours. The second relates to the changing natures of societies, and the implications for travel. The third explores and interprets the issue of car dependence in ways which highlight the ethical, experiential and emotional dimensions associated with car use, its symbolic role in societies increasingly concerned with consumption, and its differing roles within different cultures. Finally, the 'new mobilities paradigm' highlights issues such as the increasing links between travel and new technologies, and the primacy of social networks in influencing travel decisions. These themes emphasise the importance of understanding the broader contexts in which travel choices are made. In particular, the implication is that the creation of more sustainable travel patterns will require changes at a range of social levels, not simply in individual behaviours, and that changes to transport will inevitably be linked with, and influenced by, broader changes in the values and practices developed by societies as a whole.

Using a model of heterogeneous firms that can move between regions, Baldwin and Okubo (2006) show how more productive firms sort themselves to the large core region. We extend this model by introducing different fixed costs in terms of capital among firms and sectors. In accordance with empirical evidence, more productive firms are assumed to be associated with a higher fixed cost in terms of capital. As a result, our model can produce sorting to the large regions from both ends of the productivity distribution. Firms with high capital intensity and high productivity as well as firms with very low productivity and low capital intensity tend to relocate to the core. We use Japanese micro data to explore the predictions of the model. Many sectors show patterns that are consistent with two-sided sorting. We also find supportive evidence for our model prediction that two-sided sorting occurs in sectors with a high capital intensity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, there exists a strong need to mitigate adverse selection problems in microlending. A risk scoring model that more accurately predicts the likelihood of repayment of potential borrowers can help address this market imperfection and to benefit both lenders and borrowers. This paper compares the performance of nonparametric versus semiparametric and traditional parametric risk scoring models based on default probabilities. We show the advantages of relying on less structured, data-driven methods for risk scoring using both simulated data and data from credit loans granted to small and microenterprises in rural Peru. The estimation results indicate that nonparametric methods lead to a better evaluation of credit worthiness and can help prevent including potential bad borrowers and excluding good borrowers from sensitive microcredit markets.","[Hernandez, Manuel A.; Torero, Maximo] IFPRI, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Hernandez, MA (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",m.a.hernandez@cgiar.org; m.torero@cgiar.org,,,,,,,24,9,9,0,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

San Francisco has adopted a performance goal of 60-80% occupancy for its metered parking. The goal represents an heuristic performance measure intended to reduce double parking and cruising for parking, and improve the driver experience; it follows a wave of academic and policy literature that calls for adjusting on-street parking prices to achieve similar occupancy targets. In this paper, we evaluate the relationship between occupancy rules and metrics of direct policy interest, such as the probability of finding a parking space and the amount of cruising. We show how cruising and arrival rates can be simulated or estimated from hourly occupancy data. Further, we evaluate the impacts of the first two years of the San Francisco program, and conclude that rate changes have helped achieve the City's occupancy goal and reduced cruising by 50%.

In addition to the conventional outputs (i.e., passengers, flights and cargo), we consider three undesirable externalities of airport activities: delays, noise and local air pollution. We adopt a directional distance function approach and perform a second stage analysis to investigate potential determinants of efficiency. Our base case results with only the positive outputs show that the greater the average aircraft size serving an airport and the larger the dimensions of the airport, the higher the technical efficiency. However, our results are sensitive to the inclusion of the undesirable outputs. The implications are that the inclusion of these externalities into the calculation of efficiency may impact policy decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Generation Phase, items over which the players' preferences differ widely enough are allocated. Contested items are placed in the Contested Pile, which is then allocated in the Splitting Phase. Each phase can be carried out using several different techniques; we perform a comprehensive analysis of the resulting design variants using a computational model. The properties of fairness and efficiency, generally achieved in the Generation Phase, must be traded off against robustness to manipulation. We find that the recently developed Undercut procedure for the Splitting Phase outperforms alternative methods in both fairness and efficiency. In general, procedures that keep the Contested Pile relatively small and incorporate the Undercut procedure score well in both fairness and efficiency, but are prone to manipulation.","[Vetschera, Rudolf] Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Kilgour, D.

We propose a multidimensional explanation for EU citizens' attitude towards Turkey's membership by referring to the political psychology literature on attitudinal ambivalence. We examine whether EU citizens simultaneously hold multiple and conflicting considerations on Turkey's EU accession bid, and whether this ambivalence has attitudinal consequences. To that end, we use the Eurobarometer 66.1 data set to analyze the EU public attitudes on various aspects of possible Turkish EU membership. The findings show that the EU citizens maintain ambivalent views about Turkish membership across three domain pairs: economy-security, immigration-security and population-culture.

Racine (Maintainer) and Zhenghua Nie. This add-on package provides a collection of functions for spline-based nonparametric estimation of regression functions with both continuous and categorical regressors. Currently, the crs package integrates data-driven methods for selecting the spline degree, the number of knots and the necessary bandwidths for nonparametric conditional mean, IV and quantile regression. A function for multivariate density spline estimation with mixed data is also currently in the works. As a bonus, the authors have also provided the first simple R interface to the NOMAD (nonsmooth mesh adaptive direct search') optimization solver which can be applied to solve other mixed integer optimization problems that future users might find useful in other settings. Although the crs package shares some of the same functionalities as its kernel-based counterpartthe np package by the same authorit currently lacks some of the features the np package provides, such as hypothesis testing and semiparametric estimation. However, what it lacks in breadth, crs makes up in speed. A Monte Carlo experiment in this review uncovers sizable speed gains compared to its np counterpart, with a marginal loss in terms of goodness of fit. Therefore, the package will be extremely useful for applied econometricians interested in employing nonparametric techniques using large amounts of data with a small number of discrete covariates.

Results show that negative preferences for alternative fuel vehicles are large, especially for the electric and fuel cell car, mostly as a result of their limited driving range and considerable refueling times. Preference for AFVs increases considerably with improvements on driving range, refueling time and fuel availability. Negative AFV preferences remain, however, also with substantial improvements in AFV characteristics; the remaining willingness to accept is on average (sic) 10,000-(sic) 20,000 per AFV. Results from a mixed logit model show that consumer preferences for AFVs and AFV characteristics are heterogeneous to a large extent, in particular for the electric car, additional detour time and fuel time for the electric and fuel cell car. An interaction model reveals that annual mileage is by far the most important factor that determines heterogeneity in preferences for the electric and fuel cell car. When annual mileage increases, the preference for electric and fuel cell cars decreases substantially, whilst the willingness to pay for driving range increases substantially. Other variables such as using the car for holidays abroad and the daily commute also appear to be relevant for car choice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In such a context, this paper examines an economic concept to incentivise a more efficient use of available network capacities. We put forward a method and develop a model for an anticipatory, time-dependent modulation of ANS charges, aiming to alleviate the demand-capacity imbalance on an airspace network, at minimal cost to airspace users. The proposed method is conceptualised as a bi-level optimisation problem, reconciling the perspectives of network manager and individual network users. The results of a medium-scale real-life case study indicate that an imposition of a revenue-neutral matrix of tolls and rebates on a congested airspace network may yield a fairly equitable route assignment, which seems capacity-wise more efficient than current administrative demand management practices.

Using four gedanken-experiments, this paper shows that this central question, so cleverly and aptly avoided by libertarian paternalism (nudge), cannot always be avoided. The four thought experiments, while purely hypothetical, serve to raise and specify the critical arguments in a maximally clear and pure manner. The first purpose of the paper is, accordingly, to provide a litmus test on the readers' stance on paternalism. We thus also survey and organize the various stances in the literature. The secondary purpose of this paper is to argue that paternalism cannot always be avoided and consumer sovereignty cannot always be respected. However, this argument will remain controversial.","[Li, Chen; Li, Zhihua; Wakker, Peter P.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Wakker, PP (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",Wakker@ese.eur.nl,"Li, ZhiHua/GYU-9914-2022; li, zh/HII-5698-2022","Li, Zhihua/0000-0003-1363-0039",,,,,98,3,3,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2014,76.0,3,,,,,297,315,,10.1007/s11238-013-9375-2,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AC4US,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332517200001,0

Based on China's provincial-level panel data over the 2000-2005 period, estimates using the fixed-effect panel data model show an insignificant impact of WHSs on tourist arrivals. Crucially, the empirical results obtained from both FEVD and TSDFE confirm a positive relationship between WHSs and international tourists in China. Moreover, cultural WHSs tend to exhibit a stronger tourism-enhancing effect than the natural WHSs.

It argues that attempts were made in the early post-apartheid period to forge a more social-democratic and co-ordinated variety of capitalism, but that this floundered as the government adopted neoliberal macroeconomic policies against the wishes of organised labour, and as black economic empowerment policies further undermined an already racially-fraught business sector. Organised labour was able to push for, and maintain, protective labour market policies - but this came at the cost of growing policy inconsistency notably with regard to trade liberalisation which, in the presence of growing labour-market protection, has exacerbated South Africa's unemployment crisis. Unemployment remains intractable (and with it inequality) and corruption/patrimonialism appears to be a growing problem.","[Nattrass, Nicoli] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Nattrass, Nicoli] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Social Sci Res, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Nattrass, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",nicoli.nattrass@uct.ac.za,,"Nattrass, Nicoli/0000-0002-8422-5631",,,,,64,41,49,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It was found that publishing, art crafts, visual arts and design dominate in the structure of exports of goods of Lithuanian creative industries. The research shows that structure of imports of creative industries changed in recent years. The key role in import of goods of creative industries was played by design. Thus, the analysis of international trade of creative industries revealed that Lithuanian integration into the EU had an influence on the changes of trade in creative products.

We provide an example of a simple consumption model with anticipated inflation which is given as an interval of predictions.

We explore a variety of econometric modelling approaches to the analysis of such data. The approaches under consideration are: the Random Utility approach (in which it is assumed that each possible action yields a utility with a deterministic and a stochastic component, and that the individual selects the action yielding the highest utility); the Random Behavioural approach (which assumes that the individual computes the maximum of a deterministic utility function, and that computational error causes their observed behaviour to depart stochastically from this optimum); and the Random Preference approach (in which all variation in behaviour is attributed to stochastic variation in the parameters of the deterministic component of utility). These approaches are applied in various ways to an experiment on fairness conducted by Cappelen et al. (Am Econ Rev 97(3):818-827, 2007). Various models that we estimate succeed in capturing the key features of the dataset. Conclusions concerning fairness-related behaviour depend crucially on the choice of econometric model.","[Conte, Anna] Max Planck Inst Econ, Strateg Interact Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Conte, Anna] Univ Westminster, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, London W1R 8AL, England; [Moffatt, Peter G.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Max Planck Society; University of Westminster; University of East Anglia,"Conte, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Strateg Interact Grp, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",aconte@econ.mpg.de; p.moffatt@uea.ac.uk,"Conte, Anna/GLT-3497-2022","Conte, Anna/0000-0002-9234-5705",,,,,21,9,11,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2014,76.0,1,,,,,119,145,,10.1007/s11238-012-9309-4,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,298QW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330340400008,0

To answer this question, the impact of regional public expenditure in Peru on young children's nutritional outcomes is examined. To account for policy endogeneity, public expenditures are instrumented using unanticipated regional mining revenues. Even after accounting for changes in expenditure composition due to increases in mining revenues, public spending has a significant and positive impact on children's outcomes only in urban areas. However, even in urban areas, barriers exist that diminish the effectiveness of public expenditure, so indigenous and frailer children in these areas do not benefit from public spending. These children face constraints that limit their ability to use public services. This result reveals the paramount importance of initial conditions. In rural areas, possibly because of the lower quantity and quality of public services, there is no positive effect for any children.","Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Gajate-Garrido, G (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",g.gajategarrido@cgiar.org,,,Department for International Development (DFID); Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Department for International Development (DFID); Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"The author thanks Dora L.

Also in identifying the rent component in the structure of income, distribution mechanisms of rental income in the value chain, the institutions of redistribution of rent income, the definition of subjects assignment quasi-rent. Communicational quasi-rent should be presented as a general system construction, in which she will act as a single system element, and at the same time - as a phenomenon. The communication quasi-rent as the income from application of communicative resources represents a prize from inclusion in a production activity of the communicative resources created by organizational system which can't be got in the market and which therefore gain properties of exclusiveness and a rarity. Ready-to-use communication resources are not available in the market. Communicative resources of the organization are as though a internal product (result) of its communication activity. Therefore, distinction in value and public usefulness of used communicative resources by various subjects of the market, that they possess, becomes an economic condition of formation of a communication quasi-rent. Extremely interesting is the question of possession of communicative resources. The communicative resource also as well as the communication capital is inseparable from the organization therefore it can't be withdrawn or moved at will of the owner of the organization. However, as the property complex belongs to his owner, so the inalienable communicative resource belongs to the same owner who has an opportunity and the right of use by organizational communicative resources. Classification of a communication quasi-rent allows to designate its main forms: the differential quasi-rent, received at use of more effective resource; the exclusive quasi-rent, caused by exclusive use of a limited resource; the local quasi-rent, formed within private business processes; the joint quasi-rent, formed in joint business processes.","Don State Tech Univ, Technol Serv Inst, Rostov Na Donu, Russia",Don State Technical University,"Krivokora, E (通讯作者)，Don State Tech Univ, Technol Serv Inst, Rostov Na Donu, Russia.",,"Krivokora, Evgenia Ivanovna/H-1540-2016",,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-27-8,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,317,324,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614800041,0

Population aging brings with it the need for a wide range of changes in the functioning of society in areas that are significantly affected by the age structure of the population. The main areas are the funding of the pension and health care system. The growing number of the older persons increases the required volume of provided health care and cost for this care. The financial requirements for the payment of pensions will grow in the same way. The consequences of these facts will have an impact on the economy of the state. Under the influence of changes there is a real need to reform pension insurance and health care system. Population aging is a process that changes the functioning of society.

The thesis raises that the CAP does not influence directly the way of development of agricultural land structures in the EU Member States, and the possibility of a parallel application of national agricultural policies causes the persistence of the existing differences. At the same time, the concentration of agricultural land patterned on the developments taking place in the EU-15 can be observed in the new Member States. These relationships are shown using synthetic indicators of the agrarian structure in the 25 Member States of the EU for the period of 2003-2010: average farm size, Gini ratio, the Shannon diversity index (SHDI), and using the analysis of convergence.","[Majchrzak, Adam] Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,,adam.majchrzak@ue.poznan.pl,"Majchrzak, Adam/JEO-9607-2023","Majchrzak, Adam/0000-0001-6486-0585",,,,,17,1,2,0,6,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-3-2,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,36,,,,,67,76,,,,,,10,Economics; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography; Public Administration,BB8OR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347134600007,0

The implementation of an effective energy policy encourages the economic growth and prevents significant energy poverty. Development of energy systems depends on many factors, among which the energy price and the rate of return on invested funds should be emphasized. Long-term use of real energy prices will result in a reliable supply of energy in the future. The price of energy for households depends significantly on production costs and energy consumption. Households consume energy for heating, cooling, cooking, domestic hot water, lighting and household appliances. In fact, the biggest item is the cost of heating which depends significantly on the climatological conditions and specific habits of consumers. Developed societies tend to use a variety of devices. As a consequence, energy consumption and price increase continuously. Hence, the cost of energy becomes a significant part of the total costs of an average household. The number of people who cannot pay the cost of energy will inevitably increase in the future in line with rising energy bills and energy poverty. The complex energy poverty issues must be studied in depth because there are many countries in which energy poverty is a major social problem.

In the early 1990s, Finland went through a financial crisis that was the most severe in OECD countries since the Second World War and came to play a major role in the paradigm change. In the crisis, the Ministry of Finance gained a central role as a consensus-building power broker, and formulated a political strategy of national competitiveness, which was adopted as a rationale of power for consensual governments and has been maintained since. We suggest that financial crises can become formative moments in which new ideas are adopted and policies are reformulated. They can also become moments which provide opportunity to overcome citizen opinion. In Finland, the wide popular and party support for the Nordic welfare model was not reflected in the new paradigm.","[Kantola, Anu] Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Kananen, Johannes] Univ Helsinki, Swedish Sch Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Kantola, A (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, Helsinki, Finland.",anu.kantola@helsinki.fi; johannes.kananen@helsinki.fi,,"Kantola, Anu/0000-0001-7868-0956",,,,,78,58,58,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The PIA framework is then applied to understand the relative importance of socio-demographic, built environment, transit service, and socio-psychological factors on public transit use for 279 residents of south Los Angeles, California, a predominately low-income, non-white neighborhood. Confirmatory factor analysis based on 21 survey items resulted in six transit-relevant socio-psychological factors which were used in regression models of two measures of transit use: the probability of using transit at least once in the 7-day observation period, and the mean number of daily transit trips. Our analysis indicates that two PIA constructs, attitudes toward public transportation and concerns about personal safety, significantly improved the model fit and were robust predictors of transit use, independent of built environment factors such as near-residence street network connectivity and transit service level. Results indicate the need for combined policy approaches to increasing transit use that not only enhance transit access, but also target attitudes about transit service and perceptions of crime on transit.

In this paper, we analyse the impact of deregulation in that sector on cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in services. We find that deregulation favours inward M&As in services. This positive effect occurs through two channels: a reduction in entry costs and an increase in investment opportunities. On the other hand, deregulation has an ambiguous impact on outward M&As that depends on the initial level of regulation in the acquiring country. In particular,we provide some evidence of a U-shaped relationship between deregulation and outward M&As in the service sector. In countries that are initially highly deregulated,deregulation fosters outward M&As. Conversely, in situations in which government control is large, privatisation and deregulation are likely to reduce the incentive for firms to engage in cross-border M&A deals.","[Boudier, Fabienne; Lochard, Julie] Univ Paris Est Creteil, ERUDITE, Paris, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Boudier, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est Creteil, ERUDITE, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,35,3,4,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2013,36.0,11,,,SI,,1424,1441,,10.1111/twec.12067,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,248JB,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326694200004,0

Electric two-wheelers have the potential for significant air pollution reductions as an alternative to gasoline-powered motorcycles; however, they have yet to penetrate many Asian markets. While previous research has examined the adoption of cleaner alternatives to gasoline-powered automobiles (e.g., hybrid electric cars), similar work on motorcycle alternatives is lacking. This study uses a stated preference survey of households in Hanoi, Vietnam to analyze adoption of electric two-wheelers, while focusing on the effects of economic incentives (e.g., differential sales taxes and fuel prices) and technological improvements (e.g., more efficient batteries). A choice model is estimated and market shares are calculated for scenarios involving different levels of electric two-wheeler technology, gasoline prices, and sales tax rates. Results indicate that technological improvements and economic incentives, particularly sales taxes, have significant effects on adoption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This has led to the emergence of transportation monocultures, defined as systems where the ability of travelers to use various modes is constrained. In order to create transportation polycultures, alternative modes of transportation must be available and users must perceive them as feasible alternatives to the car. This implies changing the modality style (a predisposition towards certain modes) and increasing the modality (number of alternatives available and feasible for use) of travelers. The objective of this paper is to investigate the modality of respondents to a travel survey in McMaster University, Canada. We define modality as the self-reported number of modes that respondents consider available/feasible for their daily commute, including the chosen mode. Analysis is based on the application of an ordered probit model. The results of our study indicate that modality is influenced by a combination of demographic, attitudinal and spatial/land use variables. With respect to mode of travel, active travelers tend to have a higher modality compared to users of motorized modes. Car users who live in more densely built environments are more likely to report higher levels of modality, whereas density reduces the modality of users of local transit. Distance from McMaster reduces the modality of car and local transit users. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Lavery, T. A.; Paez, A.; Kanaroglou, P.

This raises a series of challenges related to the secondary regulatory measures to correct for market and government imperfections under conditions of competition between entities with different objective functions. In shared governance systems, such as the European Union structural funds, additional tensions are generated by the double role of the public sector as purchaser and potential provider of services. This analysis presents empirical evidence from a transitional context in which quasi-markets have been newly established, based on data from the Romanian human resource development operational programme (RO-SOPHRD) between 2007 and 2011.

The analysis is based on daily data for seven Member States of the eurozone (France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain), starting in autumn 2008 and covering the time period until April 2012. To summarize the findings, the high-profile meetings appear to have only minor effects that ceased quickly. Therefore, it can be concluded that investors consider Europe's economic and political crisis management insufficient and its communication strategy little convincing. While controlling for additional effects, it was found that European Central Bank policy measures may have had short-run effects on bond returns and the exchange rate, but no intended influence on stock prices, except for Italy.","[Smeets, Dieter; Zimmermann, Marco] Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Econ, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Smeets, D (通讯作者)，Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Econ, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",smeetsd@hhu.de,,,,,,,30,16,16,0,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Employing discrete choice models, data from the Ghana Statistical Service (specifically, the fifth round of the Ghana Living Standard Survey) are used for the analysis. In addition to providing a quantitative analysis of the determinants of travel propensity, which had not previously been examined for Ghana, the authors test two hypotheses. First, they assert a three-way (positive negative positive) relationship between age and travel propensity. Second, they argue that the mother's education is more likely to influence the decision to travel than the father's education. The travel patterns of Ghanaians were found to bear the inherent hallmarks of domestic tourism. The authors also observe that, although the degree of travel is low, the frequency of repeat visits is high. Social imperatives dominated the motives for travel, while key socio-demographic variables (especially the respondent's age) were found to influence travel propensities significantly.","[Boakye, Kwaku Adutwum Ayim] Univ Cape Coast, Dept Hospitality & Tourism Management, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Annim, Samuel Kobina; Dasmani, Isaac] Univ Cape Coast, Dept Econ, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Annim, Samuel Kobina] Univ Cent Lancashire, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England",University of Cape Coast; University of Cape Coast; University of Central Lancashire,"Boakye, KAA (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Coast, Dept Hospitality & Tourism Management, Cape Coast, Ghana.",boakye.kwaku@ymail.com; skannim@gmail.com; ikdasmani@gmail.com,"Annim, Samuel Kobina/P-8229-2016","Annim, Samuel Kobina/0000-0002-3449-0912",,,,,35,7,7,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The authors analyse visitors' expenditure at the micro-level, dividing it into expenditure on accommodation and expenditure on food and beverages. The explicative variables taken into account are socio-demographic, economic, psychological and trip related attributes. An ad hoc survey was conducted on the three most famous Christmas markets in the north of Italy in December 2008 and 2009. To achieve their aims, the authors use the robust double-hurdle model. The results indicate that travel purpose, region of origin, perception of the event, length of stay and age are significant factors influencing both the propensity to spend and the amount of money actually spent during visits.

Evidence from Luxembourg,EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Leverage dynamics; Banking sector; GMM estimation; Crisis effect,FINANCIAL CRISIS; MODELS,"We investigate the leverage cycle in Luxembourg's banking sector using individual bank-level data for the period 2003 Q1-2010 Q1. One of our findings is that Luxembourg's banks have a procyclical leverage. This procyclicality is not due to marking-to-market but because Luxembourg's banks are liquidity providers to the EU banking sector. We then empirically investigate the role of bank characteristics as well as real, financial and expectation variables that proxy for macroeconomic conditions in the pre-crisis and crisis period. We find that off-balance sheet exposures have different effects in the pre-crisis and crisis period, and that the share of liquid assets in the portfolio only affects security holdings. As for macroeconomic variables, we find that the Euribor-OIS spread is a significant driver of the build-up in leverage in the pre-crisis period. The reason is that most banks in Luxembourg are either branches or subsidiaries. This makes leverage a less relevant indicator of riskiness for investors. It also implies that in times of liquidity shortages, mother companies or groups demand further liquidity from their branch or subsidiary. The downturn in leverage during the crisis can be accredited to reductions in expectations, which we proxy by an economic sentiment indicator. It can also be explained by increasing bond prices which induce depositors to shift their funds from bank deposits into bonds. We find no important role for GDP growth.","[Giordana, Gaston] Banque Cent Luxembourg, Financial Stabil Dept, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Schumacher, Ingmar] IPAG Business Sch, F-75006 Paris, France; [Schumacher, Ingmar] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91120 Palaiseau, France",IPAG Business School; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Schumacher, I (通讯作者)，Banque Cent Luxembourg, Financial Stabil Dept, 2 Blvd Royal, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",gasto_andres.giordana@bcl.lu; ingmar.schumacher@ipag.fr,,"Schumacher, Ingmar/0000-0003-2339-982X",,,,,11,1,2,0,24,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Some REOs address numerous economic issues, while others have only limited mandates. Some REOs have an independent bureaucracy and a legalized dispute settlement mechanism (DSM), while others do not. What determines this institutional variation? Thinking about these institutions as devices that generate credible commitment to a rule-based regional cooperation, institutionalists maintain that the intensity of commercial ties determine regional institutionalization and institutional independence. A number of studies question this logic and argue that it is na < ve. Empirical evidence on the links between commerce, economic scope, and regional institutions is scant, however. Using an original data set that contains detailed information on the economic activities and institutional structure of twenty-eight REOs over three decades, this paper presents one of the first systematic analyses of these relationships. The empirical analysis indicates that the institutionalist wisdom is right after all. It shows that higher levels of regional trade are associated with greater institutionalization and economic scope, but only if implementation of signed agreements is accounted for, and that regional commerce and greater economic scope are associated with more independent bureaucracies and more legalized DSMs.","[Haftel, Yoram Z.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Int Relat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Haftel, Yoram Z.] Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Haftel, YZ (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Int Relat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",yoram.haftel@gmail.com,,,,,,,78,45,49,1,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

A sample of 2,020 home sales transactions from Fulton County, Georgia, are analyzed in a two-stage least squares, geospatial autoregressive corrected, semi-log hedonic model to test for gender and gender selection effects. Although agent gender seems to play a role in naive models, its role becomes inconclusive as variables controlling for possible price and time on market expectations of the buyers and sellers are introduced to the models. Clear differences in real estate sales prices, time on market and agent incomes across genders are unlikely due to differences in negotiation performance between genders or the mix of genders in a two-agent negotiation. The evidence suggests an interesting alternative to agent performance: that buyers and sellers with different reservation price and time on market expectations, such as those selling foreclosure homes, tend to select agents along gender lines.","[Seagraves, Philip] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Finance & Business Law, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA; [Gallimore, Paul] Univ Reading, Dept Real Estate, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England",University of Wisconsin System; University of Reading,"Seagraves, P (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Finance & Business Law, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",seagravp@uww.edu; p.gallimore@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,14,17,2,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SEP,2013,41.0,3,,,,,600,631,,10.1111/reec.12006,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,217AZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324330200006,0

The model's equilibrium implies that the distribution of bids is truncated at the threshold for participation. I use the model to estimate the cost of participation in Michigan highway procurement auctions. The null hypothesis of zero entry costs is rejected. Using my empirical results, I then construct an estimate of the optimal auction, which employs regular policy tools such as entry fees.

What is the appropriate typological method, how could a suitable typology look? In the Weberian tradition, this article pleads for a method that rigorously distinguishes ideal types from empirical cases. Ideal types (like liberal capitalism) idealise reality by emphasising certain aspects, cases (like Brazilian capitalism) are hybrids more or less approximating the types. Contrasting static classifications that do not allow for gradual change, the latter has to be understood as the movement of cases in the field between the types. Using the state-economy and capital-labour relationships as criteria the article proposes a typology consisting of liberal, statist, corporatist, meso-communitarian and patrimonial types. Liberalism, statism and particularly patrimonialism are relevant for emerging economies. In the second half, the article illustrates its methodological recommendation by indicatively mapping institutional change from 1998 to 2008 in political economies that recently gained importance: the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China), Turkey and a few Eastern European ones. It turns out that most of them liberalised but that this change was rather modest in the BRICs, while it was more significant in Eastern Europe. Yet statism and patrimonialism appear still to be strong.","Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Becker, U (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.u.becker@uva.nl,,,,,,,78,27,27,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The scholarship often regards international organizations as passive transmission belts that merely comply with the demands of their member-states. Scholars who do identify the constitutive role of international organizations consider them to be enthusiastic supporters of the neoliberal project. There were cases, however, when international organizations were opposed to neoliberal reforms imposed from above. This paper draws on the experience of the World Health Organization (WHO) to show that in the process of adapting to the emerging neoliberal regime, international bureaucracies actively restructured this regime in accordance with their own institutional cultures. Some neoliberal prescriptions were successfully transmitted, but others were transformed, with the result that the global regime was hardly monolithic and included elements that were introduced by the international bureaucracies themselves. In developing this argument, the paper identifies the adaptive strategies that allow international bureaucracies, in spite of their vulnerability to external forces, to incorporate their own organizational agendas into what has consequently become a more heterogeneous global neoliberal regime.","Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Chorev, N (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,,,,,,,141,39,46,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

As this secret was guarded more closely, camps found it increasingly difficult to do business without disclosing a state secret: their own location. For months and then years Gulag officials worked around this dilemma, expending considerable efforts. Rather than resolve it, they eventually normalised it.

We conducted two studies to examine three possible processes that might drive groups to be more cooperative than individuals in reducing risks: group risk concern, group cooperation expectation, and pressure to conform to social norms. We found that ex post guilt aversion and ex-post blame avoidance cause group members to be more risk concerned than individuals under uncertainty. These concerns drive groups to choose the cooperation (and risk-reduction) strategy more frequently than individuals. Groups also have higher cooperation expectations for their corresponding groups than individuals have for their corresponding individuals.

An evolutionary economic approach is adopted by introducing decision rules that are applied routinely and an agent-based model is developed. Firms (the agents) can collaborate and create networks for research and development purposes. We have compared three collaboration strategies (A-peer-to-peer complementariness, B-concentration process and C-virtual cooperation networks) that were defined on the basis of literature and on empirical evidence. Strategies are introduced exogenously in the simulation. The aims of this paper are twofold: (i) to analyze the importance of the networking effects; and (ii) to test the differences among collaboration strategies. It was possible to conclude that profit is associated with higher stock of knowledge and with smaller network diameter. In addition, concentration strategies are more profitable and more efficient in transmitting knowledge through the network. These processes reinforce the stock of knowledge and the profit of the firms located in the centers of the networks.","[Campos, Pedro; Brazdil, Pavel] INESC TEC, LIAAD Lab Artificial Intelligence & Decis Support, P-4200465 Oporto, Portugal; [Campos, Pedro; Brazdil, Pavel; Mota, Isabel] Univ Porto, FEP Fac Econ, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Mota, Isabel] CEF UP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",INESC TEC; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Campos, P (通讯作者)，INESC TEC, LIAAD Lab Artificial Intelligence & Decis Support, R Dr Roberto Frias 378, P-4200465 Oporto, Portugal.",pcampos@fep.up.pt,,"Brazdil, Pavel/0000-0002-4720-0486; Mota, Isabel/0000-0001-6101-8261; Campos, Pedro/0000-0001-5495-9434",,,,,43,5,5,0,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Maintaining urban and rural settlements throughout the country has been an important aim of Norwegian regional politics. This paper assesses the impact of second home tourism on local economic development in rural municipalities in Norway. The study is based on data collected as part of an ongoing research project initiated in 2002. Having developed and tested a model consisting of socioeconomic factors and factors associated with the second home as such, the authors examine how and to what extent these factors explain the impact of second home tourism on local economic growth. They find that the size and standard of the recreational home are important factors in explaining variations in annual consumption by second home owners, and more so in rural communities with a broad and well-structured trading activity than in areas with a weaker trading structure. It appears that urban recreational tourism based on second homes of high standard offers the best potential for sustainable local rural economic growth. Based on their findings, the authors also discuss possible local government strategies to achieve economic growth through second home tourism.","[Velvin, Jan; Krogh, Erling] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Velvin, Jan; Kvikstad, Tor Martin; Drag, Eivind] Buskerud Univ Coll, Dept Business & Social Sci, N-3603 Kongsberg, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University College of Southeast Norway,"Velvin, J (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Univ Tunet 3, NO-1432 As, Norway.",jan.velvin@hibu.no; tor.martin.kvikstad@hibu.no; eivind.drag@gmail.com; erling.krogh@umb.no,"Alves, Juliano/GQO-7605-2022",,,,,,56,18,19,3,58,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

While values and beliefs retain their high relevance, today's enlightened societies also tend to rest their aspirations and decisions on the actual facts and on a sober assessment of possible courses of events emerging from different choices. Given the complexity of modern life, it is by now well understood that this strategy requires objective, comprehensive and accessible statistical reporting. Today, the desire to provide such a valuable basis for individual decisions and policy-making finds one of its most important expressions in the international debate on GDP and beyond. In contrast to similar efforts displayed in previous decades, the current projects emphasize sustainability issues and focus on the accessibility of the information, using modern tools of measurement and presentation. Yet, there is ample evidence that even by the mid-19th century economists aspired to use the objectifying power of statistical analysis as an instrument to improve policy-making and to achieve societal progress. Many of the approaches entertained today have thus to be viewed as an extension of attempts started at that time.","[Moore, Nils Aus Dem] RWI, Berlin, Germany; [Schmidt, Christoph M.] RWI, Essen, Germany; [Schmidt, Christoph M.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Schmidt, Christoph M.] CEPR, London, England",Ruhr University Bochum; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Moore, NAD (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Buro Berlin, Hess Str 10, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",nils.ausdemmoore@rwi-essen.de; praesident@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,60,2,2,0,8,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This paper investigates the relationships between neighborhood-level sociodemographic context, individual level sociodemographic characteristics and walking for leisure and transport. Data from two community-based studies of adults (n = 550) were used to determine the association between the Area Sociodemographic Environment (ASDE), calculated from U.S. Census variables, and individual-level SES as potential correlates of walking behavior. Descriptive statistics, mean comparisons and Pearson's correlations coefficients were used to assess bivariate relationships. Generalized estimating equations were used to model the relationship between ASDE, as quartiles, and walking behavior. Adjusted models suggest adults engage in more minutes of walking for transportation and less walking for leisure in the most disadvantaged compared to the least disadvantaged neighborhoods but adding individual level demographics and SES eliminated the significant results. However, when models were stratified for free or reduced cost lunch, of those with children who qualified for free or reduced lunch, those who lived in the wealthiest neighborhoods engaged in 10.7 min less of total walking per day compared to those living in the most challenged neighborhoods (p < 0.001). Strategies to increase walking for transportation or leisure need to take account of individual level socioeconomic factors in addition to area-level measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In times of systemic crisis, such as dangerous anthropogenic climate change, perverse resilience (for example the structural power of fossil fuel interests in the global economy) can threaten overall Earth system stability. Critical political economic analysis recognises climate change as a threat with significant political economic characteristics and implications. However, key dimensions of climate change as a globally coherent phenomenon, including the important implications of Earth system dynamism and non-linear change, can remain unrecognised, mischaracterised or underestimated. In contrast, resilience approaches describe social-ecological systems but neglect the significance of norms and power relations in human societies. This article builds theory by linking key concepts hegemony and resilience from neo-Gramscian political economic analysis and resilience approaches to social-ecological systems. Our objective is to generate a new conceptual framework to improve understanding of the role of politics in social-ecological systems. We use climate change and its mitigation to demonstrate the new framework's potential.","[Phelan, Liam] Univ Newcastle, GradSch & Discipline Geog & Environm Studies, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Henderson-Sellers, Ann] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Taplin, Ros] Univ New S Wales, Australian Ctr Sustainable Min Practices, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia",University of Newcastle; Macquarie University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Phelan, L (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, GradSch & Discipline Geog & Environm Studies, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",Liam.Phelan@newcastle.edu.au,"Phelan, Liam/AAS-9320-2020; Phelan, Liam/G-1653-2013","Phelan, Liam/0000-0002-9306-3216; Phelan, Liam/0000-0002-9306-3216",,,,,122,41,44,1,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Using a polynomial distributed lag model, the long-run elasticity of demand with respect to visibility in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park (GSMNP) was estimated. The GSMNP, the most visited national park in the USA, has significant air quality issues. Although the park has observed some fluctuation in visitation, the results indicate that the demand for visitation in general and for specific recreational visits are mean reverting and highly stable. Further, park visitation in a given month is significantly affected by the cumulative effect of the visibility condition in both the current and preceding months. Estimated elasticity reveals that a programme aiming to improve the average visibility by 10% (5.5 km) from the current level could result in an increase of roughly one million recreational visits annually, and that the increase would be higher for overnight visitors than for day visitors because of overnight visitors' relatively elastic demand. This demand model could assist park managers in their planning as they weigh the anticipated benefits of a visibility improvement programme against increased visitation and its associated costs.","[Poudyal, Neelam C.; Green, Gary T.] Univ Georgia, Nat Resource Recreat & Tourism, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30605 USA; [Paudel, Bamadev] Nepal Rastra Bank, Kathmandu, Nepal",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Poudyal, NC (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Nat Resource Recreat & Tourism, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, 180 East Green St, Athens, GA 30605 USA.",npoudyal@uga.edu; ggreen@warnell.uga.edu,,,,,,,37,50,55,0,23,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

It begins by outlining a rational choice framework conceptualizing implementation as a three-stage game with key roles for an enforcer, domestic policy-makers and implementing actors. This model is then applied to the case of transposition and implementation of the EU rules regarding cultural heritage in Bulgaria. Different implementation outcomes stemming from one and the same formal policy are found. To explain the variation of implementation outcomes, the theorized model is applied and it is found that, given the high levels of polarization between political decision-makers, the implementing actors have broad discretion to apply different informal policies. The analysis of implementation also shows that under these conditions implementing players have followed their normative orientations to apply different policies as if they live in parallel universes of implementation.","[Dimitrova, Antoaneta; Steunenberg, Bernard] Leiden Univ, NL-2511 VA The Hague, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Dimitrova, A (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Inst Publ Adm, Schouwburgstr 2, NL-2511 VA The Hague, Netherlands.",dimitrova@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,"Dimitrova, Antoaneta/H-9115-2019; Dimitrova, Antoaneta/H-3716-2013","Dimitrova, Antoaneta/0000-0002-7592-0587; Steunenberg, Bernard/0000-0003-1028-9867",,,,,35,18,19,1,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In such cases factor methods have been traditionally used, but recent work using a particular prior suggests that Bayesian VAR methods can forecast better. In this paper, we consider a range of alternative priors which have been used with small VARs, discuss the issues which arise when they are used with medium and large VARs and examine their forecast performance using a US macroeconomic dataset containing 168 variables. We find that Bayesian VARs do tend to forecast better than factor methods and provide an extensive comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches. Typically, we find that the simple Minnesota prior forecasts well in medium and large VARs, which makes this prior attractive relative to computationally more demanding alternatives. Our empirical results show the importance of using forecast metrics based on the entire predictive density, instead of relying solely on those based on point forecasts.

The economic geography structure is built on Fujita et al. (1999)5 racetrack economy. Workers choose optimally what to consume at each period, as well as which spatial itinerary to follow in the geographical space. The spatial extent of the resulting agglomerations increases with the taste for variety and the expenditure share on manufactured goods, and decreases with transport costs. Because forward-looking agents anticipate the future formation of agglomerations, they are more responsive to spatial utility differentials than myopic agents. As a consequence, the emerging agglomerations are larger under perfect foresight spatial adjustments than under myopic ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It defines demoicracy' as a Union of peoples, understood both as states and as citizens, who govern together but not as one', and argues that the concept is best understood as a third way, distinct from both national and supranational versions of single demos polities. The concept of demoicracy' can serve both as an analytical lens for the European Union-as-is and as a normative benchmark, but one which cannot simply be inferred from its praxis. Instead, the article deploys a normative-inductive' approach according to which the EU's normative core transnational non-domination and transnational mutual recognition is grounded on what the EU still seeks to escape. Such norms need to be protected and perfected if the EU is to live up to its demoicratic nature. The article suggests ten tentative guiding principles for the EU to continue turning these norms into practice.","[Nicolaidis, Kalypso] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Nicolaïdis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",kalypso.nicolaidis@sant.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,65,204,208,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using the classic case of the gold standard, it shows how state intervention came to be shaped by considerations of state power and diverged considerably from the traditional emphasis on free markets and stable conditions of investments. As I argue, the gold standard was constructed through political struggles over monetary governance which involved significant constraints for capitalist investors. Its institutions helped establish a new structure for exerting control over finance. By resituating the gold standard in a broader historical perspective, I show how nineteenth-century monetary governance, far from leading to a retreat of the state, established in fact the foundations of a new form of state intervention: modern central banking.","Univ Sussex, Brighton BN19SN, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Knafo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN19SN, E Sussex, England.",s.knafo@sussex.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,3,3,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Using detailed data on the positions of hedge funds and swap dealers from 2005-2009, we find little evidence that herding destabilizes the crude oil futures market. To the contrary, herding among speculative traders is negatively correlated with contemporaneous volatility and does not lead next-day volatility. Our impulse-response analysis shows that market regulators should monitor herding since a shock to herding among all groups may lead to price changes, and, in the case of hedge funds, may lead to increased volatility.

We also document that investment decisions exhibit strong, pure state dependence and are also significantly affected by initial conditions.

This paper firstly discusses the expression and extraction of Haar face feature and then using integral image accelerates the feature calculation speed. Then the definition and design of weak classifier are researched. In training process, the weights of several weak classifiers are constantly adjusted and at last, the generated classifier is called strong classifier. At the same time, the error of strong classifier can be limited in some certain range. Finally, the flow chart of AdaBoost algorithm is given. The results show that the precision of strong classifier obtained by AdaBoost is related with the number of weak classifier. If improving the precision, the number of weak classifier will be added, but at the same time, the calculation speed is reduced. On the contrary, the recognition effect will be degraded.

Using DCC multivariate GARCH models, it provides new evidence on four research questions: 1) Are macroeconomic factors relevant in explaining returns of energy and non-energy commodities? 2) Is financial speculation significantly related to returns in futures markets? 3) Are there significant relationships among returns, either in their mean or variance, across different markets? 4) Is speculation in one market affecting returns in other markets? Results suggest that the S&P 500 index and the exchange rate significantly affect returns. Financial speculation, proxied by Working's T index, is poorly significant in modelling returns of commodities. Moreover, spillovers between commodities are present and the conditional correlations among energy and agricultural commodities display a spike around 2008.","[Manera, Matteo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Manera, Matteo; Nicolini, Marcella; Vignati, Ilaria] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy; [Nicolini, Marcella] Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; Fondazione Mattei; University of Pavia,"Manera, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy.",matteo.manera@unimib.it; marcella.nicolini@unipv.it; ilaria.vignati@feem.it,"Nicolini, Marcella/ABA-7959-2020; Nicolini, Marcella/ABE-2618-2020","Nicolini, Marcella/0000-0001-9034-2562; Nicolini, Marcella/0000-0001-9034-2562; Manera, Matteo/0000-0003-1220-8995",,,,,42,39,40,5,63,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,34.0,3,,,SI,,55,81,,10.5547/01956574.34.3.4,0.0,,,27,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,173NB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321085100004,0

However, in real-world multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems some criterion might be in conflict with other criteria, but this problem is completely neglected in the standard AHP. The aim of the article is to propose a new method for the evaluation of criteria weights based both on their pair-wise comparisons and the degree of a conflict/agreement among criteria. This degree for each pair of alternatives is expressed by a value from [-1,1] interval, where positive values denote an agreement, while negative values denote a conflict, and all the degrees form a conflict matrix. Information from the conflict matrix is converted into criteria (sub) weights, and the final weights of criteria are given as an aggregation of weights from pair-wise comparisons and from the conflict matrix.

To estimate the degree of banking concentration was used the concentration ratio and Herfindahl-Hirschman index and for estimation of the cost and profit efficiency of the Czech banks was applied the Stochastic Frontier Approach. In the Czech banking sector it was found a slight decrease in concentration during the analyzed period. The efficiency of the Czech banks increased in this period. Using a Johansen cointegration test the positive relationship between concentration and cost and profit efficiency was estimated in the Czech banking sector. This result confirms the efficiency hypothesis. These findings suggest that the increase of banking concentration will contribute to efficiency of the Czech banks.,"[Repkova, Iveta] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,repkova@opf.slu.cz,"Repkova, Iveta/ABG-2947-2020; Repkova, Iveta/ABF-7018-2020; Paleckova, Iveta/J-6439-2015","Repkova, Iveta/0000-0002-0810-853X; Repkova, Iveta/0000-0002-0282-9977; Paleckova, Iveta/0000-0003-2381-0738",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,785,790,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000133,0

It implies that the standard deviation of annual premium paid by a policyholder is greater than zero. As risk is usually measured by means of the standard deviation of the correspondent random variable, the insurance company applying a bonus-malus system does not take the entire risk of the total coverage of all the damages the policyholder caused. A part of the risk carries a policyholder him or herself. So the risk is divided between the policyholder and the insurance company. It is possible to divide the risk according to the Schnieper covariance model of risk distribution. Czech insurance companies have started using bonus-malus system in automobile insurance systematically since 2000. In this paper the Schnieper covariance model of risk distribution is used to investigate the ability of bonus-malus systems currently applied on Czech automobile insurance market to carry the risk to the policyholder. The insurance companies are ranked by the value of the risk that is being carried to the policyholder through their present bonus-malus system. The paper furthermore addresses potential development of the risk distribution in the future.","[Stolin, Radek] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Math, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava,,radek.stolin@vspj.cz,,,,,,,3,1,1,0,0,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,868,874,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000147,0

The development of time-varying structural parameters is identified using the second order approximation of a nonlinear DSGE model. The model is estimated with the use of unscented particle filter. It is the prime goal of this paper to identify the most important changes of the structural parameters and interpret them in terms of behaviour of representative economic agents. We focus on the subset of parameters that are generally considered deep, i.e. time-invariant. Changes of these parameters during the period of global recession would imply that the structure of the economy together with its behaviour changed as a consequence of the recession.
