Democracy may be conducive to reform, as politicians embrace growth-enhancing reforms to win elections. On the other hand, authoritarian regimes may not worry as much about public opinion and could undertake reforms that are painful in the short run but bring long-term benefits. We test these alternative hypotheses, using data on regulatory reforms from the World Bank's Doing Business database. The results provide mixed support for the hypothesis that democracy is good for regulatory reforms.

The regulator faces an asymmetric information problem: the firm knows current compliance costs, but the regulator does not. Both the regulator and the firm are uncertain about future costs. In our basic framework, the regulator may not offer payments to the firm; we show that the regulator can vary the strength of regulation over time to induce the firm to reveal its costs and increase welfare. In the optimal mechanism, the regulator offers stronger (weaker) regulation in the first period and weaker (stronger) regulation in the second period if the firm reports low (high) compliance costs in the first period. Low cost firms expect compliance costs to rise in the future, and thus prefer weaker regulation in the second period. High cost firms expect costs to fall in the future and thus prefer regulation which becomes stricter over time. Thus the regulator offers the low (high) cost firms slightly weaker (stronger) regulation in the second period in exchange for much stronger (weaker) regulation in the first period, thereby timing the regulation. If the regulator can make payments, then the optimal mechanism to some degree times the regulation as long as a positive marginal cost of funds exists. If the marginal cost of funds is high enough, then under the optimal mechanism the regulator will not use payments and use our timing mechanism exclusively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The framework suggests that good macroeconomic outcomes in open economies are possible by focusing inflation targeting that is implemented by a Taylor type rule, a rule that in equilibrium is reflected in the exchange rate as an asset price. Optimal monetary policy will not be able deliver a stationary ('stable') nominal exchange rate - let alone a fixed exchange rate or one that remains inside a target zone - because, absent a commitment device, optimal monetary can't deliver a stationary domestic price level. Another feature in the data for inflation targeting countries that is consistent with monetary policy via Taylor type rule is that it will tend push the nominal exchange rate in the opposite direction from PPP in response to an 'inflation' shock the 'bad news god news' result of Clarida and Waldman (2008.

Policy instruments include public provision of LTC as well as a subsidy on private insurance. The subsidy scheme may be linear or nonlinear. For the linear part we consider an arbitrary number of types, characterized by earnings and survival probabilities. In the nonlinear part, society consists of three types: poor, middle class and rich. The first type is too poor to provide for dependence; the middle class type purchases private insurance and the high income type is self-insured. The main questions are at what level LTC should be provided to the poor and whether it is desirable to subsidize private LTC for the middle class. Interestingly, the results are not totally similar under both linear and nonlinear schemes. First, whereas in the linear case a subsidy of private LTC insurance is desirable, it is not in the nonlinear case (at least at the margin). Second, the desirability of public provision of LTC services depends on the way the income tax is restricted. In the linear case, it may be desirable only if no demogrant (uniform lump-sum transfer) is available. In the nonlinear case, public provision is desirable when the income tax is sufficiently restricted. Specifically, this is the case when the income is subject only to a proportional payroll tax while the LTC reimbursement policy can be nonlinear.","[Cremer, Helmuth; Pestieau, Pierre] Toulouse Sch Econ IDEI, GREMAQ, Toulouse, France; [Cremer, Helmuth; Pestieau, Pierre] Inst Univ France, Toulouse, France; [Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Liege, CREPP, Liege, Belgium; [Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Institut Universitaire de France; University of Liege,"Pestieau, P (通讯作者)，Univ Liege, CREPP, Liege, Belgium.",helmuth.cremer@tse-fr.eu; p.pestieau@ulg.ac.be,,,,,,,16,20,20,2,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In contrast to most of its European neighbors and the United States, Germany experienced almost no increase in unemployment during the Great Recession, despite a sharp decline in GDP in 2008 and 2009. Germany's exports reached an all-time record of $1.738 trillion in 2011, which is roughly equal to half of Germany's GDP, or 7.7 percent of world exports. Even the euro crisis seems not to have been able to stop Germany's strengthening economy and employment. How did Germany, with the fourth-largest GDP in the world transform itself from the sick man of Europe to an economic superstar in less than a decade?

Yet many real life situations involve insiders, who are directly affected by a dilemma, and outsiders, who may be harmed if the insiders overcome the dilemma. The quintessential illustration is oligopoly. If insiders overcome their dilemma and collude, this inflicts harm on the opposite market side. In our experiment, harm on outsiders significantly reduces conditional cooperation of insiders. We can exclude that this result is driven by inequity aversion, reciprocity or efficiency seeking.

And, if the answer is yes, which specific reform steps should the government undertake? In this study we attempt to shed light on these questions by examining experiences of 80 countries during the period 1980-2010. Empirical analyses reveal that the growth effect of financial repression is insignificant among low-income economies, significantly negative among middle-income economies and significantly positive among high-income economies. Furthermore, for the middle-income group, repressive policies on credit, bank entry, securities market and the capital account significantly inhibit economic growth. In the meantime, law and order promotes growth among all income groups, while democracy has no impact whatsoever. We also validate these findings through a range of robustness checks. These findings offer important policy implications for China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, it reconstructs the central point of his work (which saw him involved in debates with economists such as Blaug, Bliss, Hahn, Hollander, Joan Robinson and Samuelson) namely, the development of Sraffa's work, both regarding the critique of the marginalist theory of value and distribution, and the revival of the surplus approach of Smith, Ricardo and Marx. It also reconstructs a characteristic which was a constant of Garegnani's activity that is, his attention to concrete economic phenomena and the search for economic policies able to assure high levels of employment and the wellbeing of the greatest part of the population. These two traits of Garegnani's work are traceable since his first contributions to economic theory namely, from his 1958 PhD thesis entitled A Problem in the Theory of Capital from Ricardo to Wicksell to his 1962 work for Svimez, where Garegnani faced the issue of how to achieve a higher rate of growth in a case like that of Italy, characterised by large areas with high labour underemployment. The two traits were of course strictly interconnected, as, for instance, the suggestion in favour of Keynesian economic policies, or the criticism (especially in the absence of full employment of resources) to Pareto optimality and its implications for policy analysis could not but pass through a critique of the marginalist theory and the simultaneous clarification and development of an alternative theoretical approach.","Roma Tre Univ, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Levrero, ES (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Rome, Italy.",,,"LEVRERO, Enrico Sergio/0000-0003-4529-4981",,,,,73,1,1,0,6,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

I adjust for this mismatch, and in so doing, incorporate natural capital. I also treat factor shares as variables, not constant parameters. To accommodate these adjustments, I carry out a development accounting analysis using translog multilateral indices of outputs, inputs and productivity. Results reveal that the correction for the mismatch between physical capital and its share, which is the weight assigned to the physical capital input in development accounting, reduces the variation in output per worker explained by observables by as much as 15 percentage points relative to the standard baseline. Most of this reduction is due to a decline in the explanatory power of physical capital per worker. Natural capital per worker, which is usually ignored, is found to explain up to 7.2% of the variation in cross-country output per worker. Variation in factor shares, also omitted from most studies, explains up to 6.3% of the variation in cross-country output per worker, which is nearly half as much as all observables together explain.

We show that there are positive balanced-growth rate and a debt-to-GDP ratio that depend on deep parameters such as the income tax rate and the standard deviation of the growth rate of private and public capital. Investment and fiscal shocks influence the mean and variance of the growth rate and the debt dependency rate through portfolio changes and capital accumulation. In particular, an increase in the risk of private investment destabilizes the economy and reduces the mean growth rate if the portfolio change is drastic, and this increase in risk increases the debt-to-GDP ratio. In contrast, an increase in the income tax rate stabilizes the economy, increases the mean growth rate, and has a positive or negative effect on the debt-to-GDP ratio according to the ratio of public to private capital if the income tax rate is sufficiently small.

Using a multistage data envelopment analysis model at the subnational level, several categories of production factors are explored: intermediate demand, labour, capital, as well as taxes and subsidies. The results emphasise South Africa's weak infrastructure and the failure to effectively promote stability in managing factor inputs. The results further illustrate that industry scale efficiency for water and electricity are poorest across all provinces, highlighting the current water and energy supply concerns in South Africa and problem areas associated with the National Development Program.","[Van Heerden, Chris] Sch Econ, ZA-2531 Potchefstroom, North West, South Africa; [Van Heerden, Chris; Rossouw, Riaan] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, North West, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Van Heerden, C (通讯作者)，Sch Econ, 11 Hoffman St, ZA-2531 Potchefstroom, North West, South Africa.",chris.vanheerden@nwu.ac.za,"Van Heerden, Chris/ABF-5250-2020; van Heerden, Chris/N-5218-2015","Van Heerden, Chris/0000-0001-8074-0719; van Heerden, Chris/0000-0001-8074-0719; Rossouw, Riaan/0000-0003-1761-6488",,,,,60,4,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

To address the possible endogeneity between PJI and the crisis indicator, we use relevant instrumental variables and compute the results using two stage least square (2SLS). We found that PJI in China were significantly correlated with the 2008 global financial crisis despite its high economic growth and frequent government interventions. Income and wealth reductions emanating from the crisis were also significantly correlated with PJI. Government's expansionary policies appear to be effective in ameliorating the workers' PJI. Social developments such as provisions of social security and income protection measures could also be used to reduce Chinese workers' job insecurity perception. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

On the one hand, the money supply Granger-causes output when the economy is overheated or during recession, whilst it has no significant effect on output when the economy grows moderately; the short term interest rate only has temporary effect on output, suggesting the ineffectiveness of the interest rate based monetary policy. On the other hand, output only affects the money supply in short periods, whilst the feedback of output on the short term interest rate has distinct regime switching features, which implies that the nonlinear Taylor rule targeting on the short term interest rate is more appropriate than the McCallum rule in describing China's monetary policy reaction function.

J,"Witt, U",,,,"Witt, Ulrich",,,The future of evolutionary economics: why the modalities of explanation matter,JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DARWINISM; ANALOGY,"Far from inspiring that paradigmatic shift in economics that was envisioned by its early proponents, 'evolutionary' economics today represents a patchwork of unconnected theories and topics. In other disciplines, evolutionary thinking has induced a paradigm shift, resulting from the adoption of the Darwinian paradigm extended by hypotheses about cultural evolution. Concerning economics, however, even a preliminary discourse on the potential of this paradigm for future theorizing remains controversial. The present paper therefore focuses on the methodological implications of the paradigm. It is shown that hitherto unnoticed common ground can be identified underlying the diversity of approaches to evolutionary economics. It rests in the modalities of causal explanations germane to the Darwinian paradigm. Understanding these modalities also makes it possible to distinguish evolutionary from non-evolutionary research irrespective of the specific theories and topics concerned. The argument is illustrated for the exemplary case of institutional economics.","[Witt, Ulrich] Max Planck Inst Econ, Jena, Germany; [Witt, Ulrich] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Gold Coast, Australia",Max Planck Society; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Witt, U (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Jena, Germany.",witt@evoecon.mpg.de,,,,,,,81,19,19,1,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Evidence from historical religious identification,APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,religion; CSR; corporate social responsibility; religious piety; instrumental variable; M14; G30; Z12,MATTER,"We explore the effect of religious piety on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Prior research links religion to honesty and risk aversion. Accordingly, religion induces managers to be more honest and likely view as opportunistic and unethical an exploitation of other stakeholders. Risk aversion also implies that managers are unlikely to take advantage of other stakeholders as stakeholders can take retaliatory actions against them. Religion therefore motivates managers to treat other stakeholders and the society at large more favourably, resulting in stronger CSR. Our evidence, based on over 17 000 observations across 16 years, shows that religious piety leads to stronger CSR. However, this is the case only when religious piety is sufficiently strong, that is, when it is beyond a certain threshold. To draw a causal inference, we use as our instruments religious piety in the distant past, that is from 1971 to 1952. Religious piety from decades ago is unlikely correlated with current CSR, except through its impact on contemporaneous piety. Our instrumental-variable analysis shows that the effect of religion on CSR is likely causal.","[Chatjuthamard-Kitsabunnarat, Pattanaporn] Chulalongkorn Univ, Sasin Grad Inst Business Adm, Bangkok, Thailand; [Jiraporn, Pornsit] Penn State Univ, Great Valley Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA; [Jiraporn, Pornsit] NIDA, Bangkok, Thailand; [Tong, Shenghui] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chulalongkorn University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); Central University of Finance & Economics,"Chatjuthamard-Kitsabunnarat, P (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Sasin Grad Inst Business Adm, Bangkok, Thailand.",pattanaporn.chatjuthamard@sasin.edu,,"Chatjuthamard, Pattanaporn/0000-0003-1479-1969",,,,,14,20,20,1,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In the case of replacement noise, where the senders observe the true state with high probability, we show this under mild assumptions, for both unbounded and large bounded state spaces. In the case of continuous noise, where senders observe a signal distributed continuously over a small interval around the true state, we establish this for unbounded state spaces. The results imply that when there are multiple experts from whom to solicit information, if the state space is large, then even when the state is observed imperfectly, there are communication equilibria that are strictly better for the principal than delegating the decision right to one of the experts.

We also show that under-entry always holds under business-enhancing competition. This confirms the general intuition given by Mankiw and Whinston, which does not rely on the convexity of the cost function. The same result is shown to extend (at a similar level of generality) to the comparison between free entry and the first best socially optimal solution, irrespective of business-stealing. Three illustrative examples are provided, one showing that the second-best and free entry solutions may actually coincide. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The characterization we propose, although differently formulated, is conceptually the same as Perea's and so is the generalization of back-ward induction. The novelty of this contribution lies in the models that we use, which are dynamic, behavioral models where strategies play no role and the only beliefs that are specified are the actual beliefs of the players at the time of choice..

Among any other alternative models nested to the initial VAR model, this less restrictive modeling strategy produces the smallest log determinant of the residual covariance matrix adjusted by degrees of freedom. Each equation of the finally derived subset VAR model has a maximized (R) over bar (2) adjusted by degrees of freedom in samples and consequently a minimized 1-step-ahead prediction error in out-of-samples. The applicability of this modeling strategy is excised to the case of a bivariate VAR model for output growth and inflation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A decline in offshoring costs affects intrafirm and intrasectoral reallocation of jobs in the differentiated-good sector through a selection effect, a productivity effect, and a job-relocation effect. The key parameters determining the impact of offshoring on jobs at various margins, as well as on the economy-wide unemployment rate, are the elasticity of substitution between inputs, the elasticity of substitution between varieties of differentiated goods, and the elasticity of demand for differentiated goods as a whole. Changes in search frictions affect unemployment both directly and through their interaction with offshoring. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our model provides a reason why Coops are less prone than PMFs to pay variable bonuses to their managers. We show that this occurs under price competition when in equilibrium the Coop prefers to pay a flat wage to its manager relying instead on her intrinsic motivation, whereas the profit-maximizing rival adopts a variable, high-powered incentive scheme. The main rationale is that, by recruiting a manager whose preferences are aligned with the company goals (e.g., a consumer-owner), the Coop is per se highly expansionary in term of output. Therefore, the Coop does not need to rely on an externally hired manager who sets prices aggressively to expand market share and quantity. Furthermore, adopting a monetary reward based on sales and profits leads to distorted incentives with respect to the Coop's goal, which after all is the welfare of its members.","[Kopel, Michael] Graz Univ, Dept Org & Econ Inst, Graz, Austria; [Marini, Marco A.] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Marini, Marco A.] CREI, Rome, Italy",University of Graz; Sapienza University Rome,"Marini, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",michael.kopel@uni-graz.at; marini@dis.uniroma1.it,"Kopel, Michael/AAF-1301-2020; Marini, Marco/P-7052-2019","Marini, Marco/0000-0002-7452-614X",,,,,82,16,16,0,21,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We compare the gains from trade that would occur after the adoption of the euro against the costs of relinquishing monetary policy, both conventional and unconventional. We also study the effects of the changes in the corporate risk premium observed during the recent crisis. We find that in tranquil times, when the risk premium volatility is low, the net welfare gain of joining the monetary union is 2.4 percent of life-time consumption. During financial crises, when there is a sharp increase in the volatility of the risk premium, joining a monetary union would lead to a net welfare loss of 2.2 percent of life-time consumption. The welfare analysis underscores the importance of financial stability to sustain a monetary union over time. (c) 2014 Elsevier BM.

It finds, first, that unlike the legislative intention to revise the KCmC in 1991 and 2007, there have been long and continuing arguments on the effects of the issuance of bills of lading without receipt or shipment among scholars and case decisions. This is not only because the revised provisions do not directly deal with or clearly mention the scope of the application of both causal and stipulatory attributes, but the scholars have also interpreted them to either deny or admit the causal or stipulatory attributes. It argues that one should not deny in principle the causal attribute as an inherent nature of a bill of lading regardless of who holds it, whereas, as clearly stated in the KCmC, it is only limited in favor of the third party holder in good faith in order to enhance the negotiability of a bill of lading in practice.

We embed a static setting in a dynamic process; Over time agents revise their strategies based on the improvements that the new strategy profile offers them. In addition to the optimization process, there are persistent random shocks on agents' utility that potentially lead to switching to suboptimal strategies.

There are many fans of anime and manga, creating a community known as otaku world. However, Japanese anime and manga have gained popularity in Western countries as well as in Japan. This paper attempts to ascertain the determinants of watching anime in Japan based on individual-level data from Japan. Despite the growth in the number of adult anime fans, children are still more likely to watch anime than adults are. Hence, this study investigates how adults are influenced by the presence of their children. After controlling for individual characteristics, it was found that people are more likely to watch anime when they have children aged less than 12 years who have not yet entered junior high school. Such an effect is larger for parents who belong to an older generation where people are less likely to prefer anime. This implies that the externality coming from children results in parents watching anime. The findings of this study show that externalities from surrounding people play a critical role in enlarging the market of modern cultural goods representing Cool Japan..","Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Sawara Ku, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan",,"Yamamura, E (通讯作者)，Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Sawara Ku, 6-2-92 Nishijin, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan.",cyl02111@nifty.com,,,,,,,44,3,5,5,63,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

However, all previous experiments have overlooked the fact that outside the lab committee members are allowed to - and do - engage in sometimes intense communication processes prior to voting on a proposal. We conduct an experimental test of the Baron-Ferejohn model in which we allow committee members to engage in unrestricted cheap-talk communication before a proposal is submitted. We find that proposers extract a significantly higher share of resources when communication is allowed. Communication increases proposer power through two channels. First, it mitigates the uncertainty surrounding the amount a coalition member is willing to accept. Second, it allows potential coalition members to compete for a place in the coalition by lowering this stated price. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

If a firm's marginal cost is lower than that of its rival, then this firm (its rival) is referred to as the more (less) efficient firm. Under each mode of competition, there are three types of equilibria: blockaded-entry, deterred-entry, and accommodated-entry. Moreover, the presence of R&D investment makes it harder for the less efficient firm to survive. Cournot competition entails a unique equilibrium, whereas Bertrand competition may yield two equilibria. It is harder for the less efficient firm to survive under Bertrand competition than under Cournot competition. Versus Cournot competition, Bertrand competition yields higher industry output, and it shifts production from the less efficient firm to the more efficient firm. This result, together with the known size effect, explains the following three findings. First, the more efficient firm has a normal output ranking, whereas the less efficient firm may demonstrate an output reversal. Second, the more efficient firm may demonstrate a R&D reversal, whereas the less efficient firm has a normal R&D ranking (its Cournot R&D effort exceeds its Bertrand R&D effort). Third, Bertrand competition is more welfare-efficient than Cournot competition.","[Chang, Ming Chung; Ho, Yan-Ching] Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Chungli 32001, Taiwan",National Central University,"Chang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, 300 Chung Ta Rd, Chungli 32001, Taiwan.",mcchang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,17,4,4,1,18,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Evidence is mounting that consumers in specific socio-economic groups express lower satisfaction levels than their peers, at least, in some utility markets. Seeing this as part of their remit to protect consumer welfare, governments and international organizations are exploring possible demand-side policy responses with the intention of ameliorating lower satisfaction levels of these groups of consumers. However, more information on the precise relationships between satisfaction and consumers' socio-economic background is required if policy is to be proportional and effective. This paper provides new empirical knowledge on this topic by contrasting consumers' stated and revealed preferences for five utility services (electricity, gas, fixed and cellular telephony and Internet) across twelve European countries. We find strong evidence that consumers' socio-economic characteristics matter: consumers with lower levels of education, the elderly and those not employed exhibit particular expenditure patterns on, and lower satisfaction levels with, some utility services. However, this relationship is uneven and depends on the socio-economic category and service in question. We conclude by highlighting five findings which may be of use to policy-makers when considering whether demand-side regulatory policies are required.","[Clifton, Judith; Diaz-Fuentes, Daniel; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Marcos] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Clifton, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Av Castros SN, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",judith.clifton@unican.es; diazd@unican.es; marcos.fernandez@unican.es,"Fernandez-Gutierrez, Marcos/AAY-3954-2020; Díaz-Fuentes, Daniel/K-8324-2014; Clifton, Judith/E-4462-2013","Fernandez-Gutierrez, Marcos/0000-0002-4000-9283; Díaz-Fuentes, Daniel/0000-0002-6290-2363; Clifton, Judith/0000-0001-6081-6800",,,,,60,24,24,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Several of these proposals require healthcare providers to employ a value-based purchasing program (also known as pay-for-performance [P4P]). However, the way in which existing payment structures impact physician behavior is unclear and therefore, predicting how well P4P will perform is difficult. To understand the impact physician payment structures have on physician behavior, I approximate the physician-patient relationship in a real-effort laboratory experiment. I study several prominent physician payment structures including fee-for-service, capitation, salary, and P4P. I find that physicians are intrinsically motivated to provide high quality care and relying exclusively on extrinsic incentives to motivate physicians is detrimental to the quality of care and costly for the healthcare industry.

It was believed that China's free silver standard acted as a natural check on the excessive issuing of notes by warlords and local governments. This consensus view, however, overlooks the fact that the silver standard was inherently unstable because it left no room for monetary policy to stabilize output and inflation. This article employs a formal structural model to show that a fiat currency unlinked to fluctuations in the price of silver that allows government to implement self-adjusting monetary policies would further stabilize China's output and inflation. If the external price level is unstable, we cannot keep both our own price level and our exchanges stable. And we are compelled to choose. ... Our conclusions up to this point are, therefore, that, when stability of the internal price level and stability of the external exchanges are incompatible, the former is generally preferable; and that on occasions when the dilemma is acute, the preservation of the former at the expense of the latter is, fortunately perhaps, the line of least resistance.

As the expected revenue stream from continuing with honest communication increases with their ability, high-ability sellers remain honest while low-ability sellers find it too costly and sometimes lie about quality for short-term gain. Thus, cheap-talk communication facilitates the market's learning of a seller's ability and strengthens reputation effects. We study this new reputation mechanism and the induced market dynamics, first when sellers cannot restart with a new identity and second when they can.

Key features of the model include the integration of decentralized markets into a full economy in a spatially explicit way and the analysis of short-run adjustment processes. The model is calibrated to a low income region of rural agrarian Pakistan that faced severe floods in 2010. Dynamic adaptation by agents in response to falling income includes migrating and running down savings. Despite these consumption smoothing strategies, some low income groups are vulnerable to starvation. The paper showcases two hypothetical policy scenarios, a cash and a food transfer program, and tracks their effects on the welfare of low income groups in the economy.","[Naqvi, Ali Asjad] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Rehm, Miriam] Chamber Labor, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Naqvi, AA (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",snaqvi@wu.ac.at; miriam.rehm@akwien.at,"Naqvi, Asjad/AAE-2793-2019; Naqvi, Asjad/AAP-5034-2021; Holloway, Susan/KBD-1889-2024","Naqvi, Asjad/0000-0002-0986-6009",,,,,70,24,25,0,33,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

This topic is of great importance because China is the world's second-largest oil importer and has exhibited substantial growth in oil consumption. Extending Diebold and Yilmaz's (2012) method of catching spillover dynamics, it is found that return and volatility spillovers between China and world oil markets are bi-directional and asymmetric. The Chinese oil market is highly affected by world oil markets and exerts an influence on world oil markets, although to a lesser extent. Moreover, the volatility spillover index has increased significantly since the peak of the last financial crisis in September 2008. Although the US oil market impacts China's market most in terms of spillover, the influence of China's oil market on the world oil market has intensified in recent years. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The sources of this decline have been widely debated among academics and policymakers, with some arguing that the participation rate is depressed due to weak labor demand while others argue that the decline was inevitable due to structural forces such as the aging of the population. In this paper, we use a variety of approaches to assess reasons for the decline in participation. Although these approaches yield somewhat different estimates of the extent to which the recent decline in participation reflects cyclical weakness rather than structural factors, our overall assessment is that much of the decline is structural in nature. As a result, while we believe some of the participation rate's current low level is indicative of labor market slack, we do not expect the rate to substantially increase from current levels as labor market conditions continue to improve.","[Aaronson, Stephanie; Cajner, Tomaz; Galbis-Reig, Felix; Smith, Christopher; Wascher, William] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Fallick, Bruce] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland,"Aaronson, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",,,"Wascher, William/0000-0003-0313-5958; Smith, Christopher/0000-0002-9648-5641",,,,,70,62,67,2,16,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We present a model of non-homothetic preferences, in which the rich consume a wide range of exclusive high-quality products and the poor a more narrow range of low-quality mass products. In this framework, inequality affects the composition of R&D through price and market size effects. The inequality-growth relationship depends on how mass production affects productivity; and on the particular dimension of inequality (income gaps versus income concentration). Our model is sufficiently tractable to incorporate learning-by-doing, oligopolistic market structures, and different sources of knowledge spillovers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This paper analyzes which risk-sharing networks can be sustained in the long run when individuals are farsighted, in the sense that they are able to forecast how other agents would react to their choice of insurance partners. In particular, we study whether the farsightedness of the agents leads to a reduction of the tension between stability and efficiency that arises when individuals are myopic. We find that for extreme values of the cost of establishing a mutual insurance agreement, myopic and farsighted agents form the same risk-sharing networks. For small costs, farsighted agents form efficient networks while myopic agents don't.","Univ St Louis Bruxelles, CEREC, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles,"Grandjean, G (通讯作者)，Univ St Louis Bruxelles, CEREC, Blvd Jardin Bot 43, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",grandjean@fusl.ac.be,,"Gilles, Grandjean/0000-0003-0777-4474",,,,,32,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Economists and sociologists have changed its meaning: should it be changed back?,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Capital; Money; Finance; Collateral; Human capital; Social capital,CONTROVERSY; SCHUMPETER; TIME,"This article traces the historical usages of the term capital and the explosion of different types of supposed 'capital' in the twentieth century, including 'human capital' and 'social capital'. In medieval and early modern times, capital meant money investable or invested in business. This meaning persists in business circles today. In contrast, Adam Smith treated physical assets, machines and people as 'capital' and this different usage has dominated economics since. The pre-Smithian meaning referred to money or other saleable assets that could be used as collateral. This article questions the change in meaning by economists and sociologists and highlights the importance of collateralisable property for capitalism. 'Human capital' can only be collateral if the humans involved are slaves. 'Social capital' can never be used as collateral and it is not even owned. These important issues are masked by the broadened notion of 'capital'. Given the conceptual problems involved, economists and sociologists should consider returning to the pre-Smithian and surviving business usage of the term.","[Hodgson, Geoffrey M.] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Hodgson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",g.m.hodgson@herts.ac.uk,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021",,,,,,125,79,86,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This is achieved by integrating an endogenous growth model with a cultural transmission mechanism that captures how parents shape the risk attitudes of their children in response to economic incentives. The model predicts that in an economy in which the material benefits associated with risky entrepreneurial activity are high, agents will over time develop more risk tolerant attitudes, which in turn will speed up the rate of economic growth. It is shown that policy interventions aiming at supporting entrepreneurial activity can play an important role for overcoming the forces of risk aversion and promoting long-run economic growth. Furthermore, the paper highlights how by inducing cultural change, such policy interventions may quantitatively have larger effects than what would be predicted by more standard models of endogenous growth.

Its dynamic growth is accompanied by severe pollution problems and large emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2)-it now has the largest annual emissions in the world. China will also be one of the main victims of climate change, should no action be taken to shift the global economy to cleaner modes of production and consumption. It is therefore in China's self-interest to take action to reduce CO2 in the very near term. However, doing so would require a fundamental change in economic growth patterns and a transformation of economic structure. This paper argues that such changes are feasible, and further that strong and active government interventions to facilitate these changes are justified. The paper explores the policy options, including in relation to carbon pricing and innovation policy, and the major challenges to implementing such structural reform.","[Lin, Justin Y.; Xu, Jintao] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Lin, JY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",justinlin@nsd.pku.edu.cn; xujt@pku.edu.cn,,"Xu, Jintao/0000-0001-5588-2942",,,,,36,8,9,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

First, we argue for and consider time-in particular genuine personal leisure time-as an important and prominent resource, additional to income, for everyday activities and individual well-being. Second, we evaluate and quantify the interdependence among the multiple poverty dimensions (via a CES well-being function and SOEP data) of the German population instead of arbitrarily choosing substitution parameters. We characterize the working poor and their multidimensional poverty regimes by descriptive results and by multinomial logit estimation based on German 2001/02 time use diary data. We find that the interdependence between time and income is significant. There is an important fraction of time poor individuals who are assigned not to compensate their time deficit even by above poverty threshold income. These poor people in particular have so far been ignored in the literature on poverty and well-being as well as the time pressure/time crunch.","[Merz, Joachim; Rathjen, Tim] Univ Luneburg, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Merz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Scharnhorst 1,C4-118b, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",merz@leuphana.de,,,,,,,69,19,22,2,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The first step is to establish that community-based networks are active throughout the developing world. Plenty of anecdotal and descriptive evidence supports this claim. However, showing that these networks improve the economic outcomes of their members is more of a challenge. Over the course of the paper, I will present multiple strategies that have been employed to directly or indirectly identify network effects. The second step is to look beyond a static role for community networks, one of overcoming market failures and improving the outcomes of their members in the short-run, to examine how these informal institutions can support group mobility. A voluminous literature documents the involvement of communities in internal and international migration, both historically and in the contemporary economy. As with the static analysis, the challenge here is to show statistically that community networks directly support the movement of groups of individuals. I will show how predictions from the theory can be used to infer a link between networks and migration in very different contexts.","Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Munshi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England.",munshi@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,72,57,78,1,25,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The estimation results indicate that upstream transfers in Korea cannot be explained by just one motive. I find evidence that altruism is the dominant motive at the margin if parental income is low, but not so if parental income is high. I also find that upstream transfers are given, at least in part, in exchange for child care service and in lieu of personal visits. There is little evidence that upstream transfers are used by children to win parental favor for future gains such as an inheritance or to repay implicit parental loans used for education. Additional evidence is provided from the analysis of the frequency of personal visits and semiparametric regressions.

Not only can they issue their own currency, but also any self-imposed constraint on budgetary operations can be easily bypassed. Through a detailed analysis of the institutions and practices surrounding the fiscal and monetary operations of the Treasury and central banks of several countries, MMT has provided institutional and theoretical insights into the inner workings of economies with monetarily sovereign and non-sovereign governments. In terms of theory, MMT argues that taxes and bond offerings are not best conceptualized as funding sources for the Treasury, but rather as reserve draining devices to maintain price and interest-rate stability. As such, they are necessary even if a government issues its currency to spend. This theoretical conclusion holds even if the Treasury may be required to tax and issue bond to fund itself. Another theoretical conclusion is that merging the central bank and the Treasury in a government sector can be done without loss of generality for monetarily sovereign governments. Separating the two adds complexity without bringing insights. The paper shows that the previous theoretical conclusions of MMT can be illustrated by providing evidence of the interconnectedness of the Treasury and the central bank in the United States.","Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97219 USA",,"Tymoigne, E (通讯作者)，Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97219 USA.",,,,,,,,39,23,26,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The results indicate that although linear models are useful in predicting the 1990 and 2001 decline in economic activity, none of these give signal of the major 2007 decline in output. Moreover, we find evidence that there is more information in the shape of the yield curve about the future economic activity than that provided by the spread alone. We also document that probit models are doing well in signalling the onset of 2007 subprime crisis although they fail to capture its duration.","[Evgenidis, Anastasios; Siriopoulos, Costas] Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm, Patras 26500, Greece",University of Patras,"Siriopoulos, C (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm, Univ Campus, Patras 26500, Greece.",siriopoulos@upatras.gr,"Evgenidis, Anastasios/AAP-8575-2020; Evgenidis, Anastasios/AAG-8823-2021","Evgenidis, Anastasios/0000-0002-5190-1058",,,,,6,5,5,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We identify a welfare rationale for public health under dynamic efficiency and exogenous mortality even when private and public investments are perfect substitutes. If health investment reduces mortality risk but individuals do not internalize its effect on the life-annuity interest rate, the Philipson-Becker effect emerges; when the young are net borrowers, this works together with dynamic efficiency to support a role for public health.

Evidence on the alternative possibility that they may nonetheless contain a common 1(1) component generating long-horizon co-variation between them crucially depends on the fact that (i) structural breaks are, or are not allowed for, and (ii) the precise nature and timing of such breaks. Not allowing for breaks, evidence points towards the presence of a common component inducing positive long-horizon covariation, which is compatible with the notion that the technology transforming consumption goods into investment goods is non-linear, and the RPI is also impacted upon by neutral shocks. Allowing for breaks, evidence suggests that long-horizon covariation is either nil or negative. Assuming, for illustrative purposes, that the two series contain a common component inducing negative long-horizon covariation, evidence based on structural VARs shows that this common shock (i) plays an important role in macroeconomic fluctuations, explaining sizeable fractions of the forecast error variance of main macro series, and (ii) generates 'disinflationary booms', characterized by transitory increases in hours, and decreases in inflation.

Furthermore, the gap in absenteeism does not seem to be driven by different behaviour in case of sickness as we find no clear difference in the prevalence of presenteeism between the two groups.

Coffee and cotton are agricultural products that face the problem of TE in developing countries, where we observe low global coffee product export shares but high global cotton textile export shares, posing a question on TE's impact on competitiveness. This paper employs a computable generalised equilibrium (CGE) modelling approach to examine the impact of TE on export shares of processed coffee and cotton textiles. We modify the standard GTAP (global trade analysis project) model to solve for global export shares and simulate the impact of eliminating TE on coffee and cotton to analyse economy-wide trade and welfare implications. Results show that TE has mixed effects on export shares, depending on the initial economic structure. Findings reveal that the elimination of TE on cotton and coffee may generate potential global gains of over US$ 0.7 billion, mainly from the cotton sector. Given the relative size of these sectors in global agriculture, the magnitude of gains is not small. This underlines the need for the policy-makers to examine, address and evaluate the prevalence of TE on a sectoral basis in ongoing WTO negotiations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Finally we illustrate the utility of the methodology by carrying out an empirical analysis for the 2007 Spanish Personal Income Tax, which meant a shift from a quasi-comprehensive to a semi-dual income tax.","[Onrubia, Jorge] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ Aplicada 6, Pozuelo De Alarcon 28223, Madrid, Spain; [Picos-Sanchez, Fidel] Univ Vigo, REDE, Orense 32004, Spain; [Picos-Sanchez, Fidel] Univ Vigo, Dept Econ Aplicada, Orense 32004, Spain; [del Carmen Rodado, Maria] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Madrid 28032, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Picos-Sánchez, F (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, REDE, Lagoas S-N, Orense 32004, Spain.",jorge.onrubia@ccee.ucm.es; fidel@uvigo.es; mariacarmen.rodado@urjc.es,"Rodado Ruiz, María del Carmen/AAA-9682-2019; Onrubia, Jorge/F-4146-2016; Fernández, Jorge Onrubia/AAA-9518-2019","Rodado Ruiz, María del Carmen/0000-0002-6670-0347; Fernández, Jorge Onrubia/0000-0001-8394-7387; Picos, Fidel/0000-0003-2996-8296",,,,,19,13,13,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Under the assumption of the heterogeneous expectations of two firms, we have observed that the Nash equilibrium price can be a dynamic equilibrium to realize when the speed of price adjustment is lower. However, the numerical simulation shows that the system may present a periodic and chaotic status when the speed of price adjustment is higher. The effect of the degree of horizontal differentiation on the stability of Nash equilibrium of the system is also discussed. We have a different conclusion from Lucino Fanti and Luca Gori's (2012); that is the greater the degree of product horizontal differentiation is, the more stable the Nash equilibrium of the system is.

The empirical evidence, based on a structural VAR model consisting of productivity, wage costs and prices, provides the robust facts for understanding Japan's deflation. It suggests that sluggish wage growth since the mid-1990s, along with productivity recovery from the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, contributed to the persistence of deflation, while weak demand pressure had a large negative implication for Japan's inflation. Going forward, the result implies that the translation of productivity gains into adequate wage growth, in addition to boosting demand, is important to help bring a definitive end to Japan's deflation.","[Urasawa, Satoshi] Japanese Govt, Cabinet Off, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008970, Japan; [Urasawa, Satoshi] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, F-75775 Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Urasawa, S (通讯作者)，Japanese Govt, Cabinet Off, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008970, Japan.",satoshi.urasawa@oecd.org,,,,,,,4,0,0,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Results reveal that the TFP index has increased by 27% largely due to an upward shift of the technology frontier. Although TC has increased by an impressive 57%, TEC declined by 30.1% during the post-reform period, thereby depressing overall TFP growth. The market liberalization policies exerted significantly positive impacts on TC and TFP growth but negatively on TEC. Farm size and household size also significantly improved these indices while education, tenancy and off-farm income exerted negative effects.

We show that liability rules bias the structure of the prices charged by the platform to consumers and merchants with respect to a case in which such a responsibility regime is not implemented. If consumers are liable for fraud, the profit-maximizing price structure is neither biased in favor of consumers nor merchants. If consumers are not liable for fraud, the platform lowers the price for merchants to provide them with investment incentives. Under the zero liability rule for consumers, the profit-maximizing allocation of fraud losses maximizes social welfare. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When a given host country allows more immigrants in, this creates costs and benefits for that particular country as well as a positive externality for individuals and governments who care about world poverty. Host countries quite often restrict immigration due to its important social and political costs, however these costs are never measured and made comparable across countries. In this paper we first show theoretically that tradable immigration quotas (TIQs) can reveal countries' comparative advantages in hosting immigrants and - once coupled with a matching mechanism taking migrants' preferences over destinations and countries' preferences over migrants' types into account allow for exploiting them efficiently. We then discuss three potential applications: a market for the resettlement of international refugees, a market for the resettlement of migrants displaced by climate change, and the creation of an OECD poverty-reduction visa program adapted from the US green card lottery.

As PV system prices declined rapidly since 2009, the German government implemented automatic mechanisms to adjust the remuneration level for new installations in response to deployment volumes. This paper develops an analytic model to simulate weekly installations of PV systems of up to 30 kW based on project profitability and project duration. The model accurately replicates observed market developments and is used to assess different adjustment mechanisms against multiple scenarios for PV system price developments. The analysis shows that responsive feed-in tariff schemes with frequent tariff adjustments and short qualifying periods reach deployment targets most effectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We contribute to this literature by documenting the importance of gender role attitudes with data from the 1970 British Cohort Study. We find that mothers' and children's gender role attitudes, measured 25 years apart, are strongly correlated, equally so for sons and daughters. We also find that daughters and sons' wives/partners have greater human capital and labour supply if their mothers held nontraditional attitudes. A fixed effect analysis shows that the female labour supply effects are particularly large following childbirth. Importantly, sons' human capital and labour supply are unaffected, suggesting the results are not driven by unobserved heterogeneity.

We examine how speculative storage affects the behavior of an oligopoly producing a commodity for which demand is subject to random shocks. Speculators compete with consumers when purchasing the commodity and then subsequently compete with producers when selling their stocks, resulting in two opposing incentives: on the one hand, producers would like to increase production to capture future sales in advance by selling to speculators; while on the other hand, they would like to withhold production to deter speculation, thereby eliminating the additional supply from speculators in future periods. We find that the incentive to sell to speculators can be quite strong, potentially resulting in prices sufficiently high to drive consumers from the market. Furthermore, these incentives are non-monotonic in the number of producers: speculative storage occurs more frequently in a relatively concentrated oligopoly than in the extremes of monopoly or perfect competition.

However, a careful reformulation of his analysis shows that he anticipated a number of insights (also with respect to Kahneman's 'two-systems of thought') which suggest new lines of inquiry from an original and different perspective. These insights of Scitovsky regard the following aspects: Uncertainty as a condition where the outcomes of choosing a particular option (novelty) is partially unknown; the case of individual 'consumption skill' (inclusive of emotions) that finds this uncertainty desirable when it is challenging; the case of increasing such skill so as to change preferences and make choices more efficient; the case of failing to increase such skill so as to make addictive harmful products an alternative and more tempting option.","[Pugno, Maurizio] Univ Cassino, Dept Econ & Law, I-03043 Cassino, Italy; [Pugno, Maurizio] Univ Cassino, CreaM, I-03043 Cassino, Italy",University of Cassino; University of Cassino,"Pugno, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino, Dept Econ & Law, Campus Folcara, I-03043 Cassino, Italy.",m.pugno@unicas.it,"Pugno, Maurizio/AAG-5669-2019","Pugno, Maurizio/0000-0003-0614-1181",,,,,64,0,0,0,17,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 18,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201424.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-24,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1NA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339611800001,0

With an ARDL-type model, the statistical results suggest that the availability of private sector bank credit in the economy exerts a positive impact on real GDP. In addition, inflation rates have contributed negatively to the increase in private credit, liquid liabilities, and financial development. A key outcome is that one percent increase in inflation is associated with a 0.07 % fall in long-run real rate of output through its effect on bank credit to the private sector. Another crucial finding is that policies of financial liberalization have helped stimulate economic growth. Reinforcing the literature on finance and growth, this study reaffirms that inflation rates are detrimental to long-run financial development and economic growth.","[Angel Tinoco-Zermeno, Miguel; Venegas-Martinez, Francisco] Escuela Super Econ, Inst Politecn Nacl, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico; [Hugo Torres-Preciado, Victor] Univ Colima, Fac Econ, Colima 28970, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Universidad de Colima,"Tinoco-Zermeño, M (通讯作者)，Escuela Super Econ, Inst Politecn Nacl, Plan Agua Prieta 66, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico.",mangel.tinoco@gmail.com; fvenegas1111@yahoo.com.mx; torrespreciado@ucol.mx,"Preciado, Víctor Hugo Torres/V-6889-2019; Venegas-Martínez, Francisco/AAH-2212-2021","Venegas-Martínez, Francisco/0000-0003-1157-0298; Tinoco-Zermeno, Miguel A./0000-0003-4707-2450",,,,,62,14,18,0,18,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

The paper aims to open the 'production black box' by proposing the analytical map of production as a tool for disentangling the set of interdependent relationships among capabilities, tasks and materials. The concept of structural learning is introduced to identify the continuous process of structural adjustment triggered and oriented by existing productive structures at each point in time. Structural learning trajectories allow for the transformation of structural constraints such as bottlenecks and technical imbalances into structural opportunities. Complementarities, similarities and indivisibilities are essential focusing devices for activating compulsive sequences of technological change as well as discovering structurally embedded opportunities. The paper then investigates the tension between structure and agency present in structural learning trajectories, and examines the form it takes in different productive organisations.

Multivariate analysis (MANOVA) and discriminative analysis were used in the statistical procedure of data analysis. The results show that the level of income does not affect the first phase of need awareness, but strongly affects all the other phases of the decision-making process.

By reviewing the definition of middle region's perimeter, we come to see how much the description of this middle land reflects the image of the powers (whose roles are seen as more, or less, important) and implies a chronology. This is obvious in the way that the mass violence of the 1930s and 1940s has been fit into a movement starting in 1905. It can also be seen in explanations of how Communism created the conditions for (not) assuming this violence after 1945.

We test the model using a newly constructed data set and the Polity IV data. We find that if expected economic growth under democracy is greater than anticipated economic growth under the alternative regime then the probability of breakdown is lower. Moreover, an increase in democratic capital decreases the probability of democracy breakdown.

The result finds that there is club-convergence within the middle income states. There is also evidence of the convergence of per capita income among Indian states by conditioning private investment and public investment along with other factors of economic growth. This paper is innovative in separating the significance of private investment from the public investment in the longrun dynamics of income in Indian states.

Over 500 incidents that had the potential to meet the criteria of an offensive foul were recorded from the 2009/10 season of the Israeli Basketball Super League and were analyzed by basketball experts. Falling intentionally in order to improve the chances to get an offensive foul is a very common behavior of defenders (almost two thirds of the recorded falls). It seems to be helpful at first, increasing indeed the chances to get an offensive foul, but a more careful analysis shows that the entire impact of an intentional fall on the team seems to be negative. We suggest that both rational reasons and biased decision making lead players to frequently act against their team's interest by falling. Referees almost never call an offensive foul if the player remained on his feet, and are generally calling fewer fouls than the number judged by experts as appropriate. We explain the referees' behavior both by using the representativeness heuristic and by examining closely the referees' interests and observing that to some extent even their officiating mistakes may be rational.

The focus of this study is on effects of knowledge capital on manufacturing total factor productivity (TFP) in China through the lens of the regional knowledge capital model (KCM). The objective is to estimate the impact of region-internal and region-external knowledge capital measured in terms of patents granted by the Chinese patent office on TFP across Chinese regions. We derive a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) for empirical testing, using panel data on 29 Chinese regions for the years 1988-2007. The results indeed point to a shift of Chinese productivity growth to a more knowledge based one, statistically confirming the impact of knowledge capital on regional TFP after 1998.

It is found that the wage premium of the vertical educational match is greater than that of the horizontal educational match. A better vertical match augments the wage premium of an improvement in the horizontal match, and vice versa. The horizontal educational mismatch appears to be an extended scenario of overeducation because graduates from colleges with low rankings have a higher probability of being vertically overeducated as well as horizontally mismatched. Graduates from highly-ranked colleges are privileged to not only have high earnings but also to have low probabilities for the vertical and horizontal mismatches. These low probabilities indirectly raise their earnings. The indirect effects of academic characteristics on earnings are calculated. The approach we propose provides an insight into how academic characteristics comprehensively influence earnings.","[Tao, Hung-Lin] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Hung, Chia-Yu] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Econ, Shoufeng, Hualien, Taiwan",Soochow University; National Dong Hwa University,"Tao, HL (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, 56 Kuei Yang St,Sec 1, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",hltao@scu.edu.tw,,,,,,,14,6,6,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

In order to fill this gap, this article suggests a Minsky-inspired interpretation of Schumpeterian institutional dynamics in monetary terms. It then develops a specific Schumpeterian analysis of the evolution of financial institutions and regulatory mechanisms in the wake of the 2007-08 crisis and points to major consequences of financial innovations on economic stability. It appears that unlike the creative destruction process of entrepreneurial innovations, in a liberalised/deregulated environment financial innovations move banks from their crucial role of financing long-term economic evolution and lead to reckless finance. Thus, financial market dynamics put economies on a destructive path. Such an evolution calls for active and tight rational regulation in order to shape capitalist finance towards more stable and welfare-enhancing strategies.","Univ Grenoble Alpes, CREG, Dept Econ, F-38040 Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Ülgen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, CREG, Dept Econ, F-38040 Grenoble, France.",ulgen.faruk@upmf-grenoble.fr,"Ulgen, Faruk/T-9908-2019","ULGEN, Faruk/0000-0003-2625-6293",,,,,48,15,15,1,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

We focus on one particular business decision which may indicate low productivity: keeping enough change on hand to break larger bills. This is a surprisingly large problem. Our estimates suggest that the average firm loses approximately 5-8% of total profits because they do not have enough change. We conducted two experiments to shed light on why this happens: surveying firms weekly about lost sales, thereby increasing the salience of change, and explicitly informing firms about lost sales. We find that both interventions significantly altered change management and reduced lost sales. This largely rules out many potential explanations such as the risk of theft or the costs of holding change being too high. One explanation consistent with firms' response to the survey and information on their lost sales is that firms were not perfectly attentive to change management prior to the interventions.

We employ a trivariate asymmetric BERK-type GARCH-in-Mean (MGARCH-M) approach to estimate the time-varying conditional variance and covariance of returns of stock market index, the world market portfolio and bilateral exchange rate between the US dollar and the local currency. The results show that the world market and currency risks are not only priced in the stock markets, but also time-varying. It is found that currency betas are much more volatile than the world market betas, and currency betas in the emerging markets are more volatile than those in the developed markets. We find empirical evidence of contagion effect and spillovers between stock market and foreign exchange market during the recent global financial crisis, and the effect is stronger in the emerging markets than that in the developed markets. Two applications are provided to illustrate the usefulness of time-varying currency betas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In principle, a well-designed tax could reduce the risk of climate change, minimize the cost of emissions reductions, encourage innovation in low-carbon technologies, and raise new public revenue. But designing a real-world carbon tax poses significant challenges. We analyze those challenges from a public finance perspective, emphasizing three tax policy design issues: setting the tax rate, collecting the tax, and using the resulting revenue. The benefits of a carbon tax will depend on how policymakers address those issues.","[Marron, Donald B.; Toder, Eric J.] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA",Urban Institute,,dmarron@urban.org; etoder@urban.org,,,,,,,17,62,63,15,125,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

However, when using a quantile approach, export participation is found to be positively related to profitability for those firms with high profit growth but negatively related for those firms with low profit growth.

Brand and size can be either complementary or substitutable with respect to consumers' shopping characteristics. They are complementary to spending per visit, or brand magnifies the positive effect of size to spending per visit. Weekend consumers also tend to view size and brand complementary, which is so strong that there exists polarized shopping at either large nationwide brand or small unbranded stores during weekend. Car owners exhibit very similar patterns as weekend consumers. On the other hand, substitutability exists to explain shopping frequency. This effect is so high as to generate the polarized pattern; shopping frequency is high with regard to small nationwide brand and large unbranded stores.

The key approach is based on symmetric input-output tables (SIOTs) that allow the description of several segments of the economy. SIOTs were compiled directly from data sources on a regular basis instead of supply and use tables. We used SIOTs for 1973 and 1987 to investigate thoroughly the differences between the previously used Material Product System (MPS) and the System of National Accounts (SNA). After that, we identified the most important differences between MPS and SNA, and constructed the time series of Czech gross domestic product for 1970-1989.

When using an empirically based consumer model including cross-border shopping, tax-free shopping, and smuggling, we do find revenue curves implying total tax revenue maximizing tax rates. But we also find that these tax rates are always higher than the observed tax rates, i.e., suggesting that the answer to our question is no.

Players can save, consume and give transfers to each other: We identify a continuum of equilibria in which imperfectly-altruistic agents act as if they were a perfectly-altruistic dynasty which is less patient than the two agents themselves. In such equilibria, the poor agent receives transfers until both effectively pool their wealth and tragedy-of-the-commons-type inefficiencies occur. We also provide a sharp characterization of strategic interactions in consumption and transfer behavior. This provides new insights relative to existing two-period models. It allows us to differentiate between the Samaritan's dilemma - e.g. a child runs down its assets inefficiently fast in anticipation of transfers - and what we refer to as the Prodigal-Son dilemma - e.g. parents do not leave an early bequest, anticipating a child's profligate behavior.

Participation and commitment in a coalition are either exogenously imposed or endogenously determined by the players themselves. We find larger voluntary participation rates when commitments in the coalition are endogenously determined using a minimum contribution rule rather than exogenously determined. However, due to a trade-off between participation and commitment, coalitions with voluntary participation are less effective in facilitating cooperation compared to when all players are forced to participate. This paper therefore confirms the rather pessimistic conclusions from coalition formation theories.","[Dannenberg, Astrid] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lange, Andreas] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Sturm, Bodo] Leipzig Univ Appl Sci, Leipzig, Germany",Columbia University; University of Hamburg,"Dannenberg, A (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,27,34,35,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2014,81.0,322,,,,,257,275,,10.1111/ecca.12073,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AC5ZH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332599000005,0

This paper assesses the gender gap in labor supply elasticities. This topic is relevant for a better understanding of recent changes in women decisions to participate in the labor market in Uruguay and because of the policy implications arising from the distinction between both elasticities. The results confirm differences in the magnitudes between intertemporal and uncompensated elasticities with a higher substitution effect for women.

We study this question in the context of an innovation-based model of growth where cultural attitudes are endogenously transmitted from one generation to the next. Focusing on attitudes regarding patience, we analyze the two-way interaction between economic growth and the intergenerational transmission of patience. Exploiting this interaction, we compare the long-run growth performance of a culturally heterogeneous society where patience is initially underrepresented in the population with a culturally homogeneous society where all agents are perfectly patient. Our main result is that in the absence of any intrinsic preferences of patient parents to transmit their attitudes to their children, the development paths of the two societies are bound to diverge, with the culturally heterogeneous society experiencing lower growth rates. Yet, if patient parents ceteris paribus prefer their children to be patient like them, we show that the two societies can in the long run grow at the same rate.(JEL D91, E24, O30, O40, Z10)","[Klasing, Mariko J.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Global Econ & Management, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Milionis, Petros] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Klasing, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Global Econ & Management, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.j.klasing@rug.nl; p.milionis@rug.nl,"Klasing, Mariko J./AAL-5747-2020","Klasing, Mariko J./0000-0002-3716-0644; Milionis, Petros/0000-0001-9899-3925",,,,,47,8,8,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

By introducing intangible capital in an otherwise standard theoretical real business cycle model, this paper aims to provide a theoretical foundation of the empirical findings. Our results indicate that investment in intangible capital is pro-cyclical. Both transitory as well as permanent productivity shocks increase investment in intangible capital. However, in case of a permanent technology shock we learn that firms allocate more labor and physical capital to the creation of intangible capital which increases future profits at the cost of current profit.

The universal nature of the phenomenon, however, indicates that globalization, which occurred simultaneously, also played a role. We build a model based on Melitz (2003) in which falling transport cost lead to greater openness, higher productivity and lower inflation. Following a decline in transport cost openness increases and firm selection eliminates the least productive domestic firms. The consequent increase in average productivity leads to falling relative prices for goods. A cash-in-advance constraint allows analyzing how falling relative prices can lead to lower inflation. Using a data set of macroeconomic variables for 123 countries from all world regions, we disentangle the influences of monetary policy and globalization by showing that openness-induced productivity growth leads to a significant decline in inflation world-wide.

The probability of leaving unemployment also varies strongly between ethnicities, while first- and second-generation Turks are identified as the major problem group.","[Uhlendorff, Arne] Univ Mannheim, DIW Berlin, IZA, Mannheim, Germany; [Uhlendorff, Arne] IAB Nuremberg, Nurnberg, Germany; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Mannheim; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Bonn,"Uhlendorff, A (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, DIW Berlin, IZA, Mannheim, Germany.",,"Uhlendorff, Arne/AAS-6187-2020","Uhlendorff, Arne/0000-0002-2823-4445",,,,,27,21,21,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2014,81.0,322,,,,,348,367,,10.1111/ecca.12077,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AC5ZH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332599000010,0

(The class of capitalists cannot extract from the circulation what has not previously been thrown in.) Steve Keen studied the monetary paradox and contrary to circuitists he came to the conclusion that capitalists can make a monetary profit with the possibility to earn enough to repay their debt, with positive balances for all actors. The author demonstrates that Keen made a fundamental mistake and is using the Stock Flow Consistency Principle in an inconsistent way by combining it with behavioral equations in a dynamic model. The solution presented here shows not only problems with the numbers but with the method. This solution resolves a dispute between Keen and circuitists and implies that, in a Wicksellian pure credit economy, it remains impossible for all actors to gain a monetary profit.","DLF Sustainable, Delft, Netherlands",,"de la Fonteijne, MR (通讯作者)，DLF Sustainable, Delft, Netherlands.",marcel@dlfsustainable.nl,,,,,,,6,0,0,1,3,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 26,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201415.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-15,0.0,,,8,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1MO,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339610500001,0

The results show that first, although the problem of payment delays is the most important single issue determining the investment decisions of Polish companies, its importance decreases when analysed simultaneously with other issues. Second, among the indicators selected for an assessment of investment decisions, two driving forces determine the investment decisions of Polish companies namely, macroeconomic factors and law-related factors, with the relative importance of the former lower than the latter. Third, there is a positive association between the importance of each of the two factors and the actual investment reductions, implying that among companies facing higher investment reductions, the importance of macroeconomic and law-related factors is higher.","[Bialowolski, Piotr] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Stat & Demog, Warsaw, Poland; [Weziak-Bialowolska, Dorota] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Protect & Secur Citizen, Econometr & Appl Stat Unit, Ispra, VA, Italy",Warsaw School of Economics; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Weziak-Bialowolska, D (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Protect & Secur Citizen, Econometr & Appl Stat Unit, Ispra, VA, Italy.",dorota.bialowolska@gmail.com,"Weziak-Bialowolska, Dorota/AAF-7827-2020; Bialowolski, Piotr/AAI-8393-2020","Weziak-Bialowolska, Dorota/0000-0003-2711-2283; Bialowolski, Piotr/0000-0003-4102-0107",,,,,40,14,16,9,41,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,MAR 7,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201411.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-11,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1MK,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339610100001,0

Using data for the period 1980 to 2009 and controlling for state and year fixed effects, the results of the present study suggest that states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murder rates than other states. It was also found that assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level. These results suggest that restrictive concealed weapons laws may cause an increase in gun-related murders at the state level.

This paper shares the opinion that the significance of Hayek's legal writings and their relevance to law and economics can only be understood by jointly analyzing his economic and legal theories. Moreover, I will argue that both theories must be reconsidered in light of Hayek's theory of mind. This theory represents the key to understanding Hayek's thought in that it provides an insight into the complexity of cognitive and psychological determinants of coordination processes. The latter are essential for understanding the emergence of social institutions. From this perspective, Hayek's theory bears close relevance to current research in law. He suggests a different methodological approach in which the analysis of the micro-foundations of behavior is of central importance. I argue that such multidisciplinary inquiry can contribute to legal theory by explaining perception in decision-making processes. This line of analysis may also contribute to a normative legal theory that reduces errors in legal contexts. Such an interdisciplinary approach seems to be consistent with the OIE requirement - in the tradition of Veblen and Commons - that economic science must deal with a consistent theory of human behavior.","[Ambrosino, Angela] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Law Polit Econ & Social Sci, Alessandria, Italy; [Ambrosino, Angela] Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; University of Turin,"Ambrosino, A (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Law Polit Econ & Social Sci, Alessandria, Italy.",,,,,,,,100,4,4,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

A stochastic single-factor input frontier estimation using the gamma error distribution is applied to separately estimate the distribution of the electricity and fossil fuel efficiency of assembly plants using data from 2003 to 2005 and then compared to model results from a prior analysis conducted for the 1997-2000 time period. This comparison provides an assessment of how the industry has changed over time. The frontier analysis shows a modest improvement (reduction) in best practice for electricity use and a larger one for fossil fuels. This is accompanied by a large reduction in the variance of fossil fuel efficiency distribution. The results provide evidence of a shift in the frontier, in addition to some catching up of poor performing plants over time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These issues are investigated within a model of occupational choice with credit market imperfections and local non convexities in educational investment. Whether and under which conditions private wealth accumulation leads to the elimination of the effects of credit market imperfections is also studied. In the cases where steady states feature wealth and occupational mobility we show that private wealth accumulation cannot eliminate the effects of credit market imperfections if, at any point in time, investment correlates with wealth within households in the skilled occupation. Persistence of wealth constraints in the economy with occupational mobility motivates our exploration of policies. Compared to the case of homogeneous ability, we show that heterogeneity requires more persistent policies to achieve similar results in terms of enhanced investment opportunities and income per capita. It is also shown that the scope for policies is larger under heterogeneity: policies can be effective in environments where they would fail in a world of homogeneous abilities.","[D'Amato, Marcello] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Csef, Celpe, I-84100 Salerno, Italy; [Di Pietro, Christian] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-84100 Salerno, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Salerno,"D'Amato, M (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Csef, Celpe, I-84100 Salerno, Italy.",damato@unisa.it; cdipietro@unisa.it,"D'Amato, Marcello/AAE-1108-2020","DI PIETRO, CHRISTIAN/0000-0002-1683-155X; D'AMATO, Marcello/0000-0002-5772-3897",,,,,21,1,1,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Empirical results from an experiment with simulated congestion experiences show that the impact of consumers' anticipation of other consumers' service time choices is lower for first-time than for the repeated encounters. Despite consumers greater information need in first-time encounters, we predict that the impact of publicly announced access recommendations is lower in first-time than in repeated service encounters. The reason is that consumers have not yet learned how to take into account the impact of recommendations on other consumers' choices. However, we hypothesize that consumers do benefit from recommendations in that recommendations allow them to better anticipate other consumers' choices and are also able to learn about others' choices sooner than in case no recommendations are provided.

How should legislators' voting weights appropriately reflect these population differences? An analysis requires an understanding of the relationship between voting weight and some measure of the influence that each legislator has over collective decisions. We provide three new characterizations of weighted voting that embody this relationship. Each is based on the intuition that winning coalitions should be close to one another. The locally minimal and tightly packed characterizations use a weighted Hamming metric. Ellipsoidal separability employs the Euclidean metric: a separating hyper-ellipsoid contains all winning coalitions, and omits losing ones. The ellipsoid's proportions, and the Hamming weights, reflect the ratio of voting weight to influence, measured as Penrose Banzhaf voting power. In particular, the spherically separable rules are those for which voting powers can serve as voting weights. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Using three well-known structural vector autoregression (SVAR) models, we analyse how structural shocks are associated with the variations of output and hours worked at business cycle frequencies. Empirical results reveal that technology shocks remain an important source of cyclical movements in output. Furthermore, a positive technology shock does not lead to a decline in hours worked, in contrast to previous studies. Our SVAR-based evidence does not support discarding a technology-shock-driven business cycle theory.","[Huh, Hyeon-Seung] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kim, David] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Yonsei University; University of Sydney,"Huh, HS (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",hshuh@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

The results show that male employment is not affected by a minimum wage increase, although men's working hours do increase. In contrast, female employment is more likely to be negatively affected by a minimum wage increase, while their working hours remain unchanged. This may lead to women being in a more disadvantaged position in the workforce, and adopting a monthly minimum wage may induce firms to extend men's working hours. Therefore, to better protect disadvantaged workers, we suggest that minimum wage regulation should focus on the target group of less-educated women, and that a unified minimum hourly wage needs to be set for both full-time and part-time workers. Meanwhile, the importance of human capital accumulation should be addressed in alleviating the negative effects of minimum wage increases.","Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Jia, P (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jiapeng@jiapeng.org,,"Jia, Peng/0000-0001-5260-6002",,,,,25,14,15,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR,2014,22.0,2,,,SI,,61,80,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12062.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AC5YW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332597900005,0

The findings suggest that when managers engage in wasteful capital expenditures, welfare may decline if the cost of investment is tax deductible, as commonly advocated. The extent to which the return on investment should be taxed depends on how the internal provision of incentive pay and external monitoring by banks interact in constraining the manager and whether retained earnings or new share issues finance investments at the margin. The results are informative for the design of investment subsidies which might be integrated in corporate tax systems such as an Allowance for Corporate Equity or a cash-flow tax.

Using a new series of experiments in which group size is varied across sessions, we find that models based on logit choice organize the data well. In this setting, logit quantal response equilibrium (QRE) is a limit of a cognitive hierarchy (CH) model with logit best responses for appropriate parameters. While QRE captures the data well, the CH fits provide support for relaxing the equilibrium assumption. Both the QRE and CH models have parameters which capture boundedness of rationality. The maximum likelihood fits of both models yield parameters indicating rationality is more restricted as group size grows. Period-by-period adjustments of expenditures are more likely to be in the earnings-improving direction in smaller groups. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The theory implies that formal and informal credit can be either complements or substitutes. The model also explains why weak legal institutions increase the prevalence of informal finance in some markets and reduce it in others, why financial market segmentation persists, and why informal interest rates can be highly variable within the same sub-economy.

Limited financial resources as well as detailed regulations and supervision of their spending are the important features of the public higher education sector. Another important and debated issue is the division of public money among higher education institutions (HEI). It is therefore crucial to create stimuli for the rational management of public funds by HEI and for the quality improvement of HEI services. One of the proposed ways to achieve the desired result is the comparative efficiency assessment of HEI activities. Setting clear reference points for HEI, such assessment may be treated as a substitute for market competition. This paper describes a comparative efficiency study of 19 Polish universities of technology. Detailed analysis of potential input, output and environmental variables describing the HEI efficiency model was carried out. The study used the CCR-CRS output-oriented DEA model. It was assumed that HEI had more influence on achieved results than on the amount of their resources. The economies of scale were also studied in relation to the efficiency achieved. Sensitivity of the model to data errors was tested.","[Nazarko, Joanicjusz] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Business Informat & Logist, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland; [Saparauskas, Jonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Bialystok University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Saparauskas, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",jonas.saparauskas@vgtu.lt,"Nazarko, Joanicjusz/L-1285-2016","Nazarko, Joanicjusz/0000-0002-0236-2334; Saparauskas, Jonas/0000-0003-3685-7754",,,,,49,96,106,5,151,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This paper assesses the distributional effects of these price increases in Cyprus by specifying and estimating a consumer demand system with price heterogeneity between households. This novel method allows obtaining robust parameter estimates even when household expenditure surveys are limited, as is the case in many European countries. The empirical analysis is conducted both conditional on energy-related household characteristics and unconditionally. We then use the estimated demand system to conduct welfare analysis. We find that the rise in energy prices results in welfare losses of EUR 101 per household (in 2009 prices) in year 2020, or a nationwide welfare loss of more than EUR'2009 33 million. Price increases will be regressive and will affect small and urban households more strongly than the rest of the population. Furthermore, we find that the largest proportion of welfare loss is due to loss of household's income purchasing power caused by higher energy prices, while the changes in relative prices induce deadweight loss which is a small part of welfare loss because of the limited substitutability of energy with other goods.

I reached this conclusion without considering the many facets of state capitalism in the Chinese growth process. Having outlined some basic features of Chinese state capitalism in section one, in section two I focus on China's industrial policy to promote innovative entrepreneurship. Two sets of policies have played a key role: (a) the decision to build up a team of national global players, and (b) the decision to grasp the big and let go of the small (i.e., to retain big firms in state ownership but privatize small firms). This has resulted in the David-Goliath symbiosis, which is one of the cornerstones of China's economic success. Chinese policy decision-making is driven by networks (between public officials and managers of leading private and state-owned enterprises), the pervasive role of the new elite, and a highly developed patronage system. I describe this in section three. The focus in section four is on public investment in infrastructure to develop the hinterland and overcome the middle income trap. In the final section, I assess the methodology of recent Western evaluations of Chinese policy in the light of the global economic crisis.","[Schweinberger, Albert] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany; [Schweinberger, Albert] Zeppelin Univ, Friedrichshafen, Germany",University of Konstanz; Zeppelin University,"Schweinberger, A (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany.",,,,,,,,28,18,22,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

It is obtained by adapting the Equal treatment property: if the cost of the edge between two agents changes, their cost shares are affected in the same manner if they have the same demand.

In that country, pensions available to older people vary considerably across the country's various pension schemes. This paper calculates the fairness coefficients of these pensions based on pension income, contributions, demand, and generational gap. The analysis shows that the pension fairness coefficients are 0.53, 038, 0.95, and 0.82, respectively. Synthesizing pension income, contributions, demand, and generational gap, the paper suggests that, in China, old-age pensions across different schemes are absolutely unfair. Finally, it analyzes the superficial and deeper factors behind pension unfairness in China before providing policy recommendations for improving the fairness of the country's pension system.

In the early stages of financial development, agents are constrained in their borrowing ability. As a result, the individual savings, affected by the labor supply, play a dual role in the economy, having repercussions on the interest rate. On the one hand, high savings imply high investment, low marginal product of capital and thus low interest rate. On the other hand, high savings affect the agents' ability to run highly productive investment projects, which increases the interest rate. When the former effect is dominant, a dynamic complementarity between individual and aggregate labor supply arises. This leads to a local and global indeterminacy of equilibrium paths. If the borrowing constraint is relaxed, the complementarity between individual and aggregate labor supply decisions weakens, equilibrium becomes globally unique and the possibility of having aggregate fluctuations in output disappears.

It is well recognized that entrepreneurship and new firm formation are critical factors in determining economic growth and development. New firm entry into the marketplace enhances welfare in two distinct ways: 1) by promoting innovation, productivity and economic growth and 2) by increasing competition, which lowers prices and expands output. It is also well documented that barriers to entry reduce the likelihood that new firms will enter various sectors. We argue that the burden imposed by tax codes and tax compliance constitutes a barrier to entry that has been neglected in the previous literature. We use data from the World Bank to measure the administrative burden that the complexity of tax policy imposes on new firms. Additionally, we use a measure of new firm formation - entry density. Our data cover 118 countries over a period of six years. We find that the entry rate is significantly reduced by the tax administrative burden and that this effect is unrelated to general taxes on corporate profits and is robust to the inclusion of several important control variables.","[Braunerhjelm, Pontus; Eklund, Johan E.] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, SE-11156 Stockholm, Sweden; [Braunerhjelm, Pontus] Royal Inst Technol, SE-11156 Stockholm, Sweden; [Eklund, Johan E.] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, SE-11156 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Jonkoping University,"Eklund, JE (通讯作者)，Sodra Kungstornet, Kungsgatan 33,7th Floor, SE-11156 Stockholm, Sweden.",pontus.braunerhjelm@entreprenorskapsforum.se; johan.eklund@entreprenorskapsforum.se,"Eklund, Johan/HPC-9141-2023","braunerhjelm, pontus/0000-0003-0218-7924",,,,,39,54,58,5,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2014,67.0,1,,,,,1,11,,10.1111/kykl.12040,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,282JM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329167200001,0

Without adequate tax enforcement, government is reduced to acting as a financial backer for companies. Furthermore, a lower tax rate on labour income enabling money to flow from households to companies through private consumption reduces incentives for tax evasion.

The fiscal stance is measured by the government deficit To study the impact of aggregate shocks, we use impulse responses derived from a pooled structural vector autoregression model estimated on annual panel data. We find that the fiscal deficits of OMS could be vulnerable to discretionary changes in government expenditures and revenues. In contrast, the fiscal stance of NMS shows vulnerability to GDP shocks, because the increase in revenues after a positive GDP shock is often outpaced by greater expenditure increases in NMS. The estimated fiscal vulnerabilities stem from disproportionate policy responses concerning government expenditures and a lacking discipline to control pro-cyclical fiscal spending. Our findings for the EU thus support application of fiscal rules focused on government expenditure rather than other fiscal variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a global vector autoregressive model and a new data set that excels in country coverage and covers the most recent time period including the global financial crisis, our results are threefold: First, we show that a +1% shock to Chinese output translates to a permanent increase of 1.1% in Chinese real GDP and a 0.1% to 0.5% rise in output for most large economies. Second, to benchmark the shock to Chinese output, we examine the response to a +1% shock to US GDP. The results show that the US economy remains dominant in the world economy, as output rises in other advanced economies by 0.6 to 1%. By contrast, China seems to be little affected by the US shock. Finally, we are the first to assess the impact of a real appreciation of the renminbi versus the US dollar in a global model. Our results indicate that real appreciation of the renminbi decreases the level of Chinese GDP slightly and the long-run effect is also negative for many countries exporting (e.g. raw materials) to China.","[Feldkircher, Martin] Oesterreich Nationalbank OeNB, Vienna, Austria",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"Korhonen, I (通讯作者)，Bank Finland, Bank Finland Inst Econ Transit, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",iikka.korhonen@bof.fi,"Feldkircher, Martin/R-3436-2019; Feldkircher, Martin/JBJ-7518-2023; Korhonen, Iikka/AAP-4573-2020","Korhonen, Iikka/0000-0002-9037-7797; Feldkircher, Martin/0000-0002-5511-9215",,,,,27,26,27,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Contrary to previous studies, we propose, in this work, a new approach; an intermediate approach that consists in conducting a time-series analysis (employed in the literature under unilateral cases-absolute approach) with a comparison of inflation performance of IT countries and those of non-IT countries (comparison made in literature under the relative approach). Empirically, we employ a frequency analysis based on evolutionary spectral theory of Priestley (1965-1996) in order to distinguish between different inflation horizons: short-run and the medium-run inflation rates. To check the stability of spectral density functions for inflation series for each country under studied frequencies, we apply a Bai and Perron (2003a,b) test. Our results show that after IT framework implementation, there is no break point in inflation series in short and medium terms. This result is not verified for non-IT countries. Therefore.

Using a fully general specification for the instantaneous utility function, we show that the size of the wealth effect on labour supply is largely inconsequential for macroeconomic dynamics. Instead, we find that Edgeworth complementarity between consumption and hours worked is crucial in order to obtain co-movement of key macroeconomic variables. We consider investment shocks and we show that co-movement can easily be achieved with non-separable preferences in combination with a reasonable degree of nominal rigidity.

Emphasis is placed on the impact of an artwork's dimensions upon its auction price. A salient aspect of this is the first test of the 'golden ratio' hypothesis in a market situation. It is concluded that purchasers prefer paintings that deviate from the golden rule. The 'orientation' of works (portrait, landscape or square) as well as size also helps determine price. The impact of winning the Archibald portraiture prize (Australia's foremost art prize) is found to have significant and positive impacts on winning artists' prices. This suggests that purchasers are not fully informed. In addition, a previously unsuspected relationship between artwork dimensions and Archibald prize winners was found.

Our hypothesis stipulates that part of the value that a unit of money buys in lotteries is consumed before the actual resolution in the form of emotions such as hope. In other words, a person holding a lottery ticket may prefer a delayed resolution of risk due to positive anticipatory emotions. This conjecture is tested in an experiment with real lottery tickets. We show that our theoretical considerations may contribute to explaining empirical puzzles associated with lottery participation, timing of resolution and the spreading of lots over drawings. More specifically, we find that a substantial minority of participants prefer delayed resolution, that anticipated thrill is the main variable explaining this choice, and that emotions actually experienced during the waiting period are indeed predominantly positive and correlated with predictions. Finally, we find that a great majority prefers to 'spread' chances, that is. to obtain one ticket for each of two drawings rather than two for the same drawing. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In simulations, we find that this estimator continues to be unbiased even when intraday mean reversion is present, as captured by the Binomial Markov Random Walk model. On the empirical side, we find that this estimator works well in a variety of global stock indices, including the S&P 500 Index, in the sense of being unbiased relative to the usual estimator, i.e., the sample variance of the daily returns.

The main contribution of this research is that it examines what function fixed-term contracts have in the EU new member states, countries that have not yet been investigated in this regard. This research tests which individual characteristics influence the transition to permanent employment and how labour market institutions can help in understanding the differences among countries. The analysis covers the eight post-communist countries which joined the EU in 2004. The period analysed is 2005-10. We make use of the EU-SILC dataset and employ multinomial logistic regression to perform the analysis. The findings reveal that, on average, a temporary job is more a trap than a stepping stone, although considerable differences exist across countries. Surprisingly, most of the individual demographic and human capital characteristics do not have an effect on the transition to permanent employment. Only the age category and work experience significantly increase the chances for a successful transition. Institutions such as employment rigidity and industrial relations explain a considerable amount of the country variations. More rigid labour markets and stronger trade unions lower the probability of successful transition. We argue that the reason is that companies use FTCs as a tool to increase flexibility in rigid labour markets. The concluding part discusses some limitations of the research, links it back to the theoretical literature and suggests some challenges for future research.","Comenius Univ, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Babos, P (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",pavol.babos@uniba.sk,"Babos, Pavol/K-7046-2019","Babos, Pavol/0000-0002-7536-9027",,,,,23,11,11,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JAN 2,2014,26.0,1,,,,,39,52,,10.1080/14631377.2014.874230,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AB5YJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331864300003,0

These two sources of growth require different policies and institutions. In particular, in this article we argue that the transition from an imitation-based to an innovation-based economy calls the old welfare state model into question. It is not so much the size of the state that is at stake but rather its governance. What we need to foster economic growth in developed economies is not a reduced state but a strategic state, which acts as a catalyst using selective and properly governed support to the market-driven innovation process. This idea of a strategic state that targets its investments to maximize growth in the face of hard budget constraints departs both from the Keynesian view of a state sustaining growth through demand-driven policies and from the neoliberal view of a minimal state confined to its regalian functions.","[Aghion, Philippe; Roulet, Alexandra] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Aghion, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",paghion@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,44,17,17,1,26,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

In such a setting, an expected utility maximizing society demands an efficient abatement effort from each firm. We assume that the abatement effort is decided by each firm and is not observed by the environmental regulator. This leads to a moral hazard problem between firms (agents) and the regulator (principal). The regulator assigns contracts to each firm, each contract consisting of an amount of permits and a linear fine for over-polluting firms. We distinguish those policies where the regulator assigns a low number of permits (restrictive policies) and policies where the number of permits to distribute is high (permissive policies). We show that in a context of restrictive policies there exist policies that achieve efficiency and do not need to discriminate in terms of penalties among over-polluting firms when a market for permits is allowed to operate. We also find that the regulator can set up policies with low penalty levels for almost all firms. Finally, we show that in a context of permissive policies, the market leads to the same efficiency-inducing fine scheme than the corresponding one under autarky.","[Alvarez, Francisco; Camina, Ester] Univ Complutense, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Alvarez, F (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Madrid 28223, Spain.",fralvare@ccee.ucm.es; ecaminac@ccee.ucm.es,"Alvarez, Francisco/ABH-2320-2020","Alvarez, Francisco/0000-0003-0472-5255; Camina, Ester/0000-0001-5181-5793",,,,,13,0,0,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Since China's quality and technical level of production is increasing, liabilities in the EU current account of the balance of payment is deepened by mutual trade relations; negatively affecting unemployment rate and government debt.

To evaluate this, the paper develops and applies a conceptual framework that distinguishes between the intensive and extensive margins of Chinese export competition. South African exports of new and existing manufactured products to Sub-Saharan Africa are found to have been negatively affected by Chinese competition relative to exports from other countries. Consequently, South Africa's exports to the region in 2010 were 20% lower than they would have been if they had been affected to the same degree as other countries. The crowding-out effects are found to be strongest in medium- and low-technology products.

Affected students passed more AP exams, were more likely to remain in college beyond their first and second years, and earned higher wages. Effects are particularly pronounced for Hispanic students who experienced a 2.5-percentage-point increase in college degree attainment and an 11% increase in earnings. While the study is based on nonexperimental variation, the results are robust across a variety of specifications, and most plausible sources of bias are ruled out.

We find that the presence of spillovers from other exporters has a statistically significant positive effect on the decision to export, after controlling for sunk costs to enter new markets, plant characteristics, and other factors that are commonly considered to affect the firm's decision to export goods. The result showing a significant and positive spillover effect on the decision to export is consistent with the studies on firms in developing countries but contrasts with the study on firms in the United States. Thus, we suggest the establishment of export promotion policy based on capturing the important spillover effects caused by proximity and resource reallocation in developing countries.

We argue that the impact of back loading on the motivation of a worker to put effort into work depends, among other variables, on the probability of being able to find another job. The less likely it is that one can find another job the more likely one is to exert a greater effort at work. Given that older workers are less likely to be able to find another job if they are dismissed from their current position, they are also less likely to shirk their obligations at work. Therefore, firms have to expend fewer resources monitoring their work. In addition, we demonstrate that the probability of employee misconduct declines with the number of years on the job even when the probability of detection remains constant.","[Luski, Israel; Malul, Miki] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84000 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Malul, M (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84000 Beer Sheva, Israel.",malul@som.bgu.ac.il,,"malul, miki/0000-0001-9985-8303",,,,,5,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The baseline regression results suggest that banks with an above-average equity-to-asset ratio tend to report higher NIMs. The chosen proxy for loan default risk also appears statistically significant, but contrary to what is suggested by theory, indicates that the relation between default risk and the NIM is inverse. Amongst industry-specific determinants, only the proxy for concentration appears significant, as expected, and carries the prefix envisaged. Despite its narrow focus, this article does not ignore other possible determinants of the bank NIM. The type of bank ownership, as well as size effects, are explored further in order to gain insights into the influence of those variables on the NIM. The approach we follow does not include proxies for such determinants, but rather involves testing differences in regression results for banks that belong to different groups (proposed by Angbazo, 1997). Where size is taken into account, results indicate that large banks are better able to insulate books against interest rate risk by managing liabilities, while the superior performance of foreign banks could be attributed to their conservative lending practices and better access to foreign finance.","[Marinkovic, Srdan; Radovic, Ognjen] Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Nish, Serbia",University of Nis,"Marinkovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Nish, Serbia.",srdjan.marinkovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs,,"Radovic, Ognjen/0000-0001-7428-565X; Marinkovic, Srdan/0000-0001-9012-9454",,,,,39,13,15,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

A characterization of the most informative equilibria of such models is given. It is shown that editorial control never aids communication and that for small biases in the senders' preferences relative to those of the receiver, necessary and sufficient conditions for information transmission to be adversely affected are (i) that the senders have opposed preferences relative to the receiver and (ii) that both senders have powers of editorial control.

A MNE has a production subsidiary in one country, from where it sells the produced good locally as well as to a sales subsidiary in a second country. The latter subsidiary is engaged in duopolistic competition with a local competitor. The MNE has two aims in setting the transfer price: strategic delegation and tax minimization. We examine the extent to which the four transfer pricing regimes we set up allow the MNE to pursue these aims. While neither strategic delegation nor tax minimization will be eliminated, trade-offs are inevitable, albeit to varying degree.","[Nielsen, Soren Bo] Copenhagen Business Sch, DK-2000 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Nielsen, Soren Bo] CEPR, London, England; [Nielsen, Soren Bo] CESifo, Oxford, England",Copenhagen Business School; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Nielsen, SB (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, DK-2000 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",sbn.eco@cbs.dk,,,,,,,34,0,0,1,12,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Empirical analysis reveals evidence that all workers, except Hispanic males, earn significantly higher hourly wages when working for a supervisor of the same race and sex as themselves. Furthermore, the results suggest that sex has a larger impact on wages than race for workers with white supervisors, while race has a larger impact on wages than sex for workers with minority supervisors. Based on past research, we theorize that the degree of labour discrimination workers face may also be dependent upon the location and size of the firm in which they are employed. However, decomposing the samples by firm location and size suggests that these two factors cannot adequately explain the observed matched supervisor-worker wage effects, which supports the notion that these wage effects are largely driven by factors other than supervisor discrimination.","[Pitts, J.

The constraint is modeled as a proportional fine per unit of debt in excess of a specified reference value, resembling features of the Stability and Growth Pact. Sovereign debt is the result of myopic fiscal policy. It reduces welfare in the absence of lump-sum taxes. The paper shows that the borrowing constraint enhances welfare by reducing long run debt. In an economy calibrated to a generic OECD country, the maximum attainable welfare gain of debt consolidation, which is induced by imposing the optimally parameterized constraint, amounts to 0.5% in terms of consumption. The short run welfare costs of the constraint, which arise from restricting the use of debt to smooth taxes, are quantitatively negligible. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The argument to be developed is that the large number of new entrants to labor markets of African countries will likely be deprived of the labor skills necessary to allow them earn a livelihood. The demographic dividend will thus be denied and the consequences will be felt not only in Africa but in the world at large, most acutely in Europe. To prevent the rise of this disruptive power in Africa the paper, offers some novel ideas on how to redesign Official Development Assistance (ODA) so as to promote human capital investment.","Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Saavedra-Rivano, N (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan.",neantro@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2014,61.0,5,,,SI,,585,596,,10.2298/PAN1405585S,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AR8UI,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343849300005,0

The SBC also postulates a competitive market economy as the benchmark of hard budget constraint (HBC) and efficiency. A recent formal theory explains the SBC as a component of profit-maximizing strategic behaviour. From this perspective, the SBC can be integrated into the new microeconomics, but it loses its specific institutional connotation and its macroeconomic dimension.

Different from most previous studies, it comes to the conclusion that RMB nominal effective exchange rate has more influence on the tertiary industry than on the secondary industry, and it supports more strongly that RMB appreciation raises the tertiary industry's position in the national economy. The reform of exchange rate regime in 2005 has reduced the exchange rate's impact on economy, so a mature foreign exchange market is conducive to economic development.","[Wang, Boya; Liu, Siyue] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Res Div Int Finance, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Wang, BY (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Res Div Int Finance, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",boya@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,13,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

In particular, through the inoperability input-output model (IIM), the degree of failure in an economic system can be quantified on a scale from 0 (normal state) to 1 (complete failure). This paper develops a vulnerability index that builds upon the foundations of the Leontief input-output model and the IIM, which is capable of identifying and prioritizing the key sectors in the aftermath of disasters. The key sector prioritization framework proposed in this paper is expected to contribute to the domain of disaster preparedness planning, such as enhancing the efficiency of resource allocation across various sectors. The proposed vulnerability index is formulated in terms of three underlying components: (1) economic impact, (2) propagation length, and (3) sector size. The vulnerability index captures the impact of investments to various sectors in times of disaster in order to yield the maximum benefits to the entire economy. This paper considers a baseline scenario that assumes that the decision-maker has an equal preference for all index components. Using Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis, we investigated the extent to which the key sector rankings could fluctuate with respect to variations in the decision-maker preferences. Key sectors tend to be sensitive to the weight assignments across the three vulnerability index components; nevertheless, some sectors are less sensitive to such weight variations and may persist on their level of priority, independent of the scenario. Using the Philippine input-output data, we found that the private services sector is consistently a high-priority sector, the trade sector is a mid-priority sector while the real estate and ownership of dwellings sector tend to be a low-priority sector.","[Yu, Krista Danielle S.] De La Salle Univ, Sch Econ, Manila 1004, Philippines; [Yu, Krista Danielle S.; Santos, Joost R.] George Washington Univ, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Washington, DC USA; [Tan, Raymond R.; Aviso, Kathleen B.; Promentilla, Michael Angelo B.] De La Salle Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Ctr Engn & Sustainable Dev Res, Manila 1004, Philippines",De La Salle University; George Washington University; De La Salle University,"Yu, KDS (通讯作者)，De La Salle Univ, Sch Econ, Manila 1004, Philippines.",krista.yu@dlsu.edu.ph,"Aviso, Kathleen/ABA-4589-2020; Yu, Krista/AAG-6259-2020; Promentilla, Michael/AAH-5265-2020; Santos, Joost/AAH-1466-2019","Aviso, Kathleen/0000-0002-9994-5172; Yu, Krista/0000-0002-3001-1793; Promentilla, Michael/0000-0002-9009-8552;",,,,,53,25,29,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

It is desirable, on welfare grounds, to limit patent protection along both dimensions, namely by limiting patent length and capping the price of patented products.

Not only are inequalities in wealth and labor productivity a feature of most societies, but also financial markets suffer from many well-known frictions. This paper demonstrates that, when households face borrowing constraints and uninsurable idiosyncratic shocks to income, the welfare implications of financial liberalization are considerable. For instance, the average increase in welfare of a typical emerging market economy that switches from a closed capital market to perfect capital mobility is equivalent to a permanent increase in average consumption of roughly 5.4%. This is about 3.9 times more than the welfare gains of the same policy under a complete markets environment without any individual heterogeneity. We show that individual heterogeneity accounts for two thirds of this additional increase in the average welfare gain; market incompleteness accounts for the remaining third. In our calibration, the median household in capital-scarce countries is in favor of international financial integration. However, if the pivotal voter is wealthy enough then such reform might not be implemented, since richer households have a vested interest in capital market closedness.","[Antunes, Antonio A.] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Cavalcanti, Tiago V.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",Banco de Portugal; University of Cambridge,"Antunes, AA (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal.",antunesaa@gmail.com; tvdvc2@cam.ac.uk,,"Antunes, Antonio/0000-0002-7541-297X",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,64,10,10,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We exploit a Swedish reform which reduced UI duration from 90 to 60 weeks for a group of older unemployed workers in a setting where workers who exhausted their benefits received unchanged transfers if they agreed to participate in a work practice program. Our results show that job finding increased as a result of the shorter duration of passive benefits. The time profile of the job-finding effects suggests that the results are due to deterrence during the program-entry phase. We find no impact on ensuing job durations or wages, suggesting that the increased job-finding rate was driven by increased search intensity rather than lower reservation wages.

This introduces an endogenous location dependent temperature function, driving spatial characteristics, in terms of location dependent damages resulting from local temperature anomalies into the standard climate-economy framework. We solve the social planner's problem and characterize the competitive equilibrium for two polar cases differentiated by the degree of market integration. We define optimal taxes on fossil fuel use and how they may implement the planning solution. Our results suggest that if the implementation of international transfers across latitudes is not possible then optimal taxes are in general spatially non-homogeneous and may be lower at poorer latitudes. The degree of spatial differentiation of optimal taxes depends on heat transportation. By employing the properties of the spatial model, we show by numerical simulations how the impact of thermal transport across latitudes on welfare can be studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While the contents of neuroeconomic models and evidence are obviously different than in traditional economics, (some of the) goals are identical: to explain and predict choice, the effects of comparative statics, and perhaps make interesting new welfare judgments that are defensible. To this end, Paul Glimcher's important book carefully describes how economics, psychological, and neural levels of explanation can be linked (a structure which has been successful in visual neuroscience). As Glimcher shows, the neural evidence is quite strong for a process of learning valuations through prediction error, and a simple model of neural valuation and comparison that corresponds to random utility (though subject to normalization, which produces menu effects). There is also rapidly growing evidence for more complicated constructs in behavioral economics, including prospect theory's account of risky choice, hyperbolic time discounting, level-k models of games, and social preferences corresponding to internal reward based on what happens to other agents.","CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",California Institute of Technology,"Camerer, CF (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",,,,,,,,142,12,15,1,62,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

I argue that many ideas about this period need to be revisited. In particular, my evidence (which uses archival work to describe market microstructures) shows the importance of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) as a Court of Arbitration. I show how the LSE General Purpose Committee set up a system of Collective Action Clauses, requiring majority agreement among bondholders to permit market access.

A possible explanation is that the literature focuses on the average behavior of unemployment and assumes that the speed of adjustment towards its long-run equilibrium is constant, regardless of the magnitudes and signs of shocks. This paper seeks to re-examine the dynamics of the unemployment rates in terms of shocks for 12 OECD countries. A newly developed quantile unit root test by Galvao (2009) is applied to show potential asymmetric responses of unemployment to shocks over various quantiles, depending on the size and sign of the shocks that hit the unemployment rate. Our results suggest that generally, the unemployment rates are not only stationary but also exhibit obvious asymmetric behavior, in the sense that in the lower quantiles, negative shocks with large absolute value tend to induce faster speed of adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium, while in the upper quantiles, large positive shocks do not, and hysteresis exists. These findings can explain why unemployment rates display the behavior of fast rises and slow falls. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A large body of literature tries to understand and quantify the value of DINs to help policy makers justify investments in new or improved infrastructures. The prevailing methodological approach is to depict DINs as an observable production input changing the uncertainty regarding the performance of an economic system. In such context, the value of DINs is typically measured with regression techniques between the penetration rate of DINs and economic growth. This approach provides too little insight on the actual causality between DINs and economic value. We recently developed a framework that identified 13 different ways (capabilities) how users convert information into economic value. In this article, we show how a simple quadratic relation (Metcalfe's law) can be used to quantify how adequate these capabilities are in converting the ability to access information into economic value. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Metcalfe's law is empirically validated as such. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

With virtually no room for macroeconomic manoeuvring since the crisis onset, fiscal austerity has been the main instrument for achieving reduction of public debt levels; but because austerity also weakens growth, public debt ratios have barely budged. Austerity has also implied continued high private debt ratios, and these debt burdens have perpetuated economic stasis. Economic theory, history, and the recent experience all call for a principled debt restructuring mechanism as an integral element of the Eurozone design. Sovereign debt should be recognized as equity (a residual claim on the sovereign), operationalized by the automatic lowering the debt burden upon the breach of contractually specified thresholds. Making debt more equity-like is also the way forward for speedy private deleveraging. This debtequity swap principle is a needed shock absorber for the future but will also serve as the principle to deal with the overhang of legacy debt.","Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Mody, A (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",amody@Princeton.edu,,,,,,,71,11,11,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Capitalists responded to this profitability crisis by attempting to restore their rate of profit by a variety of strategies, including: wages and benefit cuts, inflation, speed-up on the job, and globalization. These strategies have largely restored the rate of profit, but have resulted in stagnant real wages for workers for decades. As a result, household indebtedness has increased to unprecedented levels and must be substantially reduced in order to make possible a sustainable recovery.","Mt Holyoke Coll, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA",Mount Holyoke College,"Moseley, F (通讯作者)，Mt Holyoke Coll, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA.",fmoseley@mtholyoke.edu,,,,,,,7,5,6,0,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

This article analyses the issue of programme diversification, using a panel of 181 Portuguese higher education institutions over the period 1995 to 2007, by comparing the behaviour of public and private institutions. The results show that the legal status of institutions is the major determinant of programme diversification, as private institutions are far more specialized than their public counterparts. The study also evaluates the role of other institutional variables, such as the institution's size, age, location, institutional mission and research intensity, to explain differences in the diversification behaviour of higher education institutions.

Whereas the price interaction is widely recognized and has been thoroughly discussed, the effect of an overlapping instrument on the abatement attributable to an instrument has gained little attention. This paper estimates the actual reduction in demand for European Union Allowances that has occurred due to RE deployment focusing on the German electricity sector, for the five years 2006 through 2010. Based on a unit commitment model we estimate that CO2 emissions from the German electricity sector are reduced by 35 to 60 Mtons, or 10% to 18% of what estimated emissions would have been without any RE policy but with the CO2 price remaining in place at the observed level. Furthermore, we find that the abatement attributable to RE injections is greater in the presence of an allowance price than otherwise. The same holds for the ETS effect in presence of RE injection. This interaction effect is consistently positive for the German electricity system, at least for the considered years, and on the order of 0.5% to 1.5% of emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The main research problem was formulated as follows: Do the instruments of supporting entrepreneurship used by self-government affect the development of economic initiatives in the area of the surveyed communes? We analyzed it in two areas. The first one focuses on the present state, analyzing the quality and directions of actions taken by commune authorities in supporting economic initiatives as well as their results. The second one attempts at pointing the solutions conducive to enterprise development and instruments ensuring their stimulation. The results of the conducted analyses allowed us to assess the effectiveness of the instruments supporting entrepreneurship used by local government units. The main conclusion derived from the research is that the use of fiscal instruments does not constitute the strongest factor in determining the location of economic activity. The use of tax forms of support dependant on the economic situation turns out to be much less important than the use of solutions such as improvement of infrastructure conditions, selection of areas for investment, lease of commune facilities for economic activities, creation of capital back-up comprised of loan funds, as well as implementation of organizational changes aiming at better efficiency of the office.","[Wolowiec, Tomasz] Univ Econ & Innovat, Lublin, Poland; [Skica, Tomasz] Univ Informat Technol & Management, Dept Finance, Rzeszow, Poland; [Skica, Tomasz] Inst Financial Res & Anal, Rzeszow, Poland",University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow; University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow,"Wolowiec, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Innovat, Lublin, Poland.",wolowiectomek@gmail.com; tskica@wsiz.rzeszow.pl,"wolowiec, tomasz/F-4148-2018","wolowiec, tomasz/0000-0002-7688-4231",,,,,31,8,8,0,21,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The article describes four case studies of export emergence in differentiated-good sectors in Argentina, namely wine, television programs, motorboats, and wooden furniture. The case studies rely primarily on an extensive set of interviews. We find that consistent exporters to developed countries adopt a new set of business practices that differ starkly from those that prevail in their domestic market. In three of the sectors, an export pioneer led the adoption of these new practices. Export pioneers possessed tacit knowledge about foreign markets, achieved through their previous embeddedness in the business community of those markets. Export emergence occurs as business practices diffuse throughout the sector. These findings point to the importance of foreign market knowledge, relative to production knowledge, as the key constraint to achieve consistent export to developed countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Rather it comes through the promotion of the tradability of goods, capital in particular: specifically, the encouragement of price competition, contestable home markets, ability to borrow and buy insurance at home, and the harmonization of regulations. Some of the consumption smoothing may also depend on EU membership rather than EMU as such but EMU adds to it.

We construct gravity equations for the two product margins motivated by Chaney (2008). The empirical results show that standard gravity variables provide good explanatory power for bilateral trade on both margins. Importantly, we show that the impact of the WTO is concentrated almost exclusively on the extensive product margin of trade, i.e. trade in goods that were not previously traded. In our preferred specification, WTO membership increases the extensive margin of exports by 25%. At the same time, WTO membership has a negative impact on the intensive margin. Based on novel comparative statics results about how fixed and variable trade costs impact the product margins of trade, our results suggest that WTO membership works by reducing primarily the fixed rather than the variable costs of trade.

The effects of four groups of variables, including bank-specific characteristics, ownership, transitional environment and macroeconomic conditions on the profitability of banks, are analysed using a Tobit model to account for the censored nature of the efficiency scores. The model is estimated using a two-step instrumental-variable method as a regressor is endogenous. The findings show that the profit efficiency of a bank is enhanced by a larger size and better management ability, while it is hampered by low quality of assets and a too high level of capitalisation. High growth in per-capita GDP and a low-inflation rate provide a favourable environment for banks to improve their profitability. The study also finds that among the foreign banks operating in Vietnam, those headquartered in Australia, Japan, the US and Europe perform better than those headquartered in Asia as well as the domestic banks. Finally, the study suggests that in order to optimise their performance while remaining secure, banks should maintain the ratio of equity over total assets between 4% and 14%.","[Ha Vu; Nahm, Daehoon] Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Vu, H (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",ha.vu@mq.edu.au,"Nahm, Daehoon/N-2759-2016","Nahm, Daehoon/0000-0003-0147-6425; Vu, Ha/0000-0003-2599-1851",,,,,31,35,36,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

In this paper we test the Chinese provincial panel data for the period 1978-2002 against the predictions from the technology diffusion model. We find that the estimated coefficient on initial real GDP per worker is negative and significant, showing strong evidence of conditional convergence; the estimated coefficients on secondary school human capital investment rate and labor force growth are positive and negative respectively, significant at the 5% level, in both LSDV (Least squares dummy variables) estimation and system GMM (Generalized method of moments) estimation that overcomes the endogeneity of these variables. The test accepts that the estimate coefficients on physical capital and human capital investment rates are equal, with absolute magnitudes about half of that on labor force growth in LSDV estimation. The estimated coefficient on the FDI to GDP ratio that captures technology diffusion is insignificant in LSDV estimation but becomes significant in system GMM estimation. All these are consistent with the technology diffusion model (and the augmented Solow model). Therefore, the reform period Chinese provincial panel data may be reliable for growth regressions.","[He, Qichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Meng] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; Beijing Normal University,"He, QC (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qichunhe@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,11,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Tobit analysis reveals that economic equality increases weighted medal shares, while political equality is associated with lower success, ceteris paribus. The inverse relationship between political equality and Olympic success becomes manifest once nations reach the 58th percentile in political equality, a category associated with high degrees of overall gender equality. A nonlinear relationship between composite gender equality and Olympic success is found, with 71% of complete equality maximizing weighted medal shares and further increases in equality lowering success, all else equal.","[Potts, T.] Indiana Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Indiana, PA 15705 USA; [Edwards, R.] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Indiana University of Pennsylvania; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Potts, T (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Indiana, PA 15705 USA.",todd.potts@iup.edu,,,,,,,8,2,2,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The fixed-price FIT (FFIT), which guarantee a fixed price for every unit of produced electricity and the premium based FIT (PFIT), which pay a premium on top of the market price are commonly implemented in the EU. Costs for balancing intermittent electricity production may be significantly higher with FFIT than with PFIT, and FFIT do not provide any incentive to produce electricity when marginal production costs are high. In contrast, PFIT do provide strong incentives to better match renewable power output with marginal production costs in the system. The purpose of this article is to assess the effects of the two tariff schemes on the choice of wind turbine locations. In an analytical model, we show that both the covariance between wind power supply and demand as well as between the different wind power locations matter for investors in a PFIT scheme. High covariance with other intermittent producers causes a decrease in market prices and consequently in revenues for wind power investors. They are therefore incentivized to diversify the locations of wind turbines to decrease the covariance between different wind power production locations. In an empirical optimization model, we analyze the effects of these two different schemes in a policy experiment for Austria. The numerical results show that under a PFIT scheme, (1) spatial diversification is incentivized, (2) the covariance of wind power production with marginal electricity production costs increases, and (3) the variances of the wind power output and of residual load decrease if wind power deployment attains 10% of total national electricity consumption.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE; ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; NIPPON TELEGRAPH,"This study discusses a new use of window analysis for DEA environmental assessment in a time horizon where DEA stands for Data Envelopment Analysis. The data sets on environmental protection are often structured by time series. In applying DEA to environmental assessment, it is necessary for us to examine a frontier shift between different periods because it indicates a technology progress on desirable and undesirable outputs. An important feature of the proposed approach is that it incorporates the concept of natural and managerial disposability into the computational framework of DEA and extends the two disposability concepts in a time horizon. To capture the frontier shift, this study proposes a new type of DEA window analysis for environmental assessment. This study applies the proposed DEA window analysis to a data set on U.S. coal-fired power plants during 1995-2007. The application finds that the coal-fired power plants have gradually paid attention to environmental protections under Clean Air Act (CAA). Consequently, their performance under managerial disposability has increased from 1996 to 2007. This indicates the importance of CAA and regulation on industrial pollutions. Thus, it is necessary for the United States to extend the scope of CAA for controlling the amount of CO2 emission because current regulation has a limited policy influence on the source of global warming and climate change in our modem society.

Using a parametric quadratic directional distance function, we evaluate the inefficiency and shadow price of CO2 for 124 power enterprises in 2004, applying deterministic and econometric methods. A regression analysis is undertaken to examine the factors that drive shadow prices. Our results indicate that there are large inefficiencies in terms of electricity production and CO2 emissions. The shadow price is a negative function of firm size, age, and coal share, and is positively correlated with the technology level. This correlation between shadow prices and its determinants is not sensitive to changing assumptions regarding directional vectors, although such changes do alter the distribution of shadow prices. The large variation witnessed in shadow prices across power enterprises argues in favor of market-based regulation such as an emissions trading system as opposed to the command-and-control regulation currently used in China to minimize overall abatement cost.

We find that the jumps in the currency markets are closely connected with significant economic and political events.","[Li, Xiao-Ping] Shanghai Lixin Univ Commerce, China Lixin Risk Management Res Inst, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chun-Yang; Wu, Chong-Feng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Finance, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China",Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Li, XP (通讯作者)，Shanghai Lixin Univ Commerce, China Lixin Risk Management Res Inst, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",lxp.mzz@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,1,1,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We show theoretically that dynamic interactions between elastic credit supply (due to leveraged borrowing) and persistent credit demand (due to consumption habit) can generate a multiplier-accelerator mechanism that transforms a one-time productivity or financial shock into large and long-lasting boom-bust cycles. The predictions are consistent with the basic features of investment booms and the consequent asset-market crashes led by credit expansions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Being unemployed has a significant negative effect on life satisfaction; (in)voluntary retirement on the other hand has no significant effect on life satisfaction. A new finding is that unemployed individuals underestimate future life satisfaction. That is, their current labor market status has temporary negative effects on well-being, but, after 5 years, individuals are happier with their life than previously anticipated.

But large-scale purchases of bonds by the Federal Reserve, and other major central banks, have significantly reduced the scale and maturity of public debt that would otherwise have been held by the private sector. We present new evidence that tilting the maturity structure of private-sector holdings significantly influences term premia, even outside crisis times. Our framework helps explain both the bond yield conundrum and the effectiveness of quantitative easing. We suggest that these findings raise two important policy questions. One is: should a central bank, contrary to recent orthodoxy, use its balance sheet as an additional complementary instrument of monetary policy to influence, as part of the monetary transmission mechanism, the long-term interest rate? The second is: how should central banks and governments ensure that debt management properly takes account of the implications for both monetary and financial stability?.","[Chadha, Jagjit S.] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Turner, Philip; Zampolli, Fabrizio] Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland",University of Kent; Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Chadha, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.",jsc@kent.ac.uk; philip.turner@bis.org; fabrizio.zampolli@bis.org,,"Chadha, Jagjit/0000-0001-7549-9027",,,,,72,5,5,2,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The Slowdown in Health Care Spending,BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Why have health care costs moderated in the last decade? Some have suggested that the Great Recession alone was the cause, but health expenditure growth in the depths of the recession was nearly identical to growth prior to the recession. Nor can the Affordable Care Act (ACA) take credit, since the slowdown began prior to its implementation. Instead, we identify three primary causes of the slowdown: the rise in high-deductible insurance plans, state-level efforts to control Medicaid costs, and a general slowdown in the diffusion of new technology, particularly for use by the Medicare population. A more difficult question is: Will this slowdown continue? On this question we are pessimistic, and not entirely because a similar (and temporary) slowdown occurred in the early 1990s. The primary determinant of long-term growth is the continued development of expensive technology, and there is little evidence of a permanent slowdown in that pipeline. Proton beam accelerators are on target to double between 2010 and 2014, while the market for heart-assist devices (costing more than $300,000 each) is projected to grow rapidly. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) and emboldened insurance companies may yet stifle health care cost growth, but our best estimate over the next two decades is that health care costs will grow at GDP plus 1.2 percent, a rate lower than previous estimates but still on track to cause serious fiscal pain for taxpayers and workers who bear the costs of higher premiums.","[Chandra, Amitabh; Holmes, Jonathan] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Skinner, Jonathan] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Harvard University; Dartmouth College,"Chandra, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,"NIA NIH HHS [U01 AG046830, P01 AG019783] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,2,17,19,1,15,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The nominal exchange rate generally accounts for over 50 percent of the aggregate real effective exchange rate fluctuations, but this conclusion does not apply to three of nine industries. We apply the industry-specific REER to re-examine the relationship between the exchange rate and trade, and find that the industry-specific REER index performs better than the traditional aggregate REER index.

One of the most critical consisting parts of the market's capacity are market niches, the fulfilment of which depends on market openness or closeness. In the opened market there is a possibility of reproduction, while for the closed market the saturation is more typical. However, reproduction and saturation have one similar feature: both influence the beginning of a crisis. The main difference between reproduction and saturation is in reproduction's possibility to create a new market niches driven by globalization, innovation and the growth of the living standards of population. A creation of the new market niche in case of saturation is not possible because of the consumers' expectations. The return on investments in the closed market is growing exactly at the moment when the market niche approaches zero. At the same time people tend to invest into this market with a hope to get the highest profits. This finally leads to the bubble formation.

Wealthy locals are more likely to choose private schools and vote for a lower tax rate to finance public education. In contrast, high-skilled immigrants tend to reinforce the public system. The optimal immigration policy is highly skill-biased. The admission of high-skilled immigrants expedites redistribution toward the less-skilled local households through both a stronger fiscal support for public education and a reduction in the skill wage premium.

We empirically investigate the interplay between different institutional qualities and fiscal policy, and their effect on resource-abundant economies' growth. In particular, the study contributes to the existing literature by disentangling the indirect effect of institutions on growth through the quality of fiscal performance transmission channel. Using yearly panel data on 79 resource and non-resource countries for the period 1984-2008, we find that the quality of fiscal policy - and not the quantity (government size) - matters to growth in the group of resource-rich countries. We also find that not all types of socio-economic and political institutions impact growth in the same manner.

A detailed examination of the magnitude, determinants, and implications of this decline delivers five conclusions. First, about a third of the decline in the published labor share appears to be an artifact of statistical procedures used to impute the labor income of the self-employed that underlies the headline measure. Second, movements in labor's share are not solely a feature of recent U.S. history: The relative stability of the aggregate labor share prior to the 1980s in fact veiled substantial, though offsetting, movements in labor shares within industries. By contrast, the recent decline has been dominated by the trade and manufacturing sectors. Third, U.S. data provide limited support for neoclassical explanations based on the substitution of capital for (unskilled) labor to exploit technical change embodied in new capital goods. Fourth, prima facie evidence for institutional explanations based on the decline in unionization is inconclusive. Finally, our analysis identifies offshoring of the labor-intensive component of the U.S. supply chain as a leading potential explanation of the decline in the U.S. labor share over the past 25 years.","[Elsby, Michael W.

Through rigorous exercises involving robust regressions, quantile regressions and nonparametric matching methods, we find that the wage premium of exporting activities is not a prevailing phenomenon in China. It is related to the heterogeneous characteristics of the firms such as ownership, export-orientation and locations.

Cobb-Douglas production function has been adopted for almost one hundred years, while modern economists tend to analyze the economy via the aspect of individual agents. A different perspective of reviewing Cobb-Douglas function is needed. This paper finds a closer relationship between electricity consumption and economy, which can be represented via a strong similarity between four characteristics of genes. A second finding is that countries after post-industrialization should enter the phase of up-industrialization, which largely focuses on technology accumulated value added for the secondary industry. Case study in this paper illustrates that the U.S. is entering the up-industrialization period. Countries that deemphasize on technology innovations will sooner or later result in severe economic consequences or financial crisis. This paper also initially encourages the wide application of smart meters and integration of smart grid to obtain timely and accurate data of electricity consumption to observe unusual economic activities.

I discuss three alternative definitions: the deviation of output from its long-run stochastic trend (i.e., the Beveridge-Nelson cycle); the deviation of output from the level consistent with current technologies and normal utilization of capital and labor input (i.e., the production-function approach); and the deviation of output from flexible-price output (i.e., its natural rate). Estimates of each concept are presented from a dynamic-stochastic-general-equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy used at the Federal Reserve Board. Four points are emphasized: The DSGE model's estimate of the gap (for each definition) is very similar to gaps from policy institutions, but the model's estimate of potential growth has a higher variance and substantially different covariance with GDP growth; the change in the Beveridge-Nelson trend covaries negatively with the change in the gap in the DSGE model, providing a structural model estimate of a controversial parameter; in this model, estimates of the natural-rate concept are similar to those based on the Beveridge-Nelson and production function approaches; and the estimate of the output gap, irrespective of definition, is closely related to unemployment fluctuations.

This policy change postponed restructuring and exacerbated the soft budget constraint problem of the SEEs. While the installation of a new government in March 2011 has increased prospects for economic development, sustainable growth still requires full-scale structural reform of the SEEs and institutional infrastructure building.

By announcing information on non-insurable aggregate risk, the policy maker distorts households' incentives for insurance of idiosyncratic risk and increases the riskiness of the optimal self-enforceable allocation. The negative effect of distorted insurance incentives can be quantitatively important for a monetary authority that reveals changes in its short-run inflation target.

There are many forecasting models which were developed and successfully predicted the diffusion of long lifecycle product, but there are very few forecasting models which were developed for predicting new products with short lifecycle. Assumption of these models is always the growth of products follows an S-shaped curve. As for the products which were just introduced to the market, it is very difficult to identify if they follow an S-shaped curve with their limited historical data. This research aims to apply Grey system theory to predict the diffusion of mobile cellular broadband and fixed broadband in Taiwan since Grey system theory has a characteristic which requires very limited primitive data (the least 4 data) to build a differential forecasting model. We use penetration as an indicator to describe the diffusion of new products. The numerical data show that the Grey forecasting models GM (1,1) built in this paper have higher prediction accuracy than logistic models and grey Verhulst models. Moreover, we apply Lotka-Volterra model to analyze the competitive relationship between mobile cellular broadband and fixed broadband. The empirical data show that the relationship is commensalism rather than predator-prey. These results can be extended to contribute to other researches. (C) 2013 The Author.

This paper assesses the responses of US house prices to an exogenous credit supply shock and compares them with the effects from variations in credit supply associated with a bank lending channel. The contribution of the study is twofold. First, innovations in credit supply are identified using a mortgage mix variable, thereby accounting for the market-based financial intermediaries. As a robustness check a survey variable of bank lending standards for mortgage loans is also used. Second, the policy-induced credit supply effect on house prices is disentangled and compared with the effect from an exogenous credit supply shock. It is shown that in the first 3 years credit supply shocks affect house prices exogenously rather than through the bank lending channel. Monetary policy has still a large impact on house prices, even when the bank lending channel is 'turned off'. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To avoid classic moral hazard problems and to insure the guarantors against default, each country would pay a risk premium conditional on economic fundamentals to a joint debt management agency. This suggests that these bonds be called euro-insurance bonds. While the sovereign debt markets have taken increasing account of the economic fundamentals, the signal-to-noise ratio has been weakened by huge market volatility, so undercutting incentives for appropriate reforms and obscuring economic realities for voters. This paper uses an econometric model to show that competitiveness, public and private debt to GDP, and the fall-out from housing market crises are the most relevant economic fundamentals. Formula-based risk spreads based on these fundamentals would provide clear incentives for governments to be more oriented towards economic reforms to promote long-run growth than mere fiscal contraction. Putting more weight on incentives that come from risk spreads, than on fiscal centralization and the associated heavy bureaucratic procedures, would promote the principle of subsidiarity to which member states subscribe. The paper compares euro-insurance bonds incorporating these risk spreads with other policy proposals.","[Muellbauer, John] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Muellbauer, John] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Muellbauer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",john.muellbauer@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,11,11,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The econometric analysis finds no evidence suggesting that import penetration of manufactured goods from China has a statistically significant effect on real manufacturing wages (skilled, unskilled and total) in either developed or developing economies.

Hence agents may switch status over time from investors to workers and vice versa. Agents can issue equity up to a given fraction, so they can partially finance their investment costs externally and are in effect borrowing constrained. I characterize steady states and transitional dynamics in this environment and analyze the effects on allocations, asset prices and returns of a sudden, unexpected credit crunch: an exogenous, unanticipated decrease in the maximum fraction of investment costs that can be financed externally. I find that this type of unexpected shock generates a sizeable contraction in output and investment and produces a heterogeneous response in the return on assets, depending on the evolution of agents' status through time.

We test the model against linear-detrended data and reestimate it by indirect inference; the resulting model passes the Wald test only on outputs in the two countries. We then extract the model's implied residuals on unfiltered data to replicate how the model predicts the crisis. Banking shocks worsen the crisis but 'traditional' shocks explain the bulk of the crisis; the non-stationarity of the productivity shocks plays a key role. Crises occur when there is a 'run' of bad shocks; based on this sample Great Recessions occur on average once every quarter century. Financial shocks on their own, even when extreme, do not cause crises-provided the government acts swiftly to counteract such a shock as happened in this sample.","[Vo Phuong Mai Le] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Meenagh, David; Minford, Patrick; Ou, Zhirong] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",University of Sheffield; Cardiff University,"Ou, ZR (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, B14 Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",V.Le@sheffield.ac.uk; OuZ@cardiff.ac.uk,"Ou, Zhirong/HKE-3122-2023","Ou, Zhirong/0000-0002-4610-7183; Meenagh, David/0000-0002-9930-7947; Minford, Anthony Patrick L./0000-0003-2499-935X",,,,,31,3,3,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Countries with better institutions qualities as captured by the World Banks' Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) tend to attract more scientists and engineers into the research field and to spend more on R&D as well. This paper has also found evidence that the effect of institutions varies in different economies characterized by different levels of financial development and human capital accumulation, but stays relatively unchanged across countries with different levels of trade openness.

This paper studies these phenomena through a model in which the median voter elects a leader anticipating that he will impose institutional constraints-such as constitutional amendments, judicial appointments, or the implicit threat of a coup-that influence the behavior of future political challengers. It is typically optimal for the median voter to elect an extreme incumbent when democracy is less fully consolidated, when the costs of imposing institutional constraints are intermediate, and when the distribution of potential challengers is asymmetric. The median voter typically elects a more right-wing incumbent when the distribution of potential challengers shifts to the left. Implications of the model for the consolidation of democracy and institutional constraints are discussed, as are several related mechanisms through which politicians' ability to affect institutions may lead voters to optimally elect extremists.

First, in explicitly recognizing how optimizing behavior, particularly in the form of residential sorting, can lead to nonrandom assignment of pollution, economists have employed a wide range of quasi-experimental techniques to develop causal estimates of the effect of pollution. Second, economic research has placed a considerable focus on the role of avoidance behavior, which is an important component for understanding the difference between biological and behavioral effects of pollution and for proper welfare calculations. Lastly, economic research has expanded the focus of analysis beyond traditional health outcomes to include measures of human capital, including labor supply, productivity, and cognition. Our review of the quasi-experimental evidence on this topic suggests that pollution does indeed have a wide range of effects on individual well-being, even at levels well below current regulatory standards. Given the importance of health and human capital as an engine for economic growth, these findings underscore the role of environmental conditions as an important factor of production.","[Zivin, Joshua Graff] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Zivin, Joshua Graff; Neidell, Matthew] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neidell, Matthew] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,"Zivin, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,"Zivin, Joshua Graff/ABF-1697-2020","Graff Zivin, Joshua/0000-0002-0820-4900",,,,,145,265,304,10,111,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

We show that the more dispersed the distribution of income within a region, the more the region benefits from a decentralized provision of the education-related public good, in terms of higher accumulation of human capital. Nevertheless we show that, with decentralization, there exists a trade-off between accumulation of human capital and equality in the distribution of income among citizens within a region: a region that accumulates more (less) human capital with decentralization, exhibits also higher (lower) interpersonal inequality among its citizens.

The endogeneity of the implicit game substantially alters the incentive structure faced by agents. If agents can refuse to play a game and instead seek a different partner, then it becomes in their interest to be the sort of player with whom a high quality partner will agree to play. Formally, we explore games which are endogenous in the sense that players first choose to learn a specific set of strategies to play with future partners, and then enter a matching process to find a suitable partner. We find that in coordination games, the only equilibria involve all agents learning the exact same single strategy and playing this with the first partner they meet. Applying this to culture and language, our results imply that if there are benefits from interacting with similar agents then there is a strong bias towards assimilation and the emergence of a single culture (that is, all agents use the endogenous game structure to learn or adopt only a single common culture or language). This result can be overturned, however, by such factors as heritage, cultural affinities, caste, and government policies. Finally, we show that if agents benefit from interacting with agents dissimilar from themselves (we call this a discoordination game), not only will different cultures coexist, but also there must necessarily arise a class of cultural market makers who specialize in bridging the cultural divide.

Particularly when opportunities for advancement are unequally presented to people, this transformation may be accompanied by polarization and violent conflict. We illustrate this point by describing the processes of land privatization in Sub-Saharan Africa and then present two models that capture some salient aspects of this transformation in rural communities, including the possibility of polarization. We find that the support of egalitarian norms is notably strong when new opportunities are available for only a few people or when the community is socially unstable.

Employed individuals are more likely to participate in lottery syndicates than unemployed individuals, and females are more likely to play lottery games syndicated than males. The evidence supports both economic and sociological motives for syndicated play; informational problems appear to be an important barrier to the formation of lottery syndicates.

By using a panel data set for virtually all incorporated Swedish businesses over 1990-2009, a period which includes a full-scale banking crisis, we find strong evidence for a substantial and stable impact from aggregate fluctuations on business defaults. A standard logit model with financial ratios augmented with macroeconomic factors can account surprisingly well for the outburst in business defaults during the banking crisis, as well as the subsequent fluctuations in default frequencies. Moreover, the effects ofmacroeconomic variables differ across industries in an economically intuitiveway. Out-of- sample evaluations show that our approach is superior to models that exclude macro information and standard well-fitting time-series models. Our analysis shows that firm-specific factors are useful in ranking firms' relative riskiness, but that macroeconomic factors are necessary to understand fluctuations in the absolute risk level.","[Roszbach, Kasper] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,,tor.jacobson@riksbank.se; jesper.l.linde@frb.gov; kasper.roszbach@riksbank.se,,"Roszbach, Kasper/0000-0002-2489-004X",,,,,24,33,37,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We show the solution of these problems depend upon the belief structure. Agents' beliefs are described by individual state variables and satisfy three Rationality Axioms, leading to the emergence of an aggregate state variable named mean market state of belief. In equilibrium, endogenous variables are functions of mean market belief and this state variable is the tool used to solve the aggregation problems. Diverse beliefs alter the problem faced by a central bank since the source of fluctuations is not only exogenous shocks but also market expectations. Due to diverse beliefs the effects of policy instruments are not monotonic and the trade-off between inflation and output volatilities is complex. Also, monetary policy can counter the effects of market belief by aggressive anti-inflation policy but at the cost of increased volatility of financial markets and individual consumption.

We keep our ABM as close as possible to the original New Keynesian (NM) model, but we model the individual behaviour of the agents under procedural rationality a la Simon. Accordingly, we assume that their behaviour is guided by simple rules of thumb - or heuristics - while a continuous learning process governs the evolution of those rules. Under these assumptions that also allow the emergence of agents heterogeneity, we analyze the dynamics of the economy without assuming rational expectations, and study the role that a central bank, implementing an inflation targeting regime via a monetary policy rule, can play in the orientation of these dynamics. Consequently, our main goal is to analyse the interplay between the learning mechanisms operating at the individual level and the features and performances of the inflation targeting regime. Our results point to the prime importance of the credibility of central bank's inflation target regarding macroeconomic stabilisation, as well as the beneficial role played by that target as an anchoring device for private inflation expectations. We also establish the potential welfare cost of imperfect public information and contribute to the current debate on optimal monetary policy rules under imperfect common knowledge and uncertainty.

Overall, the impacts of the ETS were not significantly adverse. Although the fuel tax had similar impacts to the ETS on key macro-variables such as real GDP, employment, household consumption, exports and imports, it was however not effective compared to the latter in reducing emissions. Neither policy led to inflation growth of more than 0.8% for any coal mining and non-mining Australian state. At the sectoral level, the GDP growth of energy-intensive industries such as coal, iron ore, steel and coal-powered electricity generators is adversely affected while electricity generators who use gas and renewable energy sources and the forestry sector gain. It was also found that a 10% technological change in the renewable energy sector over a decade did not significantly improve the outcome when coupled with the ETS. Thus the Australian government's industry assistance to invest in low pollution technologies needs to be more aggressive to meet current and future international emission abatement targets.

Because oil is fungible, U.S. pricing and import policies can differentiate only between domestic and imported oil rather than between stable and unstable sources.

Our analysis suggests that the relationship between oil prices and macroeconomic activity is nonlinear and exhibits an asymmetric pattern: oil price changes have a significant effect on inflation and output when the change exceeds a certain threshold level. The lower response of macroeconomic variables to oil price shocks in the low oil price change regime also indicates that only the shocks exceeding the optimal threshold level are able to create a contraction in the economic activity.

We find that deregulation can significantly improve the efficiency of electricity production, increase employment and enhance household welfare. These nontrivial findings can help to resolve many controversies about governmental intervention during China's economic transition.

In this paper we recommend that Asian economies hold each other's currencies as part of their foreign reserves. Different from crisis-fighting currency swap arrangements or crisis-rescuing fund mechanisms, this mechanism means that reserves would be held, with a regular arrangement in place and on an ongoing basis. We propose that the global reserve system should be pushed in the direction of diversification, which could be a transitional step toward a new single reserve system. This mechanism would not necessitate any currency being a globally accepted reserve currency but would mean that every currency carried some weight in the reserve system. Establishment of such a system would require significant development of regional bond markets and facilitation of macroeconomic surveillance among the economies.","[Fan, Gang] Natl Econ Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bijun] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yiping] Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Peking University,"Fan, G (通讯作者)，Natl Econ Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",neri2@neri.org.cn; wangbijun007@126.com; yhuang@ccer.edu.cn,"Yang, Jie/JDM-6213-2023","Yang, Jie/0000-0002-3941-0053",,,,,22,2,2,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL,2013,21.0,4,,,,,14,35,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12026.x,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,180BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321566600002,0

Recent macro-economic turmoil has reinforced the trend. This paper explains the decrease based on credit supply and demand considerations by 1) presenting stylized facts regarding the evolution of the banks' sources and fund use in 2005 to 2011, noting two different cycles of external capital flows, and 2) estimating private credit supply and demand equations using quarterly data from 1998 to 2011. The system of simultaneous equations is estimated both assuming continuous market clearing and allowing for transitory price rigidity entailing market disequilibrium. The main results are robust to the market clearing assumption. During the global financial crisis, a significant capital outflow stalled bank deposit growth, which in turn affected the private sector's credit supply. At the same time, the banking sector increased credit to the government. Both factors reduced the private sector's credit supply during the period under study. After the trough of the global crisis, capital flowed back into Egypt and deposit growth stopped being a drag on the supply side, but bank credit to the government continued to drive the decrease in the private sector's credit supply. Beginning in the final quarter of 2010, capital flows reversed in tandem with global capital markets, and in January 2011 the popular uprising that ousted President Hosni Mubarak added an Egypt-specific shock that accentuated the outflow. Lending capacity dragged again, accounting for 10% of the estimated fall in private credit. Credit to the government continued to drain resources, accounting for 70-80% of the estimated total decline. Reduced economic activity contributed around 15% of the total fall in credit. The relative importance of these factors contrasts with that of the preceding capital inflow period, when credit to the government accounted for 54% of the estimated fall, while demand factors accounted for a similar percentage.

The results confirm the complementary effect of public subsidies on private R&D spending and prove that R&D subsidies are an influential variable for the increase in private R&D spending. The results also point to three sources of subsidized firms' heterogeneity that have significant effects on the scope of R&D subsidies: (1) the larger the previous private R&D spending of firms, the smaller the increase in current R&D spending of subsidized firms; (2) the larger the sales, the higher the increase in private R&D spending of subsidized firms; and (3) the effect of R&D subsidies decreases with persistency of subsidizing.

The investment environment is usually fuzzy and uncertain. To handle these imprecise data, this paper discusses a fuzzy multi-period portfolio optimization problem where the returns, risk, and liquidity of securities are represented by interval variables. By taking the return, risk, liquidity and diversification degree of portfolio into consideration, an interval multi-period portfolio selection optimization model is proposed with the objective of maximizing the terminal wealth under the constraints of the return, risk and diversification degree of portfolio at each period. In the proposed model, a proportion entropy is employed to measure the diversification degree of portfolio. Using the fuzzy decision-making theory and multi-objective programming approach, the proposed model is transformed into a crisp nonlinear programming. Then, we design an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm for solution. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the application of our model and demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed algorithm. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, we derive the optimal rate for nonparametric point estimation of, and bounds for, the private value distribution, which is typically substantially slower than the regular root-n rate. We propose trimming rules for the nonparametric estimator that achieve that rate and derive the asymptotic distribution for a regularized estimator.

We investigate their presence in eleven African countries, using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model designed for indebted small open-economies. Our simulations reveal that the majority of African countries report a price puzzle whereas only three countries exhibit liquidity effect. In many of the sampled countries, a positive money growth shock drives interest rates up, but consumption and output fall in contrast to the conventional view. External debt increases in response to money growth shock, exchange rate appreciates and inflation falls. Money growth shocks are transmitted to the economy through the exchange rate channel when uncovered interest rate parity condition holds. Our findings therefore appear to suggest that monetary policy in Africa should prioritize foreign debt stabilization by reacting more to output gap than to inflation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We do so through an economic experiment in which children and their parents play a standard public goods game. The experimental data presents us with a surprising result. While we find significant heterogeneity in cooperative preferences in both parents and children, we cannot reject the null that the correlation between the degree of cooperation of a child and that of his or her parent is zero. That is, there is lack of evidence in our data that prosocial values are transmitted from parents to children. This finding is robust to the inclusion of demographic and socio-economic controls.

The model differs from Green and Porter () and Rotemberg and Saloner () in that it is the private cost shocks as opposed to public demand shocks that necessitate modifications of collusion.

One is often interested in simulating data from copula estimates. The process can be analytically and computationally complex and usually involves steps that are unique to a given parametric copula. We describe an alternative approach that uses Probability-Proportional-to-Size' random sampling with weights formed from the copula likelihood function. The method is flexible and can be applied to parametric and nonparametric marginal density estimates. The precision of the simulation can be calibrated by adjusting the density of the multidimensional grid used in the simulation process. The approach is fully transparent to any copula function with continuous random variables.

EI recipients invest more, but are less profitable than firms receiving no such investment. Group-affiliated firms reduce their dividend payout and short-term debt after receiving EI. Finally, recipients increase capital investment when they perceive their EI to be persistent, and those receiving massive EI use funds differently from those receiving normal EI.

Two social welfare models - social welfare as a function of the number of lives saved in each of the age groups (Model 1) and social welfare as a function of the number of lives saved irrespective of age and total life-years saved (Model 2) - were specified and ran using binary probit regression. Our results from both models indicate a general preference for saving younger lives. Based on Model 1 estimates, saving a child aged below one year was considered to be equivalent to saving four retirees (60 years old and above), and saving a life in the 1-19 years age group was equivalent to saving five retirees. The working age group's (20-59 years old) life was judged equivalent to three lives in the retired age group. Regression results for Model 2 indicated that both number of lives and total number of life-years saved (and hence age group of lives saved) significantly affected the choices of the respondents.","Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Econ, Quezon City 1108, Philippines",Ateneo de Manila University,"Palanca-Tan, R (通讯作者)，Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Econ, 4th Floor,Leong Hall, Quezon City 1108, Philippines.",rtan@ateneo.edu,"Eclevia, Marian/I-6486-2013",,,,,,25,4,4,2,9,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Consumers differ in their preferences for competing brands and in their switching costs between brands. Brand-producing firms use their acquired knowledge of customer-specific preferences to differentiate prices. We show that consumers are worse off when firms acquire information about their preferences and that information sharing between firms further reduces consumer welfare. Non-sharing of information supports a subgame perfect equilibrium that is also efficient.

We also estimate rates of factor augmentation. Aggregate estimates are produced. Our empirical model comes from the first-order conditions associated with a constant-elasticity of substitution production function. Our data represent 35 industries at roughly the 2-digit SIC level, 1960-2005. We find that aggregate U. S. sigma is likely less than 0.620. sigma is likely less than unity for a large majority of individual industries. Evidence also suggests that aggregate sigma is less than the value-added share-weighted average of industry sigma's. Aggregate technical change appears to be net labor-augmenting. This also appears to be true for the large majority of individual industries, but several industries may be characterized by net capital augmentation. When industry-level elasticity estimates are mapped to model sectors, the manufacturing sector sigma is lower than that of services; the investment sector sigma is lower than that of consumption.","[Young, Andrew T.] W Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA",West Virginia University,"Young, AT (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Div Econ & Finance, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.",Andrew.Young@mail.wvu.edu,,,,,,,49,41,48,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We consider three families of such models where nodes avoid forming edges beyond those necessary for connectivity, thus forming tree networks. We focus on two local two-stage best-response dynamics in these models, where nodes can only form links with others in a restricted neighborhood. Despite this locality, both our dynamics converge to efficient outcomes in two of the considered families of models. In the third family of models, both our dynamics guarantee at most constant efficiency loss. This is in contrast with the standard best-response dynamics whose efficiency loss is unbounded in all three families of models. Thus we present a globally constrained network formation game where local dynamics naturally select desirable outcomes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We examine the allocations implied by the maximization of this index using a standard growth model. Maximization leads to consumption (excluding education and health expenditures) being pushed to minimal levels. It also leads to the overaccumulation of education and/or health capital and possibly physical capital, relative to the standard golden rule. We propose an alternative specification for the HDI, where consumption replaces income as a proxy for decent standard of living. Maximization of this alternative implies a 'human development golden rule' which balances consumption, education and health expenditure. We advocate the method of optimization subject to constraints for revealing the policy implications of taking an achievement measure and its underlying philosophy seriously.","[Engineer, Merwan] Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [King, Ian] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Victoria; University of Melbourne,"Engineer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",menginee@uvic.ca; ipking@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Cross-sectional estimates indicate that time since arrival is negatively correlated with the probability of being uninsured for both male and female Mexican immigrants, and about a third of the decline could be attributed to civic and labor market incorporation of Mexican immigrants. However, much of the relationship between time in the USA and health insurance coverage, after adjusting for demographic and labor market factors, is due to failure to control for age at arrival and period of arrival. Estimates from longitudinal analyses suggest that there is no systematic relationship between time in the USA and health insurance of Mexican immigrants, although imprecision in the fixed effects estimates makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.","[Kaushal, Neeraj] Columbia Univ, Sch Social Work, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kaestner, Robert] Univ Illinois, Inst Govt & Publ Affairs, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",Columbia University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Kaushal, N (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Sch Social Work, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.",nk464@columbia.edu,,,NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD058486] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,34,4,6,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Since 1990, relative wages of CHT migrants have been escalating in contrast to other immigrants. It is shown that these widening gaps are largely explained by individual's endowments, mostly education. Rising US-earned degrees by CHT migrants can account for this relatively successful economic assimilation. Cohort analysis shows that the economic performance of CHT migrants admitted to the USA has been improving, even allowing for the effect of aging.","Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Lin, C (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, 19 XinJie Kou Outer St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",csmlin@bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,30,4,4,0,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Although money is superneutral in the steady state, the effect of the growth rate of money supply on the speed of capital accumulation depends not only on the curvature of the felicity, but also on the slope and curvature of the discount rate function. We find that when the discount rate decreases with consumption and the elasticity of marginal utility is greater than unity, inflation yields a slower speed of capital accumulation.

Patterns of technology diffusion depend on where high knowledge managers work and how much time they allocate to training workers. Managers appropriate the surplus training creates and in the open economy managers face a cross-country trade-off between labor costs and the value of knowledge transfer. Complementarity between country level efficiency and managerial knowledge makes learning more valuable in the North meaning that high knowledge managers choose to work in the North and globalization precipitates a brain drain of high knowledge Southern agents to the North. The brain drain reduces learning opportunities in the South and exacerbates cross-country technology differences. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

On the one hand, the public administration sells to the tourists an environmental call option that gives them the possibility of being (partially or totally) reimbursed if the environmental quality in the region turns out to be unsatisfactory. On the other hand, it offers the firms that adopt an innovative, non-polluting technology an environmental put option that allows them to get a reimbursement for the additional costs imposed by the new technology if the environmental quality is sufficiently good. The aim of the paper is to study the dynamics that arise with this financial mechanism from the interaction between the economic agents and the public administration in an evolutionary game context. The evolution of visitors' and firms' behavior is modeled in the paper using the so-called replicator dynamics, according to which a given choice spreads across the population as long as its expected payoff is greater than the average payoff. From the model it emerges that such dynamics may lead either to a welfare-improving attractive Nash equilibrium, in which all firms adopt the environmental-friendly technology, or to a Pareto-dominated equilibrium with no technological innovation and no tourism. As shown in the paper, the attraction basin of the virtuous equilibrium will be maximum if total reimbursement is offered by the public administration to the visitors, and will be minimum if a simple entrance ticket is imposed on the tourists with no chance of reimbursement.","[Antoci, Angelo] Univ Sassari, Dept Econ Business & Regulat, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Borghesi, Simone] Univ Siena, Dept Law Econ & Govt, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Galeotti, Marcello] Univ Florence, Dept Math Decis, I-50134 Florence, Italy",University of Sassari; University of Siena; University of Florence,"Borghesi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Law Econ & Govt, Via Mattioli 10, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",antoci@uniss.it; borghesi@unisi.it; marcello.galeotti@dmd.unifi.it,"Borghesi, Simone/B-7143-2012; Vilela, Nicole Louise L Rosolen/K-9426-2014; Antoci, Angelo/AAG-2800-2021","Antoci, Angelo/0000-0003-3719-0437; BORGHESI, SIMONE/0000-0002-7419-1212",,,,,14,16,16,2,78,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In order to differentiate the effect of bank size from that of systemic importance, we control for systemic risk using the CoVaR measure introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). We show that a bank's contribution to systemic risk has a significant negative effect on banks' credit default swap (CDS) spreads, supporting the too-systemic-to-fail hypothesis. Once we control for systemic risk, bank size (relative to gross domestic product (GDP)) has either no or a positive effect on banks' CDS spreads. The effect of bank size increases in the home country's debt ratio and turns positive already at moderate debt ratios. This result is consistent with the too-big-to-save hypothesis. We show further that the effect of systemic risk rises sharply at the onset of the financial crisis in August 2007, but weakens after the failure of Lehman Brothers, reflecting changing bailout expectations. Taken together, our results suggest that banks are not too big to fail, but they may be too systemic to fail and too big to save.

We show that vertical integration can increase the gains from cross-border mergers. We also demonstrate how market concentration interacts with costs in the decision of a relatively efficient foreign firm located in one country (source) to merge with a disintegrated or an integrated firm in another country (target) when the industry is vertically related. Absent any merger incentives in an autarkic equilibrium, we demonstrate that vertical integration can raise the incentives for diversification in production and add to the gains from cross-border horizontal mergers. Any additional gain from cross-border horizontal mergers, due to the existence of a vertically integrated production structure, is shown to be sensitive to the relative market concentration across countries. Cross-border mergers will be triggered by a relatively cost-efficient source taking over a disintegrated target when pre-merger competition among the disintegrated firms is relatively intense but, otherwise, the initial target will be a vertically integrated firm.

The data set includes eurozone members both before and after the inception of the euro, floating exchange rate countries of Western Europe, and emerging market economies of Eastern and Southern Europe. We find that there is a substantial and continuing deviation from purchasing power parity (PPP) at all levels of aggregation, both for traded and non-traded goods, even among eurozone members. Real exchange rates (RER) exhibit two clear properties in the sample (a) they are closely tied to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita relative to the European average, at all levels of aggregation and for both cross country time series variation; (b) they are highly positively correlated with variation in the relative price of non-traded goods. We then construct a simple two-sector endowment economy model of real exchange rate determination which exhibits these two properties, calibrated to match the data. Simulating the model using the historical relative GDP per capita for each country, we find that for most countries, there is a close fit between the actual and simulated real exchange rate. In terms of policy relevance, the model can offer suggestions of the degree to which real exchange rates in Europe (both in and out of the eurozone) have been overvalued (by approximately 15% in Greece and Portugal and 6% in Italy and Spain).

In this setting, the government faces a trade-off between boosting employment of low-skilled agents and raising work effort of high-skilled workers. If sanctions for inadequate search effort can be targeted at high productivity types for whom it is socially optimal to search, the government can afford to levy higher labor taxes on marginal workers without discouraging these agents from seeking work. This allows for lower marginal taxes on work effort of agents with a job. In contrast to workfare, job externalities in the private sector raise marginal tax rates, as the government attaches more importance to boosting employment of low-skilled workers.","[Boone, Jan; Bovenberg, Lans] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Boone, Jan] Tilburg Univ, TILEC, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Boone, Jan; Bovenberg, Lans] CEPR, London, England; [Bovenberg, Lans] Tilburg Univ, Netspar, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Tilburg University,"Boone, J (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",j.boone@uvt.nl; a.l.bovenberg@uvt.nl,,"Bovenberg, Lans/0000-0002-6933-0687; boone, jan/0000-0002-0958-2444",,,,,11,1,1,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

This finding is explained by the tight association between capital goods and firms' collateral, a relationship that we highlight as the capital-accumulation channel. During a liquidity trap, a government spending expansion reduces the real interest rate, leading to a period of cheap credit. Entrepreneurs use this time to accumulate capital, which persistently improves their balance sheets and reduces their future costs of credit. A public spending expansion can thus encourage private investment, yielding consequently a large spending multiplier. This effect is further ;reinforced by Fisher's debt-deflation channel.

A successful MSA will find the optimal trade-off between the two types of errors for a given data environment. Whether a given MSA will be successful in a given environment depends on the relative costs of these two types of errors. We use Monte Carlo experimentation to illustrate these issues. We confirm that no MSA does best in all circumstances. Even the worst MSA in terms of overall performance the strategy of including all candidate variables sometimes performs best (viz., when all candidate variables are relevant). We also show how (1) the ratio of relevant to total candidate variables and (2) data-generating process noise affect relative MSA performance.

The analysis focuses on a dynamic model where preferences about the future depend on nutrition and health. Situations of malnutrition cover both ends of the spectrum: from nutrient deficiency to obesity. The model involves preferences that are not time-additive and exhibit endogenous discounting. This provides a framework to investigate the factors affecting consumption and investment behavior. The adverse investment incentives of malnutrition are examined. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This causes the aggregate saving rate to fluctuate, which leads to cycles in the capital-labour ratio. When all agents delay childbearing, we analytically show that both the capital-labour ratio and the welfare of all agents can fall in the long run, despite the population decline. When a fraction of agents delay childbearing, it has differential welfare effects on agents depending on their positions in the demographic cycles.

We observe that gay males are at an earnings disadvantage compared to male heterosexuals regardless of which earnings measure we use. This earnings disadvantage is found to be larger when we compare gay and heterosexual males who are working full-time. In addition, the disadvantage is larger in the private than in the public sector. Lesbians, however, earn more than heterosexual females. This earnings advantage is considerably smaller when we study full-time monthly rather than annual earnings but an earnings advantage for lesbians at the top of the earnings distribution is documented regardless of which earnings measure we use. In addition, lesbians are doing better than female heterosexuals in the public sector. To sum up, the results indicate that gay males face obstacles on the labor market that hinder them from reaching top-level positions and high earnings. The earnings advantage observed for lesbians is likely to stem from the fact that lesbians devote more time to market work than heterosexual females do.","[Ahmed, Ali] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Ahmed, Ali] Swedish Coll Adv Study, S-75238 Uppsala, Sweden; [Andersson, Lina; Hammarstedt, Mats] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Labour Market & Discriminat Studies, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden",Linkoping University; Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study (SCAS); Linnaeus University,"Hammarstedt, M (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Labour Market & Discriminat Studies, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.",ali.ahmed@swedishcollegium.se; lina.andersson@lnu.se; mats.hammarstedt@lnu.se,,"Alden, Lina/0000-0002-0702-5564",,,,,41,31,35,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Consistent with previous findings, the empirical results suggest that property rights institutions are significantly more important than contracting institutions in promoting economic growth. The direct effect of multinationals on economic growth is generally insignificant statistically. However, a statistically significant and robust interaction effect exists between property rights institutions and multinationals on economic growth, whereas no such effect is observed between contracting institutions and multinationals. The results are attributable to the fact that multinationals can rely on reputation or personal connections to enforce contracts when contracting institutions are weak. However, it is difficult for multinationals to operate when the state expropriates their profits (i.e. property rights institutions are weak).","[Che, Yi] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Business, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Danny T.] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Sch Business, Dept Mkt, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Baptist University,"Che, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Business, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",tccheyi2005@hotmail.com; dtwang@hkbu.edu.hk,"Wang, Danny/M-1634-2013","Wang, Danny/0000-0002-5244-0097",,,,,38,6,6,3,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The findings allow one to conjecture that inflation expectations are well coordinated by the CBB. In short, the transparency of information by the CBB is a very important tool for guiding public expectations and thus contributes to maintain inflation under control. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that political integration with countries that have stronger political and economic institutions leads to growth-enhancing foreign investments because investors expect an improvement of institutions in the future. The empirical evidence supports the importance of political integration: within the group of developing countries, the effect of financial integration is larger in countries that are more strongly politically integrated. Such an effect is not found for advanced countries.

Careful analysis of a two-sector sticky-price model reveals that whether there are wealth effects on labour supply fundamentally changes the nature of the model in a way that has not been fully appreciated. In the presence of wealth effects on labour supply, as Barsky et al. study demonstrate, the pricing of housing is central to the behaviour of the model, whereas price rigidity in the non-durable goods sector is much less important. In the absence of these wealth effects, by contrast, the behaviour of the model depends critically on whether the non-durable goods, not the new housing, themselves have sticky prices.","[Kim, Kwang Hwan] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Katayama, Munechika] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Yonsei University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Kim, KH (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",kimkh01@yonsei.ac.kr,,"Katayama, Munechika/0000-0001-9791-7824",,,,,13,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The generalized fuzzy weighted average function could be applied for solving problems in multiple criteria decision making. Research on the stability of the generalized weighted averaging operator of ranking alternatives was performed applying the Monte Carlo method. The aim of the conducted research is to establish the types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and the exponent values of the generalized weighted averaging operator having the least error probabilities considering alternatives ranking. Computations were performed involving 3,4 and 5 experts. In the case of 5 experts, initial decision matrices having high, middle and low separability alternatives were examined.

We exploit a large panel of Italian manufacturing firms observed over the period 1998-2003 to jointly assess the impact of cash flow and leverage on corporate growth measured in terms of employees and sales. We tackle problems of endogeneity, unobservable heterogeneity and persistence by using a system GMM estimator fully developed by Blundell and Bond (1998). We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between debt and growth: at low levels, leverage exerts a positive influence on growth and yet there appears to be a negative relationship between growth and debt-exposure for fragile firms, i.e. highly leveraged ones. This finding is consistent with the idea that debt initially enables firms to broaden their financing options and provides additional resources to growth. Nevertheless, once debt-exposure reaches a certain threshold, liquidity and debt overhang effects prevail and negatively affect firm expansion. Highly leveraged firms are also endowed with relatively lower levels of internal cash flow and exhibit higher growth-cash flow sensitivity. We conclude that this latter result can be interpreted as evidence of the existence of financial constraints. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We apply the newly developed causality in variance test and impulse response functions to daily data from 01 January 1986 to 21 March 2011. In order to identify the impact of the food price crisis, the data are divided into two sub-periods: the pre-crisis period (01 January 1986 to 31 December 2005) and the post-crisis period (01 January 2006-21 March 2011). The variance causality test shows that while there is no risk transmission between oil and agricultural commodity markets in the pre-crisis period, oil market volatility spills on the agricultural markets with the exception of sugar in the post-crisis period. The impulse response analysis also indicates that a shock to oil price volatility is transmitted to agricultural markets only in the post-crisis period.

Employing a bivariate Smooth Transition EGARCH-M model for the G7 countries during 1957-2009, we find strong nonlinearities. First, uncertainty regarding the output growth rate is related with a higher average growth rate mostly in a low-growth regime, supporting the theory of creative destruction. Second, higher inflation uncertainty diminishes growth rates, mainly at a high-inflation regime. Finally, real uncertainty has mixed effects on average inflation, while the effect of nominal uncertainty is typically positive, especially so during inflationary periods. Our findings suggest that these relationships are sufficiently complex to require treatment with nonlinear models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The long-run pattern of the growth of the income share of finance from the nineteenth century to current times in the United States is similar to some economies, but not all economies reach the same size and instead reach a plateau. The relationship between financial output and income is nonhomothetic and changes three times in this sample. Most of the increase in real GDP per capita from 1870 occurred while financial output and the income share of finance were smaller than their size in 1980. After 1980 the elasticity of income with respect to financial output falls significantly. We find considerable heterogeneity in the size of finance in recent times. There is no evidence for an increase in the unit cost of financial intermediation. We find that information technology and financial deregulation can help explain the increase in relative skill intensity and in relative wages in finance, while common trends, which may be related to financial globalization, also play a role.","[Philippon, Thomas] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Philippon, Thomas] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Philippon, Thomas] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England; [Reshef, Ariell] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Virginia,"Philippon, T (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA.",tphilipp@stern.nyu.edu; ariellr@virginia.edu,,,,,,,48,100,108,1,33,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The international section of the AMFM web site is a centralized source for Divisia monetary aggregates data and research for over 40 countries throughout the world. The components of the CFS Divisia monetary aggregates for the United States reflect closely those of the current and former simple-sum monetary aggregates provided by the Federal Reserve. The first five levels, M1, M2, M2M, MZM, and ALL, are composed of currency, deposit accounts, and money market accounts. The liquid asset extensions to M3, M4-, and M4 resemble in spirit the now discontinued M3 and L aggregates, including repurchase agreements, large denomination time deposits, commercial paper, and Treasury bills. When the Federal Reserve discontinued publishing M3 and L, the Fed stopped providing the consolidated, seasonally adjusted components. Also the Fed no longer provides the interest rates on the components. With so much of the needed component quantity and interest-rate data no longer available from the Federal Reserve, decisions about data sources needed in construction of the CFS aggregates have been far from easy and sometimes required regression interpolation.

The United States' wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have revived again the phenomenon of regime change that was thought to have died with the Cold War. We study Cold War regime changes for insight, although of course they do not extrapolate exactly to modern events. The recent declassification of Cold War documents now makes it possible to develop a new time series cross section dataset of superpower interventions during the Cold War which takes account of interventions by the secret services. We find that US interventions to prop up a leader are associated with significant short term and medium term declines in democracy in the intervened country. We observe a similar size effect for Soviet interventions, but they are not robustly significant like US interventions. Although the negative effect of interventions dissipates once the intervention ends, an intervention has a large effect on democracy when it lasts for a long time.

Its implementation affects the underlying incentive structure which might induce lower performance by participants, and additionally result in a selected pool of tournament winners that is less efficient. In this paper, we study the empirical validity of such concerns in a case where the disadvantage affects capacities to compete. We conducted real-effort tournaments between pairs of children from two similar schools who systematically differed in how much training they received ex-ante on the task at hand. Contrary to the expressed concerns, our results show that the implementation of affirmative action did not result in a significant performance loss for either advantaged or disadvantaged subjects: instead it rather enhanced the performance for a large group of participants. Moreover, affirmative action resulted in a more equitable tournament winner pool where half of the selected tournament winners came from the originally disadvantaged group. Hence, the negative selection effects due to the biased tournament rules were (at least partially) offset by performance enhancing incentive effects.

In the United States, federal government outlays as a ratio to GDP rose substantially from about 19.5 percent before the crisis to over 24 percent after the crisis. In this paper we consider a fiscal consolidation strategy that brings the budget to balance by gradually reducing this spending ratio over time to the level that prevailed prior to the crisis. A crucial issue is the impact of such a consolidation strategy on the economy. We use structural macroeconomic models to estimate this impact focussing primarily on a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with price and wage rigidities and adjustment costs. We separate out the impact of reductions in government purchases and transfers, and we allow for a reduction in both distortionary taxes and government debt relative to the baseline of no consolidation. According to the model simulations GDP rises in the short run upon announcement and implementation of this fiscal consolidation strategy and remains higher than the baseline in the long run. We explore the role of the mix of expenditure cuts and tax reductions as well as gradualism in achieving this policy outcome. Finally, we conduct sensitivity studies regarding the type of model used and its parameterization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We test this hypothesis using a variable from the World Values Survey that measures an individual's taste for government responsibility, which we interpret as a measure of the demand for egalitarian social policy. Our results provide support for a modified version of Friedman's hypothesis. In particular, we find that the taste for government responsibility is positively related to the recent change in the growth rate and negatively related to the change in income inequality. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for attempts to further the egalitarian social goals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The model includes a shock to the expected risk-premium, which introduces a time-varying wedge between the policy rate set by the central bank and the cost-of-capital of firms. In the aggregate data, most U.S. corporations finance their investment using internal funds, and stock prices reveal the opportunity cost of this type of financing. I therefore use corporate market value and dividend data in the Bayesian estimation of the model to identify risk shocks. Variance decomposition exercises show that these shocks account for a substantial part of the variation in the stock market, as well as the variation in output and investment, especially at short forecast horizons. The variation of these variables at longer forecast horizons are mainly captured by shocks to investment-specific technological change. Historical decomposition points to the important role played by risk shocks in the run up of stock prices and output in the late 90s, and in the reversal of these variables in the early 2000s and during the recent recession.

Concerns about the sustainability of its debt burden, along with gloomy growth prospects, have pushed up the cost of government borrowing, exacerbating current economic conditions. At the moment Italy is facing two mounting economic challenges: (i) achieve a rapid fiscal consolidation to restore financial market confidence; (ii) implement structural reforms to strengthen medium-term growth prospects. Using the European Commission's model QUEST III with R&D, adapted to Italy, we quantify the potential effects of a set of interventions inspired to the reform packages currently being undertaken or under discussion and consider different levels of policy effort. Results show that reforms are likely to bring about sizable gains in output, consumption, employment and net foreign assets position and that most of these gains derive from labor market reforms. However, the fiscal austerity plan is likely to severely mitigate the positive effects of the interventions, especially during the earlier phases of the reform process. Most of these losses accrue to liquidity-constraint households who would experience a drop in consumption. (C) 2012 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Applying a semi-parametric decomposition approach we show that controlling for children significantly reduces the gap between married women and secondary lesbian earners both in terms of the decision to remain attached to the labor market (the extensive margin) and annual hours of work conditional on working (the intensive margin). Further, the effect of controlling for children primarily reduces the percentage of secondary lesbian earners working extremely high annual hours.

We find that any rank incentive improves mean performance than no rank incentive, and this result is independent of the group size. In the large group, the mean performance increases strictly in all except at the highest rank incentive, but in the small group the mean performance increases weakly in rank incentives. Finally, the mean performance is significantly higher in the large than in the small group because of a higher prestige effect. In additional treatments in which we do not reveal the identity of the status-prize winners, we find that average performance is identical to that in the baseline treatment without any status prizes.

The main finding is evidence for Chilean municipalities that equalization grants have this incentive effect on local revenue. In order to identify this effect, we exploit that today's collected revenue could affect grants received 2, 3, or 4 years later, as determined by the equalization grant's distribution formula. This formula has undergone changes in the 1990-2006 period. We find a negative relationship between the equalization grant's implicit tax and collected local revenue, and this effect is greater when the period of time between collection and the corresponding distribution of grants is shorter and when the political coalition to which the incumbent mayor belongs has a high likelihood of winning the next election and therefore paying this implicit tax in the coming years.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chil, Publ Policy Ctr, Santiago 8331150, Chile",,"Rodríguez, JB (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chil, Publ Policy Ctr, Alameda Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 324,3th Floo, Santiago 8331150, Chile.",jpbravo@uc.cl,,,,,,,8,5,6,1,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The authors situate this approach in a conceptual and methodological panorama of the existent literature. Starting from the regime concept, the paper introduces a distance notion to compare the observed paths and the clustering of the economies whose evolution is studied. The analysis shows that two fundamental clusters have existed: one of high and another of low performance, in addition to other transitory groups. In the high performance cluster the member's number increases, while in the low performance cluster this number diminishes. At the same time, the article shows that the sub-national states that belong to the first cluster have had an increasingly similar performance. Also, it confirms that the sub-national states move from the low to the high performance cluster, and that the distance between both clusters has increased.

Our results show that public decisions are affected by interactions between neighbor countries, neighborhood being defined by economic leadership as well as geography.

This occurs although members of the R&D agreement increase their R&D efforts. We focus on cases where firms compete both on the final market and to buy an input necessary for R&D. The market is composed of a competitive fringe and two strategic firms that enjoy a first mover advantage on both markets. By increasing its R&D input purchase, a strategic firm increases the cost of all its rivals and in particular deters entry in the fringe. This reduces downstream competition and increases the final price. Therefore, an R&D agreement may induce strategic overbuying of R&D input by members of the agreement at the expense of rival firms and consumers.","Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Christin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Gebaude 24-31,Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",christin@dice.uni-duesseldorf.de,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,12,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

The main objective is to present empirical evidence for the Brazilian case concerning the framework of the public debt composition and also the effect of this framework on public debt to GDP ratio.

This paper assesses this understanding. To this end, we examine the contents of the old and the new neoclassical syntheses. We show that the neoclassical synthesis originally had no fixed content, but two meanings gradually became dominant. First, it designates the program of integrating Keynesian and Walrasian theory. Second, it designates the methodological principle that in macroeconomics it is better to have alternative models geared towards different purposes than a hegemonic general equilibrium model. The paper documents that: (a) the first program was never achieved; (b) Lucas's criticisms of Keynesian macroeconomics eventually caused the neoclassical synthesis program to vanish from the scene; (c) the rise of DSGE macroeconomics marked the end of the neoclassical synthesis mark II; and (d) contrary to present-day understanding, the link between the old and the new synthesis is at best weak.","[Duarte, Pedro Garcia] Univ Sao Paulo, FEA, Dept Econ, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [De Vroey, Michel] Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Duarte, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, FEA, Dept Econ, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto 908, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",pgduarte@usp.br,,"Duarte, Pedro/0000-0003-3525-7036",,,,,85,8,8,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Theory predicts that link costs lead to less competitive networks, with one link rather than two links, and that link costs do not affect the bargaining outcomes conditional on the network. We find support for the first but not the second prediction. 2-link networks form less frequently when there are link costs. Given that a 2-link network forms, however, a seller on average offers a smaller share of the pie to the buyers in the presence than in the absence of link costs. This impact of link costs can be explained by a disutility for (advantageous) inequality on the part of the seller. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The error correction model results capture, in a dynamic setting, the offsetting effects of per capita income on the one hand and aid on the other to result in stagnant tax revenue GDP ratio that has been observed in the recent past.

We investigate the relationship between the composition of banks' liabilities and their credit procyclicality. After examining the macroeconomic context where banks rely increasingly on wholesale funding (WSF), we estimate the effect of WSF on the banks' credit growth using quarterly panel data for the commercial banks of Korea from 2000 to 2011. We find that a higher sensitivity of banks' WSF to the business cycle leads to an excessive response of credit growth to the business cycle, even with a low share of WSF on bank liabilities. On the other hand, we find that overseas WSF has a more marked effect on credit procyclicality, which may additionally exacerbate the financial fragility of export-led emerging economies.","[Jeong, Sangjun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Jeong, S (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151, South Korea.",,,,,,,,23,6,6,1,10,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,5,,,,,615,631,,10.2298/PAN1305615J,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,226SD,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325055400003,0

Maintaining such a correspondence is necessary to understand how economic forecasts reflect, and are constrained by, relationships within the underlying physical system. This work develops a method for projecting global demand for passenger vehicle transport, retaining supplemental physical accounting for vehicle stock, fuel use, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This method is implemented in the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis Version 5 (EPPA5) model and includes several advances over previous approaches. First, the relationship between per-capita income and demand for passenger vehicle transport services (in vehicle-miles traveled, or VMT) is based on econometric estimates and modeled using quasi-homothetic preferences. Second, the passenger vehicle transport sector is structured to capture opportunities to reduce fleet-level gasoline use through the application of vehicle efficiency or alternative fuel vehicle technologies, introduction of alternative fuels, or reduction in demand for VMT. Third, alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) are represented in the EPPA model. Fixed costs as well as learning effects that could influence the rate of AFV introduction are captured explicitly. This model development lays the foundation for assessing policies that differentiate based on vehicle age and efficiency, alter the relative prices of fuels, or focus on promoting specific advanced vehicle or fuel technologies.

Originating from social psychology, the TPB posits that intention, a function of behavioural beliefs, is a significant predictor of subsequent behaviour. In spite of an established stream of scholarship explaining the formation of entrepreneurial intentions, empirical research has not yet employed longitudinal data to examine whether the intention to start a business measured at one point of time translates into subsequent entrepreneurial behaviour. This article provides a full test of the TPB in the prediction of business start-up intentions and subsequent behaviour based on two-wave survey data (2006 and 2009) from the working-age population in Finland. The econometric results support the predictions outlined in the TPB: attitude, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms are significant predictors of entrepreneurial intention; and intention and perceived behavioural control are significant predictors of subsequent behaviour. This research thus provides support to the application of the TPB and the concept of behavioural intention to understand the emergence of complex economic behaviour such as entrepreneurship prior to the onset of any observable action.","[Kautonen, Teemu] Univ Turku, TSE Entre, Sch Econ, Turku 20014, Finland; [van Gelderen, Marco] Massey Univ, Sch Management, Auckland, New Zealand; [Tornikoski, Erno T.] Grenoble Ecole Management, Grenoble, France",University of Turku; Massey University; Grenoble Ecole Management,"Kautonen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, TSE Entre, Sch Econ, Turku 20014, Finland.",teemu.kautonen@utu.fi,"Tornikoski, Erno T./JCD-9012-2023; Tornikoski, Erno T./G-4865-2013; Kautonen, Teemu/L-8973-2013; van Gelderen, Marco/AAH-1653-2020","Tornikoski, Erno T./0000-0002-2108-5483; Kautonen, Teemu/0000-0001-9357-5337; van Gelderen, Marco/0000-0001-5804-3087",,,,,52,359,402,13,206,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results of the panel cointegration test show that there is a stable long run relationship amongst total output, capital, labour, land, water and SO2 when total output is the dependent variable. The results of the causality test with Error Correction Model (ECM) analysis suggest that the available water resource and environmental pollutant have no impacts on total output temporarily, but in the long-run there is a Granger causality running from these variables to total output, indicating the economic growth drag induced by the natural resource and environmental pollution can be further estimated. Given the stable cointegration and significant Granger causality being, the study shows that the drag on the total output reduces annual economic growth rate by about 1.1 percentage points for the Central China as a whole and there is a significant difference on the aggregated and disaggregated drags for the six provinces, which indicates that natural resource and environmental constraints so far incorporated into production probably have a modest effect over the past 31 years for the Central China.","[Liu, Yaobin] Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang 330031, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yaobin] Fudan Univ, State Innovat Inst Publ Management & Publ Policy, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yaobin] Univ Michigan, China Data Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA",Nanchang University; Fudan University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Liu, YB (通讯作者)，Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing E Rd, Nanchang 330031, Peoples R China.",liuyaobin2003@163.com,"Liu, Yaobin/KCY-6467-2024","Liu, Yaobin/0000-0002-0249-9365",,,,,41,5,5,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While the attributes of organic milk that are valued by consumers are fairly well-known, more ambiguity exists regarding the demographic characteristics of the typical organic milk consumer. This research makes use of experimental data from 148 adult participants and use a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis, a nonparametric modelling approach, to identify how Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) for organic milk varies with the demographic profile of experiment participants.

We assemble a rich data set from the largest and most comprehensive online male sex worker Web site to estimate the effect of information on pricing. We show how clients of male sex workers informally police the market in a way that makes signaling credible.

The analysis is conducted by using the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) method. Our results indicate large and significant impact of capital, and lesser but significant impact of labour on sectorial output, while expanding farmland would not increase the output. The estimates of trade openness are not statistically significant, indicating that it does not impact technical efficiency. Trade liberalization as an underlying motive for increasing technical efficiency does not exist based on our results. The primary markets for Brazilian agricultural commodities are still the domestic markets, which are still relatively well protected from foreign competition. This implies that domestic producers are not forced to use existing inputs more efficiently given the relative lack of competition domestically and enlarged foreign markets expanding primarily in the booming and large Asian economies.","[Miljkovic, Dragan; Shaik, Saleem] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Miranda, Silvia H.] Univ Sao Paulo, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr ESALQ, Piracicaba, Brazil",North Dakota State University Fargo; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Miljkovic, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, 500 Barry Hall, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",dragan.miljkovic@ndsu.edu,"Shaik, Saleem/F-6771-2012; Miranda, Sílvia Helena Galvão de/A-7373-2016; Shaik, Saleem/HSH-3760-2023","Miranda, Sílvia Helena Galvão de/0000-0003-0935-8917; Shaik, Saleem/0000-0001-6177-2520",,,,,12,11,13,3,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

For this purpose, we use both industry-level and firm-level imports by country of origin and further distinguish between firm-level offshoring of final versus intermediate goods. Results indicate that China is different from both other low-wage and OECD countries. Industry-level import competition from China reduces firm employment growth and induce skill upgrading in low-tech manufacturing industries. On the other hand, import competition has no effect on firm survival, while offshoring of finished goods to China actually increases firms' probability of survival. In terms of skill upgrading, the effect of Chinese imports is large. Import competition from China accounts for 27% (48%) of the total observed increase - within and between firms - in the share of non-production (highly educated) workers in low-tech Belgian manufacturing over our period of analysis. Offshoring to China further accounts for a small but significant increase in the share of non-production workers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In 1982, the Chilean manufacturing sector suffered a severe contraction in output, most of which can be accounted for by a falling Solow residual: This paper uses establishment data from the Chilean manufacturing census to examine the decline in measured TFP. To quantify the contribution of resource misallocation, I develop a measure of allocational efficiency along the lines of Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and derive the appropriate measure of aggregate productivity to which it should be compared. Across Specifications, within-industry allocational efficiency either remained constant or improved in 1982, while a decline in between-industry allocational efficiency accounts for about one-third of the reduction in TFP. Industries more sensitive to domestic demand - durables and industries with low exports - experienced larger declines in measured TFP. This finding is consistent with large adjustment costs and underutilization of inputs. Reduced,capital utilization played a substantial role, accounting for 25-50 percent of the decline in measured TFP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The change in needs and wishes is especially felt by service companies because the quality of services is perceived individually and is subject to personal needs and wishes of each customer. The success of companies providing other than essential services, such as a tourism organization, depends on the ability to adapt and learn. Recently great attention has been paid to the improvement of organizational performance and the transformation of a traditional organization into a learning organization is seen as one of the possibilities for better performance. It has been generally accepted that correct learning of the organization is a key factor that ensures a rapid improvement of the organization and a quick response to the changing environment. Presumably, organizational learning is very important for a tourism company. Firstly, the environment in this sector undergoes constant changes; the sector develops rapidly and offers new products to the market.

In arbitrarily large networks with bounded neighborhoods, an action is diffused to the whole population either if it is the only one initially chosen by a non-negligible share of the population, or if the payoffs satisfy a sufficient condition.

Institutions in Europe were different too and well suited for economic growth through imitation and adaptation of the technology to local circumstances. Catching up is, however, a self defeating process. It ends when the technology frontier is attained or when in case of conditional convergence institutions set a limit to the process of catching up. Once this situation is reached, the existing institutions may no longer be appropriate. Regression analysis on a panel of 21 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries reveals that Employment Protection Legislations (EPL) had a positive impact on productivity growth in the period of rapid convergence in the sixties and seventies. However, from the eighties onwards, the total effect of EPL on labour productivity growth was negative.","[van Schaik, Ton; van de Klundert, Theo] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"van Schaik, T (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",Schaik@uvt.nl,,,,,,,21,7,8,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The taxation and subsidization of 2nd pillar private pensions is explained in a very different way. We compare the Czech fiscal policy in this respect with policy and systems in other countries. Different concepts of taxation of pension funds are discussed, having in mind the development of general tax policies. The approaches to value-added taxation of financial services and to the insurance excise taxes and contributions are also of heavy importance.

However, these two important elements have not been formally integrated into the demand equations for China's exports. As we demonstrate in this paper, income elasticity will be underestimated if new varieties of goods and quality improvements are omitted in price index and quantity index calculations, which are necessary for estimating the export demand function. Moreover, the faster new product varieties enter export markets, the greater the underestimation will be. In this paper, we develop an export demand equation that takes into account new product varieties and improvements in quality, and then calculate the demand function for China's exports using the data from 1992 to 2006. According to our estimation, the short-term income elasticity of demand for China's exports is approximately 2.34, and the short-term price elasticity is approximately 0.65. Our estimation predicts an increase in China's export value in the case of an RMB appreciation or export rebate rates reduction in the short term, due to the low price elasticity of China's exports, whose absolute value is less than 1. Our findings are novel and could have significant policy implications.","[Yao, Zhizhong; Tian, Feng] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Qingyi] China Ctr Int Econ Exchanges, Dept Econ Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Yao, ZZ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yaozhizhong@gmail.com; tianfeng@cass.org.cn; mathe_sqy@163.com,,,,,,,7,7,7,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2013,21.0,1,,,,,91,106,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12010.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,073MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313747300005,0

The problem arises because CES 'share' parameters are not in fact shares, but depend on underlying dimensions in other words they are 'dimensional constants'. It follows that such parameters can neither be calibrated nor be estimated unless the choice of units is made explicit. We use an RBC model to demonstrate two equivalent solutions. The standard one expresses the production function in deviation form about some reference point, usually the steady state of the model. Our alternative, 're-parameterization'. expresses dimensional constants in terms of a new dimensionless (share) parameter and all remaining dimensionless ones. We show that our 're-parameterization' method is equivalent and arguably more straightforward than the standard normalization in deviation form. We then examine a similar problem of dimensional constants for CES utility functions in a two-sector model and in a small open economy model: then re-parameterization is the only solution to the problem, showing that our approach is in fact more general.

Putting special emphasis on the modeling of household migration a trade reform scenario is simulated with and without the existence of a land rental market in the village. Significant impacts of the land market on the policy outcome regarding household production, income and welfare are found. The possibility to trade land within the village leads to increasing specialization into agriculture and migration among the households as a response to the policy shock. In a situation with a land market, incomes of households which expand agricultural production are less negatively affected by trade reform than incomes of households which migration more. At the village level, a land market does not influence the poverty outcome of the reform but reduces its inequality enhancing impact. Village migration and exports of agricultural outputs increase.

The method is based on the eigenfunction expansion of the pricing operator. Given the set of call and put dates, the callable and putable bond pricing function is the value function of a stochastic game with stopping times. Under some technical conditions, it is shown to have an eigenfunction expansion in eigenfunctions of the pricing operator with the expansion coefficients determined through a backward recursion. For popular short rate diffusion models, such as CIR, Vasicek, 3/2, the method is orders of magnitude faster than the alternative approaches in the literature. In contrast to the alternative approaches in the literature that have so far been limited to diffusions, the method is equally applicable to short rate jump-diffusion and pure jump models constructed from diffusion models by Bochner's subordination with a Levy subordinator.

This paper first examines the evidence on alleged market failure and regulatory failure as experienced in practice in Australia, where there have been both regulated and merchant interconnectors. Merchant transmission has generally not exhibited the standard examples of market failure but regulated transmission generally has exhibited the standard examples of regulatory failure. Imperfect information-more specifically, in the form of lack of coordination-has often been a challenge whatever the approach. Experience in Argentina suggests that transactions costs are not a barrier to negotiation and efficient investment determined by users. Policy should seek to improve the regulatory framework and to remove barriers to private initiatives. An important role for regulation is to facilitate coordination between potential providers and users of transmission lines.","[Littlechild, Stephen] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Littlechild, Stephen] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England",University of Birmingham; University of Cambridge,"Littlechild, S (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",sclittlechild@tanworth.mercianet.co.uk,,,,,,,48,18,19,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The Peruvian case study between 1994 and 2007,JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inflation targeting; Exchange rate pass-through into prices; TV-VAR models,MONETARY-POLICY; RATE VOLATILITY,"This paper analyzes whether the exchange rate pass-through into prices changed when the inflation targeting scheme was adopted in Peru. First, a simple dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model is simulated, which shows that adopting this scheme induces an increase in exchange rate volatility. Furthermore, applying the theory of the currency denomination of international trade, it is demonstrated that increased exchange rate volatility reduces the share of firms that set their prices in foreign currency. Given that the pass-though has a direct relationship with this share, it is shown that adopting inflation targeting generates a pass-through contraction. Second, we empirically test whether the Peruvian Central Bank's decision to adopt inflation targeting in January 2002 actually had an effect on the pass-through estimating a time-varying vector autoregressive model which allows for an asymmetrical estimation of the pass-through. It provides parameters for both the pre and post inflation targeting regimes based on the assumption that the transition from one regime to the other is smooth. An analysis of the generalized impulse response functions reveals that the decision to adopt inflation targeting significantly decreased the exchange rate pass-throughs into import, producer, and consumer prices. The results are consistent with economic theory and are robust to the specification of parameters of the model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Yet it is only beginning to be explicitly incorporated in long-term scenario analyses of energy and emissions. We assess the implications of a plausible range of urbanization pathways for energy use and carbon emissions in India and China, using the integrated Population-Economy-Technology-Science (iPETS) model, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the global economy that captures heterogeneity in household types within world regions and into which we have introduced income effects on household consumption preferences. We find that changes in urbanization have a somewhat less than proportional effect on aggregate emissions and energy use. A decomposition analysis demonstrates that this effect is due primarily to an economic growth effect driven by the increased labor supply associated with faster urbanization. The influence of income on household consumption is strong, and indicates a potentially rapid transition away from traditional fuel use and toward modern fuels such as electricity and natural gas. Results also indicate important directions for future work, including the implications of alternative types and driving forces of urbanization over time, a better understanding of possible changes in consumption preferences associated with income growth and the urbanization process, and modeling strategies that can produce disaggregated household consumption outcomes within a CGE framework.

In Jeremy Bentham's work, we find practical as well as theoretical proposals regarding this problem. Here, we view his work as an invitation to reflect on the overall nature of the question of institutional design and transplantation. The transfer of institutions requires knowledge of 'place and time' that will allow for an accommodation of the transferred institutions to their new soil. However, an awareness of this type of knowledge and thus relying on its actually being available is not viable from a practical point of view. This is due to the fact that the core of informal institutions is tacit, which imposes a fundamental constraint on the process of institutional transplantation; informal norms must co-exist with formal rules, and such merging requires some accommodation of both types of rules.","[Pablo Couyoumdjian, Juan] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Gobierno, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Couyoumdjian, Juan] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile",Universidad del Desarrollo; Universidad del Desarrollo,"Couyoumdjian, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Desarrollo, Fac Gobierno, Av Plaza 680, Santiago, Chile.",jpc@udd.cl,,"Couyoumdjian, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-5076-6464",,,,,79,11,12,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Specifically, we examine exchange rate effects on an exporter's extensive (entry, exit, and product churning) and intensive margins of exports. We find significant effects on the extensive margin. A 10% real appreciation of the renminbi is associated with a 1 percentage point decline in the probability of entry, and a 0.2 percentage point increase in the probability of exit. The effects among foreign-invested enterprises almost double for both entry and exit. Despite the seemingly large effect on the extensive margins, exchange rates alone can only explain about 4% of entries and about 1.6% of exits during the sample period. The exchange-rate elasticity of exports is estimated to be around 0.4 in the first year after the shock, with most of the adjustment taking place in the first six months. This finding of a relatively fast response to exchange rate shocks is consistent with anecdotal evidence about intense competition in the Chinese export sectors.

We find different incentives for the regions in the climate coalition to raise carbon-based border tax rates (BTAX) above the standard rate that mimics an equalisation of carbon prices across regions. Herein, the strategic use of BTAX (the manipulation of the terms of trade) is stronger for all coalition regions than the environmental use (the reduction of carbon emissions abroad). Higher BTAX can reduce carbon leakage but with a declining marginal effect. Furthermore, we find different incentives for regions outside the coalition to oppose high BTAX rates: Russia and the other energy exporters would oppose it, while the low-income countries would not because of benefits from the trade diversion effect. Thus, BTAX encourages the former to join the coalition, while compensating transfers are necessary to encourage the other (developing) countries including China and India (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We extend the NATREX model in several important perspectives and apply it for the first time to China. A wide range of economic fundamentals that are unique to the Chinese economy is introduced into the model. We construct a unique set of quarterly data and employ unit root and cointegration tests that can account for multiple endogenous structural breaks. In addition, to capture the evolution of China's foreign trade pattern, we employ time-varying (i.e. 3-year average) trade weights to construct the real effective exchange rate. We find two structural breaks in the cointegration relationship (in 1988 and 1992). Effective terms of trade, demographic factors, liquidity constraints and government investment are significant determinants of the equilibrium real effective exchange rate. The RMB was overvalued against a basket of 14 currencies until mid-1980s. During 1986-2010, it was undervalued in most years except after the Asian financial crisis in 1997. We have found persistent undervaluation from 2004 onwards. However, the misalignment rates are much lower than those reported by previous studies and the undervaluation rate actually declined sharply in 2008. The undervaluation rate rose modestly in 2009 and sharply in 2010, though it is still lower than what has been suggested by other studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Yet this reasoning incurs what we could call the 'fallacy of probability diffusion symmetry': although market efficiency does indeed imply that the mean (i.e. 'expected') path must rule out any cyclical or otherwise arbitrage-enabling pattern, if the probability diffusion process is asymmetric the observed path will most closely resemble not the mean but the median, which is not subject to this condition. In this context, this paper develops an efficient markets model where the median path of Tobin's q ratio displays regular, periodic cycles of bubbles and crashes reflecting an agency problem between investors and producers. The model is tested against U.S. market data, and its results suggest that such a regular cycle does indeed exist and is statistically significant. The aggregate production model in Gracia (Uncertainty and Capacity Constraints: Reconsidering the Aggregate Production Function, 2011) is then put forward to show how financial fluctuations can drive the business cycle by periodically impacting aggregate productivity and, as a consequence, GDP growth.",,,"Gracia, E (通讯作者)，39 Palace Court, London W2 4LS, England.",eduard.gracia@booz.com,,,,,,,57,0,0,0,25,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 12,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201241.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-41,0.0,,,45,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,091GZ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315038700001,0

Given that firms are driven by different motives for R&D cooperation, the aim of this article is to investigate the differences related to different motives with respect to the impact of R&D cooperation on firm innovativeness and firm productivity. Not only R&D cooperation in general but also cooperation driven by each of the seven motives considered in this paper correlate positively with the sales share of innovative products. With respect to innovativeness, the characterization of cooperation by the driving motive did not add much more than could be gained through the overall variable 'R&D cooperation yes/no'. Technology-motivated collaborative activities show a weaker tendency to positive direct effects on productivity than cost-motivated cooperation. In this case, the distinction of several cooperation motives yields some additional insights as compared to the overall cooperation variable. On the whole, distinguishing various cooperation motives appears to be fruitful because it allows more differentiated insights that would remain hidden behind the overall variable R&D cooperation yes/no.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Arvanitis, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.",arvanitis@kof.ethz.ch,,,,,,,48,27,29,0,46,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The GSG hypothesis argues that the surge in capital inflows from emerging market economies to the United States led to significant declines in long-term interest rates in the United States and other industrial economies. In turn, these lower interest rates, when combined with both innovations and deficiencies of the U.S. credit market, are believed to have contributed to the U.S. housing bubble and to the buildup in financial vulnerabilities that led to the financial crisis. Because the GSG countries for the most part restricted their U.S. purchases to Treasuries and Agency debt, their provision of savings to ultimately risky subprime mortgage borrowers was necessarily indirect, pushing down yields on safe assets and increasing the appetite for alternative investments on the part of other investors. Foreign acquisitions of private-label ABS, primarily by Europeans, provided credit more directly and, by adding to domestic demand for these securities, contributed to the decline in their spreads over Treasury yields. Through a combination of empirical estimation and model simulation, we verify that both GSG inflows into Treasuries and Agencies, as well as European acquisitions of ABS, played a role in contributing to downward pressures on U.S. interest rates.

The study adopts a two-stage methodology. First, we estimate the technology gap using the metafrontier approach. Then we test the relationship between the technology gap and the quality of governance. The empirical results show that institutions (corruption, law and rules and investment climate) are very important in closing the technology gap and speeding up the technology catch-up. Other determinants of the technology gap are also identified: foreign direct investment, human capital and trade. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that charter and, especially, private schools attain better results than public schools and are more responsive to its academic evolution, both at a lower cost. Private schools do their best to converge to the leading schools in their district in the previous year, whereas public schools do not seem to do so. This result holds even after controlling for the number of immigrants in the school, the age of the school, and its size.

Decentralized freely operating markets will mitigate the persistence of any price shocks and restore prices to their long-run trends. The main policy implications are that oil, gasoline, and ethanol market shocks do not spillover into grain prices, which indicates no long-run food before fuel issue.

It offers an alternative interpretation in which Sraffa's prices are completely independent of demand considerations or the condition of equilibrium of demand and supply. The requirement of the uniform rate of profits in Sraffa's price equations is argued to be a logical consequence of the assumption that wages are uniform and fixed from outside the system.

Our model shows that when the demand shock has higher volatility, the firm finances the investment cost with high-coupon convertible debt. We find that default occurs earlier for firms that finance with convertible debt rather than with straight debt. We also find that firms with high-growth prospection, high volatility, and low capital costs that issue convertible debt tend to defer investments. Furthermore, we examine the investment decisions in which the convertible debt includes a call provision. We show that firms that use callable convertible debt invest earlier than those that use non-callable convertible debt by using suboptimal coupon payments. The opportunity from the forced conversion increases as the volatility increases. These results are consistent with recent empirical evidence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model to study the equilibrium determinacy properties of interest rate rules that respond to inflation measures differing in their degree of price rigidity. We find that rules responding to a headline measure, which puts some weight on the inflation of the sector with low price stickiness, are more prone to generate endogenous aggregate instability in the form of fluctuations driven by self-fulfilling expectations and equilibria where fluctuations are unbounded than rules that respond exclusively to a core measure, which includes only the inflation of the sector with high price stickiness.

Our unified framework encompasses and extends many well-known models, such as variants of the Ramsey taxation model with aggregate or idiosyncratic risk, and economies with incentive compatibility constraints due to limited commitment, political economy, self-enforcement or private information, or combinations of these. We identify a sufficient condition that rules out permanent intertemporal distortions: if there exists an allocation that satisfies all constraints and eventually converges to the limiting first-best allocation, then intertemporal distortions are temporary in the second best. This result uncovers a common optimality principle linking the intertemporal allocation of resources with the ability to front-load distortions for this broad class of environments. A series of applications illustrates the significance of these findings.","[Albanesi, Stefania] NBER, Fed Reserve Bank New York, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Armenter, Roc] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Albanesi, S (通讯作者)，NBER, Fed Reserve Bank New York, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,62,12,12,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Indeed, when a given individual selects a specific subset of preferences according to what others do, he/she will contribute positively to the public good provision. We provide anecdotal evidence to support our theoretical analysis by using data from an Internet survey on a sample of French individuals. Analyses of individual responses confirm our theoretical arguments. For instance, we show that relative concerns matter, that is, for several environmental goods, people might prefer polluting more in absolute terms but less than others in society. Moreover, we also test whether people exhibit a social desirability bias and show that they attribute more (less) positional (prosocial) concerns to others in society. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

As far as public spending is concerned, our results strongly suggest that capital expenditures are associated with higher profits, while expenditures on goods and services and in particular on wages and salaries deteriorate profits. In general, productive expenditures seem to increase profits while the effect of unproductive expenditures is insignificant.

While recent studies point to high non-take-up rates, existing evidence does not make full use of the information recorded by benefit agencies. Most studies have to rely on interview-based data, with misreporting and measurement errors affecting the variables needed to establish both benefit receipt and benefit entitlement. In this paper, we exploit a unique combination of Finnish administrative data and eligibility simulations based on the tax-benefit calculator of the Finnish authorities, carefully investigating the measurement issues that remain. We find rates of non-take-up that are both substantial and robust: 40 to 50% of those eligible do not claim. Using repeated cross-section estimations for years 1996-2003, we identify a set of stable determinants of claiming behavior and suggest that changes in behavior could drive the observed downward trend in take-up rates during the post-recession period. We discuss the poverty implications of our results.","Univ Coll Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Bargain, Olivier] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Bargain, Olivier] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bargain, Olivier] Ctr Household Income Labour & Demograph Econ CHIL, Turin, Italy; [Immervoll, Herwig] OECD, Paris, France; [Immervoll, Herwig] ISER, IZA, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Immervoll, Herwig] European Ctr Social Welf Policy & Res, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Viitamaki, Heikki] VATT, Helsinki, Finland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland.",olivier.bargain@ucd.ie,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019",,,,,,29,37,37,0,38,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

One party (the seller) makes an unverifiable quality choice and the other party (the buyer) has private information about its valuation. A simple deterministic exit option contract, which allows the buyer to refuse trade, achieves the first-best in the benchmark cases where either quality is verifiable or the buyer's valuation is public information. But, when unverifiable and asymmetric information are combined, deterministic contracts are necessarily inefficient. The first-best can be achieved, however, through simple message games with stochastic terms of trade as off-equilibrium outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Although Marshallian microeconomics is also hypothetical-deductive, it is a major achievement because it actually founded a methodological science: economic decision making, later completed by game theory. As deductive thought allows for mathematical reasoning, the resulting models are apparently scientific and constitute the core of mainstream economics. But often they are economic reasonings, not real theories able to predict and orient. This fact became obvious in the 2008 global financial crisis. Now is the time to change the mainstream; and the present paper is an academic manifesto in this direction.

But are the private mining firms really efficient than the public sector firms? In such a context this paper compares the extraction efficiency of public and private mining firms in India by assessing their Total Factor Productivity (TFP). The study reveals that TFP levels of private firms are significantly higher than that of public firms in metallic, non-metallic and coal mining sectors. TFP levels of private firms in non-metallic sector are almost double that of public firms. Similarly, private firms in metallic and coal mining industry are one and half times more productive than public firms. In such a context, we can suggest that private participation in the mining industry may boost the overall productivity of the sector. (C) 2012 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The subgame perfect entry threshold of the dynamic game will generally differ from the global game threshold of the static version of the same game. Nevertheless, our experimental findings suggest that entry thresholds are similar between static and dynamic versions of the same game.

Banks can be subject to sectoral and aggregate domestic shocks. After integration they can share these risks in a complete interbank market When banks have a comparative advantage in providing credit to certain industries, financial integration may induce banks to specialize in lending. An enhanced concentration in lending does not necessarily increase risk, because a well-functioning interbank market allows to achieve the necessary diversification. This greater need for risk sharing, though, increases the risk of cross-border contagion and the likelihood of widespread banking crises. However, even though integration increases the risk of contagion it improves welfare if it permits banks to realize specialization benefits. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Proponents of price-level targeting have argued that the costs of eliminating the price-level drift may be reduced if the central bank responds flexibly by returning the price level only gradually to the target path (Gaspar et al., 2010). We revisit this argument in two variants of the New Keynesian model. We show that in a two-sector version of the model which allows for changes in relative prices across sectors, the costs of stabilisation under price-level targeting remain much higher than under inflation targeting for all policy-relevant horizons. Our conclusion is that extending the policy horizon is not a panacea to reduce the costs of eliminating price-level drift. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

By focusing on the case study of Italy and Germany, we argue that both macroeconomic (the functioning of the euro area) and microeconomic (internationalization of production) factors contributed to the creation of such imbalances. When sovereign risk and currency risk emerged in the periphery, coupled with austerity as a response to these risks, both factors made the euro crisis worse. The present zero-sum-game approach is very risky for the stability of the euro area. Policy coordination of some kind is needed. This requires agreeing on well-identified economic policy priorities, taking full account of the different positions of the members in terms of growth, external imbalances, and competitiveness. New policy priorities are thus required in the euro zone that put more emphasis on cooperative (positive-sum) games in convergence and competitiveness.","[Guerrieri, Paolo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Bruges, Italy; [Guerrieri, Paolo] Coll Europe, Bruges, Italy; [Esposito, Piero] Cer & St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Guerrieri, P (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Bruges, Italy.",paolo.guerrieri@uniroma1.it; p.esposito@sssup.it,"Esposito, Piero/AAK-7776-2020","Esposito, Piero/0000-0002-5616-8545",,,,,24,17,18,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Our view is that KPV have not successfully made the case that our study is rife with problems, that our findings are  simply spurious correlations, and that our conclusions are  highly doubtful. In our reply we take on each of KPV's criticisms. Specifically, we demonstrate that neither (1) our use of census data; nor (2) the problem of uneven enforcement of licensing laws; nor (3) measurement error in the timing and stringency of licensing laws; nor (4) the omitted variables that KPV identify systematically bias our estimates in favor of finding positive effects. In each of these instances, we show that the problems that KPV have identified would either bias our estimates toward zero or in the opposite direction of what we do find. Additionally, we argue that KPV's falsification tests do not clearly show that our empirical methodology is biased. Finally, we estimate new regressions in light of KPV's suggestions and find results that are consistent with our original conclusions. Accordingly, KPV have failed to mount a persuasive critique of our original paper.","[Law, Marc T.] Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Marks, Mindy S.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of Vermont; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Law, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",marc.law@uvm.edu; mindy.marks@ucr.edu,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,6,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

This does not occur at the expense of economic freedom, as an expansion of the middle class also implies more market-oriented economic policy on trade and finance.

When the weaker firm plays the leading position, the conclusions depend on the total capacity.

I use the results of growth accounting and the insights from a two-sector growth model to answer this question. A two-sector rather than a one-sector model is required because of the very rapid rate at which the prices of ICT products have fallen in the past and are expected to fall in the future. According to the two-sector model, the main boost to growth comes from ICT use, not la production. Even a country with zero la production can benefit via improving terms of trade. I quantify this effect for 15 European and 4 non-European countries, using the EU KLEMS database. The ICT intensity of production (the Id T income share) is much lower in many European countries than it is in the United States or Sweden. Nevertheless the contribution to long run growth stemming from even the current levels of ICT intensity is substantial: about half a per cent per annum on average in these 19 countries. If ICT intensity reached the same level as currently in the U.S. or Sweden, this would add a further 0.2 percentage points per annum to long run growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

When a technology has several distinct applications, FOUR allow the licensor to divide up his rights and attribute them to the lowest-cost producer in each field of use. This can improve production efficiency. With complex technologies, however, the boundaries of fields of use may be difficult to codify, entailing a risk of licensees' rights overlapping. We explore how this affects the optimal license contract in a moral hazard framework where the licensor's effort determines the probability of overlap. We show that depending on the contracting environment, the license agreement may include output restrictions and non-linear royalty schemes. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, a necessary presumption of financial stability is to reduce their dependence on one source of funding or in other words, the independence can be achieved by diversifying of the funding sources. And it is the diversification of financial sources and their acquisition through self-financing that we consider as an appropriate way to achieve financial balance and thus long-term existential security of non-profit organizations. This scientific paper presents the partial results of a research of the current state of self-financing and diversification of financial resources of private non-profit organizations in the Slovak Republic. We analysed the primary data by the relevant scientific methods and procedures (selected mathematical-statistical methods, analysed in SPSS - Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). With the analysis we acquired a knowledge which allows us to formulate several solutions and recommendations for theory and practice.

Our analysis shows that public sector employees are significantly less likely to choose the risky option (lottery) and, at the start of their career, significantly more likely to choose the pro-social option (charity). However, when tenure increases, this difference in pro-social inclinations disappears and, later on, even reverses.

Making some agents debt-constrained is a surprisingly powerful assumption. Fisherian debt deflation, the possibility of a liquidity trap, the paradox of thrift and toil, a Keynesian-type multiplier, and a rationale for expansionary fiscal policy all emerge naturally from the model. We argue that this approach sheds considerable light both on current economic difficulties and on historical episodes, including Japan's lost decade (now in its 18th year) and the Great Depression itself.

It advances several different specifications of the endogenous switching between the trading strategies and then estimates these models by the method of simulated moments (MSMs), where the choice of the moments reflects the basic stylized facts of the daily returns of a stock market index. In addition to the standard version of MSM with a quadratic loss function, we also take into account how often a great number of Monte Carlo simulation runs happen to yield moments that are all contained within their empirical confidence intervals. The model contest along these lines reveals a strong role for a (tamed) herding component. The quantitative performance of the winner model is so good that it may provide a standard for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The latter is the result of a standard substitution effect, whereas the former is the result of subsistence concerns. Theoretically, these results are not at odds with each other if these events differentially impacted rich and poor households. We also show that the earthquakes of 2001 resulted in large reductions in the number of female members who were sent abroad and large increases in hours of domestic labor supplied by female members.

Changes in the composition of the output mix might translate into changes of comparative advantages across countries, as revealed by trade flows. This paper focuses on this issue, looking at the changes in the structure of bilateral trade over the period 19962006 between China and 14 EU countries (EU14) as a measure of revealed comparative advantage (RCA). Using industry-level data on bilateral trade, air- and water-pollution intensity, and several measures of environmental stringency, we find that, after controlling for other factors (such as labor costs) on average our EU14 countries have kept or improved their RCA with respect to China in both water-polluting industries (such as paper and agro-based) and air-polluting industries (such as basic metals and chemicals), while they have lost competitiveness in the more clean industries (such as machinery and fabricated metals). Thus, we find no evidence of a pollution haven effect on the bilateral trade pattern between Europe and China.","Bank Italy, Int Econ Anal & Relat Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Marconi, D (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Int Econ Anal & Relat Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",daniela.marconi@bancaditali.ita,,,,,,,30,67,68,0,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We characterize the first-best allocation and show efficiency can be implemented with decentralization using head taxes. We calibrate the model and compare welfare in property-tax equilibria, both decentralized and centralized, to the efficient allocation. Inefficiencies with decentralization and property taxation are large, dissipating most if not all the potential welfare gains that efficient decentralization could achieve. In property-tax equilibrium, centralization is frequently more efficient! An externality in community choice underlies the failure to achieve efficiency with decentralization and property taxes: poorer households crowd richer communities and free ride by consuming relatively little housing thereby avoiding taxes.","[Calabrese, Stephen M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ Qatar, Doha, Qatar; [Epple, Dennis N.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Epple, Dennis N.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Romano, Richard E.] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business Adm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Qatar Foundation (QF); Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar; Carnegie Mellon University; National Bureau of Economic Research; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Calabrese, SM (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ Qatar, Doha, Qatar.",,,"Calabrese, Stephen/0000-0002-7892-0996; Epple, Dennis/0000-0002-7354-5728","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0958705] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,59,28,40,3,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

An equilibrium selection criterion is defined which we call coalitional stochastic stability (CSS). This differs from existing work on stochastic stability in that profitable coalitional deviations are given greater importance than unprofitable single player deviations. A general characterization of CSS is given together with more detailed characterizations for specific classes of games. Applications include contracting, asymmetric social norms and collusive price setting, the latter of which is shown in some circumstances to facilitate competitive outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The theoretical basis for our experiment is the model of Bramoulle and Kranton (2007). As predicted, we find that individuals are able to coordinate on equilibria, but that coordination strongly depends on the network structure. Despite frequent coordination failures, in graphs of size N = 4 equilibrium play seems easier on network architectures with high (low) density and low (high) centrality. If play converges, it almost exclusively does so towards the predicted equilibria. Theoretical results with respect to welfare are also confirmed. Next to global graph structural properties we also explore the effects of local and individual factors. We find that behavior on networks is affected by the number of (direct) neighbors, but not by individuals' risk attitudes. Apparently, the global and the local structure of a network does not leave much explanatory room for individual effects that pertain to risk taking. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a continuous-time model wherein a firm is endowed with a perpetual option to invest in a project at any time by incurring an investment cost at that instant. The amount of the investment cost is directly related to the intensity of investment that is endogenously chosen by the firm at the investment instant. The project generates a stream of stochastic revenue flows with a concomitant stream of constant cost flows, both of which increase with the investment intensity. We show that allowing the firm to make an irreversible decision to abandon the project does not affect the firms optimal investment intensity if the investment cost is totally reversible. Otherwise, the option to abandon the project induces the firm to choose a lower level of investment intensity. Furthermore, we show that the presence of the abandonment option pushes down the firms optimal investment trigger, thereby hastening the undertaking of the project.","Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Wong, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kpwong@econ.hku.hk,,,,,,,24,5,5,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Specifically, we measure mobile telephony demand estimating a point-to-point model of the text messaging traffic exchanged cross-network, identifying the impact of incoming traffic as well as network size. The analysis relies on a monthly dataset spanning 15 countries for the period 2002-2007. The econometric estimates of price elasticities indicate that incoming traffic is a key driver of SMS demand, as previously established for fixed telephony. A further novel contribution is the estimation of the demand impact of network size, a confounding factor for the effect of incoming traffic. The results hold implications for theories of network competition, optimal pricing by telecommunications operators and regulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Unique features of the organization of Chinese middle schools (Grades 7 to 9) and panel data allow us to overcome difficulties that have hindered the separation of peer effects from omitted individual factors due to self-selection and from common teacher effects and to identify peer effects at the classroom level. We estimate peer effects for Math, English, and Chinese test scores separately. In a linear-in-means model controlling for both individual and teacher-by-test fixed effects, peers are found to have a positive and significant effect on math test scores, a positive but insignificant effect on Chinese test scores, but no effect on English test scores. Importantly, in Math and Chinese students at the middle of the ability distribution tend to benefit from better peers, whereas students at the ends of the ability distribution do not, suggesting that policy makers who want to exploit positive peer effects face difficult tradeoffs in classroom and school assignment.

Fixed-effect analysis is applied on a longitudinal sample of Dutch employees in four work arrangements: regular, fixed-term, on-call and temporary agency work. Our results indicate that temporary agency work is the only contingent employment relation that is on average associated with lower job satisfaction compared to regular workers. Decomposition of this gap indicates that the major part is due to the low satisfaction experienced by agency workers regarding the content of their jobs. A lack of job security is also responsible for part of the gap. For fixed-term and on-call workers the negative satisfaction effect originating from the lack of job security and lower wages is compensated by other job aspects and a variant relationship between total job satisfaction and its components. However, male and high educated on-call workers do experience lower job satisfaction.","Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Adv Labour Studies, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"de Graaf-Zijl, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Adv Labour Studies, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.degraaf-zijl@uva.nl,,,,,,,43,19,26,1,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2012,160.0,2,,,SI,,197,218,,10.1007/s10645-011-9180-7,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,935RB,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303536700007,0

In contrast with previous studies, two separate unions - representing low-skilled and high-skilled workers respectively - are considered. Using Belgian firm-level data, labour bargaining power and relative wage preference have been estimated by skill level. When these estimates are subsequently regressed on a set of potential determinants, the bargaining power of low-skilled workers appears to fall with imports and offshoring, whereas the bargaining power of high-skilled workers is only positively affected by R&D activities. In addition, a significant effect of globalisation is found on the relative preference of unions for wages over employment, indicating that the effect of globalisation on the behaviour of labour unions is more encompassing than frequently assumed.

This paper examines necessary conditions for an economy to support institutions that implement markets. Agents differ in land holdings, skill, and power. A competitive market assigns land to the skilled, not necessarily to the powerful. Therefore a market allocation needs to be robust to coalitional expropriation. In a dynamic setting, market payoffs may induce sufficient inequality in next period's endowments for markets to alternate with expropriation in a limit cycle, decreasing efficiency and amplifying macroeconomic fluctuations. Long run stability of markets is favored by higher social mobility, more initial equality, and less mismatch between skill and land.","[Gall, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Masella, Paolo] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Masella, Paolo] Univ Mannheim, SFB 884, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Mannheim; University of Mannheim,"Gall, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",,,"Gall, Thomas/0000-0003-2257-1405",,,,,75,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

The topic is important to investors and also to policymakers, who wish to extract macroeconomic expectations from longer-term interest rates, and take actions to influence those rates. The simplest model of the term structure is the expectations hypothesis, which posits that long-term interest rates are expectations of future average short-term rates. In this paper, we show that many features of the configuration of interest rates are puzzling from the perspective of the expectations hypothesis. We review models that explain these anomalies using time-varying risk premia. Although the quest for the fundamental macroeconomic explanations of these risk premia is ongoing, inflation uncertainty seems to play a large role. Finally, while modern finance theory prices bonds and other assets in a single unified framework, we also consider an earlier approach based on segmented markets. Market segmentation seems important to understand the term structure of interest rates during the recent financial crisis.","[Guerkaynak, Refet S.] Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Wright, Jonathan H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Johns Hopkins University,"Gürkaynak, RS (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey.",,"GURKAYNAK, REFET SOYKAN/Y-9672-2018","GURKAYNAK, REFET SOYKAN/0000-0003-4266-7463",,,,,123,107,121,3,55,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

We examine three types of confidence and find that confidence measured by expected ranking is the most important determinant of decisions to enter tournaments. Conditional on ability, this measure eliminates gender differences in winner-take-all tournaments and, when entered with risk measures, eliminates differences in ranked compensation tournaments. When the sample is split by career choice, there are no gender differences for students in STEM fields, and in the humanities and the social sciences differences can be explained by confidence. However, for business school students, gender differences in willingness to compete in winner-take-all tournaments persist even after accounting for risk aversion and confidence.

We modify the traditional general equilibrium tax model to capture endogenous trade imbalances along with endogenous factor supply, a fixed exchange rate and a non-accommodative monetary policy structure which supports the Chinese trade imbalance. We calibrate model parameters to 2008 data and simulate counterfactual equilibrium for VAT tax basis switches in which the trade imbalance changes. Our results suggest that given China's trade surplus VAT regime switching to an origin basis can decrease China's trade surplus by over 40%, and additionally increase Chinese and world welfare.

Monte-Carlo analysis is employed to examine the small-sample properties of SMM in specifications with different curvatures and departures from certainty equivalence. Results show that SMM is computationally efficient and delivers accurate estimates, even when the simulated series are relatively short. However, the small-sample distribution of the estimates is not always well approximated by the asymptotic Normal distribution. An empirical application to the macroeconomic effects of skewed disturbances shows that negatively skewed productivity shocks induce agents to accumulate additional capital and can generate asymmetric businesscycles.

Our dynamic model of bank's profit maximization predicts a non-monotonic relationship between bank lending and macroeconomic uncertainty. We test this proposition using a panel of Ukrainian banks over the 2003Q2-2008Q2 period. The estimates indicate that banks decrease their lending ratio in times of substantial economic volatility, which could be explained by higher risk aversion of bank managers. Additionally, small and least profitable banks are less likely to be affected by changes in the macroeconomic environment compared to their large and most profitable peers. This outcome is robust with respect to the different measurements of macroeconomic uncertainty. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

First, we find that the enlargement in both the overall and residual inequality was larger at the upper half of the wage distributions between 2002 and 2007. Between 1995 and 2002, however, it is the lower half that experienced larger increase in inequality. Second, by using two complementary semi-parametric methods, we find that composition effect is negligible. Instead, the change in skill prices plays a dominant role in the rise of residual inequality. Finally, by constructing a panel data at the city level, we find that ownership restructuring is an important factor that has caused the skill price to rise, especially in the earlier period. Another finding is that China's export share of GDP has a positive effect on the enlargement of residual wage inequality, especially in the period from 2002 to 2007. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Contrary to the constant elasticity case, in which all gains from trade are due to product diversity, our model allows for a welfare decomposition between gains from product diversity and gains from pro-competitive effects. We show that the market outcome is not efficient because too many firms operate at an inefficiently small scale by charging too high markups. We further illustrate that trade raises efficiency by narrowing the gap between the equilibrium utility and the optimal utility. As the population gets arbitrarily large in the integrated economy, the equilibrium utility converges to the optimal utility because of the competitive limit. We finally extend the variable elasticity model to a multi-sector setting, and show that intersectoral distortions are eliminated in the limit. The multi-sector model allows us to illustrate some new aspects arising from intersectoral and intrasectoral allocations, namely that trade leads to structural convergence, rather than sectoral specialization, and that trade induces domestic exit in the nontraded sector.

Public policy is an instrument used in different countries to stimulate start-up companies, including attempts to influence national institutions, university structures and the incentives for individual researchers. This paper contributes with an analysis of Sweden, which has retained the 'professor's privilege', whereby the individual retains inventor rights and can choose to allocate ownership rights. The descriptive results of the survey revealed that academics have positive attitudes to commercialisation and relatively satisfactory commercialisation output. This paper examines the complementarities of research performance, networks and support structure in explaining commercialisation amongst university researchers in science and engineering in Sweden. The results show that publishing is positively correlated with commercialisation and that support structures play an important role through technology transfer offices, courses and incubators.

Unconditional liberalization by the large trading partner has an ambiguous effect on the small countrys dynamic incentives. Liberalization through a reciprocal trade agreement, in which the large country lowers its tariffs conditionally on the small country doing the same, unambiguously dominates unconditional liberalization by the large country as a way of boosting trade reforms and reinforcing policy credibility in the small country. However, if capacity in the import-competing sector can be reduced only gradually, a conditional, reciprocal agreement may require an asynchronous exchange of concessions, where the large country liberalizes before the small country does.","[Conconi, Paola] Univ Libre Bruxelles ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Conconi, Paola] CEPR, London, England; [Perroni, Carlo] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Warwick,"Conconi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles ECARES, Brussels, Belgium.",pconconi@ulb.ac.be,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,32,3,3,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

During a disaster an asset's fundamental value falls by a time-varying amount. This in turn generates time-varying risk premia and, thus, volatile asset prices and return predictability. Using the recent technique of linearity-generating processes, the model is tractable and all prices are exactly solved in closed form. In this article's framework, the following empirical regularities can be understood quantitatively: (i) equity premium puzzle; (ii) risk-free rate puzzle; (iii) excess volatility puzzle; (iv) predictability of aggregate stock market returns with price-dividend ratios; (v) often greater explanatory power of characteristics than covariances for asset returns; (vi) upward-sloping nominal yield curve; (vii) predictability of future bond excess returns and long-term rates via the slope of the yield curve; (viii) corporate bond spread puzzle; (ix) high price of deep out-of-the-money puts; and (x) high put prices being followed by high stock returns. The calibration passes a variance bound test, as normal-times market volatility is consistent with the wide dispersion of disaster outcomes in the historical record.

Focusing on initial plays observed in experiments, this paper attempts to offer another explanation based on thorough study of level-k models as applied to these games. Borrowing ideas from the cognitive hierarchy model (Camerer et al., 2004), the authors constructed a group of models based on levels of rationality, and also tested for various assumptions on the play of the most nave player type in these models. It was found that level-k models generally perform better than the agent quantal response equilibrium (AQRE) model and its variant with altruistic player types for increasing-pie centipede games, while the AQRE model with altruistic player types performs better in constant-pie games.

In this framework, knowing the bilateral details of each country's input-output structure is key to the correct calculation of the factor content of trade. Because input-output tables typically lack this detail, TZ impute the relevant input-output coefficients by making a proportionality assumption. This paper uses survey-based input-output coefficients from the Asian Input-output (AIO) tables that do provide bilateral details. Exploiting methodological differences in the compilation of the AIO tables and the data underlying TZ studies, this paper empirically assesses how well the TZ approach fits sourcing patterns of inputs and finds that it understates countries' use and relative use of foreign inputs, especially in those sectors where they are most used. As a result countries' use of domestic factors is overstated. Biases generated on exported and imported factor services cancel each other out. The net effect on the measured factor trade is small.

Using the basic framework of Arifovic and Masson (2003), we simulate the model for a large number of parameter specifications. The learning dynamics of our agent-based computational model, based on imitation of successful expectational rules and occasional experimentation, result in recurrent currency crises. Recurrent crises are a robust feature of the dynamics regardless of the model's parameter specifications. We discuss both the impact of imitation and experimentation on the model's dynamics, as well as the impact of the parameter values on the duration of episodes of devaluation and periods of no-devaluation. In addition, we compare the first difference in interest rate spread statistics of the data generated in our simulations and real world data. Finally, we conduct policy experiments in our agent-based type environment designed to examine the power of the interest rate policy changes in decreasing the number as well as the duration of the episodes of currency crisis. Our results indicate that the policy of decreasing, rather than increasing, the emerging market interest rate proves more effective at reducing the likelihood of devaluation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It presents a cointegration analysis identifying a distinct co-movement between exchange rate, reserves, and banknotes that holds over the three sub-periods of the sample.

A CRITIQUE OF INSTITUTIONALIST AND CULTURALIST ECONOMICS,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Christian-individualist belief; Islam; Latin America; Post hoc ergo proctor hoc; Primordial-normative reasoning; Rise of Western Europe,GEOGRAPHY; RELIGION,"Economists have recently started to discuss the roles of institutions and cultural beliefs in explaining the performance of civilizations. This paper investigates two views, institutionalist economics and culturalist economics, with regard to the question of why Europe rose economically a few centuries ago, while other regions of the world lagged behind. These two views share a common platform raised on two pillars. First, both regard institutions/beliefs as extra-economic as primordial entities that ultimately stand independent of economic performance. Second, both regard economic performance as fully determined by institutions/beliefs i.e. normative causality in the sense that institutions/beliefs determine performance. Douglass North's (2005) analysis of economic performance, for example, is based on both pillars. Concerning the primordial pillar, he attributes the mystery of the rise of Europe to primordial beliefs, viz. Christian dogma and English individualism. Concerning the normative pillar, he presumes that such beliefs have almost one-to-one correspondence with economic performance. This paper, though, maintains that the two pillars (primordial analysis and normative causality) are rather fragile: Advocates of the first pillar fail to recognize that institutions/beliefs are endogenous. Advocates of the second pillar fail to recognize that institutions/beliefs can give rise to diverse economic performances.","Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Khalil, EL (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",,"Khalil, Elias/ABA-3606-2021; Khalil, Elias L/I-7075-2012","Khalil, Elias/0000-0002-0510-447X;",,,,,104,4,4,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The Idea of Justice (2009) is a synthesis and a further development of his study in the field of social and economic welfare. He provides criteria of reason in order to reduce injustice in every human society. Accordingly he aims not to define what he calls criteria of transcendental justice, but instead rules of human behaviour that could be reached and established through a public debate in liberal and democratic societies. Sen's thinking is developed in the rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment, but following the Borda - de Condorcet approach, with the consequences of this choice.

Absent commitment to investment by the borrowing country, imperfect contract enforcement leads to an informational lag such that the debt contracted upon today depends upon the past stock of capital. The no-commitment delay originates a history effect by which the richer a country has been in the past, the more it can borrow today. For (arbitrarily) small delays, the history effect offsets the growth benefits from international borrowing and dampens growth, and it leads to both leapfrogging in long-run levels and growth breaks. When large enough, the history effect originates growth reversals and we connect the latter to leapfrogging. Finally, we argue that the model accords with the reported evidence on changes in the growth rate at break dates. We also provide examples showing that leapfrogging and growth reversals may coexist, so that currently poor but fast-growing countries experiencing sharp growth reversals may end up, in the long-run, significantly richer than currently rich but declining countries.","[Boucekkine, Raouf; Pintus, Patrick A.] Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France; [Boucekkine, Raouf; Pintus, Patrick A.] GREQAM IDEP, Marseille, France; [Boucekkine, Raouf] Catholic Univ Louvain, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Boucekkine, Raouf] IRES CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [Pintus, Patrick A.] Inst Univ France, Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite Catholique Louvain; Institut Universitaire de France,"Pintus, PA (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France.",,,,,,,,18,10,10,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Here we suggest that these features are best explained as the outcome of evolved human cognition, in such domains as mating, moral judgment and social exchange. As empirical illustrations, we show how this evolved psychology makes marriage systems, legal norms and commons management systems intuitively obvious and compelling, thereby ensuring their occurrence and cultural stability. We extend this to propose under what conditions institutions can become 'natural', compelling and legitimate, and outline probable paths for institutional change given human cognitive dispositions. Explaining institutions in terms of these exogenous factors also suggests that a general theory of institutions as such is neither necessary nor in fact possible. What are required are domain-specific accounts of institutional design in different domains of evolved cognition.","[Boyer, Pascal] Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Petersen, Michael Bang] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark",Washington University (WUSTL); Aarhus University,"Boyer, P (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, Campus Box 1125,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",pboyer@artsci.wustl.edu,"Petersen, Michael Bang/JOZ-2626-2023","Petersen, Michael Bang/0000-0002-6782-5635",,,,,106,49,52,0,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Based on the results we discovered four main deficiencies of the CDO market: i) an insufficient analysis of underlying assets by both investors and rating agencies; ii) investment decisions arise from the valuation model based on expected cash flows, they neglected other factors such as mark-to-market losses; iii) mispriced correlation; and finally iv) obligation of the mark-to-market valuation. Based on the mentioned recommendations we conclude that the CDO market has a chance to be regenerated but in smaller volumes compared to the pre-crisis period.

The data show that voters punish the incumbent party for weather events beyond its control. However, fewer voters punish the ruling party when its government responds vigorously to the crisis, indicating that voters reward the government for responding to disasters. We also find evidence suggesting that voters only respond to rainfall and government relief efforts during the year immediately preceding the election.

In this paper, using job flows from a sectoral panel dataset for four Latin American countries, we find that sudden stops are characterized as periods of lower job creation and increased job destruction. Moreover, these effects are heterogeneous across sectors: we find that when a sudden stop occurs, sectors with higher dependence on external financing experience lower job creation. In turn, sectors with higher liquidity needs experience significantly larger job destruction. This evidence is consistent with the idea that dependence on external financing affects mainly the creation margin and that exposure to liquidity conditions affects mainly the destruction margin. Overall, our results provide evidence of financial frictions being an important transmission channel of sudden stops and in the restructuring process in general. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

How is the general theory specified for political institutions? He, like Max Weber, suggests that a government monopoly of soldiers is a condition for the existence of political institutions. However, governments' wielding of force is only political if those attacked consider the attack a responsible and a morally acceptable act. All political power in Searle's theory is deontic. It is assigned as a right, an obligation or the like, as a status function. If power wielding by a government is not assigned, it is beyond the political; it is only brute force. My contention is that this distinction limits the power of Searle's theory in the analysis of politics. From the idea of political institutions as ultimate institutions in a specific, bordered territory it is the strong idea of deonticity that is misleading. Ultimate institutions cannot by definition have externally assigned status. Leaders of other ultimate institutions can accept their existence, but then mainly because they have the military power to defend their borders. Nation states, demanding territorial sovereignty, therefore logically demand a monopoly of soldiers. This sovereignty seen over time suggests an evolutionary first principle of political institutions.","Univ Bergen, Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Gran, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Bergen, Norway.",thorvald.gran@aorg.uib.no,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

To gain support for their trust in money, economic agents create hierarchically ordered structures of institutional insurance, which reflect the relative liquidity/enforceability of the monetary obligations taken by the parties to economic exchange. These layered structures of attendant institutions, however, fail to perform their supposed function of substantiating trust in money due to the problems of infinite regress, lack of the guarantor of last resort and uncontrollability of complex monetary systems.

Employing a broad set of mobility indices, we show that there is much mobility in household incomes from one year to the next and over longer periods in Russia. Both relative and absolute mobility in Russia are significantly higher than in Western countries. We demonstrate that income growth in Russia was strongly pro-poor in 2000-2005. Incomes of the relatively poor were growing faster than incomes of the relatively rich. However, this inequality-reducing effect was almost exactly offset by changes in the relative positions of individuals and the overall reduction in cross-sectional inequality was merely modest.

In central banks, however, the conventional view that inflation is ultimately determined by excess demand in the economy is still widely accepted, and research into activity-based models has continued. We add to this research by examining a range of activity-based models, with the aim being to determine whether any of these can outperform the autoregressive benchmark, and if so, which performs best. Our results show that an expectations-augmented, unemployment-based Phillips Curve can produce significantly superior forecasts of Australian trimmed mean inflation to both the autoregressive benchmark and others at a range of forecast horizons, while mark-up type models also produce superior results at longer horizons. This outperformance is shown to come from the period in which inflation rose to relatively high rates. These results do not, however, translate to headline consumer price index inflation, suggesting that inflation in the items that are trimmed largely reflects noise, as opposed to any signal of trend inflation.",,,"Norman, D (通讯作者)，GPO Box 2633, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",normand@rba.gov.au,"Richards, Anthony/R-1366-2019",,,,,,38,9,9,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

To this aim, we embed labor market search and matching frictions in a two-country New Keynesian model. We show that labor market frictions amplify the international propagation of supply and demand shocks. In terms of cyclical properties then, they raise the cross-country output correlation. Adding labor market search in the New Keynesian model thus improves its ability to account for the business cycle comovement observed in G7 countries in the recent decades. Nominal wage rigidity substantially contributes to this result. Labor market institutions also play a role. Yet, their impact is not unequivocal depending on the institution considered. Business cycle synchronization is thus found to increase with the generosity of the unemployment benefits system, whereas it decreases with the strictness of employment protection.

This model is used to assess production reallocation across sectors in each EU15 region, assuming a scenario in which world tariff liberalization is implemented in the agricultural sector. The model is parsimonious in terms of data, focusing on unskilled and skilled labor as the source of heterogeneity across regions. A stylized model is built to interpret trade policy effects. Results show decreases in agricultural production in the EU15 of about 0.93%. All regions reduce agriculture but show different magnitudes in the relative changes of production. Large reallocation effects are observed between manufactures and services, some regions specializing in the former and others in the latter. In addition, the introduction of labor mobility within the EU15 and the EU27 causes strong amplification effects in manufactures and services. (C) 2012 Society for Policy Modeling.

With the enforcement of these fiscal policies, domestic banking institutions face a more dynamic, increasingly intense and highly competitive environment even as the banking industry's overall efficiency has gradually been enhanced. This structural change has further forced individual banking institutions, especially state-owned banks, to inspect the performance of their branches and identify improvement directions so as to gain further competitive advantages. To conduct a valid, fair and reliable evaluation on Taiwan's bank branches, we integrate a two-stage series performance model and fuzzy multiobjective model. A new scheme that considers the complementation of production and intermediation activities within a branch and overcomes the shortage of the traditional network DEA methodology about DMUs cannot be assessed on a common base. The results indicate that the overall performances of mixed ownership bank branches are superior to those of state-owned bank branches, representing that the advantages of banking privatization have some remedial effects for improving the managerial inefficiency of state-owned banks. In addition, the sensitivity analysis and decision-making matrix herein help bank management to identify branches' efficiency, weakness, and directions for improvement. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Should a company with a large technology lead over its rivals receive the same IPR protection as a company with a more limited advantage? In this paper, we develop a dynamic framework for the study of the interactions between IPR and competition, in particular to understand the impact of such policies on future incentives. The economy consists of many industries and firms engaged in cumulative (step-by-step) innovation. IPR policy regulates whether followers in an industry can copy the technology of the leader. We prove the existence of a steady-state equilibrium and characterize some of its properties. We then quantitatively investigate the implications of different types of IPR policy on the equilibrium growth rate and welfare. The most important result from this exercise is that full patent protection is not optimal; instead, optimal policy involves state-dependent IPR protection, providing greater protection to technology leaders that are further ahead than those that are close to their followers. This is because of a trickle-down effect: providing greater protection to firms that are further ahead of their followers than a certain threshold increases the R&D incentives also for all technology leaders that are less advanced than this threshold.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Akcigit, Ufuk] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Pennsylvania,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",daron@mit.edu; uakcigit@econ.upenn.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023; Akcigit, Ufuk/IXD-8968-2023","Akcigit, Ufuk/0000-0002-8908-7645",,,,,49,148,171,4,115,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We use an equilibrium model of a credit market with moral hazard to characterize the theoretical effects and also develop a quantitative analysis using data from Sri Lanka. We show that the effects are likely to be nonlinear and heterogeneous by wealth group. They also depend on the extent of competition between lenders. There can be significant increases in profits and reductions in interest rates when credit markets are competitive. However, since these are due to reductions in moral hazard, that is, increased effort, the welfare gains tend to be modest when cost of effort is taken into account. Allowing for an extensive margin where borrowers gain access to the credit market can make these effects larger depending on the underlying wealth distribution.","[Besley, Timothy J.] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Besley, TJ (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,"Ghatak, Maitreesh/G-7753-2015","Ghatak, Maitreesh/0000-0002-6231-5580; Burchardi, Konrad Burchard/0000-0003-4230-0629",,,,,31,51,58,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Consumer subscription service entails transactions in two time periods: a forward transaction that allows consumers to select service options to hedge financial risks and a spot transaction that allows consumers to secure electricity on demand. The difference between the forward subscription and the actual consumption is settled at spot prices determined in a competitive wholesale electricity market. Priority service offers consumers choices from a menu of reliability-differentiated service options with compensatory insurance for curtailments. Following the principles of revelation and competitive consistency, the priority service menu provides consumers opportunities to choose options that are consistent with their individual preferences and demand characteristics. Combining priority service and dynamic pricing, consumer subscription service is Pareto superior to an undifferentiated service design. Overall, consumer subscription service provides consumers incentives and tools for efficient demand management fostering price-responsive demand in competitive electricity markets. It facilitates an essential linkage between competitive wholesale and retail markets in ways that would enable consumers to be engaged in the process of the industry's transition toward a smart grid future.","ISO New England, Holyoke, MA USA",,"Chao, HP (通讯作者)，ISO New England, Holyoke, MA USA.",hchao@iso-ne.com,,,,,,,25,19,23,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The conditional responses of forecast errors and disagreement among agents can also be used to differentiate between some of the most prominent models of information rigidities.","[Coibion, Olivier] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Coibion, Olivier; Gorodnichenko, Yuriy] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gorodnichenko, Yuriy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",William & Mary; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Coibion, O (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",,"Gorodnichenko, Yuriy/ABD-5366-2021",,,,,,56,333,383,1,48,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

This article considers how such biases affect regulatory decisions. The article posits a simple model of a regulator who serves as an agent to a political overseer. The regulator chooses a policy that accounts for the rewards she receives from the political overseer-whose optimal policy is assumed to maximize short-run outputs that garner political support, rather than long-term welfare outcomes-and the weight the regulator puts on the optimal long run policy. Flawed heuristics and myopia are likely to lead regulators to adopt policies closer to the preferences of political overseers than they would otherwise. The incentive structure for regulators is likely to reward those who adopt politically expedient policies, either intentionally (due to a desire to please the political overseer) or accidentally (due to bounded rationality). The article urges that careful thought be given to calls for greater state intervention, especially when those calls seek to correct firm biases. The article proposes measures that focus rewards to regulators on outcomes rather than outputs as a way to help ameliorate regulatory biases.","[Kovacic, William E.] George Washington Univ, Sch Law, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Cooper, James C.] George Mason Univ, Law & Econ Ctr, Sch Law, Arlington, VA USA",George Washington University; George Mason University,"Kovacic, WE (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Sch Law, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",wkovacic@law.gwu.edu,,", James/0000-0001-9651-5583",,,,,26,35,38,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Based on a New Empirical Industrial Organization model we estimate the market power of food retailers towards consumers and input suppliers with respect to three groups of dairy products (drinking milk, cheese, butter including others). Our empirical results suggest that market power of retailing exists towards consumers (in particular in the case of drinking milk) and towards input suppliers (in particular in the case of butter and other milk products). Market power is more significant (in statistical terms) downstream than upstream.

They also document and analyse the failure of Africa to industrialise while addressing the question of how policies might be reshaped to boost industrial development and accelerate structural transformation in Africa. Each of the papers explores one or more of the channels by which industrial development drives structural change. They pointed out that the idea that Africa should industrialise is not new as the continent's post-independence leaders - like those in many developing countries in the 1960s and 1970s - looked to state-led, import substituting industrialisation as the key to rapid economic growth. However, the industries they created were frequently uncompetitive and unsustainable, and efforts to spur industrial development in Africa largely vanished with the economic collapses and adjustment programs of the 1980s and 1990s. In contrast to the region's earlier efforts at industrial policy, it was argued that states must work with the market as public action moves beyond the regulatory reform agenda to addressing the physical, institutional and knowledge constraints limiting Africa's industrial development.","[Ajakaiye, Olu] AERC, Nairobi, Kenya; [Page, John] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC); Brookings Institution,"Ajakaiye, O (通讯作者)，AERC, Nairobi, Kenya.",ajakaiye_olu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,8,11,14,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

This income channel of the resource curse is stronger for countries with lower degrees of openness and forward altruism.

Yet, communication can serve entirely different purposes in dynamic settings as communication during the game may work as a means for renegotiation, potentially undermining the credibility of cooperative strategies. To explore this issue, this paper experimentally investigates cooperation and non-binding communication in a two-stage game. More specifically, two treatments are considered: one with only pre-play communication and one where subjects can also communicate intra-play between the stages of the game. The results highlight a nontrivial difference concerning the effects of pre-play communication between the two treatments. Sending or receiving pre-play messages has a positive and significant effect on cooperation if there is no possibility of intra-play communication. However, this effect is significantly reduced when when intra-play communication is allowed. The results suggest that the credibility of pre-play messages may depend crucially on future communication opportunities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, we use so-called multiobjective programming in connection with a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to determine the combinations of policy instruments that provide efficient combinations of inflation and unemployment. This approach results in an alternative version of the Phillips curve labelled as efficient Phillips curve. Our aim is to present an application of CGE models to a new area of research that can be especially useful when addressing policy exercises with real data. We apply our methodological proposal within a particular regional economy, Andalusia, in the south of Spain.

However, this scale can vary across individuals due to different perceptions on what are the right or appropriate bounds for Willingness To Pay (WTP). In this article, we test for scale-perception bias and propose a correction method based on the utilization of anchoring vignettes that define different degrees of preference for the nonmarket good. The proposed method is applied to study the commonly found anomaly 'probability neglect', which is defined by the insensitivity to the probability levels in the valuation of environmental risks. The results show that probability neglect disappears when WTP responses are corrected for self-perception bias through the utilization of the anchoring vignettes approach.","[Arana, Jorge E.; Leon, Carmelo J.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev TIDES, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Arana, Jorge E.] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Study Choice CenSoc, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Technology Sydney,"Araña, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev TIDES, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain.",jarana@daea.ulpgc.es,"Araña, Jorge E./D-1139-2011; Suárez, Beatriz/L-6377-2014","Araña, Jorge E./0000-0003-0878-9934; Suárez, Beatriz/0000-0001-7132-9346",,,,,37,17,17,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The estimation evaluates the effects of public and private imbalances on the dynamics of the current account. Correlation coefficients support the Ricardian equivalence. Higher budget deficit correlates with a reduction in private consumption and an increase in private savings. Government saving does not vary significantly with macroeconomic variables in the short- or in the long-run. In contrast, fluctuations in government investment vary significantly with a number of economic variables in the long- and in the short-run. Accordingly, fluctuations in the budget deficit are likely to be driven by fluctuations in public investment. In contrast to government savings, private savings vary significantly with macro variables in the long- and in the short-run. Fluctuations in private investment appear less evident compared to that in private savings. Overall, fluctuations in the current account balance appear to be more tied to movements in the budget deficit. Nonetheless, fluctuations in the budget deficit are moderated by an increase in private savings and a reduction in private investment, moderating fluctuations in the current account balance.","[Batdelger, Tuvshintugs] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kandil, Magda] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Boston University; International Monetary Fund,"Batdelger, T (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",tuvshuu@bu.edu; mkandil@imf.org,,,,,,,49,12,12,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that: 1) enterprise credit is positively associated with economic growth whereas household credit is not; and 2) enterprise credit is significantly associated with faster reductions in income inequality whereas household credit is not. We also find that the share of household credit is higher in more urban societies, in countries with smaller manufacturing sectors and more market-based financial systems, while market structure and regulatory policies are not related to credit composition.","[Beck, Thorsten] Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Beck, Thorsten] Tilburg Univ, European Banking Ctr, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Bueyuekkarabacak, Berrak] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Rioja, Felix K.; Valev, Neven T.] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Beck, T (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands.",T.Beck@uvt.nl; bbahadir@uga.edu; frioja@gsu.edu; nvalev@gsu.edu,"Beck, Thorsten/GRX-3987-2022","Bahadir, Berrak/0000-0001-8036-2818",,,,,73,171,182,0,34,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6116,1935-1690,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

These costs are a financial burden to importers and ultimately to consumers. This study measures the transaction costs that are created by the obsolete customs and port handling procedures in North Cyprus. Such an analysis is important because since 1974 North Cyprus has suffered under a direct trade embargo. All its imports and exports must come or go via the ports in Turkey. This study finds that excessive trade transaction costs inflicted by the inefficient port handling and customs services of North Cyprus is between 1.42 to 2.96 times as costly as the extra transportation costs caused by the international embargo on its direct trade with the rest of the world.,"[Jenkins, Glenn P.] No Cyprus & Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Berhan, Bahro A.] Centennial Coll, Sch Business, Toronto, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada; Eastern Mediterranean University,"Jenkins, GP (通讯作者)，No Cyprus & Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada.",Jenkins@econ.queensu.ca,"Jenkins, Glenn P./AAX-3438-2021","Jenkins, Glenn P./0000-0003-4416-0164",,,,,15,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Offending behaviour (the principal area of interest in this paper) is costly to its victims and to society and is closely intertwined with exclusion. Offending is often found in association with other indicators of exclusion such as unemployment, problematic substance misuse and mental and physical health issues. The paper uses a generic model of offending, based on the notion of human capital development, viewed from the wider context of social exclusion. It seeks to avoid two criticisms of standard economic models of crime, namely that they tend to be static rather than dynamic and also that they omit any treatment of adolescence during which preferences and planning skills are still in their formative phase. The paper uses data from a number of contemporary English surveys to test the principal conjectures on which a more general, economics-based approach to offending might be developed. The paper concludes that an approach that considers the role of social exclusion provides a better understanding of offending than one that treats crime purely as an enforcement issue.","[Bowles, Roger] York Criminal Justice Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England",,,roger.bowles@btopenworld.com,,,,,,,40,3,3,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTR 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-916X,,978-3-7908-2772-9; 978-3-7908-2771-2,AIEL SER LABOUR ECON,,,2012,,,,,,,105,125,,10.1007/978-3-7908-2772-9_6,0.0,,,21,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDD90,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312877400006,0

The goal, which is reached by analyzing cross-country data, is firstly to describe the situation of social exclusion with the use of specific socio-economic variables, and secondly to compare the levels of education and training for each considered country. These two phenomena are mutually influenced, as a low level of literacy in affecting the employment status precludes the possibility to enter and operate freely in society, while poverty and persistent social exclusion of a person or family make difficult to address appropriate educational and training paths. Therefore, our study has rejoined two issues which influence almost all decisions adopted by policy makers, especially in the Western world. The opening issue is the level of education, which should constitute the human capital of a country, through appropriate investment, and the second one is the relational condition of social dynamics, which highlight the so-called social capital. Together these two types of intangible capitals constitute a strong support for the long-term development of a country. Our quantitative analysis is also addressed to detect differences and peculiarities among the different national realities, with the ultimate purpose to recognize which socioeconomic variables affect more directly the processes of education.","[Bucciarelli, Edgardo; Pagliari, Carmen] Univ dAnnunzio Chieti Pescara, Dipartimento Metodi Quantitat & Teoria Econ, I-65127 Pescara, Italy; [Muratore, Fabrizio; Odoardi, Iacopo] Univ Annunzio Chieti Pescara, Scuola Super, Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Bucciarelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ dAnnunzio Chieti Pescara, Dipartimento Metodi Quantitat & Teoria Econ, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.",e.bucciarelli@unich.it; c.pagliari@unich.it; fabrizio.muratore@gmail.com; iacopo.odoardi@alice.it,"Odoardi, Iacopo/AAF-3699-2021","Odoardi, Iacopo/0000-0002-5511-5564",,,,,42,0,0,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTR 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-916X,,978-3-7908-2772-9; 978-3-7908-2771-2,AIEL SER LABOUR ECON,,,2012,,,,,,,35,+,,10.1007/978-3-7908-2772-9_3,0.0,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDD90,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312877400003,0

This activity may generate income that depends nonlinearly on hours dedicated to it. The individual can also work in the labour market (an activity that does not increase utility by itself) in exchange for an hourly wage, and obtain income not related to hours. Conditions are obtained that sort individuals into two groups, part-time and full-time artists, deriving their labour supply functions in both activities. The predictions of the model are tested empirically using a sample of musicians from a Uruguayan performing rights society. Increases in outside wages drive part-time artists out of the labour market, but no significant increase in arts hours is detected. Higher nonlabour income also reduces nonarts work time of part-time artists, but does not have a significant impact in their arts hours. Conversely, arts hours of full-time artists increase with nonlabour income.","[Casacuberta, Carlos] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Dept Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Gandelman, Nestor] Univ ORT Uruguay, Dept Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; University ORT Uruguay","Casacuberta, C (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Dept Econ, Constituyente 1502, Montevideo, Uruguay.",carlosc@decon.edu.uy,,"Gandelman, Nestor/0000-0002-4023-8342",,,,,16,17,19,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The second reason emphasises the entrepreneurial, risk-taking nature of self-employment, which according to this view is procyclical and similar to wage employment. This article examines these views by looking at labour market flows obtained from the Polish LFS. As the self-employed account for about 20% of the working population in Poland knowledge about their behaviour over the business cycle is of particular importance. The results point to countercyclical behaviour of self-employed farmers and the entrepreneurial nature of own-account workers and entrepreneurs with employees.","[Cichocki, Stanislaw] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland; [Cichocki, Stanislaw] Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Cichocki, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.",scichocki@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Cichocki, Stanislaw/ABA-9567-2020","Cichocki, Stanislaw/0000-0003-2500-5046",,,,,47,6,6,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24.0,2,,,,,219,239,,10.1080/14631377.2012.675157,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,944CD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304175100004,0

This article constructs and examines the labour pathways followed by Spanish young people who have completed vocational lower secondary education. To do so, we use the Survey on Educational-Training Transition and Labour Integration, a retrospective longitudinal dataset that contains monthly calendar information about the labour states in the 4 years after completing vocational education. A wide range of states is covered: part-time employment, full-time employment, unemployment and several situations of inactivity. To examine young labour pathways we use sequence analysis, an exploratory technique which allows us to obtain a measure of dissimilarity between sequences. Later, a cluster analysis is applied that allow us to identify seven patterns of transition into the labour market. Nevertheless, most trajectories may be classified as linear, with a successful integration into the labour market. A multinomial logit model confirms that demographic and educational variables are relevant to explain the pathways followed by young people.","[Corrales-Herrero, H.; Rodriguez-Prado, B.] Univ Valladolid, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Corrales-Herrero, H (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Dept Econ Aplicada, Ave Valle Esgueva 6, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.",helena@eaee.uva.es,"Corrales-Herrero, Helena/G-7150-2017; Rodriguez-Prado, Beatriz/M-2576-2014","Corrales-Herrero, Helena/0000-0002-6256-021X; Rodriguez-Prado, Beatriz/0000-0002-6257-6385",,,,,40,9,10,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show that the average gap in test scores of children of immigrants and natives differs widely across countries, and is strongly related to achievement differences in the parent generation. The disadvantage of immigrant children reduces, and even disappears for some countries, once we condition on parental background characteristics. A foreign language spoken at home is the single most important factor associated with the achievement gap. An alternative reference group to native children are children born to non-emigrants in the country of origin. We compare mathematics test scores of children of Turkish immigrants in several destination countries, to those of Turkish children in Turkey whose parents have not emigrated. We find that in most host countries, the test score achievement of the children of Turkish immigrants (although being lower than that of their native peers) is higher than that of children of their cohort in the home country. This is conditional and unconditional on parental background characteristics. The higher school- and peer- quality relative to that in the home country is a main determinant of the educational advantage of immigrant children.","[Dustmann, Christian] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; Univ Milan, CReAM, IZA, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of London; University College London; University of Milan,"Dustmann, C (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",,,"FRATTINI, TOMMASO/0000-0002-9844-881X",,,,,35,112,118,2,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Unlike previous studies we are able to account for the heterogeneity across firms in their exposure to foreign competition. We focus on a situation akin to a natural experiment, and examine the impact of a sharp real appreciation of the Norwegian Krone in the early 2000s on Norwegian manufacturing firms which differ substantially in their trade orientation. A change in the real exchange rate (RER) affects a firm through three different channels: (i) firm's export sales, (ii) firm's purchases of imported inputs, and (iii) import competition faced in the domestic market. Unlike previous studies, we are able to examine all three channels. Both net exporters and import-competing firms were exposed to increased competition due to the real appreciation. Both groups reacted by shedding labor, but only the first group experienced increasing labor productivity. Partly, the productivity improvements came from measured TFP gains, while capital deepening does not appear to have been affected by the shock. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose a new set of indicators derived from the Annual Reports on Exchange Arrangements and Export Restrictions. Contrary to most earlier attempts to construct control indicators from this source, our set of indices allows one to analyze the control intensity separately for inflow, outflow and repatriation controls. An additional set of indicators features information on the institutional design of controls. At first glance, the data show that the financial crisis caused a surge in capital market restrictions, most notably concerning the derivatives market. This reflex, which is not justified by the scarce empirical evidence on the success of controls, shows the importance of having a valid measure to allow an econometrically sound policy evaluation in this field.

Experience with this instrument has been mixed, with a crucial design issue being the choice of whether to auction allowances to firms, or to grandfather them based on historical emissions. In this paper, we examine the changing incentives of investment in different technologies, when investors are risk averse and are expecting an allowance system with a certain allocation rule but do not know if the policy is going to take place in the near future. Investors also cannot fully predict future investment costs for the low-carbon technology. We apply a game theoretic model to examine the combined effects of uncertainty and risk aversion on the actions of potential investors into high and low carbon generating capacity, under both allocation rules and uncertain costs.

The Bayesian SVAR allows us to model the entire panel of metropolitan areas through the imposition of a shrinkage prior. We then seek the origin of the city-level asymmetric responses. We find strong evidence that the population density and the size of the local government sector mitigate the effects of monetary policy on local employment. The roles of the traditional interest rate, equity, and credit channels are marginalized relative to the previous findings based on less-granular definitions of regions.

Now, with the adoption of the new Europe 2020 strategy, Poland once again faces a great challenge: by 2020 it has to demonstrate intelligent development, i.e. one founded on knowledge and innovations. The aim of the article is to analyze and to assess R&D activities in Poland in comparison with EU-27 states in the years 2004-2010, and their impact on the innovativeness of their economies. The assumption is that the structure of R&D expenditures and the complementarity of research centers and private enterprise have a decisive influence on the level of an economy's innovativeness. The analysis presented in the article indicates that the financing structure of R&D expenditures in Poland is just the opposite to the pattern revealed by the highly developed countries and recommended by the European Commission. It is a structure which supports incremental rather than radical innovations.

One possible theoretical explanation for these results is that the hard-close ending rule accommodates the practice of sniping, which leads to a lower expected selling price.

In particular, research is uncovering not only the location of brain regions where certain processes are taking place, but also the nature of the (economically meaningful) latent variables that are represented, as well as how they relate to behavior. This transition from understanding where to how economic decisions are being made in the brain has been integral to relating neural processes to economic models of behavior. This progress, however, has been notably uneven. Neuroeconomic studies of individual decision-making, such as those involve risk and time preferences, have the benefit of drawing on decades of work from neuroscientific studies of animal behavior. Critically, many of these findings are based on quantitative, computational approach that lends well to economic experimentation. In contrast, our understanding of the neural systems underlying social behavior is much less specific. A large measure of the current challenge in fact arises from the empirical shortcomings of standard game theoretic predictions of behavior, which are largely equilibrium-based. Using our own study as an example, we show how one can directly search for the latent variables implied by current economic models of strategic learning, and attempt to localize them in the brain. Specifically, we show that the neural systems underlying strategic learning build directly on top of those involved in simple trial-and-error learning, but incorporate additional computations that capture belief-based learning. Finally, we discuss how our approach can be extended to address fundamental problems in economics.","[Hsu, Ming] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Helen Wills Neurosci Program, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhu, Lusha] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Tech Caril Res Inst, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Hsu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Helen Wills Neurosci Program, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,63,3,3,2,25,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

The recent literature sheds some doubt on the sources of productivity and wage premium, suggesting that most of the performance gap is actually due to self-selection. In the present paper we reevaluate the productivity and wage premium of foreign affiliates using a large dataset of Romanian firms, for the period 2000-2008. In order to correct for self- selection and endogeneity, we use a non-parametric econometric approach. Propensity score matching allows us to go beyond a correlation analysis and establish a causal effect of foreign ownership on performance gaps. We find that that around 40% of the productivity gap and 42% of the wage premium is due to self-selection. Once this bias removed, foreign affiliates still present 19% higher productivity and 22% higher wages compared to domestic firms. Results also confirm spillovers effects to domestic firms and show evidence of rent-sharing between foreign affiliates and their employees. We conclude that FDI do indeed have beneficial effects in the Romanian economy, though their magnitude is considerably overestimated.","[Jude, Cristina] Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Jude, C (通讯作者)，58-60 T Mihali St, Cluj Napoca 400591, Romania.",cristina.jude@econ.ubbcluj.ro,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,12,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The author shows that in order to attain the highest possible growth rate, one has to eliminate all the taxes, both income tax and consumption taxes. He proves mathematically that indirect taxes are less detrimental to economic growth than direct taxes imposed on wages and profits. Moreover, wage taxes are much more detrimental to economic growth as compared with the same percentage tax imposed on capital profits. Using empirical data for Poland, the author analyses the growth effects of 12 different variants of tax reduction. Reducing the total tax burden from 33% to 30% of GDP would increase the GDP growth rate by 1/4 percentage point. A significant acceleration of economic growth could also be achieved by raising the expenditure tax rates and lowering the income tax rates, without effecting the total amount of tax revenues.","Uniwersytet Ekonometry Poznaniu, Katedra Ekon Matematycznej, Poznan, Poland",,"Konopczynski, M (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekonometry Poznaniu, Katedra Ekon Matematycznej, Poznan, Poland.",michal.konopczynski@ue.poznan.pl,"Konopczynski, Michal/M-7593-2019",,,,,,20,1,1,2,4,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2012,,6,,,,,689,711,,,,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,075DQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313864400002,0

We compare 2009 and 2010 PGA Tour results in a manner consistent with previous studies of offsetting behaviour and golf club groove construction.

Such a FTA can be expected to comprise opportunities as well as challenges for both the EU and Ukraine and to have an impact on agricultural markets. This article provides a model-based quantitative assessment of the potential impact of a FTA on agricultural commodity markets and farmers' revenues in the EU and Ukraine. For the quantitative analysis the dynamic, partial equilibrium model AGLINK-COSIMO has been adapted and applied. The analysis focuses on the bilateral trade positions and not on the effect on other countries. The simulation of a FTA between the EU and Ukraine was done through the elimination of import tariffs for the main agricultural commodities. The results of the simulation indicate a positive change in producer revenue of EUR 393 million (+2.6%) in Ukraine and EUR 860 million (+0.4%) in the EU. So this FTA entails benefits for the agricultural sectors of both trading partners. However, gains from a FTA are not distributed homogeneously and vary significantly among commodities. Ukrainian agricultural producers should also be prepared to meet the challenges involved in the necessity to comply with the quality and sanitary standards of the EU.","[Nekhay, Olexandr; Fellmann, Thomas; Gay, Stephan Hubertus] Inst Prospect Technol Studies, European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Nekhay, O (通讯作者)，Inst Prospect Technol Studies, European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain.",onekhay@hotmail.com,"Nekhay, Olexandr/O-7762-2014; Nekhay, Olexandr/AAD-6682-2022","Nekhay, Olexandr/0000-0002-1887-2056; Nekhay, Olexandr/0000-0002-1887-2056; Fellmann, Thomas/0000-0002-4798-329X",,,,,20,3,3,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24.0,3,,,,,351,363,,10.1080/14631377.2012.705469,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,989WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307591500003,0

Unlike its predecessors in the evolution/learning literature, this is achieved without assumptions of convexity of the characteristic function or a reliance on random errors. The stochastic stability properties of the model are then examined and it is shown that stochastically stable states solve a simple and intuitive minimization problem which reduces to maximizing a Rawlsian SWF for a common class of utility functions.

The market model has three features: (1) economic entities such as consumers and firms are regarded as autonomous agents; (2) micro interactions among consumer agents or firm agents have essential mechanisms interpretable in real markets; and (3) consumers' preferences and firms' technologies co-affect their evolutionary behavior. In recent years, consumers have experienced various inconveniences from de facto competition based on a market mechanism. Standardization communities or committees such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) need to design a compatible standard or a de jure standard in a market. However, it is difficult for market designers to decide a method or timing for the standardization. Here, by introducing a novel technique used in agent-based social simulation (ABSS), which we call scenario analysis, we aim to support such decision making. Scenario analysis provides the possible market changes that can occur following implementation of a design policy under a specific market situation and the market mechanisms that generate these market changes.","[Ohori, Kotaro; Takahashi, Shingo] Waseda Univ, Dept Ind & Management Syst Engn, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1698555, Japan",Waseda University,"Ohori, K (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Dept Ind & Management Syst Engn, Shinjuku Ku, 3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan.",oohori@fuji.waseda.jp; shingo@waseda.jp,,,,,,,46,9,10,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We analyze the Great Depression for the United States, severe and milder financial crises for advanced economies, severe financial crises for emerging markets, and postwar recessions for the United States and other advanced economies.

The target of this paper is to analyse the decisions of EU donors during the last decade, more specifically, it is to observe to what extent they link the development aid flows with their own political or commercial interests. We found contradictory trends in behaviours of EU donors. Our observations confirm the findings of other authors pointing at the Nordic countries as being the less selfish donors providing aid for purely development related aims, while countries as France, Portugal, or Germany being the examples of those lining aid with their own political or commercial aims. The new EU donors are found to have very divers behaviours (differences between their behaviours being even more divergent than for the group of old EU donors), when it comes to their bilateral aid which is however still a very small part of the total aid they provide.","Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Rimegová, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",katarina.rimegova@tuke.sk,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,TECH UNIV KOSICE,KOSICE,"FAC ECONOMICS, INST REGIONAL & COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, KOSICE, 00000, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-1225-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,147,152,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3LJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359860200016,0

Government free riding is at question and is found to be active in that private donations partially displace state government funding at the rate of 83 cents on the dollar. That compares to the 45 cents political substitution of the 1960s but is much diminished from the $1.07 of the 1980s. Those are aggregate comparisons for all public institutions. A disaggregated approach in this article additionally reveals that doctoral granting research universities are somewhat lesser victims of crowd out in experiencing a 71 cents cut. At master level colleges and universities and associate 2 year degree granting colleges, crowding out is estimated to be on the order 87 cents and $1.10, respectively. Relative to the academic year 2000 to 2001, publicly controlled colleges and universities are found to experience significant reductions in state appropriated funding in 2003 to 2004 and 2006 to 2007. Even accounting for changes in the business cycle and changes in possible government spending priorities over time, the overall findings support the persistent effect of this brand of crowding out.","Wright State Univ, Dept Econ, Dayton, OH 45435 USA",University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton,"Sav, GT (通讯作者)，Wright State Univ, Dept Econ, Dayton, OH 45435 USA.",tom.sav@wright.edu,,,,,,,19,5,5,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It aims to stress the need of respecting green environmental principles as the main instrument of attracting foreign tourists to Romanian destinations, for the future sustainable development of the sector. A panel analysis, including 3 models, was used to study the impact of GHG emissions in 23 generating countries for the period 1993-2008. All 3 models proved to be significant and underlined a medium-high influence of GHG emissions and a low-medium influence of renewable energies on international tourism flows to Romania.

Our results proved a heavy-tailed pattern of operational risk data as documented by many researchers. Additionally, we showed that the PWM is quite consistent when the data is limited as it was able to provide reasonable and consistent capital estimates. Our findings show that when using the Advanced Measurement Approach rather than the Basic Indicator Approach used in Basel II, the researched bank might save approx. 6-8% of its capital requirement on operational risk.","Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Teply, P (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic.",teply@fsv.cuni.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,,,,,50,12,12,0,20,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

An understanding of the motivation of the Russian government to support this export monopoly is important if Europe wishes to reduce its dependence on Gazprom. The principal aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of this important question. Our analysis employs a theoretical model and several numerical simulations of an alternative organization used for gas exports, where independent gas producers in Russia are permitted to export gas to Europe. We evaluate the effects of this alternative organization on consumer surplus, industry profits, and Russian welfare. The results demonstrate that while export by independent producers reduces Gazprom's export profits, it may also increase the total domestic and export profits earned by the Russian gas industry. However, the results also suggest that Russian gas consumers will not benefit if independent gas producers are able to supply both the domestic and international markets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our empirical analysis is based on a new version of the causality test of John Geweke (1982, p. 77) and Yuzo Hosoya (1991, p. 88) in the frequency domain proposed recently by Jorg Breitung and Bertrand Candelon (2006, p. 132). In addition, using standard methods in spectral analysis, we decompose the total covariance between capital flows and growth across main frequency bands and capture lead/lag interactions between them. Some of our findings are as follows: Variance decompositions over frequency bands reveal that variations in individual capital flow categories are largely concentrated over high (seasonal) frequencies. The nature of the interaction/feedback between growth and capital flows varies significantly over frequency bands and subcategories of flows. Over business cycle frequencies, two out of four subcategories of inflows, short-term external borrowings and portfolio investments on government bonds, drive growth whereas the other two components, long-term borrowings and portfolio investments on shares, are driven by growth. Furthermore, for the post-2001 financial crisis period we found significant bi-directional causality between long-term external borrowings and growth whereas portfolio investments, bond flows and short-term external borrowings do not affect growth in the long run.","[Yildirim, Nuri] Yasar Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey; [Tastan, Huseyin] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Yasar University; Yildiz Technical University,"Yildirim, N (通讯作者)，Yasar Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey.",nuri.yildirim@yasar.edu.tr; tastan@yildiz.edu.tr,"Tastan, Huseyin/AAB-2088-2021","Tastan, Huseyin/0000-0002-2701-1039",,,,,54,3,4,0,16,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,4,,,,,441,462,,10.2298/PAN1204441Y,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,020GX,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309798100003,0

Following that, a fuzzy clustering analysis is deployed on the estimates to classify markets into subsets of markets with symmetrical degrees of interactions. Findings are compared across 4 periods, that is, the Asian crisis period, the stable period after the Asian crisis but before the global crisis, the global recession period, and the whole sample period. Whilst groupings of markets differ depending on period, it seems clear that extents of association with DJIA predominantly determine the pattern of linkages across Asian markets. In another respect, the paper demonstrates the usefulness of complementing conventional econometric methodology with cluster analysis, a comparatively rarely used approach in finance.","[Zainudin, Rozaimah; Quah, Chee Heong] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Zainudin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",,"zainudin, rozaimah/AAA-4984-2021; ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/GQA-9048-2022; QUAH, CHEE-HEONG/B-7754-2010; ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/B-9626-2010","zainudin, rozaimah/0000-0002-9929-8753; ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/0000-0002-9929-8753; ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/0000-0002-9929-8753",,,,,16,1,1,0,2,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

I also examine whether being out of the labour force is correlated with the frequency of religious service attendance. Results using Poisson fixed-effect and negative binomial estimation suggest that men under age 50 appear to attend religious services less frequently when out of the labour force. I ascribe this finding to younger men's religious service attendance being related to having work or the pursuit of work. Men between ages 50 and 65 attend religious services less frequently when out of the labour force, which I attribute to serious health problems in later age forcing labour market exiting and reduced frequency of religious service attendance. Women between ages 50 and 65 attend religious services more frequently when out of the labour force, which I ascribe to having more time to pursue religious activity in addition to women's established proclivity to religious commitment.","West Texas A&M Univ, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Canyon, TX 79016 USA",Texas A&M University System; West Texas A&M University,"Meredith, NR (通讯作者)，West Texas A&M Univ, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Canyon, TX 79016 USA.",nmeredith@wtamu.edu,,"Meredith, Neil/0000-0002-4749-4533",,,,,37,0,0,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that as long as there is some degree of social fragmentation, increasing it leads to lower public good provision by majority group members. This is mainly because the share of those in the majority group who contribute fully to the public good diminishes with social fragmentation, while the share of free-riders is unchanged. This suggests social identity preferences drive our result, as opposed to self-interest. Importantly, we find no difference in contribution between homogeneous and maximally-fragmented treatments, reinforcing our finding that majority groups contribute most in the presence of some diversity.

We quantify such effects for Mexican-born men in the U.S. by recognizing that immigrants who marry U.S. natives receive expedited green cards (Permanent Residency). Robust IV estimates indicate that intermarried Mexicans earn a 40 percent wage premium, and larger for the most mobile subgroups. Analogous premiums are statistically insignificant for men from Puerto Rico, who acquire no new rights because they are already U.S. citizens. Attributing the approximately 30 percent difference to green cards, we estimate that eliminating wait times would increase Mexicans' mean earnings $120,000-$150,000 in present value.

In this paper, we show that: (i) the construction of unit labor costs using aggregate data, the standard practice, leads to serious problems of interpretation; (ii) aggregate unit labor costs are not a sum or an average of firms' unit labor costs; and (iii) aggregate unit labor costs are simply the product of the share of labor in total income times the aggregate price deflator. As such, they simply reflect the distribution of income between wages and profits. We conclude that aggregate unit labor costs should not be calculated, and certainly should not be used as a measure of competitiveness. Data for 1980-2007 confirms that aggregate unit labor costs increased across the eurozone. But of the 12 countries studied, the labor share declined in nine, it increased in one (Greece), and it remained constant in two. Overall, aggregate unit labor costs increased as a result of the increase in the price deflator. We conjecture that the increase in unit labor costs was the result of the non-tradable sectors gaining share in the overall economy. Recent data for 2008-2012 indicate that aggregate unit labor costs have stopped increasing and have even declined in some countries. This is due to the fact the labor shares have continued declining and that the overall price deflator has dramatically reversed its upward trend, either flattening or declining.","[Felipe, Jesus; Kumar, Utsav] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Felipe, J (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines.",jfelipe@adb.org; ukumar@adb.org,,,,,,,16,24,27,0,11,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between energy intensity and income (energy intensity Kuznets curve). Ten provinces, notably the developed east coast provinces, have already passed the turning point of 29,673 RMB. The number of years for the other 19 provinces to reach the turning point ranges between 8.3 (Jilin) and 21.8 (Yunnan). The share of the secondary sector in the own province and in neighboring provinces causes an increase in energy intensity, the capital-labor ratio a decrease. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has a significant negative spatial spillover impact on energy intensity. To improve the sustainability of its energy resources and its environmental conditions, China needs to continue reducing its energy intensity by further developing modern industrial systems to counterbalance the negative effects of its economic growth and energy consumption. An adequate policy handle is investment in research and development and stimulation of their introduction into production processes. For that purpose, market mechanisms can be readily applied, particularly energy prices that adequately reflect energy scarcity and external effects. FDI is also an effective tool to transfer advanced technology to China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Price disparity between different market hubs is attributed to the collision between growing volumetric flows of crude oil (as well as changing quality mix of produced crudes) and rigidity of the existing midstream and refining infrastructure.

However, these studies do not carefully analyze how these groups overcome low human capital investment activities. Unlike previous studies, the model in this paper includes network externalities in both the human capital investment stage and the subsequent career stages. This implies that not only the current network quality, but also the expectations about future network quality affect the current investment decision. Consequently, the coordinated expectation among the group members can play a crucial role in the determination of the final state. We define overlap for some initial skill ranges, whereby the economic performance of a group can be improved simply by increasing expectations of a brighter future. We also define poverty trap for some ranges, wherein a disadvantaged group is constrained by its history, and we explore the egalitarian policies to mobilize the group out of the trap.","[Kim, Young-Chul] Sangmyung Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Seoul 110743, South Korea; [Loury, Glenn C.] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Sangmyung University; Brown University,"Kim, YC (通讯作者)，Sangmyung Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Seoul 110743, South Korea.",yckim.kdi@gmail.com; Glenn_Loury@brown.edu,"Kim, Young Chul/HLH-7322-2023",,NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041020] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,24,8,10,2,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

This paper considers the economic costs of EU exclusion from the economic cooperation initiatives in Asia, It finds that, although on the whole the effects will be small, the EU could face significant trade diversion at the commodity level.","[Plummer, Michael G.] Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Plummer, Michael G.] East West Ctr, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Johns Hopkins University,"Plummer, MG (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, Via Belmeloro 11, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",mplummer@johnshopkins.it,"Plummer, Michael/JKI-7809-2023",,,,,,2,2,2,0,61,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Rationally, these insiders will not adhere to the lock-up agreement unless the benefits of doing so can more than offset the costs. Therefore, in an environment characterized by high information asymmetry, a lock-up agreement can serve as an effective mechanism to signal the risk or quality of firms. This article examines whether the lock-up ratio and lock-up period affect the initial returns, using a sample of 384 IPOs listed on Bursa Malaysia between 2000 and 2012. The results of the cross-sectional multiple regression show that the lock-up period is significantly positive in explaining IPO initial returns, but the lock-up ratio is not. The findings provide new insights for testing the signaling content of lock-up provisions, particularly in a setting characterized by high information asymmetry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This is analysed in the framework of a numerical power market model, calibrated to Danish data, where the start-up costs and other constraints in fossil-fuelled power plants are taken into account. The main conclusion is that flexibility is crucial for the costs of integrating wind power in an existing system. If thermal power plants are inflexible, subsidies for wind power should strive to increase the flexibility of the market by passing market signals to wind power. A subsidy that conceals market signals from wind power producers (a production subsidy) or disconnects wind power incentives from the market signals altogether (a fixed price) increases costs considerably. An inflexible power system should aim to introduce optimal subsidies (an investment subsidy) instead of production subsidies or a fixed price. The design of the subsidy scheme should take into account both the characteristics of the existing system and the characteristics of renewables.","[Rosnes, Orvika] Stat Norway, N-0033 Oslo, Norway; [Rosnes, Orvika] Oslo Ctr Res Environm Friendly Energy CREE, Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Rosnes, O (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131 Dep, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",orvika.rosnes@ssb.no,,"Rosnes, Orvika/0000-0002-9067-3473",,,,,29,9,9,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In this framework, a one-time, permanent, unanticipated depreciation in the RER leads to a higher steady-state level of capital stock and investment. This consequently increases the optimal investment rate associated with an arbitrary level of capital stock as the saddle path shifts upwards. In the benchmark calibration, the investment-enhancing effect of RER depreciation is sizeable. One per cent depreciation in the RER leads to an increase of 0.4444 per cent in the rate of capital accumulation.","[van Pham, Dai; Delpachitra, Sarath] Flinders Univ S Australia, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Delpachitra, S (通讯作者)，Flinders Business Sch, Sturt Rd, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia.",sarath.delpachitra@flinders.edu.au,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

We find that two independent long-run relationships emerge from the data. Since the null of homogeneity across units with regard to long-run elasticities is strongly rejected, we proceed by clustering countries according to the signs of the estimated coefficients. The approach allows us to form three groups: in the first there is evidence of an optimistic scenario, where both CO2 emissions and electric power consumption are bound to decrease in the long-run. An optimistic scenario for emissions reduction is also provided in the second cluster where, however, the long-run relationship between income and electric power consumption shows an U-shaped pattern, instead. Finally, the third cluster can be associated with a much worrying scenario where per capita CO2 is expected to grow with income. A joint consideration of long-run parameters and causality links allows us to propose cluster-tailored policy suggestions. (C) 2014 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Further, the calibrated model can give substantially different predictions regarding the relative price response to external rebalancing, when compared to a preferred alternative model with inputs that is consistent with gross-flow trade data.

Even though the rate of technical change was higher for modern energy, innovation in the use of traditional energy carriers contributed more to growth between 1850 and 1890, since the cost share of traditional energy was so much larger than that of modem energy in that period.

Our results show that if workers are heterogeneous, opening up a firm's career system may lead to a homogenization of the pool of contestants and thus encourage the firm's high-ability workers to exert more effort. If this positive effect outweighs the discouragement of low-ability workers, the firm will benefit from external recruiting. If, however, the discouragement effect dominates the homogenization effect, the firm should disregard external recruiting. In addition, product market competition may mean that opening up the career system becomes less attractive for a firm since it increases the incentives of its competitors' workers and hence strengthens the competitors.

To that aim, we explore an EU-wide data-set providing information for 5194 SMEs in 27 European countries. We distinguish between recycling and purchasing and/or development of cleaner technologies and investigate whether the set of external and internal factors to the firm driving the adoption of least-integrated environmental innovation (recycling) differ from those influencing cleaner technologies (either purchased or in-house). The main findings stemming from a multivariate probit model suggest some significant differences among firms performing recycling practices and those purchasing and developing cleaner technologies. In particular, we find that current energy prices only increase the probability to adopt recycling practices while they have no significant effect on the most-integrated environmental innovation (developing cleaner technologies). Our results also indicate that market factors (proxied as expected increases in the demand for green products) are more relevant drivers of the least-advanced eco-innovation than of developing cleaner technologies. Interestingly, we find that higher technological and managerial capabilities are more effective in driving the adoption of cleaner technologies than in enhancing recycling solutions. A positive impact of cooperation and collaboration with universities and private agencies is found only on developing cleaner technologies in-house. This finding confirms the role of knowledge networks for the most-advanced innovative practice. Finally, neither existing nor future environmental regulations have significant impact on environmentally-friendly innovative practices while subsidies only increase the probability of purchasing cleaner technologies.

In order to improve the prediction performance, a novel compressed sensing based learning paradigm is proposed through integrating compressed sensing based denoising (CSD) and certain artificial intelligence (AI), i.e., CSD-AI. In the proposed learning paradigm, CSD is first performed as a preprocessor for the original data of international crude oil price to eliminate the noise, and then a certain powerful AI tool is employed to conduct prediction for the cleaned data. In particular, the process of CSD aims to reduce the level of noise which pollutes the data, and to further enhance the prediction performance of the AI model For verification purpose, international crude oil price series of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) are taken as sample data. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed CSD-AI learning paradigm significantly outperforms all other benchmark models including single models without CSD process and hybrid models with other denoising techniques, in terms of level and directional accuracies. Furthermore, in the case of different data samples with different time ranges, the proposed model performs the best, indicating that the proposed CSD-AI learning paradigm is an effective and robust approach in crude oil price prediction.

Regression models are constructed using quarterly time series of 2000-2011 years while the methodology is backed with the findings of Lithuanian and foreign scientists from an extensive overview of specific literature. Regression equations, obtained in the paper, allows us to identify the key macroeconomic and global indicators that statistically significantly affect the Baltic securities market and to quantify their impact on the stock price indices of individual sectors in the Baltic countries. Econometric analysis of OMX Baltic security market proves the hypothesis that the set of macroeconomic regressors may vary considerably depending on the individual sector's price indices, especially in the case of small open economy with immature stock markets. The paper provides investors who are shaping their portfolios taking into account the macroeconomic forecasts with additional opportunities on the basis of sectoral stock price indices regression equations.","[Rudzkis, Rimantas] Vilnius State Univ, Inst Informat & Math, LT-08663 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Valkaviciene, Roma] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Math Stat, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Valkaviciene, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Math Stat, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",roma.uzdanaviciute@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,7,8,1,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We use data collected after the 2011 Israeli social justice protests against the continuing rise in the cost of living, the social order and power-structure in Israel. Our main hypotheses are based on the expressive behavior model, and suggest that active participation in protests produces expressive utility that changes the cost-benefit calculation in the decision to be active in social protests. The results show that individuals who decided to participate actively in the non-violent protest had low general confidence in the future of the Israeli society. The findings also suggest that active participants are less present-oriented, less risk averse, and have a higher interest in politics, compared to those who did not participate actively. In addition, the more active participants tend to live in rented homes, meaning that their self-interest in housing-related issues is high. Finally, we find that women and those who support a non-aggressive military policy were more likely to participate in protests. These results shed light on behavioral and sociological factors affecting the decision to protest, specifically in Israeli society. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This paper proposes an alternative modeling strategy which has low data requirements and involves the use of detailed, but transparent, assumptions about the extent of joint consumption of particular commodities. These assumptions are embedded in an economic model of household consumption and combined with household expenditure data to calculate consumer equivalence scales.

The risky action leads either to the Pareto-superior equilibrium (high payoff) or to out of equilibrium (low payoff) depending on the opponent's action. Both players may want to obtain high payoff but uncertainty about the opponent's action may prevent them to take such strategic risk, This paper investigates how information about the risk attitude of an opponent affects a player's action choice in the stag-hunt game. I find that although a subject's propensity to choose the risky action depends on her opponent's risk attitude, it does not depend on her own risk attitude. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

If there is global information processing through public randomization and global communication, it is not difficult to construct a sequential equilibrium which supports cooperation and satisfies a property, called stability, which requires that cooperation resumes after any history. In this paper, we allow agents to locally communicate with their neighbors and show that it is possible to construct such an equilibrium without global information processing.

Utilizing panel data for sixteen transition countries we show that the relationship between the size of the IS and the level of income inequality is ambiguous.

To do so, I construct a theoretical model of lawmaking in democratic countries with three agents: the population, the legislator and the judge. The normative analysis focuses on systems that favor legal stability. The article concludes that the judge's interpretation power should be higher in the case of sensitive legal fields.

If one of the IP owners is also the incumbent of a product that employs the current competing standard - referred to as overlapping ownership - then the relationship among the IP owners will be both vertical through their IP, and horizontal through their competing interests in the final products. Consumers are better off when IP owners cooperate, even when these owners are effectively competitors, because of lower prices and greater product variety. Consumers prefer, however, that the agreements not admit firms with overlapping ownership. These results inform antitrust policy on cooperative agreements among competitors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It finds striking inter-country differences in bequest plans, with the bequest plans of Americans and Indians appearing to be much more consistent with altruistic preferences than those of the Japanese and Chinese and the bequest plans of the Japanese and Chinese appearing to be much more consistent with selfish preferences than those of Americans and Indians.

The augmented Solow model with both gross domestic product (GDP) per worker and per capita income is estimated using the dynamic system generalized methods of moments (GMM) technique with the panel data. This is the first study on the sources of conditional -convergence for African countries. According to the results of the augmented Solow model, income convergence rates are lower than those of GDP per worker. Moreover, total factor productivity convergence, human capital convergence and capital labour convergence are contributing towards the convergence of GDP per worker in Africa. This means that growth in the poorest African countries is being augmented by catch-up factor, which is good news for them. However, convergence in terms of GDP per worker is not being fully translated into income per capita convergence. The demographic structure in the African continent with its record of persistent population growth has played an important role in lowering the income convergence of its countries.","Fatima Jinnah Women Univ, Dept Econ, Rawalpindi, Pakistan",,"Khan, FA (通讯作者)，Fatima Jinnah Women Univ, Dept Econ, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.",faiza.fjwu@gmail.com,,,,,,,62,1,2,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

We describe an algorithm for finding all equilibrium payoffs in games for which there exists an open set of belief-free equilibria of Horner and Lovo (2009). This includes generic games with one-sided incomplete information and a large and important class of games with multisided incomplete information. When players become sufficiently patient, all Bayesian Nash equilibrium payoffs can be approximated by payoffs in sequential equilibria in which information is revealed finitely many times. The set of equilibrium payoffs is typically larger than the set of equilibrium payoffs in repeated games without discounting and is larger than the set of payoffs obtained in belief-free equilibria.

J,"Sákovics, J",,,,"Sakovics, Jozsef",,,Price formation in a matching market with targeted offers,GAMES AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR,,,English,Article,,,,,,Diamond paradox; Efficient matching; Directed search,WAGE DIFFERENTIALS; COMPETITION; MODEL,"We model a market where the surpluses from seller buyer matches are heterogeneous but common knowledge. Price setting is synchronous with search: buyers simultaneously make one personalized offer each to the seller of their choice. With impatient players efficient coordination is not possible, and both temporary and permanent mismatches occur. Nonetheless, for patient players efficient matching (with monopsony wages) is an equilibrium. The setting is inspired by a labor market for highly skilled workers, such as the academic job market, but it can be easily adapted to, for example, the housing market or Internet advertising auctions.

While theoretically elegant, the model has never been formulated empirically because of the complexity of the model's price-deflated terms. This paper derives the linear parameterization of the input allocation model that can be used for empirical estimation.

J,"Shapiro, AF",,,,"Shapiro, Alan Finkelstein",,,Self-employment and business cycle persistence: Does the composition of employment matter for economic recoveries?,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Business cycles; Search and matching frictions,CREDIT,"Self-employment comprises an important share of employment in many countries, and tends to expand during downturns through higher inflows from unemployment. Furthermore, countries with higher self-employment shares exhibit lower cyclical output persistence. I build a business cycle model with frictional labor markets where individuals can be self-employed or salaried employed. I show that economies with larger self-employment shares exhibit faster economic recoveries. Differences in the ease of entry into self-employment as the economy recovers explain the contrasting cyclical dynamics. The model successfully captures the cyclical patterns of self-employment and the relationship between self-employment and output persistence in the data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
