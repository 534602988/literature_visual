The material consists of survey data from 919 residents living along four major arterial streets in Malmo, Sweden, where the respondents were instructed to make estimates with their specific street in mind. The results show that respondents who stated that they often walk along their street seemed to make higher estimates of the occurrence of the tested factors. When involving people in the planning process, this implies that it might be important to control for walking frequency when asking people about phenomena in their traffic environment. The results also indicate that the respondents were quite able to relate their estimates to the specific street. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using different methods to control for multilateral resistance, we applied a gravity equation to estimate sectoral exports to 188 countries over the period 19952004. Provincial trade costs were constructed as the sum of five province-specific elasticities, including distance, adjacency, and common money. We found that Italian provinces are heterogeneous with respect to trade costs. These costs are influenced by lagged provincial per capita income and industrial structure. In turn, trade costs influence future provincial per capita income. This bidirectional relationship between trade costs and income is broadly consistent with the two-way causation process emphasized by the New Geographical Economics.","[Fratianni, Michele] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Fratianni, Michele; Marchionne, Francesco] Univ Politecn Marche, I-60121 Acona, Italy; [Fratianni, Michele; Marchionne, Francesco] Money & Finance Res Grp MoFiR, I-60121 Acona, Italy",Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington,"Fratianni, M (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",fratiann@indiana.edu; f.marchionne@univpm.it,,,,,,,79,10,12,3,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

A Possible Experimental Answer,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; NETWORKS; NORMS,"Trust is important in economics: several transactions are based on it; unfortunately it is difficult to measure. The recent economic literature on social capital shows a positive association between this concept and trust. As social capital is easier to measure than trust, this paper analyzes the possibility of assessing trust using a measure of social capital. A basic trust game is played in three Western European countries with undergraduate students; a questionnaire measures their level of social capital as time spent within social networks. This measure is stronger and more precise than the ones generally used. The use of an experiment instead of a questionnaire allows for constructing a measure of trust that is continuous in principle. Moreover, to play an experiment allows for observing the behavior of the participants better than by the means of a survey. The results are supportive of the fact that trust can be assessed through social capital, although the presence of a strong geographical effect has to be accounted for.","Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Publ Policy & Collect Choice, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Migheli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Publ Policy & Collect Choice, Via Cavour 84, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy.",matteo.migheli@sp.unipmn.it,,,,,,,43,17,19,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We take a differential-game approach, and derive the open-loop solution (providers choose the optimal quality investment plan based on demand at the initial period) and the feedback closed-loop solution (providers observe demand in each period and choose quality in response to current demand). If variable costs are strictly convex, and the degree of cost complementarity between quality and output is not too strong, the steady-state quality is higher under the open-loop solution than under the feedback solution. In both solutions, quality and demand move in opposite directions over time on the equilibrium path to the steady-state. While lower transportation costs or less sluggish beliefs lead to higher quality in both solutions, the quality response is weaker when players use feedback strategies.","[Brekke, Kurt R.] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ & Hlth Econ Bergen, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Cellini, Roberto] Univ Catania, Dept Econ, I-95129 Catania, Italy; [Siciliani, Luigi] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Siciliani, Luigi] CEPR, London EC1V 7DB, England; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Minho, NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Catania; University of York - UK; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Brekke, KR (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ & Hlth Econ Bergen, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",kurt.brekke@nhh.no; cellini@unict.it; ls24@york.ac.uk; o.r.straume@eeg.uminho.pt,"Straume, Odd Rune/B-6090-2009; siciliani, luigi/AAE-8686-2020","Straume, Odd Rune/0000-0002-6889-2717; Cellini, Roberto/0000-0003-1991-9685",,,,,58,25,26,2,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We provide a unified state-space modeling framework that encompasses different existing discrete-time yield curve models. Within such a framework we analyze the impact of two modeling choices, namely the imposition of no-arbitrage restrictions and the size of the information set used to extract factors, on forecasting performance. Using US yield curve data, we find that both no-arbitrage and large information sets help in forecasting but no model uniformly dominates the other. No-arbitrage models are more useful at shorter horizons for shorter maturities. Large information sets are more useful at longer horizons and longer maturities. We also find evidence for a significant feedback from yield curve models to macroeconomic variables that could be exploited for macroeconomic forecasting.

Identification of basketball referee bias is typically difficult as changes in observed statistics may be caused by either changes in referee bias or player behavior. We identify bias by exploiting the fact that referees have varying degrees of discretion over different types of a particular statistic-turnovers. This allows us to conduct a treatment and control-style analysis, using the less discretionary turnovers as the player behavior control. The results provide evidence that referees favor home teams, teams losing during games, and teams losing in playoff series.

However, we find that merchants are unlikely to be able to take full advantage of the Settlements new freedoms because they currently lack comprehensible and complete information on the full and exact merchant discount fees for their customers credit cards.

The conflict between the supporters of franchise regulation and commission regulation has given way to much more balanced in-depth analyses. Regulation is defined on the basis of its structure but also its scope and regulation incentives. A regulation mode must above all be evaluated with regard to the institutional environment. We propose a neo-institutionally-inspired analysis framework and show how the dynamic relationship between regulation and the institutional environment can lead to reforms and ultimately to more efficient regulation. The findings of a French water utility sector analysis underline how a series of national normative reforms and local exploratory reforms can give rise to innovations in the regulation mode. This new hybrid regulation, between commission regulation and franchise bidding, could be more effective than previous regulation mode, i.e. more stable and in line with stakeholders' expectations.","[Guerin-Schneider, Laetitia] UMR G EAU, Cemagref, Montpellier, France; [Nakhla, Michel] Mines Paris Tech, CGS, Paris, France",INRAE; AgroParisTech; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Guérin-Schneider, L (通讯作者)，UMR G EAU, Cemagref, Montpellier, France.",laetitia.guerin-schneider@cemagref.fr,,"Guerin-Schneider, Laetitia/0000-0002-0226-3803",,,,,53,3,3,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The paper analyses environmental policy approaches with emphasis on ecological tax reform and the need for implementation of green accounting. Also relations between the sustainable development and climate change are investigated. The last chapter of the paper is dedicated to the discussion upon the optimization model of climate change mitigation measures' selection. The paper concludes that the essence of ecological tax reform lies in the increase of Eco-tax, at the same time reducing labor taxation, and at the same time not increasing the overall tax burden. Selection of climate change mitigation measures or their combinations can be done using models of energetic optimization.","[Ciegis, Remigijus; Mikalauskiene, Asta; Pusinaite, Rasa] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Ciegis, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",remigijus.ciegis@aula.vukhf.lt; astam@mail.lei.lt; rasa.pusinaite@khf.vu.lt,,,,,,,47,2,2,1,17,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Though there have been methodological developments in a cross-sectional environment, they have been scarce in a time series setting. Arroyo, Gonzalez-Rivera, and Mate (2011) analyze various forecasting methods for HTS and ITS, adapting smoothing filters and nonparametric algorithms such as the k-NN. Though these methods are very flexible, they may not be the true underlying data generating process (DGP). We present the first step in the search for a DGP by focusing on the autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of HTS and ITS. We analyze the ACF of the daily histogram of 5-minute intradaily returns to the S&P500 index in 2007 and 2008. There are clusters of high/low activity that generate a strong, positive, and persistent autocorrelation, pointing towards some autoregressive process for HTS. Though smoothing and k-NN may not be the true DGPs, we find that they are very good approximations because they are able to capture almost all of the original autocorrelation. However, there seems to be some structure left in the data that will require new modelling techniques. As a byproduct, we also analyze the [90,100%] quantile interval. By using all of the information contained in the histogram, we find that there are advantages in the estimation and prediction of a specific interval. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.

Only Damodaran offers the solution based on the valuation of the company in the financial distress as the option on the base of the Black-Scholes model, but this is not possible use in the reality of the valuation in the Czech Republic. The solution of this problem requires the projection of the specifics of the financial distress of the firm into the common methods of valuation of the company without financial distress. Identification of single valuation methods depends, besides others, on the fact if the insolvency process has been initiated or not and if it is solved by bankruptcy or by reorganization. The property valuation is used in case of the bankruptcy with the negative result value. The income approach is possible to use only in case if the successful reorganization and restructuring of company is supposed, and it is necessary to distinguish whether the manufacturing is going to be restructured or not. If so, it is necessary to use three phase income method of valuation where the free cash flow must be recognized not only for cost of restructuring, but also for the extraordinary profit from selling or buying the new or old manufacturing equipment. Just the identification of the restructuring cost plays also a very important role in the process of the valuation. The interest rate for discounting of the free cash flow would also be identified separately for every phase and adjusted by risk surcharge. In case of net valuation of company it is necessary to subtract from the gross value not the value of liabilities on the date of valuation, but the target value of liabilities.","[Hrdy, Milan] SVSE Znojmo, Znojmo, Czech Republic; [Simek, Bohuslav] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Hrdy, M (通讯作者)，SVSE Znojmo, Znojmo, Czech Republic.",hrdy@svse.cz; simekb@kpm.zcu.cz,,,,,,,10,3,4,0,33,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The fundamental difference with the standard scheduling model based on expected utility is that the probabilities of arrivals are treated in a non-linear way. This paper shows how scheduling decisions are affected by the weighted probabilities of the traveller. We derive the costs of non-optimal chosen departure times because of probability weighting and show that if the parameterised probability weighting function is similar to what has been found for gambling, the costs of probability weighting for morning peak car travellers are around 3 per cent. For the full range of parameters tested, we find costs in the range of 0-24 per cent of total travel costs.","[Koster, Paul] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Koster, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.r.koster@vu.nl,"Koster, Paul/ISV-5319-2023; Verhoef, Erik/C-4026-2017","Koster, Paul/0000-0002-7775-5044; Verhoef, Erik/0000-0002-0850-5826",,,,,32,19,21,0,9,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Among them the most important is a transition of requirements from narrow expertise to the skillset that allows employees to be flexible and able to adapt to the new work environment and job requirements. Technological progress also requires mobility, foreign language skills and ability to continuously learn and acquire new skills. The EU countries have experienced new conditions as a result of the economic crisis of 2007-2008. The new economic environment required employers at all levels to reconsider theirs attitudes towards personnel. Employers cannot afford to maintain an excelerated numbers of staff and are compelled to reduce numbers of employees. By the end of 2011, the rate of unemployment has reached 13% in Latvia and has essentially raised competition in the labour market. As a result of the recent economic crisis, many employees have lost their jobs. At the same time, those who managed to stay employed, suffered through cancelled bonuses, salary reductions, prolonged working hours and an increase in the workload. The new economic situation requires employees to be able to acquire new skills quickly, adapt to the changing situations and constantly confirm their competitiveness. This requires strong motivation from each employee, however maintaining high morale at workplace becomes difficult due to the lower compensation levels. According to the author, it is crucial to consider opportunities of using all skillset and potential of the employees. Those who have kept workplaces after major layoffs are compelled to work under constant pressure. These employees became responsible for the jobs previously performed by their former colleagues. As a result, these employees require effective methods that would allow them working faster and more effectively. Current article is devoted to the description of the personnel training methods that provide the maximal results within minimal timeframes. Many articles are dedicated to the subject of what employees need to learn, however effective learning techniques have not been widely spread until now. The author suggests conducting speed reading and speed memorising trainings before any professional personnel trainings. This approach allows achieving higher efficiencies from the professional trainings and work results within short time periods. For example, the speed reading techniques training conducted for three hours during a six day course allows increasing the speed and efficiency of information processing in 2-3 times. During the period of 1999-2011 the author conducted a number of corporate trainings in the largest organisations of Latvia and abroad. All results of these trainings were consolidated into reports and questionnaires completed by all trainees, both before and after the testing. It has been confirmed that during these trainings each trainee increased the speed and accuracy of information processing in 2-3 times without additional pressure. It looks as if a person starts thinking 2-3 times faster. Imagine, if you come to the office to realise you can think three times faster than your colleagues! You start noticing that people talk slowly. Did you become smarter? No, you have just acquired new skills and abilities. It should be noted that the efficiency and effectiveness of the training increases significantly when a team or a department are trained together. The importance of this work increases as a result of continuous outflow of human capital from Latvia to the foreign countries. From the state economic efficiency point, it would be more beneficial to export highly skilled human capital, instead of cheap labour. At the moment, Latvia possesses great opportunities for establishing a system of personnel speed re-training techniques and its successful adaptation to the new economic conditions.","[Lando, Irina] Latvian State Univ, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,info@lando.lv,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,10,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,340,353,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100032,0

Roughly 50% of consumers' product choice is driven by price, 20% by product customization, 20% by delivery time, and 10% by the time needed to customize the product. Thus, while there is a customer segment driven by price, there also is a segment, consisting mainly of females, that values product customization.

The more competitive the product market is, the more likely firms competing in the market will acquire insurance or purchase full coverage. This holds true no matter whether firms exhibit risk aversion or not in their preferences. Investment in risk management prior to competition is used as a strategic commitment device in the product market competition. Finns optimize their risk management investment by balancing the strategic commitment benefit and the cost of insurance. Therefore, the outside the box factors such as the industry characteristics, the market environment and the competitive pressure are important ones shaping firms' risk management strategies. This provides clear empirical implications for corporate investment in risk management and its relation to the product market environment.By focusing on primary insurers' reinsurance purchases, we provide strong empirical support forthe theoretical predictions.","[Liu Zhiyong] Indiana State Univ, Scott Coll Business, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Jung, Hae Won] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",Indiana State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Liu, ZY (通讯作者)，Indiana State Univ, Scott Coll Business, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",,,,,,,,39,0,0,1,3,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89414-036-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,152,176,,,,,,25,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316628500012,0

We find that the likelihood of a primary insurer's downgrade increases with its reinsurance default risk exposure from downgraded reinsurers. Counterparty primary insurers' stocks also react negatively to their reinsurers' downgrades. The negative effects also spill over to insurers that are not directly exposed to the credit risk of downgraded reinsurers. Despite the close interconnectedness, worst-case scenario analyses show that the likelihood of systemic risk caused by reinsurance transactions is relatively small for the US property-casualty insurance industry.","[Park, Sojung Carol; Xie, Xiaoying] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,,sopark@fullerton.edu; xxie@fullerton.edu,"Park, Sojung/AAQ-2573-2020",,,,,,34,0,0,0,2,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89414-036-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,307,346,,,,,,40,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316628500026,0

The first part of the analysis is based on the standard HBS model, which mathematically formalizes the dependence of the real exchange rate on the difference in the relative labor productivity in the open sector between Serbia and the EMU. The second part of the research relies on a modified version of the HBS model which differs from the standard HBS model since the effect of the distribution sector is separately analyzed. The empirical testing of both models was performed by applying the Johansen and the Engle-Granger tests. The results obtained by analyzing the standard HBS model indicates that there is no reliable evidence based on which it can be concluded that either the difference in the relative labor productivity in the open sector between Serbia and the EMU translates onto the difference in the relative prices of non-tradable goods or that the difference in prices affects the real exchange rate of the dinar against the euro. Furthermore, the analysis of the modified HBS model does not affect the previous results. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the real euro/dinar exchange rate is not determined solely by sectoral differences in labor productivity, and that in future perspective Serbia will not have to choose between the dynamic economic growth and the membership in the EMU.","Inst Social Sci, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",,"Petrovic, P (通讯作者)，Inst Social Sci, Kraljice Natalije 45,POB 605, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",ppetrovic@idn.org.rs,,"Petrovic, Predrag/0000-0001-8418-5580",,,,,36,3,3,0,6,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The city's IT sector is closely integrated with a global system of production and caters largely to a global clientele. Apart from the impact of these developments on urban form, there are indications that they are causing uneven growth patterns and socio-economic polarization, which has resulted in different travel patterns in the work force. This paper compares the commuting patterns of employees in two types of firms, an IT multinational corporation and a traditional public-sector-unit (PSU), using data from a survey. Regression models show that there is a significant increase in travel cost as income rises for a sample of employees of the IT sector, even though travel distance is not influenced by income. The reverse holds true for a sample of employees of the PSU rising income significantly increases distance though income does not affect travel cost. Behavioral choice models also show that with increasing income IT employees are more likely to choose two-wheelers and cars for commuting while PSU employees are more likely to choose public buses or walk to work. The paper suggests that Bangalore's services-oriented IT economy is magnifying differences in work commuting patterns relative to those in the traditional manufacturing economy. The IT economy is also transforming travel behavior in terms of work travel mode choices among socio-economic groups. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a sample of 5,944 observations for the year 2007 and test several hypotheses using MANOVA analysis. The results show that companies tend to have different financing structures depending on their age and size. Hypotheses about trade credit, short term debt and risk are confirmed with respect to age, as the younger companies tend to use proportionally more trade credit and short term debt, and are riskier. Size is also associated in the expected way with trade credit, relative trade credit and relative short-term financial debt. On the other hand hypotheses about equity and the financing deficit are not confirmed. The effect of a pecking order behaviour over a long period of time may provide an explanation of why these two hypotheses are not confirmed.","[Sanchez-Vidal, Javier; Francisco Martin-Ugedo, Juan] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Fac Ciencias Empresa, Cartagena 30201, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Sánchez-Vidal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cartagena, Fac Ciencias Empresa, Calle Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Spain.",javier.sanchez@upct.es; juanfran@um.es,"Sanchez-Vidal, F.

Flexibility of labour market helped to reverse negative trends and already in 2010 overall situation started to improve, but many problems remain. Unemployment level is high, economic activity is decreased; a lot of workers emigrate because of weak labour demand and low wages. Declining labour income increases poverty risks especially for households with children. There are risks of high structural unemployment and inactivity trap of less skilled worker, as well as of further emigration and persistent employment in informal economy. Labour income taxation could influence employment and social issues substantially. During the budget consolidation process in Latvia tax wedge on labour income increased, and for low wage earners it is now by about 4 pp higher then EU average. Theoretical and empirical evidence confirms that taxation have strong impact especially on working decisions of low-income earners. This is one of risks to further improvement of employment. Tax wedge on labour income consists of social security contributions and personal income tax. PIT is seen generally as better candidate for change because SSC are linked to tax payer's future benefits. Taking into account Latvian flat income tax, main instrument to influence low-wage workers are tax reliefs - non-taxable minimum and allowance for dependants. Tax rate change would be more beneficial to better paid workers. Author proposes to increase PIT non-taxable minimum to the level that allows reaching EU average tax wedge. This would help to increase employment in low-skill segment, decrease inactivity and unemployment traps and improve social situation of affected households. However if target is to decrease attractiveness of emigration and informal employment, increase of non-taxable minimum up to the level of minimum wage should be considered. Both proposals are very costly to the budget, and need to be coordinated with other labour market institutions.","[Snucins, Ilmars] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,snucins@hotmail.com,,,,,,,14,1,1,1,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,690,704,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100063,0

For many families in Ireland the economic downturn put strong pressures on their household budgets. This study examines how the recession has changed class differences with regard to experiences of economic strain. It contrasts the middle class squeeze view that sees the middle or the middling classes as particularly hard hit by the economic downturn with the class theoretical point of view that the recession is expected to widen the gaps between classes with regard to their ability to maintain living standards and that working, not middle classes bear the largest strain on economic wellbeing. The study derives competing hypotheses from these views and tests them using data from the Irish leg of the European Social Survey. Key findings are that financial hardship increased most for the working classes and the class of own account workers and self-employed employees and that class differences with regard to unemployment and benefit dependency risks are the main explanatory mechanism.","Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Mühlau, P (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,38,8,8,0,18,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Its final report was published in December 2011. Subsequently, the House of Commons Transport Committee carried out an enquiry into the Commission's report, and reactions to it by the operating industry, user groups, and other bodies, which was published in September 2012. A number of major issues have been raised, including the extent to which price competition may be effective, the appropriate rate of return on capital that would be expected within the industry (and appropriate actions where this is excessive in practice), and industry structure. The importance of competition per se, as distinct from attributes of direct concern to users (such as reliability, frequency, and fares) has also been debated. This paper reviews the issues raised, and outcomes to date, in the light of further evidence on the industry's performance. It is demonstrated similar rates of return could be attained through very different operating strategies, which in turn have very different implications for changes in consumer surplus. The alternative uses made of such profits (for example through reinvestment) may also have markedly different impacts effects on users. Rather than focussing on the dangers of excessive rates of return on capital, the outcomes for service users should be the main issue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents our view of the role and position of CBA in a transport planning process, partly based on a survey of a number of countries where CBA plays a formalised role in decision making. The survey shows that methodologies, valuations and areas of application are broadly similar across countries. All countries place the CBA results in a comprehensive assessment framework that also includes various types of non-monetised benefits. An important advantage with using CBA is that it is a way to overcome cognitive, structural and process-related limitations and biases in decision making. Some of the main challenges to CBA and to quantitative assessment in general lie in the institutional and political context. There is often a risk that CBA enters the planning process too late to play any meaningful role. This risk seems to increase when planning processes are centred around a perceived problem. If the problem is perceived as important enough, even inefficient solutions may be viewed as better than nothing, despite that the definition of what constitutes a problem is often arbitrary.

The evidence comes from the market for Coca-Cola. Since implicit contracts are unobservable, we adopt a narrative approach to demonstrate that the Coca-Cola Company left a written evidence of the implicit contract with its customers-a very explicit form of an implicit contract. The implicit contract promised a 6.5oz Coca-Cola of a constant quality, the secret formula, at a constant price, 5A cent. We show that Coca-Cola attributes and market structure made it a suitable candidate for an implicit contract. Focusing on the observable implications of such an implicit contract, we offer evidence of the Company both acknowledging and acting on this implicit contract, which was valued by consumers. During a period of 74 years, we find evidence of only a single case of true quality change. We demonstrate that the company perceived itself as vulnerable to consumer backlash by reneging on the pledge, and conclude that the perceived costs of breaking the implicit contract were large.

Post-Polanyian reflections on capitalist crisis,ECONOMY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Karl Polanyi; double movement; capitalist crisis; domination; commodification,,"In his classic 1944 book, The great transformation, Karl Polanyi traced the roots of capitalist crisis to efforts to create 'self-regulating markets' in land, labour and money. The effect was to turn those three fundamental bases of social life into 'fictitious commodities'. The inevitable result, Polanyi claimed, was to despoil nature, rupture communities and destroy livelihoods. This diagnosis has strong echoes in the twenty-first century: witness the burgeoning markets in carbon emissions and biotechnology; in child-care, schooling and the care of the old; and in financial derivatives. In this situation, Polanyi's idea of fictitious commodification affords a promising basis for an integrated structural analysis that connects three dimensions of the present crisis: the ecological, the social and the financial.

We argue that even if judges have no ability to directly assess case-specific information, using standards creates a sorting effect that favors ex-post efficient decisions. When judges are not bound by rules, their decision is more likely to be sensitive to the quality of legal representation. In the absence of externalities, the party that desires the ex-post efficient decision has the most to gain, and, thus, a greater incentive to invest in high-quality representation. While the higher litigation costs under standards can easily outweigh the increased likelihood of an efficient decision, bargaining in the shadow of standards can preserve their sorting benefit while ameliorating the increase in legal costs.","[Friedman, Ezra] Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Wickelgren, Abraham L.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Northwestern University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Wickelgren, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",awickelgren@law.utexas.edu,,,,,,,20,7,8,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

Nevertheless, in this paper we aim to estimate cost functions for German airports and derive marginal costs for different types of aircraft using them. This allows us to make efficiency comparison for aeronautical activities. Moreover, using the results of Morrison (1982), we are also able to estimate the k coefficients of the Ramsey-pricing formula and then use it as a proxy for market power of these airports. As the result we obtain two rankings from the sample: the first is the cost efficiency ranking of airports, and the second ranking is with respect to market power. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This is partly due to the relative paucity of empirical data, as well as the considerable research effort involved in undertaking appropriate data collection for detailed longitudinal evaluations. Past studies suggest that economic impacts can vary significantly depending on the type of interventions, the locations and geographical areas served, preexisting market conditions and other policy and planning factors. However, another issue for evaluation is the extent to which the different studies that are available are comparable in terms of their methodologies, which makes the synthesis of research findings across different case studies extremely difficult. Whilst we are not able to overcome all of these methodological issues in the context of this paper, our main objective is to construct a typology of the 'success' factors for securing economic uplift from such projects. The main aim of our research and this paper is to make key gaps in the evidence-base concerning the economic and development impacts of major transport infrastructure impact investments more transparent. This will allow policymakers and other investors to be better informed about the likely success of these investments for the regeneration of local areas under different pre-existing conditions. It also helps to identify where there are current gaps in the knowledge base and where a lack of adequate data prevents the potential to identify economic uplifts and regeneration outcomes. An important finding of the research is that in the case of the Jubilee Line Extension and the Madrid Metrosur positive economic benefits occurred most frequently around the stations where there were already enforceable land use plans and complementary policies in place to increase urban densities and encourage mixed land uses, alongside restricted car and good walking access to stations.

The markets are developed by a GARCH model based on the S&P 500. These simulated markets are grouped by a main parameter: high volatility, bearish trend, bullish trend and low volatility. The inputs retained of the SVM are traditional technical trading rules used in quantitative analysis, such as relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) decision rules. The outputs of the SVM are the degree of set membership and market movement (bullish or bearish). The design of the SVM algorithm has been developed by Matlab and SVM-KM. The configuration for the SVM shows that the best results are achieved in simulated markets with high volatility; also results are good in trend simulated markets.

Two crucial questions for the success of bikesharing adoption are how many riders can bikesharing attract, and what influences its effectiveness. To shed light on answers to these questions, this paper models the impacts of urban features and system characteristics on bikesharing daily use and turnover rate, using data constructed on 69 bikesharing systems in China. Prior to modeling, we provide an overview of bikesharing adoption in China, describing why they have been adopted, how they have matured, and how they have expanded. Results from data regression and comparison indicate that bikesharing ridership and turnover rate tend to increase with urban population, government expenditure, the number of bikesharing members and docking stations, whilst the number of public bikes shows significant but adverse signs in impacting bikesharing ridership and turnover rate. Data comparison shows that, to pursue an ideal bikesharing turnover rate in most Chinese cities, the bike-member (supply-demand) ratio should be better controlled within 0.2. Moreover, this study suggests that personal credit cards (allowing bikesharing members to pay personal credit rather than money if they do not return public bikes within the free use hours) and universal cards (integrating bikesharing systems into other urban transit systems through the use of a rechargeable smart card that can cover a range of payments and trips) can significantly raise bikesharing daily use and turnover rate. We recommend that bikesharing operators and transit agencies take the supply-demand thresholds and the adoption of personal credit cards and universal cards into consideration in the future bikesharing operation and development policy.

More than ideas of political freedom were at stake. It is unlikely that the colonists would have demanded independence if powerful land speculators, merchants, and urban artisans had not joined forces to protect their economic interests. England had levied taxes on the colonies, and the colonists had successfully overturned those measures. Taxation was a superficial problem. But in 1773, when England imposed a commercial monopoly on tea sales, and in 1774, when it cut off settlement in western lands, the colonists saw no choice but to rebel and create their own nation. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, George Mason, Richard Henry Lee, and other wealthy Virginians who led the American Revolution stood to lose their huge investment in potential land sales if England maintained control of the colonies.","[Curtis, Thomas D.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Curtis, Thomas D.] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Curtis, Thomas D.] Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Curtis, Thomas D.] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Arizona; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,,,,,,,,,113,1,1,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In particular, we find systematic biases in the forecasts resulting in the overreaction of analysts to past information contained in the exchange rate dynamics: forecasters change their prediction more than it would be rational on the basis of past realized changes. In addition, forecasters are heterogeneous in their irrationality: low performers in previous periods show a more pronounced overreaction effect. This can be read as an indication of perpetration of past errors and continued inability to learn from the past. In the second part of the paper, we exploit the novel structure of our dataset, which consists of survey data extracted from the Bloomberg platform and readily available to anyone. This feature allows us to consider their own and others' past forecasts as part of the information set that analysts use in making their predictions. By using past forecasts as proxies for relevant macroeconomic variables, we find evidence that analysts fail to correctly process not only the information contained in the spot rate past dynamics but also the information in this broader set. We see this as confirmation of the existence of inefficiency and heterogeneity between low and high performers also when full information is available.

Our model is based on the observation that even if users prefer application variety, applications often also exhibit direct network effects. When there are direct network effects, users prefer to consume the same applications to benefit from consumption complementarities. We show that the combination of preference for variety and consumption complementarities gives rise to (i) a commons problem (to better satisfy their individual preference for variety, users have an incentive to consume more applications than the number that maximizes joint utility); (ii) an equilibrium selection problem (consumption complementarities often lead to multiple equilibria, which result in different utility levels for the users); and (iii) a coordination problem (lacking perfect foresight, it is unlikely that users will end up buying the same set of applications). The analysis shows that the platform can resolve these problems and create value by limiting the number of applications available. By limiting choice, the platform may create new equilibria (including the allocation that maximizes users' utility); eliminate equilibria that give lower utility to the users; and reduce the severity of the coordination problem faced by users.","[Casadesus-Masanell, Ramon; Halaburda, Hanna] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Strategy Unit, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Casadesus-Masanell, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Strategy Unit, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",casadesus@gmail.com; hhalaburda@gmail.com,"Halaburda, Hanna/AAG-8175-2019",,,,,,26,31,38,1,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

More researchers have conducted ongoing technology convergence analysis to create successful breakthrough technology and solve technical problems. Many studies have uncovered technology convergence by developing convergence indices that measure diversity and the bonding strength of technology using Co-International Patent Classification (Co-IPC) classification and citation patent classification. However, most studies have focused on diversity and the closeness of technologies. This paper provides a microscopic analysis of market influence and bonding between individual technologies. We also uncover the development paths of technology convergence and the individual technology level. A novel patent analysis method is presented to trace the technological and market aspects of the evolution of technology convergence. A convergence index measures the size of technology convergence using Co-IPC, while the market index (MI) measures the global market entrance using the patent family data. The development paths of technology convergence for nano biosensors are analysed along with the individual technology level. Empirical results show a different technological and market development for 21 industrial technology fields of technology convergence for nano biosensors. Development of technology convergence is more sensitive to market factors than to technological ones. The development paths of sub industrial and technological fields are analysed. Technology convergence in machinery or electronics technologies shows a growing trend in MIs over time. Technology convergence in the measurement-machinery sector is expected to have a high future development potential.","[You, Young-Bok; Jeong, Eui-Seob] Korea Inst Sci & Technol Informat, Informat Anal Ctr, Taejon 305806, South Korea; [You, Young-Bok; Kim, Byung-Keun] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Dept Technol & Innovat Management, Grad Sch, Cheonan 330240, Chungnam, South Korea",Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI); Korea University of Technology & Education,"Kim, BK (通讯作者)，Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Dept Technol & Innovat Management, Grad Sch, 415 Budaedong, Cheonan 330240, Chungnam, South Korea.",b.kim@koreatech.ac.kr,,"Kim, Byung-Keun/0000-0002-6238-0569",,,,,25,10,11,4,104,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The EU ETS is a market-based measure, which the European Union has introduced for aiming at reducing emissions and meeting the targets specified under the Kyoto Protocol. One of the largest issues is equity. The first multinational emission trading scheme resulted in many regulatory issues and objections by a number of countries and airlines concerning its legality under the Chicago Convention. In addition, under the Kyoto Protocol, ratified countries have different responsibilities and roles based on whether they are Annex I or non-Annex I countries. Hence, this paper attempted to investigate the equity issues by measuring the impact of the EU ETS on an African airline compared to airlines in an Annex I country. The results of case study indicate that there are some differences in terms of equity between Annex I and non-Annex I carriers and their passengers. The instrument is proven to be cost-effective; however, the economic rationality arguments seem to be weak with respect to the volatility in individual behaviour and the vulnerability of non-Annex I carriers which is caused by competition with Annex-I carriers. A transparent distribution of revenue from the EU ETS could be one way of moderating the equity gap between carriers and passengers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Concern about this problem has caused the EU to promote a decoupling strategy aimed at boosting sustainable development in European countries by improving the efficiency of transport systems without curbing economic growth. Over the last few years empirical evidence in some countries such as the United Kingdom has shown an increase in GDP while the volume of road freight traffic has remained stable or even decreased. This paper compares recent decoupling trends by analyzing the evolution of road tonne-kms/GDP relationship in the United Kingdom and Spain from 1999 to 2007. This comparison seeks to identify the main differences and key drivers of decoupling in both countries. We first provide an overview of the divergences between both economic structures and levels of road transport intensity. Then we conduct a decomposition analysis in order to identify the variables that explain the evolution of truck traffic per unit of GDP in each country. The results show that the increasing share of services in GDP has substantially contributed to decreasing road transport demand in both cases. Changes in road transport intensity due to improvements in logistic and supply chain management have been more successful in the UK than in Spain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The advertising produced a statistically and economically significant effect on in-store sales. The experiment permits a demographic breakdown. Surprisingly, the effects are large for the elderly.

Unlike other platforms, such as operating systems, credit cards, or even nightclubs, where a single transaction is performed via the platform, two different transactions take place on Google. Users perform searches in exchange for personal data, while advertisers seek users attentionuto be matched with the right user. Whereas operating systems, credit cards, and nightclubs would cease to exist if either of the two sides were missing, search engines (rather like TV or newspapers) can exist under different market configurations. Indeed, in search engines, network externalities run only from the number of users to advertisers, not the other way around. Building upon this analysis, a non-bilateral construction of the relevant market where Google operates is proposed. Google operates as a retailer of users personal information. In the upstream market, it buys users personal information from large retailers and final consumers in exchange for search services, or upon monetary payment. It then uses the personal information collected to sell targeted advertising to advertisers in the downstream market. Based on this market construction, the allegations against Google are analyzed as alleged violations of competition law along this vertical chain.","Ctr European Policy Studies Brussels, Regulatory Policy Unit, Brussels, Belgium",,"Luchetta, G (通讯作者)，Ctr European Policy Studies Brussels, Regulatory Policy Unit, Brussels, Belgium.",giacomo.luchetta@ceps.eu,,,,,,,65,15,15,1,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Several indicators grounded on the theory of graphs and network science are suggested and calculated for evaluating prospective developments of the fixed-route transport system in the Athens metropolitan area, which includes the metro, tram and suburban railway. The comparative static analyses of past and scheduled line extensions and planned line constructions generally show the tendency of the system towards small-world networking with scale-free characteristics, which implies increasing scale economies and reliance on a few large transfer stations. The results suggest that policy-makers can choose the option of constructing a semi-circumferential line in the middle (compared to the end) of the system development process, in order to trade investment cost for increased levels of service and robustness.

To date however, no explicit method has been adopted. Therefore, this study proposes a decision support methodology to enable the prioritization of installation of new environmental sensor stations and then demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology by applying it to road sections in South Korea which are especially vulnerable to snow.

We assume vertical differentiation of GM and non-GM goods on the consumer side. Producers of non-GM crops face a probability of having their harvest downgraded if gene flow from GM fields raises its content in genetically modified organisms (GMOs) above the labeling threshold. The government may impose on GMO producers mandatory ex ante isolation distances from non-GM fields in order to decrease the probability of non-GM harvest downgrading. It may also introduce an ex post compensation to non-GMO farmers for profit losses due to harvest downgrading, with a compensation fund financed by GMO producers and/or the state. Assuming endogenous crop choices and prices, we study the effects of ex ante regulation and ex post liability on four outcomes: market equilibrium, the achievement of coexistence, and both global and interest group welfare.","[Desquilbet, Marion] INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Poret, Sylvaine] INRA, ALISS UR1303, F-94205 Ivry, France; [Poret, Sylvaine] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Desquilbet, M (通讯作者)，INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France.",Marion.Desquilbet@toulouse.inra.fr; Sylvaine.Poret@ivry.inra.fr,,,,,,,44,2,3,0,83,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In this humongous task, change in the mindset of the marketers, policy and decision makers is collectively foreseen to bring out changes in the ideology and perception of the change makers. This paper proposes for an importance of change in mindset of the marketers ready to enter in the emerging markets with the pursuit of developing and serving the market. Exploratory research design is used as the research methodology to an exhaustive study of the available literature on BOP. The factors that may influence the mindset of the marketers have been extracted from the research papers available in the field of sociology, psychology and management and business studies. The paper foresees the emergence of an understanding through the confluence of scholarly work done within and outside the academic researches done on the BOP consumers. The change in the marketer's mindset is one of the significant enabler in influencing the way BOP market is looked upon as and carries the potential of treating BOP market as equally profitable markets. The study will help the researchers and practitioners to develop and investigate a structured form of research for the issue proposed, which may give direction to few strong empirical researches.

Therefore, transport planners, providers and manufacturers in general are becoming aware of the significance of understanding the passenger experience better, in order to improve transit policies, management and vehicles. The holistic perspective of the travel experience is conceptualized as involving: (1) a thorough set of passenger internal responses (e.g. cognitive and emotional) that are driven by experience factors, some of which are (2) aspects that are not in complete control of the transportation provider, such as waiting areas or the social environment, during (3) all the moments before, throughout and after the trip. Although transportation research has studied the different aspects of transportation quality, empirical studies with such a broad approach to the travel experience and its impact on loyalty are still scarce. This article takes a scale development approach to conceptualize, develop and test a multiple-item scale for measuring the travel experience from the defined holistic perspective, analyzing its perceptual dimensions and outcomes based on a quantitative study with 1226 passengers of a mid-distance bus transportation service. The travel experience scale demonstrates good psychometric properties and consists of 28 items aggregated into seven dimensions or experience factors: individual space, information provision, staffs skills, social environment, vehicle maintenance, off-board facilities, and ticket line service. The study shows that all seven experience factors have a significant impact on customer cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to the transportation service, highlighting the importance of a broad approach to the study and management of the travel experience. The classical dimensions of individual comfort and vehicle maintenance are the ones with the strongest impact on experience outcomes, showing that transportation providers should maintain a strong focus on providing a good core service. However, other factors such as the social environment have an influence on emotions, which in turn affect loyalty to the transportation provider. These results show the need for a careful study and management of the different aspects of the travel experience, and an integrated design and management of the transport system as a whole.

More recently, new developments in operational and vehicle technology, coupled with significant cuts to public transport subsidy budgets, promote a willingness to explore 'institutionally challenging' options such as integrating transport provision across a range of different sectors. This has once more pushed the DRT concept forward as a possible option for saving money whilst retaining opportunities for accessibility. Accordingly, it is now useful to explore the current provision of DRT in Great Britain, in order to determine what type of services exist and to examine which are working well and why. Specifically, the paper draws on a national survey of DRT providers to examine the design, performance, rationale and likely futures of DRT schemes. Key findings suggest a growing role for stakeholders from the voluntary sector and the private sector, the latter resulting in a greater use of smaller vehicles. Linear regression models highlight that passenger numbers are influenced by the size of operation (in terms of seats offered) and by the use of smaller 'car' vehicles, particularly in rural areas. Increasingly, objectives highlight the importance of DRT in providing access and geographical coverage, though insufficient revenue presents a challenge in achieving this. The long term financial sustainability of such schemes continues to be questioned, with a limited number of schemes recognised as commercially sustainable. Naturally, therefore, cost and funding remain dominant concerns of DRT service providers. The organisational response to funding reductions has been diverse. The result is that DRT services have either been withdrawn or, in some cases, replaced conventional bus services due to DRT being a more cost-effective way of meeting local needs.

The aim of this paper - to investigate empirical link between the structure of financial system and economic development. The research results show that the development level of both banking sector and financial markets is higher in countries where higher GDP per capita level is observed, however financial markets become more relevant in the process of capital accumulation. Based on the research results there can be stated that the relationship between the structure of financial system and economic development exists, i.e. the level of country's economic development is higher in countries with market-based financial system. There also can be stated that countries those can be characterized by mixed and market-based financial systems are better economic developed. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The effectiveness of CMS depends on a careful selection of the right activities. Nevertheless elements could be identified which are likely to have a stronger impact on the decision making than others. These should be in the focus when designing and implementing a CMS.

While there is a huge increase in the production and servicing aspects, automobile sector today is facing several challenges on environmental front. This sector emanates hazardous organic and inorganic wastes on grand scale and managing them is a matter of great concern. The present study, through secondary data, analyzes the different strategies adopted for waste management in the Indian automobile sector. The study reveals that automobile industry in India is gradually moving towards to zero waste generation zone, but has to go long way.

The FCE approach attempts to draw attention to the role of events in fields of economic and social action and suggests that events can be important to introducing, structuring, maintaining and configuring new products, industrial standards, cultural artefacts and knowledge categories. The FCE approach has primarily been used to study the actors and networks associated with events such as trade shows, professional gatherings, technology contests, cultural tournaments, industrial exhibitions and business ceremonies: events where actors assemble to reveal novel products, develop industry designs, initiate cultural trends, create social networks, and allocate meaning to previously unfamiliar circumstances. In this introductory paper, we identify the main research trajectories in FCE and link these to economic geography by identifying some common lines of thinking apparent in economic geography, management and organisational studies. The paper moves on to investigate the nature of the field, configuration and events from a geographic perspective, and to emphasize the role that space and power play as a structuring mechanisms in all three.

Our main thesis is that the character of scientific communities can be evaluated morally and be found wanting in terms of moral responsibility. Even an epistemically successful scientific community can be morally responsible for consequences that were unforeseen by it and its members and that follow from policy advice given by its individual members. We motivate our account by a critical discussion of a recent proposal by Heather Douglas. We offer three, related criticisms of Douglas's account. First, she assumes that scientific fields are communicative communities. Second, in a system where the scientific community autonomously sets standards, there is a danger of self-affirming reasoning. Third, she ignores that the character of a scientific community is subject to moral evaluation. We argue that these omissions in Douglas's theory leave it with no adequate response to TEDI Syndrome. Moreover, we deny that science ought to be characterized by unanimity of belief among its competent practitioners, this leads easily to the vices of close-mindedness and expert-overconfidence. If a scientific community wishes to avoid these vices it should create conditions for an active pluralism when it and its members aspire to the position of rational policy decision-making.","[Lefevere, Merel; Schliesser, Eric] Univ Ghent, Dept Philosophy & Moral Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Lefevere, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Philosophy & Moral Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",merel.lefevere@ugent.be,,,,,,,54,7,7,0,2,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-08551-7; 978-3-319-08550-0,ETHICAL ECON,,,2014,50.0,,,,,,275,295,,10.1007/978-3-319-08551-7_14,0.0,,,21,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358528600014,0

The study covers the period 2003-2010 and use standard deviation as a proxy for risk, return on assets as a proxy for return and capital structure was included as control variable. The results suggest that risk is negatively associated with return, as the literature that supports Bowman's paradox shows. Regarding control variable, it is positively associated with risk and when it is added in extended models, it does not affect the significance of variable of interest. Some possible explanations for this negative relation are related to contingencies that influence the risk behaviour of organizational decision-makers, outcomes from strategic conduct and statistical artefacts.","[Pirtea, Marilen; Botoc, Claudiu] West Univ Timioara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Timioara, Romania; [Jurcut, Cecilia] West Univ Timioara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Management, Timioara, Romania",,"Pirtea, M (通讯作者)，West Univ Timioara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Blvd V Parvan 4, Timioara, Romania.",marilen.pirtea@e-uvt.ro; claudiu.botoc@e-uvt.ro; cecilia.anis@e-uvt.ro,"Botoc, Claudiu/N-6663-2014; Pirtea, Marilen Gabriel/IVV-6430-2023","Pirtea, Marilen Gabriel/0000-0002-3956-4394; Botoc, Claudiu/0000-0002-1216-1413",,,,,37,10,10,0,7,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Although recommended for introduction in a number of European countries (such as Germany and Poland), to date only Portugal and to some extent France have implemented fiscal transfers for biodiversity conservation in Europe.

Tasks of article are to analyse models of tourism risk assessment and how they can be used in management, for successful development and functioning of this sector. The analysis of various models has shown that they are not very different from one another, but some have disadvantages, because they cannot be adjusted to incoming tourism. A performed analysis of the models of tourism risk assessment has shown that the risk classification of tourism is appropriate to use in a procedural approach, which is related to stages of the tourism product identification.

Economic development, however, has entailed social costs, witness urban-rural inequalities. The emergence of a vocal middle class in China's coastal cities and the consequent emergence of a civil society, facilitated by social media, have brought greater awareness of consumer rights and discernment in branded product purchasing. While these trends tend still to be an urban phenomenon, they are becoming more widespread, as government seeks to coordinate city and village markets, a process nevertheless still inhibited by poor infrastructure and low rural purchasing power due to income differentials. Consequently, this chapter will focus on increasing consumer discernment in purchasing of products. Chinese government emphasis on moves towards high-tech value-added products, prompted at least in part by the need to circumvent import barriers overseas, but as importantly by domestic brand diversification in China increasingly demanded by consumers, has accelerated competition, with implications for marketing strategy. Such demands for competitive innovation and market targeting bring into sharp relief a number of legal issues like trade descriptions and intellectual property. A raft of legislation is applicable to goods and services but is subject to local enforcement. A special concern of this chapter is food safety, consciousness of which may determine consumer purchasing behaviour. Greater urban consumer spending power has focused on diversified choice of food products. In the context of food safety, factors like age, sex, marital status, educational level and number of household members, which impact upon purchasing of, for example, green and genetically modified categories, are examined. In summary, greater Chinese consumer choice and discernment will necessarily influence marketing strategy by domestic and foreign firms alike.",,,,,,,,,,,42,1,1,0,20,CHANDOS PUBL,SAWSTON,"80 HIGH ST, SAWSTON, CAMBRIDGE CB22 3HJ, ENGLAND",2052-2126,,978-1-78063-449-4; 978-1-84334-768-2,CHANDOS ASIAN STUD,,,2014,,,,,,,205,225,,,,,,21,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6UP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354492600011,0

This paper presents an approach for modelling and analysing how consumers form their purchase decision for insurance services. Building upon fragmented insurance consumer behaviour works, we propose a model that consolidates and expands the current state-of-the-art. This model includes various consumers' characteristics such as life quality, exposure to risks, insurance culture and family nest filters, consumers' intelligence, perception of need for security, need for insurance and affordability. Combined together, they model the consumers' inclination towards purchasing insurance. This is followed by a price-quality trade-off filter that leads to the specific product purchase decision; moreover, we propose a scheme that reflects the complexity of the selection process. Experiments illustrate how the proposed model can be used for evaluating the impact of the various parameters. The results show that the relation between the income level and the purchase intention is not linear; that when an insurance service is perceived as affordable, consumers are inclined to buy it and pay less attention to its quality; that consumers tend to behave similarly, proportionally to their income levels; and that the decoy effect influences the price-quality trade-off","[Ulbinaite, Aurelija; Kucinskiene, Marija] Vilnius State Univ, Fac Econ, Business Dept, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Le Moullec, Yannick] Aalborg Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Elect Syst, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark",Vilnius University; Aalborg University,"Ulbinaite, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Fac Econ, Business Dept, Sauletekio Ave 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",aurelija.ulbinaite@ef.vu.lt; marija.kucinskiene@ef.vu.lt; yannicklemoullec@gmail.com,"Ulbinaite, Aurelija/AAE-8774-2020; Le Moullec, Yannick/F-7387-2010","Le Moullec, Yannick/0000-0003-4667-621X",,,,,82,1,1,2,23,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES AND PATENT LITIGATION OUTCOMES,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,C01; K39; O30; O31; O34; Z18,EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; TROLLS,"It is widely argued that so-called patent trolls are corrupting the U.S. patent system and endangering technology innovation and commercialization at large. For example, a recent White House report argued that trolls hurt firms of all sizes and advocated for specific policies aimed at curtailing practices thought to be particularly harmful. Yet the existence and extent of any systematic effects of so-called troll-like behavior, and the implications of modern patent assertion practices by Non-Practicing Entities (NPEs), remains unclear. This article develops novel empirical evidence to inform the debate over NPEs on patent litigation. Specifically, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of more than 1,750 patent infringement cases decided by a judge or jury in U.S. district courts between 1995 and 2011. We focus on case outcomes, including findings of validity and infringement, and the distributions and values of resulting damage awards. We find some relatively small differences in terms of lower success rates and award values in cases where the patent holders are NPEs. Yet across the subset of cases in which damages are awarded to the patent holders, we find no significant differences in the distribution of awards between NPEs and practicing entities. Nonetheless, there are substantial differences in litigation behavior, success rates, and award values among types of NPEs (that is, universities, individuals, and Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs)). Moreover, we find evidence of certain NPEs engaging in strategic and rational patent acquisition, assertion, and settlement-licensing practices. We posit that these practices may reflect, or perhaps derive from, the economic separation of patent rights from their underlying technologies that is represented in NPE approaches to patent assertion.","[Mazzeo, Michael J.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mazzeo, Michael J.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Mazzeo, MJ (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",mazzeo@kellogg.northwestern.edu; jonathan.ashtor@skadden.com; szyontz@mit.edu,,"Zyontz, Samantha/0000-0002-2126-0624",,,,,21,11,14,2,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The abundant empirical evidence from the developed world appears to show such research reaching maturity. Yet, several barriers to deriving basic estimates among developing countries persist. In this study, we addressed such difficulties for the Mexican context, and by pooling the available data and using well-established methods, we calculated six categories of estimates. The results showed that road transport externalities amount to at least 59.42 (44.8-73.97) billion US dollars per year or 6.24% (4.71-7.77%) of GDP. By component, accidents represented the largest share (28%), followed by congestion (22%), greenhouse gases (21%), air pollution (13%), infrastructure (7%), and noise (9%). By vehicle type, cars had the highest costs per pkm, and buses had the highest costs per vkm. The costs of road transport externalities in Mexico ranked between those of developed and developing regions, but we found some notable differences when comparing the impacts per pkm of the four largest externalities. We discuss such differences and the policy implications of our findings. We also provide suggestions for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"van der Rijt, JW",,,,"van der Rijt, Jan-Willem",,,PUBLIC POLICY AND THE CONDITIONAL VALUE OF HAPPINESS,ECONOMICS AND PHILOSOPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper examines the increasingly popular view that new insights from the science of subjective well-being (SSWB) should play a prominent role in the determination of public policy. Though there are instrumental reasons for caring about societal happiness too, these political aspirations of the SSWB appear to be mostly intrinsically motivated. As the intrinsic value of happiness is endorsed across the political-philosophical spectrum, there is some initial plausibility to the expectation that it should not be too difficult to develop intrinsically motivated policies that can count on widespread support. This paper argues, however, that intrinsically motivated policies based on SSWB findings will always be highly controversial. This is because, although happiness is widely held to be intrinsically valuable, it is usually not deemed unconditionally valuable. By exploring the policy implications of three different views of this conditionality - happiness as a fitting response to the state of the world, authenticity, and merit - it is shown that different views of the conditionality of the intrinsic value of happiness have widely diverging policy implications, which greatly undermines the political aspirations of the SSWB.","Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"van der Rijt, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany.",Jan-Willem.VanderRijt@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,,47,5,5,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

In contrast, estimators that do not incorporate overnight information are more accurate for individual stocks. We also show that accounting for overnight returns may affect the conclusions drawn in an out-of-sample horserace of forecasting models. Finally, there is considerably less variation in the selection of the best out-of-sample forecasting model when only the most accurate in-sample RV estimators are considered.

When the state-of-the-world is revealed there remain steps the parties can take to prevent breach or mitigate damages. We consider strict liability and other regimes such as negligence and comparative fault, and show that the first-best solution is not achieved in those regimes because they incentivize the parties to consult the court in order to determine the identity of the obligor, and this is done only after the contract has collapsed. We design a mechanism that yields the first-best solution without the need for court intervention, thereby allowing the parties to move forward and fulfill efficient contracts. In this mechanism, the court announces that any party that invests half the optimal level of precautionary costs as determined jointly by the parties is off-the-hook, acid that if each party invests this amount the total costs and damages will be split. We demonstrate that this achieves optimality by leading the parties to jointly determine the optimal level of precautionary costs and to allocate the desired steps to the low-cost bearer. In addition, the mechanism leads to revelation of private information. Finally, we discuss the possibility of making the rule mandatory. By predetermining the equal split, the suggested mechanism brings renegotiation costs to a minimum because the parties only have to allocate the physical tasks between them. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Effectively, after this investigation, it is possible to point out that Lagos mastered/controlled the alternatives considered for this public health reform and determined the final result by incorporating restrictions imposed externally by private actors in the health system, arbitrating in Congress the demands of the right-wing parties and dismissing those of his coalition. To explain this process, Kingdon's multiple streams approach (1995) is used.

Islamic countries are generally not free and they have a poor record regarding property rights. To explain these realities we use the institutional history of Muslim countries. We define three steps: the Arab and Ottoman Empires when Islamic law was of great importance, European colonisation, and the contemporary era with its movement towards a revival of Islam. Islamic law is not liberal. This explain why in general Muslim countries are not free. Colonisation radically changed institutional life in the twentieth century. British colonisation proved to be better than did French or Soviet colonisation. This explains why the Persian Gulf countries are freer. The collapse of the Soviet model explains the speed of liberalisation in former socialist countries (such as Albania, Kyrgyz Republic, and Kazakhstan). Nevertheless, the twentieth century was not just the century of Westernisation. It was also the century of the revival of Islam. The article concludes that the history of the twentieth century does not explain the way in which Muslim countries are attracted by the ideal of the Muslim city. The revival of Islamic intellectual innovations and the evolution of Muslim opinion sustain this thesis. Therefore, there is a dependency on the past and on an imagined future. Islam acts, like yesterday, on the world of institutional possibilities.","Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, Ile De France, France",,"Facchini, F (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, Ile De France, France.",facchini@univ-paris1.fr,"Facchini, Francois/AAD-9399-2019","Facchini, Francois/0000-0001-9471-0385",,,,,87,6,6,1,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We find that improvisational actions lead to developing routines as a response to solving unexpected coordination challenges and help explain how global R&D capabilities develop.","[Parida, Vinit; Wincent, Joakim; Kohtamaki, Marko] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Parida, Vinit; Wincent, Joakim; Kohtamaki, Marko] Univ Vaasa, Dept Management, Vaasa, Finland",Lulea University of Technology; University of Vaasa,"Parida, V (通讯作者)，Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",vinit.parida@ltu.se,"Kohtamäki, Marko/J-1618-2015; Parida, Vinit/ABA-5703-2021; Kohtamäki, Marko/ABB-4602-2021","Parida, Vinit/0000-0003-3255-414X; Kohtamäki, Marko/0000-0003-2094-7974",,,,,59,11,11,1,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

A sample of 327 young adults is used to test the hypothesized relationships derived from the main life course perspectives. The results show alternate paths leading to compulsive buying, beyond those uncovered in previous studies. By offering a broader overarching framework, the article shows how previous efforts to study compulsive buying can be improved, pointing to the value of the multitheoretical life course approach in understanding consumption phenomena.","[Baker, Andrew] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Mathur, Anil] Hofstra Univ, Hempstead, NY 11550 USA; [Fatt, Choong Kwai] Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Moschis, George P.; Rigdon, Edward E.] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Moschis, George P.] Georgia State Univ, Ctr Mature Consumer Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; Hofstra University; Universiti Malaya; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Baker, A (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",abaker@mail.sdsu.edu; Anil.Mathur@hofstra.edu; kwaifatt@um.edu.my; gmoschis@gsu.edu; erigdon@gsu.edu,"Rigdon, Edward/Q-9684-2019","Rigdon, Edward/0000-0003-4904-3952; Mathur, Anil/0000-0001-6988-4017",,,,,62,18,21,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The study reported here investigated the institutional foundations of innovation and competitive advantage in this dynamic, design-led, export-oriented manufacturing sector. It connects to ongoing work in economic geography and the social sciences to enhance economic geographers' understanding of the role of institutions in shaping the practices of firms and competitive outcomes and seeks to advance a more agency-centered institutionalist economic geography. The study focused on three dimensions of industrial practices: (1) the use of training and investments in technology, (2) the nature of employment relations, and (3) the use of design. The analysis reveals that the most globally competitive firms operating in a Canadian institutional context prosper by learning a set of production practices and the value of design-intensive products from the embodied knowledge of their founders, who have lived, studied and worked in high-wage, coordinated market economies of continental Europe. The ability of these entrepreneurs to transfer industrial knowledge from continental Europe to Canada has had direct benefits for learning and innovation processes that are critical to the synthetic knowledge base of this sector. The empirical analysis entails a sector wide survey questionnaire (N=220) as well as 55 in-depth interviews with senior managers, production workers, and designers from a subset of leading firms.","Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",University of Toronto,"Hatch, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",carolyn.hatch@mail.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,62,26,27,2,61,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Applying the lexicon of agglomeration theory, the idea is explored in the context of the spatial dynamics of the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland. Spatial concentration indices indicate a particularly high level of spatial concentration in one of the industry's sub-sectors, namely, drug substance production. Based on interview data and secondary sources, a detailed investigation of the spatial dynamics of the Irish concentrations suggests that, while some agglomeration advantages have emerged, they remain relatively limited and have played only a minor role in shaping local industrial concentration. They are mainly of the urbanisation type, relating particularly to the pooled market for workers. The evidence serves to show that the kind of spatial planning-triggered satellite industrial platforms in late-developing economies do not automatically start generating substantial agglomeration economies and crucial technological spillovers, not even after, as in the case of the Cork pharmaceuticals concentration, nearly 40 years of existence.","[Van Egeraat, Chris] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Geog, Natl Inst Reg & Spatial Anal, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Curran, Declan] Dublin City Univ, Sch Business, Dublin 9, Ireland",Maynooth University; Dublin City University,"Van Egeraat, C (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Geog, Natl Inst Reg & Spatial Anal, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",chris.vanegeraat@nuim.ie; Declan.curran@dcu.ie,,"Curran, Declan/0000-0003-0788-1210",,,,,68,6,6,3,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Despite this, a prohibition has been introduced since June 2010 on new taxi and hackney licences, while a series of measures are being introduced in 2012 and 2013 that are likely to limit the flexibility of the SPSV market to respond to changes in demand and supply, especially during busy peak periods, while at the same time obscuring market signals and making regulation more difficult. Taken together these measures mean that there is a real danger that when the economy revives and demand for SPSV services increases that there will be increased waiting times, as there were in the 1990s when taxi numbers were restricted, while fare discounting will end much sooner than it otherwise would. In this paper these issues are explored together with the implications for independence of the SPSV regulatory regime.","Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Gorecki, PK (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland.",paul.gorecki@esri.ie,,,,,,,34,3,3,0,5,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

To resolve this issue, we developed a framework using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) process and Kano's model for application to a case study on innovation in the shared research equipment service at the Gyeonggi Bio-Center. Kano's model allows us to define which service quality requirements are attractive, one-dimensional or must-be qualities in the shared research equipment service. The QFD process has rarely been applied to the shared research equipment service (which is closely related with technology infrastructure policy).

To improve forecasting accuracy, researchers must investigate the reasons for the inaccuracies. However, very little research has been done, and the percentage of errors for each reason has rarely been examined. After perusing various studies on forecasting inaccuracies, the authors determined that an in-depth case study was necessary. This paper describes such a case study: an overestimate in a forecast of travel demand, forecast using the four-step method, for the Tokadai Line rail service in a suburb of Nagoya, Japan. The paper examines the following factors behind the errors: target area, population, modal split, failure to consider the effects of a competing railway, inappropriate selection of modal choice model, and an incomplete network. Through this case, three implications of general inaccuracies in forecasting are presented. First, while previous studies have shown that input uncertainties are larger than model uncertainties, this does not mean that inputs cause larger errors. Second, the uncertainties related to inputs must be prioritised. Finally, the reasons for the inaccuracies are more difficult than expected to identify, since the same inaccuracies can be explained by more than one reason. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Relationships in this market are valuable if they mitigate potential hold-up problems and incentives for ex post renegotiation arising from contractual incompleteness. An important characteristic of informal contracts is that they must be self-enforcing, so the value of relationships between firms and suppliers depend on the extent of possibilities for future interaction. We construct measures of the stock of contractors' prior interactions with relevant subcontractors and, most importantly, an exogenous instrument to measure the future value of ongoing relationships that is orthogonal to contractor subcontractor match-specific productivity. We find that a larger stock of relationships leads to a greater likelihood of entry and to lower bids. Importantly, this relationship does not hold in periods of time and areas with little future contract volume, suggesting that the value of the future is crucial in providing value for informal contracts","[Marion, Justin] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,,,,"Gil, Ricard/0000-0003-3627-0988",,,,,41,49,54,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

We also find that fathers' education has no effect on the time devoted to educational childcare time by either parent.

That is, it is endemic only in certain areas of the globe, with environmental and climatic characteristics that are ideal for the proliferation of mosquitoes, which are the vector for transmitting the disease. This feature is the main reason why a large body of economic literature uses mortality from malaria as a proxy with which to measure the effect of geography on human outcomes. Cases of eradication are being scrutinized by scholars to determine the socioeconomic impacts of malaria. Among the various malaria parasites, the worst, Plasmodium falciparum, infested Italian regions for centuries until its eradication in the period 194550. This article presents an empirical assessment of the economic outcomes of the eradication of malaria in the Italian regions by exploiting the spatial variation in mortality rates. I found support for the hypothesis that the eradication of malaria increases human capital in the long run. In particular, I found that eradication increased the years of schooling by about 0.3 years, although my evidence suggests a greater effect on males than on females. Moreover, I found support for a long-run impact of eradication actions that operated through an intergenerational spillover effect and accounted for about 0.07 years of schooling.","[Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Milan, Italy; [Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, CERTeT, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Percoco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Via Sarfatti 25, Milan, Italy.",marco.percoco@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,0,7,8,1,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

A successful antitrust transplant requires institutional structures in host countries that are able to support and maintain transplanted laws. If the transplant country fails to meet this institutional requirement, then the enforcement of competition law will have a very limited effect in regard to improving market competition, and its transplantation will be neither harmful nor helpful in terms of law enforcement.

The primary aim of this project was to reduce transport-related greenhouse gas emissions through travel behaviour changes. In this paper, we present a study where before and after surveys were conducted to evaluate to what extent this project impacted the community's attitudes with respect to travel behaviour change, that is, not to evaluate their behaviour change, but to see if the THITW Project impacted their attitudes about use of car and alternatives to the car. The results show that in the before survey, inadequate public transport did not get mentioned as one of the most cited disadvantages of reducing car use while in the after survey, public transport has come into the minds of both THITW participants and non-participants. Moreover, an analysis of attitudinal statement scales shows that, compared to the 2005 survey, the THITW Project has contributed to some degree of attitude change. Particularly, evidence was found that THITW participants have significantly increased their willingness to reduce car use. We conclude that evidence exists that the THITW project has had the desired effect of changing participants' attitudes towards reducing car use. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While identifying the key determinants of project performance is important, few studies test discriminatory power of variables for predicting distressed capital projects. Thus, this longitudinal study of 121 capital projects identifies key variables in the initiation and planning phases of projects that differentiate between healthy and distressed projects at completion. Subsequent univariate logistic analysis shows that the Quality variable provides the highest univariate classification accuracy. Hierarchical logistic-regression analysis reveals high classification accuracy and relatively small differences in overall classification rates. Out-of-sample forecasting validation demonstrates that the optimal model provides a reasonably good overall classification rate of 85.37%. Ultimately, our findings suggest that it is feasible to discriminate simultaneously between healthy and distressed projects prior to the project execution phase in the capital facility delivery process, providing an early warning of projects in distress.","Natl Univ Tainan, Dept Business & Management, Tainan 700, Taiwan",National University Tainan,"Chen, HL (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Tainan, Dept Business & Management, 33,Sec 2,Shu Lin St, Tainan 700, Taiwan.",along314@mail.nutn.edu.tw,,,,,,,83,4,4,0,11,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The model features two engines of long-run economic growth: R&D-based innovation and human capital accumulation. One novelty of this study is endogenous fertility, which negatively affects the growth rate of human capital. Given this growth-theoretic framework, we characterize the dynamics of the model and derive comparative statics of the equilibrium growth rates with respect to structural parameters. As for policy implications, we analyze how patent policy affects economic growth through technological progress, human capital accumulation, and endogenous fertility. In summary, we find that strengthening patent protection has (a) a positive effect on technological progress, (b) a negative effect on human capital accumulation through a higher rate of fertility, and (c) an ambiguous overall effect on economic growth.","[Chu, Angus C.; Cozzi, Guido] Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham, England; [Liao, Chih-Hsing] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Liao, Chih-Hsing] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Chu, Angus C.] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Durham University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chengchi University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Chu, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham, England.",angusccc@gmail.com; guido.cozzi@durham.ac.uk; chihhsingliao@gmail.com,"Chu, Angus/GNH-3700-2022",,,,,,49,32,35,2,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The requirements of life standards and qualities, such as the right to an adequate/healthy environment, the importance of integrating the social equity into environmental policies, and the critical importance of public participation and official accountability are stressed with increasing frequency and pressure. It seems obvious now, the urgent global challenges of sustainability and equity must be addressed together. The target of this article is to prove the dependency between globalization and human development. The first part provides the methodology of measuring overall globalization with emphasis on the KOF Index of Globalization 2007. The Index of Globalization includes economic, social, and political contexts. The second part introduces one of the parameters of institutional quality - HDI (or rather IHDI as the real indicator of the level of human development) and its methodology. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index combines three dimensions: A long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The third part compares indices and scores together, analyzes them, and confirms or refutes the empirical relationships between the Index of Globalization and its parts and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. It is possible to conclude from the results achieved in the study that globalization remains primarily, a very strong and powerful economic phenomenon. But spurring growth rates and reducing poverty in countries with poor institutions cannot be done simply by globalizing their economies. The research provides data and conclusions with a potential to identify such policies at national and global level that could satisfactorily solve some of the most poignant problems of globalization and human development.","[Kocourek, Ales; Bednarova, Pavla; Laboutkova, Sarka] Tech Univ Liberci, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon, Liberci, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Kocourek, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon, Liberci, Czech Republic.",ales.kocourek@tul.cz; pavla.bednarova@tul.cz; sarka.laboutkova@tul.cz,"Kocourek, Ales/HKW-2602-2023; Laboutkova, Sarka/AAI-1256-2019; Bednářová, Pavla/HLP-4977-2023","Kocourek, Ales/0000-0002-5880-7515; Laboutkova, Sarka/0000-0001-7108-2144; Bednarova, Pavla/0000-0002-5397-4488",,,,,24,18,18,2,39,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Moreover, its centrally planned economy obtained a complete institutional framework of a capitalist economy of the FRG at the moment of reunification and consecutively got long-term financial support from West Germany. Nevertheless, the real economic results during the last two decades have been a monumental disappointment: GDP per capita is still lagging behind West Germany by approximately 30 percent. The rate of growth remains constantly slow, especially in comparison with other post-communist countries. The rate of unemployment has been oscillating between 15 and 22 percent since 1995 etc. Thus a key question is: what are the main causes of such a long economic stagnation? The topical literature particularly deals with the following factors: too strong appreciation of the east currency (the so-called Ostmark), too high wage growth, problematic privatization and so on. However, from our point of view, the mistakes in economy policy in the early 1990s cannot explain such a long unsuccessful economic development. Besides, East Germany has an advanced and stable political, institutional and legal environment and is a part of an economically prosperous region. In our opinion, the incompatibility between West Germany formal institutions and East Germany informal institutions is another crucial cause of the long-lasting decline in the productive activities. After forty years of socialism, people in East Germany failed to behave according to the western rules. Moreover, we can see some social-psychological factors affecting specially East Germany. These factors (feelings of inferiority in relationship with West Germans, inadequately optimistic expectations) contributed to the consequent frustration and pessimism of East Germans that is reflected in low economic activity in East Germany.","[Kouba, Ludek] Mendelova Univ, Prov Ekonomicka Fak, Ostav Ekonomie, Brne, Czech Republic; [Krizova, Hana] Mendelova Univ, Prov Ekonomicka Fak, Brne, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Kouba, L (通讯作者)，Mendelova Univ, Prov Ekonomicka Fak, Ostav Ekonomie, Brne, Czech Republic.",kouba@mendelu.cz; xkrizo19@node.mendelu.cz,"Kouba, Ludek/E-9951-2013; Krizova, Hana/B-8838-2017","Kouba, Ludek/0000-0001-6171-8428;",,,,,42,0,0,0,13,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Economists have focused attention on the effects of consumption, income and economic growth or development on well-being and whether economic growth can be the sole basis for delivering prosperity (Dutt & Radcliff, 2009; Jackson, 2010). The search for happiness is an important individual and national economic goal. In the Benthamite utilitarian tradition, happiness is the sum of all pleasures and pains. People often obtain or perceive their happiness from what they have in comparison with others. At the macroeconomic level, more happiness may come from a sustained growth in GDP that enables households to enjoy an improved quality of life, with rising income, consumption and employment opportunities. At the microeconomic or individual level, more income may also enable people to live happier and fuller lives relative to those who are poor. But this accounts for only a small contribution to happiness. Life circumstances, such as marital status, health, having children and the nature of the working environment statistically make a greater contribution to happiness than income.","Univ Kwazulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mahadea, D (通讯作者)，Univ Kwazulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa.",,,,,,,,56,10,11,8,83,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

These techniques are applied to the selected household indicators gathered in the SILC (Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) survey in the Czech Republic in 2008. We clustered households characterized by the indicators expressing if a household owns a computer and a car as an example. We discuss the problem of determination of optimal cluster numbers by the approach based on information criteria (we use the Bayesian information criterion) and determine number of clusters by means of the silhouette coefficient. Then we describe four obtained clusters on the basis of indicators of working activity, degree of education and degree of urbanization. Moreover, we extended characterizing variables to the recoded indicators expressing how the household goes well with its income. On the basis of this example we illustrate investigation of variable importance. In this case we describe obtained three clusters by three variables used in the analysis. In conclusion we mention some other approaches to evaluation of clustering objects characterized by categorical variables. They consist in both coefficients based on multivariate analysis of variance with using specialized variability measure for nominal and ordinal data, and modification of some other coefficients for qualitative data.

At the individual level the most important characteristic is age. Younger workers under 30 have much higher rates of mobility and the share of upward mobility is also higher among them.

With the advent of public Social Software Platforms (SSP), such as Facebook, organizations are provided with the opportunity to extend beyond organizational boundaries and include the customer in the value creation process. However, as Porter (2006, p. 225) noted, the mere presence of firms, suppliers, and institutions in a location creates the potential for economic value, but it does not necessarily ensure the realization of that potential. The aim of the research paper is to explore, if airport organizations are able to increase their economic need satisfaction when interacting with passengers on SSP. The paper adopts a strategy map approach to deduce cause-effect relationships between engaging with passengers on SSP and economic need satisfaction of airport organizations. Expert interviews with Corporate Communication Managers of six out of eight major German airports (annual passenger volume > 5 Mio.) provide initial insights into the current degree of economic need satisfaction by contrasting the SSP Facebook with traditional communication channels of the airports. The paper describes to what extent SSP contribute to economic need satisfaction with respect to 'customer insights', 'operational efficiency', 'innovative strength', 'customer advocacy' and 'customer satisfaction'. The results show that while airport managers already experience some increase in economic need satisfactions, they are not yet able to tap into the full potential of SSP.","[Tenge, Marion] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,marion.tenge@gmx.net,,,,,,,31,0,0,1,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,601,613,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100057,0

Consequently, there is a growing adoption of corporate sustainability principles and practices across all market sectors. This study examined four developed and four emerging stock markets and the sustainability reporting practices of the top 20 and bottom 20 companies in each. The results illustrate that the developed market sector was more advanced in its corporate sustainability reporting, both in the proportion of companies issuing a sustainability report (approximately 60 per cent) and the proportion of company webpages dedicated to sustainability reporting. This difference was largely due to the effect of the top 20 companies. There was little difference between developed and developing markets when only the bottom 20 companies were considered, of which less than one-third provided sustainability reports.

In our model, a top manager intends to overreport earnings; a division manager may have evidence about the intended overreporting. We show that the division manager is more likely to have such evidence when the performance of his own division is low. Top management may offer a bribe to prevent the manager from blowing the whistle. This provides the division manager with an additional payoff when his divisions output is low.

CSD is an emergent governance procedure that is increasingly advocated by practitioners and researchers as a practical means of counterbalancing the asymmetry of interests in public policy making. In CSD, participants that represent the full diversity of interdependent organised interests in the issue at stake engage in collaborative dialogue to find a consensus on the way forward. In order to improve the process and application of CSD in transport it is important to systematically compare this procedure to the conventional adversarial style of stakeholder interaction in the transport policy process. To do so this paper builds on a governance framework that allows the comparison of the collaborative and adversarial pathways with regards to their potential to facilitate better transport policy choices. The paper concludes by proposing CSD as a tool to de-politicise stakeholder discussions and so enable a shift away from the traditionally narrow priority of transport policy making to facilitate economic growth to a broader focus that better integrates environmental, social and economic considerations. It also concludes that CSD is most appropriate in problem situations with high levels of conflict between competing stakeholder groups that all have influence. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Landes and Posner (Harv Law Rev 94(5):937-996, 1981) is similarly often considered the main reference for the generalized version of the index in the case of a dominant firm that shares the market with price-taking rivals. From the viewpoint of the history of industrial economics both claims are incorrect. It was not Lerner who invented the price/cost margin index and the generalized version was fully derived before WWII. In both cases, priority should be given to Luigi Amoroso, the leading Italian mathematical economist in the interwar decades.

It begins with the concept of politics as a type of social relationship mediated by dispute and/or the exercise of power, as well as by the material or symbolic resources related to it, Methodologically, the study explores and analyzes aspects such as the valuation or construction that neighbors make about the main problems in their communities, the ways in which they face and/or solve them, the paths of autonomous action they choose for this and the participation mechanisms experienced in the community. The study explores how the polarization that Venezuelan politics has experienced in the last fourteen years has affected communal councils, a phenomenon that, in the authors' opinion, has marked the initial coordinates of the first five years of the communal councils' existence. Conclusions are that the political process opened in 1998 promoted implementation of a democratic project that tried to overcome the deficits of the IVth Republic, formalized in the development of legislation and the experiences of diverse participation, valued and driven by the interests of the political actors that promote them, showing significant limitations for the re-politicization of the communities.","[Cordova Jaimes, Edger] Univ Nacl Expt Rafael Maria Baralt, Maracaibo, Estado Zulia, Venezuela",,"Jaimes, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Expt Rafael Maria Baralt, Maracaibo, Estado Zulia, Venezuela.",cordova_e@cantv.net,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,2,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Therefore, a corrective nature of the aid is maintained. However, the Guidelines are also applied to accelerate the deployment of next-generation access (NGA) networks, which implies a driving conception of State aid, as this is an emerging market and there are relatively few Europeans who have access to these networks.

Moreover, the decision to join or form an alliance is fostered by the aggregate market share of the alliances.

The various attempts by France (a list of quality signs), Germany ('Markenqualitat aus deutschen Landen' sign) and Belgium ('Walloon' sign) have all been condemned as protectionist policies contradicting the free movement of goods in the European Market. These national quality signs can be seen as attempt to defend the viability of specific kinds of activities (involving small enterprises) in specific places (rural areas). These cases are a good illustration of the difficulties that a Member State of the European Communities (Member State) faces in trying to protect its traditional activities and/or rural areas in a way that is compatible with free markets. The paper analyses the recent court decisions underlining economic aspects such as information delivery and the cost of alternative protection mechanisms for these activities. We highlight in particular the collective trademarks and the kind of intellectual property right they form by the economic theory of clubs, and make some comparisons with protected geographical indications.","[Charlier, Christophe; Ngo, Mai-Anh] GREDEG CNRS, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Charlier, Christophe] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, F-06560 Valbonne, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Charlier, C (通讯作者)，GREDEG CNRS, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",charlier@idefi.cnrs.fr; ngo@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,"Charlier, Christophe/0000-0001-6147-7396",,,,,19,3,4,2,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This article applies a new methodology, developed in the study, of systematic content analysis of all court decisions of Robinson-Patman cases published from 1990 to 2000 (inclusive), traced using the lexis.com database, in order to expand our knowledge regarding such discrimination. I present two empirical claims concerning the act. First, I analyze the preliminary procedures conducted in secondary line private complaints, showing that the procedures themselves can harm competition among suppliers, encourage collusion, and increase monopoly prices. Second, I fill in the factual background to show how the act harms consumers and competition, and, by contrast, how the use of secondary line discrimination can encourage competition. The results help to understand the reasons why suppliers employ such discrimination and its affect on business behavior and competition. They also help to explain the motivations of those discriminated purchasers to file a complaint for such discrimination. The results show empirically why the Robinson-Patman Act should be repealed in its entirety and why it would not be sufficient to dismiss private complaints filed to courts, or to interpret it in keeping with broader antitrust policies.","[Bulmash, Hagit] Tel Aviv Univ, Zvi Meitar Ctr Adv Legal Studies, Buchmann Fac Law, Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Bulmash, H (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Zvi Meitar Ctr Adv Legal Studies, Buchmann Fac Law, Tel Aviv, Israel.",bulmashh@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,45,3,3,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Telephone interviews were conducted with 1,001 GTHA parents/guardians of elementary school-aged children. Analyses indicated that 1.7% of the sample used carpooling as the primary school travel mode in the a.m., while 33.8% of the sample drove their child to school in the a.m. One quarter (25%) of the total sample had participated in a carpool for school travel with neighbors or friends at times. The main reasons for automobile school travel were convenience and safety. Those drivers who indicated carpooling to be more convenient reported carpooling to be more appealing, to interfere less with their current household schedule, were more interested in carpooling, placed a greater importance on using an environment-friendly travel mode, and had a greater proportion of non-English speakers than drivers who indicated carpooling to be inconvenient. These findings confirm that carpooling is an under-utilized school travel mode, and that there may be some scope in intervening among parents/guardians who perceive carpooling to be potentially convenient.

The most striking effects occur when household members differ in individual preferences and enjoy positive leisure-dependent externalities. For instance, a global change in relative bargaining power where the hardworking member becomes more influential in each working class household can render the working class worse off. Moreover, we show that restrictions on labor supply can prevent hard workers from exerting too much pressure on their hedonistic partners to work more. A restriction on individual labor supply improves welfare of the working class population, which adds a new twist to the literature on why working hours are limited in many European countries.","[Gersbach, Hans] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH, Ctr Econ Res, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gersbach, Hans] CEPR, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Haller, Hans] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Gersbach, H (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH, Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hgersbach@ethz.ch,,,,,,,33,0,0,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

We examine various different approaches to demand forecasting for such products, paying particular attention to the need for inventory planning over a multi-period lead-time when the underlying process may be non-stationary. This emphasis leads to the consideration of prediction distributions for processes with time-dependent parameters. A wide range of possible distributions could be considered, but we focus upon the Poisson (as a widely used benchmark), the negative binomial (as a popular extension of the Poisson), and a hurdle shifted Poisson (which retains Croston's notion of a Bernoulli process for the. occurrence of active demand periods). We also develop performance measures which are related to the entire prediction distribution, rather than focusing exclusively upon point predictions. The three models are compared using data on the monthly demand for 1046 automobile parts, provided by a US automobile manufacturer. We conclude that inventory planning should be based upon dynamic models using distributions that are more flexible than the traditional Poisson scheme.

This paper introduces a semiparametric method that generates forecast intervals of Yt+h|Xt from point forecast models. First, the point forecast model is estimated, thereby taking advantage of its predictive power. Then, nonparametric estimation of the conditional distribution function (CDF) of the forecast error conditional on Xt builds the rest of the forecast distribution around the point forecast, from which symmetric and minimum-length forecast intervals for Yt+h|Xt can be constructed. Under mild regularity conditions, asymptotic analysis shows that (1) regardless of the quality of the point forecast model (i.e., it may be misspecified), forecast quantiles are consistent and asymptotically normal; (2) minimum length forecast intervals are consistent. Proposals for bandwidth selection and dimension reduction are made. Three sets of simulations show that for reasonable point forecast models the method has significant advantages over two existing approaches to interval forecasting: one that requires the point forecast model to be correctly specified, and one that is based on fully nonparametric CDF estimate of Yt+h|Xt. An application to exchange rate forecasting is presented.

To develop support for this claim, the paper first recounts what economic analysis can say about trade liberalization. Then it analyses the quality of the arguments that economists make in support of free trade. The paper argues that the standard argument made by economists in favour of free trade is either incoherent or implicitly imposes philosophical value judgements about what is good for a nation or society, or it makes leaps of empirical faith about how the world works.

Changes in market structure due to patent expiration or other factors is likely to reduce both the average price of a drug and marketing expenditure, so the effect of increased competition on total utilization of a drug is theoretically indeterminate. We use longitudinal, molecule-level data on virtually all prescription drugs sold during the period 2000-2004 to analyze the impact of changes in market structure (primarily resulting from patent expiration) on U.S. drug prices, marketing, and utilization. Price and marketing expenditure both decline by about 50-60% in the years immediately following generic entry, but the number of prescriptions remains essentially constant during those years. The two effects of increased competition on utilization - positive (via price), and negative (via marketing) - almost exactly offset one another, so the net effect of patent expiration on drug utilization is zero.

There is a trade-off from increasing scale that must be accounted for in any theory of firm size and reputation. The more products sold, all things equal, the more the firm has to gain in the long run from preserving a reputation for high quality. On the other hand, the more products sold, the greater the potential short-run gain from providing low quality. This article focuses on a natural assumption to explain why in many cases the longer run considerations dominate: asymmetric performance. If, for example, the products a firm sells are sold nonsimultaneously, then the entire reputation of the firm is on the line from the sale of only a subset of its products. This article explains the importance of asymmetric performance for reputational economies of scale. The logic applies to law firm structure, suggesting that larger law firms have reputational advantages. It also helps to explain why partners tend to share profits among themselves. Existing empirical evidence about firm reputation and profit sharing is consistent with the theory.

Both territorial and functional decentralisation have an impact on the final results of policy making. In fact, territorial decentralisation implies the delegation of functions to wide multi-purpose tiers of sub-national governance, which has been a central dynamic of Italian governance. Furthermore, functional decentralisation stresses the assignment of functions, vertically and horizontally, to single-purpose quasi-autonomous agencies. Multi level governance (MLG) aims at understanding the nature and explaining the structure of governance networks, their inter-relationship with control, capacity, accountability and efficiency of political systems (Bache and Flinders, 2004; Piattoni, 2010). To date, only a limited use has been made of this important instrument of analysis, at least in Italy, in transport policy, in general, and in the road sector, in particular. Research in various domains such as political geography (Shaw et al., 2009), regional and urban studies (Kern and Bulkeley, 2009) and institutional economics (Marsden et al., 2009) have all stressed the crucial role governance plays in the transport sector notwithstanding the lack of a common framework of analysis. The paper synthetically reports the definitions of MLG proposed, describing their characteristics and clarifying their implications for the transport sector, as well as discussing the implications of a specific MLG for the transport sector regulatory system and for the role of local public authorities. Management and programs of the local road sector in Italy are discussed with a particular focus on the different types of solutions adopted and on the level of integration among different governance levels.

Price discrimination by a Multinational Corporation (MNC) alleviates the problem of non-availability of the drug in a developing country compared to uniform pricing strategy. Incorporating an upstream-downstream market structure we show that in the presence of parallel trade 'a form of arbitrage' by traders the MNC cannot successfully discriminate the prices for its product. The analysis however, indicate that if the market size of the developing nation is relatively large, then with Coumot competition among the traders, the manufacturer earns higher profit by allowing parallel trade than by perfectly discriminating the prices for its product. Under Bertrand competition, the strategy to allow parallel trade always dominates the strategy to restrain it. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

An unanswered question is whether the resources generated from price discrimination are used by schools during the regular admission process to attract more diverse students. Using a sample of private national universities and liberal arts colleges, we model the choice to adopt an ED program and its impact on students' racial and geographic diversity. We find that schools facing more competition for students are more likely to adopt an ED program. The overall heterogeneity of students is lower for schools that adopt ED, and heterogeneity decreases as schools enroll larger percentages of students through ED. Higher ED enrollment percentages appear to strongly and negatively affect Asian American and Hispanic students and positively affect white students.","[Antecol, Heather; Smith, Janet Kiholm] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College,"Antecol, H (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",,,,,,,,21,3,6,0,18,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

Empirical evidence suggests that: (1) the investment share of GDP is higher in those countries characterized by highly efficient bankruptcy system; the more efficient the insolvency procedures in terms of time, cost and recovery rate, the more readily available debt is and the higher the Investment/GDP ratio is; (2) the investment share of gross domestic product is positively associated with the degree of sophistication of the Bankruptcy Law, at least below a certain level of legal production; (3) data suggest some complementary effect between Bankruptcy Law and Enforcement for rich countries, while the interaction term indicates some substitution effect when poor countries are considered.

Most studies, however, ignore household production and confound differential opportunity costs with changes in income or bargaining power. I disentangle these determinants of gender discrimination-preferences, income and time allocation-by comparing households with varying degrees of parental involvement. Results indicate that, controlling for household fixed effects, reducing the time available for household production has a disproportionately negative effect on daughters. But, for a transitory income shock, daughters' education is less income-elastic. Increasing mothers' bargaining power is most effective in narrowing the gender gap.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Chen, JJ (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 324 Agr Adm Bldg,2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",chen.1276@osu.edu,"Chen, Joyce/AAV-3126-2021","Chen, Joyce/0000-0003-1933-3692",,,,,24,4,5,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Economic development has certainly intensified per capita income enhancing personal mobility. In Asia, private vehicle ownership and usage have continued to be recognised as an obligatory element of travel for many. Undoubtedly there is a direct relationship between vehicle ownership and public transport usage. Inter-regional and inter-temporal investigations of travel behaviour in Asian cities are therefore necessary to develop an understanding of the future transportation system including suitability and the role of public transport. Since travel data are scarce in Asian countries, inter-regional or inter-temporal travel behaviour investigations do not exist to date. Several travel demand models are developed using discrete choice modelling techniques and Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Nagoya as case studies. Estimation results of the mode choice models are successfully incorporated to compare travel behaviour trends in selected cities in Asia. The developed models are tested for spatial and temporal transferability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Robust detection means that changing the number of new customers taken on should not lead to either a false or delayed signal. We investigate the performances of monitoring schemes via a simulation study that uses several scenarios. We consider monitoring based on default rates estimated through a gliding window, cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts based on default rates. CUSUM charts based on defaults within a given follow-up time after arrival, and a survival analysis CUSUM chart.

It is hoped that findings from this paper can provide greater understanding in the areas of quality and knowledge management, and illustrate how these practices can enrich the supply chain learning among partnering firms.","[Loke, Siew-Phaik; Khalid, Khalizani] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Business Management, Bota, Malaysia; [Downe, Alan G.] Curtin Univ Sarawak, Sch Business, Miri, Malaysia; [Sambasivan, Murali] Univ Putra Malaysia, Grad Sch Management, Serdang, Malaysia",Curtin University Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Loke, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Business Management, Bota, Malaysia.",lokesp@gmail.com; adowne@pd.jaring.my; murali@econ.upm.edu.my; lyzakhalid76@gmail.com,"Khalid, Khalizani/AAZ-8618-2021; Sambasivan, Murali/F-7622-2013","Sambasivan, Murali/0000-0002-5779-4126; Loke, Siew-Phaik/0000-0001-9603-2960; Khalid, Khalizani/0000-0002-8485-1616",,,,,78,49,58,4,80,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The article presents a new division of quality costs as fixed and variable quality costs. The new division is helpful to show influence of quality costs on changes in the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Those changes can be defined thanks to known indicator of operating leverage (DOL). Value of this indicator helps to show how the structure of costs affects proportional changes of the EBIT. One of the most important rules in quality management is to minimize total quality costs and to avoid external and internal failures. Minimization of failure costs (variable costs) causes increasing of prevention and appraisal costs (fixed costs). In this situation, management of company must not forget that increasing of fixed costs and decreasing of total revenue causes increasing of company risk at the same time and near future. That is the reason why management must concentrate on the improvement of company processes. The improvement is possible thanks to minimization not only failures but also prevention and appraisal losses. Thanks to minimization of prevention and appraisal losses, the company can minimize prevention and appraisal costs as fixed costs. Company (by the improvement actions) is able to change the structure of quality costs which has direct influence on the EBIT. The level of EBIT has important role in the level of tax which company has to pay and also decides about decisions of further quality improvements. We can not forget that those quality costs changes lead to decrease of operation risk level of which have important role and position in situation of economic crisis, or fluctuation of economy, in general.","[Mizla, Martin; Pudlo, Patrycja] Ekon Univ Bratislave, Podnikovohospodarska Fak, Katedra Manazmentu, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Mizla, M (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislave, Podnikovohospodarska Fak, Katedra Manazmentu, Bratislava, Slovakia.",martin.mizla@euke.sk; patrycja.pudlo@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,4,4,0,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

There was researched impact of various determinants as taxes, asymmetric information, return on assets and others on capital structure. With this issue are associated theories of capital structure which validity has been tested. There are two basic theories, the trade-off theory and the pecking order theory. Interesting is, that results often differ in various researches. This paper deals with determinants of capital structure within czech companies and also tries to verify the validity of capital structure theories. Specifity is, that this paper is also industry-oriented, there were researched 299 companies from 6 industries. First, there was performed a background research among works of economists who are related with this topic. The research of czech companies was performed by means of multiple regression. There was surveyd impact of proportion of fixed assets, retained earnings, interest rate, return on assets, size of company, proportion of tangible assets and company age on capital structure or on long-term debt and on total debt of company, and level of cross-sectional impact of these determinants. Relevant results were found for one industry: the Information and communication activities. There was found a negative impact of company size and a positive impact of retained earnings on total debt. This acknowledges the trade-off theory, which was stressed by studying of standard deviations. But when is accepted a cross-sectional negative impact of return on assets on total debt, it highlights the validity of the pecking order theory. With consideration of all results and their relevance, there could be declared that both theories explain something of capital structure decisions. There could be stated the impossibility of searching any unified rule for financial decisions of companies.","Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Ekon & Managementu, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Prásilová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Ekon & Managementu, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",Pavlina.Prasilova@upce.cz,,,,,,,65,14,14,0,27,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The collected information was analyzed seeking to identify emerging categories for the primary data in order to formulate the theory used by the researchers. Results showed that one of the most important categories refers to the dual role of teacher and researcher, indissoluble and prioritary in the institutional goals met during academic performance.

Between 2006 and 2013, Australasian BRT corridors increased from 4 to 10 while ridership tripled and now accounts for over 145 M boardings p.a. The Brisbane busway network dominates; it represents 70% of Australasian system ridership. Australasian BRT is characterised by a range of designs ranging from substantive busway infrastructure (e.g. Brisbane) to low order on-street BRT systems (Melbourne SmartBus). Analysis suggests both large-scale busways and the cheaper on-street BRT have characteristics which generate good ridership performance. Principle factors influencing ridership performance are high service levels, low speeds (although direction of causality is unclear), shorter stop spacing, segregated rights of way, modern accessible vehicles, lower fares, system integration and preboarding ticketing (the latter is not fully applied in Australasian BRT contexts). Operationally segregated rights of way act to improve BRT operating speeds and reliability compared to on-street BRT. Evidence shows BRT ridership growth has outstripped non-BRT transit ridership changes in all cities studied. Although BRT ridership has grown at a higher rate than light rail/tram in Australia, it performs less effectively per route km and per vehicle km than light rail, primarily due to lower service levels.

Drawing upon a review of policy documents, secondary data and fieldwork findings from a research project that studies the developmental impact of academic mobility among Chinese scholars active in the Chinese-German academic space, this paper challenges the talents sans frontieres' notion on the one hand, and illustrates the limits of the state on the other. Mobile scholars are conceptualised as active agents who are nested in, and hence being regulated by and at the same time shaping the Chinese state and its policies. Mobile scholars (and their local(ised) colleagues) are engaged in multiple relationships (ranging from collaborative, contradictory to conflictual ones) with the state, sometimes reinforcing and at other times toppling its notions of development. These relationalities call for new interpretations of the dynamic, contextualised and complex mobility-development nexus.","Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Leung, MWH (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",W.H.M.Leung@uu.nl,,,,,,,53,4,4,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Although it is widely recognised that these on-demand services provide a better level of service to passengers at a lower operating cost than the infrequent fixed route services which they often replace, they still require significant financial support to cover their costs. As local authority budgets to support public transport continue to be reduced the sustainability of these services is being brought into sharper focus. In this paper we compare and contrast the development of FTS in UK, Japan and India. In particular we examine the extent to which new technologies are being used to contribute to a reduction in operating costs in the UK and Japan and whether these developments point to a future model for sustainable flexible service provision in developing countries, using India as an example.

Using panel data from Irish manufacturing we find that the contribution of the breadth of openness (i.e., the variety of plants' innovation linkages) on innovation performance is stronger for small plants than for larger plants. Both small and larger plants face diminishing returns as the breadth of openness increases, but small plants experience negative returns at lower level of the breadth of openness than larger plants. Our results suggest that small plants can gain significantly from using wider set of innovation linkages, but for such plants appropriate partner choice is a particularly important issue. Small plants also gain significantly more than larger ones from investing in the linkages within the supply chain.","[Vahter, Priit] Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia; [Love, James H.; Roper, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Enterprise Res Ctr, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Love, James H.; Roper, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Tartu; University of Warwick; University of Warwick,"Vahter, P (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Narva Rd 4-A115, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia.",priit.vahter@ut.ee,"Roper, Stephen/P-1088-2016","Roper, Stephen/0000-0002-9702-8696","ESRC [RES-062-23-2767]; IUT of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [IUT 20-49]; ESRC [ES/I003185/1, ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I003185/1, ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); IUT of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The research on which this paper is based was funded by the ESRC under award [grant number RES-062-23-2767].

Commonly, the root mean square error and other point metrics are used to evaluate the forecasts from such models. However, conflict processes are non-linear, so these point metrics often do not produce adequate evaluations of the calibration and sharpness of the forecast models. Forecast density evaluation improves the model evaluation. We review tools for density evaluation, including continuous rank probability scores, verification rank histograms, and sharpness plots. The usefulness of these tools for evaluating conflict forecasting models is explained. We illustrate this, first, in a comparison of several time series models' forecasts of simulated data from a Markov-switching process, and second, in a comparison of several models' abilities to forecast conflict dynamics in the Cross Straits. These applications show the pitfalls of relying on point metrics alone for evaluating the quality of conflict forecasting models. As in other fields, it is more useful to employ a suite of tools. A non-linear vector autoregressive model emerges as the model which is best able to forecast conflict dynamics between China and Taiwan. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.

The focus on technological advance also deflects attention from the substantial benefits available from combining present-day technology with behavioural change. Finally, difficult policy decisions will be necessary; the greatest benefits are associated with technological developments that will require major, and long-term, investment for their realisation, and there will be increasing conflict between environmental and noise goals.

We compare the forecasts obtained directly from the aggregated series based on its univariate model with the aggregation of the forecasts obtained for each component of the aggregate. Within this framework (first obtain the forecasts for the component series and then aggregate the forecasts), we try two different approaches: (i) generate forecasts from the multivariate dynamic factor model and (ii) generate the forecasts from univariate models for each component of the aggregate. In this regard, we provide analytical conditions for the equality of forecasts.The results are applied to quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) data of several European countries of the euro area and to their aggregated GDP. This will be compared to the prediction obtained directly from modeling and forecasting the aggregate GDP of these European countries. In particular, we would like to check whether long-run relationships between the levels of the components are useful for improving the forecasting accuracy of the aggregate growth rate. We will make forecasts at the country level and then pool them to obtain the forecast of the aggregate. The empirical analysis suggests that forecasts built by aggregating the country-specific models are more accurate than forecasts constructed using the aggregated data.

Understanding how road pricing affects freight activity is of significant interest to transport planners, port operators and commercial interests with regards to regional competitiveness and economic development. Using a unique survey of truck activity at two maritime terminals in the Port of New York and New jersey, we examine the frequency of truck trips, toll costs and trip distance, and how these characteristics may affect port freight costs and operations by location. Key findings indicate that while the New York ports serve 19 states and Canada, the vast bulk of cargo moves are short haul trips of less than 50 miles one way from the port facility. We also find that toll charges in the New York City metropolitan region may represent over 50% of the total costs for a short haul truck trip into or out of a maritime port depending on the location of the port facility. The results presented suggest that road toll programs can place non-trivial costs on truck trips to/from major regional freight centers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The AHP makes it possible to consider the multiple objectives of decision makers and allows public engagement to be deliberative, participatory, dynamic and flexible, which is independent of planning options. The method was specified and calibrated starting from a specific stated preferences survey, and its parameters were calibrated with respect to two scenarios: without any transport options and with real transport options. Different criteria (accessibility, travel safety, comfort, environment, landscape), subcriteria and corresponding indicators (qualitative, quantitative and dichotomous) were considered, and reciprocal weights were calibrated. Finally, a real planning scenario was implemented. Calibration results gave interesting insights into the public desires and expectations, made it possible to rank the different chosen criteria and sub-criteria and to understand the biases between preferences stated with or without transport options. The method can be easily updated and can be easily transferred to any case study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from 7200 adult respondents in the 2007 Los Angeles County Health Survey, a binary logistic regression model is tested to examine whether land use patterns and the built environment characteristics of residential neighborhoods are associated with one's probability of being obese. The result has shown that living in a neighborhood with higher household density, closeness to rail stations, and better bus services are associated with a lesser likelihood to be obese, which implies that people in a well-designed transit-oriented neighborhood tend to use active transportation modes to reach their daily activities and access transit services. Increased use of active transportation gives people an opportunity to engage in a moderate-level of exercise, so as to reduce their weight and enhance their health condition. This paper contributes an approach to analyze and estimate the health impact of an integrated land use-transportation plan. The model estimated in the paper can be used to analyze public health issues as a result of different land use policies, built environment improvements, and future demographic change.

This article seeks to analyze within the framework of public choice economics two phenomena arising from this development that are counterintuitive: What made Parliament voluntarily invite the judiciary to monitor its acts? Why has Parliament consistently complied with rulings of the Judicial House of Lords that challenged primary legislation over the last 10 years? It argues that the Act was designed in a way that fulfilled the electoral commitments of the enacting majority by supplying promised policies to its constituencies, while minimizing agency costs and information problems in favor of Parliament's corporate interests. Significantly, the Act left intact the veto powers of Parliament and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. As such, it disincentivized the Judicial House of Lords to risk costly overturns of its rulings by Parliament for straying too far from the range of the ideal policy positions spanned by Parliament and Strasbourg. Drawing from the empirical evidence of the past decade, it will be shown that in nearly all cases the Law Lords have either upheld the compatibility of challenged statutes, reaffirmed parliamentary preferences, or followed the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court.","Univ Oxford, Wolfson Coll, Oxford OX2 6UD, England",University of Oxford,"Ip, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Wolfson Coll, Linton Rd, Oxford OX2 6UD, England.",eric.ip@law.ox.ac.uk,,"Ip, Eric/0000-0001-9832-0288",,,,,93,3,5,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Over rolling periods, the degree and direction of the asymmetry in forecast loss functions are time-varying. While rationality under symmetric loss is often rejected, forecast rationality under asymmetric loss fails to be rejected over nearly all rolling periods. Besides, real output growth is consistently under-predicted in the 1990s, and the inflation rate is consistently over-predicted in the 1980s and 1990s. In general, inflation forecasts, especially for long horizons, exhibit greater levels of loss asymmetry in magnitude and frequency. The loss asymmetry of real output growth forecasts is more pronounced when the last revised vintage data are used than when the real-time vintage is used. All of these results hold for both the Greenbook and SPF forecasts. The results are also similar with the use of different sets of instrumental variables for estimating the asymmetric loss and testing for forecast rationality.

Motivated by this simple theoretical framework, I analyze the impact of a tort reform in Texas that mitigated malpractice liability. Consistent with the theory, the rate of cesarean sections among commercially insured mothers, for whom the procedure is considered profitable, increased by 2 percentage points relative to the rate of cesarean sections among mothers covered by Medicaid, for whom the procedure is thought to be unprofitable.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Shurtz, I (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.",,"Shurtz, Ity/AAB-2849-2021","Shurtz, Ity/0000-0002-9608-0767",,,,,31,19,23,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Currently conventional wisdom portrays T1D as a chronic T cell-mediated autoimmune disease that leads to the specific destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing cells. The process of cell destruction is accompanied (or preceded) by the production of autoantibodies (autoAb) to cell antigens (i.e. insulin, GAD65, IA-2 and ZnT8). These autoAb have proved to be instrumental in identifying subjects at risk of developing the disease prior to overt hyperglycemia, and they help to distinguish T1D from T2D patients (who have no autoAb), but are not deemed to be pathogenic. This review will examine to which extent this well-established disease-dogmas are sustained by experiments by nature, which should not suffer from the common biases and errors of experiments by humans.","[Clements, Michael P.] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Clements, Michael P.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Warwick; University of Oxford,"Clements, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",m.p.clements@warwick.ac.uk,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017","Clements, Michael/0000-0001-6329-1341",,,,,49,11,12,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

The study also finds that the state-owned equity shareholding proportion is positively related to tax aggressiveness, but the manager ownership shareholding proportion isn't.

The author revisits the different approaches discussed in the Global Commodity Chains (GCC), Global Production Networks (GPN) and World City Network (WCN) discourses and argues that synergies can be found if the WCN's firm-level argument is merged with the GCC and GPN's call for geographic embeddedness. This article lays out that a new bottom-up approach in the field of city network analysis can help investigating non-hub cities, taking a city's local economy and its ego-network as a starting point. Sudan's capital Khartoum serves as a test case and confirms that this approach leads to interesting findings. While Khartoum would score one of the lowest rankings in 'classic' connectivity audits, using a city's ego-network offers an alternative assessment that provides a better understanding Khartoum's status in the global petroleum industry.","Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Mans, U (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, Plantage Muidergracht 14-16, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",u.mans@uva.nl,,,,,,,44,22,24,4,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Although internet banking has been around for many years, increasing the use of the service by bank clients remains a priority for many managers of internet banking services. To address this managerial concern, the study investigates the factors that contribute to the enhanced use of internet banking by bank clients. Based on a literature review, internet-banking factors that could influence bank clients' actual use of internet banking were identified. Data were collected from 1 156 users of internet banking. The results of the study showed that two factors influence internet banking usage, namely internet banking facilitating conditions and internet banking risk beliefs. The more favourable internet banking facilitating conditions are perceived to be, the more likely bank clients are to increase their use of internet banking. On the other hand, the greater the perceived risks associated with internet banking, the less the chances are that clients will do their banking through the internet.

This requires further improvement in actuarial methods and their application in insurance practice. Improving the quality of premium calculation methods is an effective factor in reducing the insurance technical risk of an insurer. Presentation the methods of premium calculation and its permanent updating is the aim of this article. Credibility theory is an experience rating technique to determine premiums, claim frequencies or claim sizes. Credibility models are based on the realistic concept of a heterogeneous insurance portfolio. Therefore, two sources of information are used in the calculation of the credibility estimators for the individual risk: typically little knowledge about the individual risk and quite extensive statistical information about entire portfolio. The most important model in the credibility theory is Buhlmann-Straub model. This model has a wide range of possibilities to be used in praxis mainly in general insurance. Besides that this model is a basis for other more specific models such as hierarchical, multidimensional or regression credibility models. In this article we deal with generalisation of one-dimensional Buhlmann-Straub credibility model to the multidimensional credibility model. We mainly focus on estimation of so-called structural parameters and usage of SAS Enterprise Guide application when estimating. The multidimensional Buhlmann-Straub credibility model is applied based the real data in motor vehicle third party liability insurance.","[Pacakova, Viera; Linda, Bohdan] Univ Pardubice, Inst Math & Quantitat Methods, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic; [Soltes, Erik] Univ Econ, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Stat, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Pardubice; University of Economics Bratislava,"Pacáková, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Inst Math & Quantitat Methods, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",viera.pacakova@upce.cz; erik.soltes@euba.sk; bohdan.linda@upce.cz,"Linda, Bohdan/AGY-3210-2022",,,,,,9,6,6,0,13,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The effectiveness of some marketing practices oriented at customer relationships was thoroughly discussed in prior studies, however, there is little literature related to managerial aspects of dealing with networks as more complex relational structures. In this paper we Ely to minimize this gap by investigating the link between the knowledge about various business partners and quality of intra-organizational relationships, as well as customer relationship quality and company performance. We also study the moderating role of making special investments in business relations under pressure of economic slowdown as experienced by B2B companies in Slovenia. We use data gathered via face-to-face interviews and analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) to test hypothesized relationships between research constructs. Our study encourages marketing managers to intensify networking activities with regard to both, inter-firm social ties and codified knowledge about partnering firms. These both aspects of networking are conceptualized as interconnected building blocks of a focal company capability to gain benefits from the business network that surrounds it.","[Pfajfar, Gregor] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Mitrega, Maciej] Karol Adamiecki Univ Econ Katowice, Market & Mkt Res Dept, PL-40226 Katowice, Poland",University of Ljubljana; University of Economics in Katowice,"Pfajfar, G (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",gregor.pfajfar@ef.uni-lj.si; maciej.mitrega@ue.katowice.pl,"Mitrega, Maciej/AAV-7536-2020","Mitrega, Maciej/0000-0003-4043-5589",,,,,98,2,2,0,15,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Using a multiple regression analysis this paper therefore examines the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction in Slovakia by taking into consideration a time subscript. From the analysis, our findings indicate that there is a high correlation between the level of GDP, GNI and Household final consumption expenditure. It can be stated that only rarely (if ever) it is possible to reduce poverty without growth in GDP. On the other hand, economic growth does not necessarily lead to a decline in poverty.

This allows us to examine the evolution of loan performance throughout the period of economic and financial crisis. We document the shift in the distribution of loans across ratings as economic conditions deteriorated, but also show that this effect was heterogeneous across sectors. In panel data estimations, changes in employment across sectors are shown to be a leading indicator of loan performance, demonstrating the importance of the link between real economy demand and loan impairment. Levels of outstanding credit in a sector cannot explain current loan performance. However, in keeping with a growing literature on the dangers of post-boom debt overhang, we calculate a measure of excess credit using deviations from a long-run trend that is strongly associated with higher levels of current impairment. This provides new evidence on the effect of relaxed credit standards during a boom on crisis-era loan delinquency.","[Lawless, Martina; McCann, Fergal] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Lawless, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",martina.lawless@centralbank.ie; fergal.mccann@centralbank.ie,,"Lawless, Martina/0000-0002-3484-8670",,,,,17,4,5,0,12,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We analyze the optimal prize allocation for the contest designer who wishes to maximize either the total effort or the highest effort. It is shown that if the minimal effort constraint is relatively high, the winner-take-all contest in which the contestant with the highest effort wins the entire prize sum does not maximize the expected total effort or the expected highest effort.

Despite the growing importance of innovative products in contemporary entertainment (including interactive games), the informal' source of innovation has attracted limited attention. By closely looking at the idea exploration, generation and selection process (where creativity plays a major role), we intend to find out how values and public policy affect product innovation. This study shows that the value of Korean and UK online gaming firms (regardless of their different socio-economic contexts) plays an important role in generating product innovation. An additional point is that Korean firms are likely to take advantage of government policy support to overcome inadequate institutional settings in conjunction with the initial conditions of online game development.","[Tsang, Denise] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England; [Park, Younsuk] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England",University of Reading; University of Reading,"Tsang, D (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, POB 218, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England.",d.tsang@henley.ac.uk,,"Tsang, Denise/0000-0003-1671-5521",,,,,34,5,6,0,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The 23 counties were grouped into four clusters based on their degree of urbanization. Subsequently, a hybrid approach based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) was used to deal with incomplete information in prioritizing the strategies. The results showed that the focuses of decision makers in each county were different. For the counties in Cluster 1 (highly urbanized counties), the three top-ranked strategies were: improving the accessibility of non-motorized modes, improving Demand Response Transportation System (DRTS) services, and improving accessibility for elderly and handicapped persons. For the counties in Cluster 2 (rapidly developing counties), and Cluster 3 (developing counties with distinct urban and rural patterns), the three top-ranked strategies were: improving transit services, improving the accessibility of non-motorized modes, and improving DRTS services. For the counties in Cluster 4 (under developed counties), the focuses of decision makers were significantly different from the focuses of decision makers in other counties. The three top-ranked strategies were: promoting the use of electric motorcycles, improving DRTS services, and improving the accessibility of non-motorized modes.

The present paper focuses on inbound open strategies and reviews various approaches (transaction costs, competences, open innovation) dealing with firms' decisions about these strategies. The different approaches result in different conclusions about the optimum level of openness. They are tested empirically taking account of the different degrees of firms' openness (closed, semi-open, open, ultra-open) and their relationship with sales of new-to-the-market products, and using a panel of Spanish firms from a Community Innovation Survey type survey for the period 2004-2008. Our results show that closed and semi-open strategies are the most common among Spanish firms and that open strategies are associated with the best performance, while semi-open strategies are correlated to a higher performance than closed ones. These results hold across different subsamples based on firm size and industry, and are robust to different ways of defining the indicators and to different estimation methods.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Barge-Gil, A (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",abarge@ccee.ucm.es,"Barge-Gil, Andrés/K-5817-2014","Barge-Gil, Andrés/0000-0003-0208-3914",,,,,84,54,55,6,129,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

This problem is often bypassed by adopting the 'agnostic' option of equal weights, as in the human development index. This is an annual ranking of countries produced by the United Nations Development Programme based on life expectancy, education, and per capita gross national income. These three dimensions are now aggregated multiplicatively. Whatever weights (exponents) are chosen for these dimensions, some nations will feel disadvantaged. To avoid the use of arbitrary weights, we propose for consideration a two-step approach: (1) find the most advantageous set of weights for each nation in turn, and (2) regress the associated optimal scores on the underlying indicators to find a single weight set. This approach has the properties of non-subjectivity, fairness, and convenience. The result is that the highest weight is placed on the life expectancy dimension.","Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Business, Stat Serv & Consultancy Unit, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Tofallis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Business, Stat Serv & Consultancy Unit, Coll Lane, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",c.tofallis@herts.ac.uk,,"Tofallis, Christopher/0000-0001-6150-0218",,,,,37,39,43,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The paper finds that the cross elasticities when gas prices were less than $3 a gallon were small, with a magnitude of less than 0.05. When prices exceeded $3 a gallon, the elasticity was larger, in the range of 0.12-0.14, for the rail modes. In the summer of 2008 when prices exceeded $4 a gallon, there was considerable responsiveness with elasticities of 0.28-0.30 for city and suburban bus, and 0.37 for commuter rail.

Moreover, transport mobility may also play an important role in helping to satisfy inherent psychosocial needs which are deemed necessary for well-being, such as relating well with others, feelings of competence and mastery, and heightened autonomy. Exploring these relationships more fully is the focus of the current study. Based on responses from 435 participants from Melbourne, Australia, hierarchical regression analyses were undertaken to test whether transport mobility predicts subjective well-being as mediated by psychological well-being (N=435). Support was found for a full mediation model, whereby transport mobility predicted subjective well-being through the mediating variables of environmental mastery, positive relations with others and self acceptance. Thus, the impact and benefits of transport mobility extend to psychosocial factors related to well-being. Although additional work is needed to confirm these findings using varied samples and measurement approaches, this is a valuable outcome which provides some justification for developing policy and investing resources into improving transport mobility to promote highly desirable outcomes related to well-being.

We analyze loans to 11,000 Russian firms between 1996 and 2002 and ask whether the creditor's willingness to lend to a firm is affected by the quality of courts that protect the creditor's rights. We match each firm to the regional commercial court where the creditor would have to sue the firm if it defaulted. We use the share of the court's decisions that get appealed as an (inverse) proxy for court quality. First, we find that creditors make fewer loans when their rights are protected by courts with higher appeal rates. Second, banks respond more to court quality than other creditors (such as suppliers). Furthermore, firms that are younger and not owned by their creditors suffer more from poor courts. These latter findings suggest that creditors use reputation concerns and ownership as substitutes for courts in contract enforcement.","Univ Cambridge, Christs Coll, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Shvets, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Christs Coll, Cambridge, England.",js591@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,14,15,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

We study three commercialization channelssales, licensing and spin-off formationappearing in a sample of 858 university and PRO patents filed with the European Patent Office between 2003 and 2005 across 22 countries. To analyze differences in commercialization outcomes, this study employs a multivariate probit model. The results suggest that PRO ownership is negatively associated with the likelihood of selling the patent and creating an academic spin-off; university ownership positively affects the patent's licensing uses. Finally, the institutional IPR regime has a negative effect on the probability of selling a patent.","[Giuri, Paola; Munari, Federico; Pasquini, Martina] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Aziendali, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Munari, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Aziendali, Bologna, Italy.",federico.munari@unibo.it,"Giuri, Paola/K-9986-2015","Pasquini, Martina/0000-0002-4917-8470; GIURI, PAOLA/0000-0002-5633-0848",,,,,39,22,22,6,90,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Local policy makers intervene on rooted, complex and pre-existent relationships. Various are the agents, both collaborating and competing, involved in providing and buying freight distribution services. Retailers, transport providers and own-account agents are among the most important actors; they are all potentially characterized both by inter and intra agent heterogeneity in preferences. Heterogeneity in preferences, whenever present, has relevant implications for policy intervention. There is a knowledge gap related to the peculiarities of these agents' preferences and behavior, notwithstanding some recent attempts to bridge it, that call for a thorough agent-specific analysis. This paper focuses on urban freight distribution with specific reference to the impact that variations of policy characteristics (e.g. time windows, number of loading and unloading bays, entrance fees, etc.) might cause on own-account agents' behavior. It is important to underline that, de facto, own-account agents are among the least studied operators in this context. This lack of attention is mostly attributable to the toil needed to acquire relevant data to study their preferences and behavior. This lack of knowledge has favored the birth of a widely accepted presumption concerning their inefficiency that, in turn, has produced specifically targeted policies often hindering their activities. This paper reports the empirical results of a study conducted in the limited traffic zone in Rome's city center in 2009 thanks to a Volvo Research Foundation grant. The analysis is based on a comprehensive and representative data set including: 1) general information on the respondent, 2) company characteristics, and 3) stated ranking exercises. The ranking data were subsequently transformed in choice data. The paper describes own-account operators' preferences as they emerge from the stated ranking exercises and proposes a systematic comparison among them via willingness to pay measures. The compared estimates are derived under different assumptions concerning agents' preference heterogeneity. More in detail we discuss results assuming: 1) no heterogeneity (multinomial logit), 2) covariates-explained heterogeneity (multinomial logit including interactions with relevant socio-economic variables), 3) flexible heterogeneity (investigating the systematic and stochastic components of the utility function). Heterogeneity analysis, apart from relevant theoretical implications, has important poli cy repercussions in as much as it impacts on the willingness to pay measures of the policies implemented. An appropriate treatment of heterogeneity is therefore functional to obtaining undistorted and reliable policy forecasts to be fed to micro simulation models used to support the decision-making process. The paper: 1) addresses methodologically relevant issues, 2) uses a new, detailed and significant data set, 3) tackles policy relevant questions, 4) provides worthwhile information for policy-makers. The estimation of willingness to pay / willingness to accept measures for hypothetical policies sets a benchmark for policy makers and researchers alike.","[Marcucci, Edoardo; Gatta, Valerio] Univ Roma Tre, DIPES CREI, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Marcucci, E (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, DIPES CREI, Rome, Italy.",edoardo.marcucci@uniroma3.it,"marcucci, edoardo/AAJ-6539-2020; MArcucci, Edoardo/AAP-5143-2021","marcucci, edoardo/0000-0002-9813-3973; Gatta, Valerio/0000-0003-1631-1797",,,,,46,29,29,0,17,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Research reported in this paper, based mainly on detailed qualitative research in four English towns, argues that the complexities and contingencies that most people encounter in everyday life often make such behavioural change difficult. Attention is focused on three sets of factors: perceptions of risk; constraints created by family and household responsibilities; and perceptions of normality. It is suggested that unless such factors are tackled directly then policies to increase levels of walking and cycling will have limited success. In particular, it is argued that there needs to be a much more integrated approach to transport policy that combines interventions to make walking and (especially) cycling as risk-free as possible with restrictions on car use and attitudinal shifts in the ways in which motorists view other road users. Such policies also need to be linked to wider social and economic change which, in combination, creates an environment in which walking or cycling for short trips in urban areas is perceived as the logical and normal means of travel and using the car is viewed as exceptional.

A polytechnic, higher education reform took place in Finland in the 1990s. It gradually transformed former vocational colleges into polytechnics and also brought higher education to regions that did not have a university before. This expansion of higher education provides exogenous variation in the regional supply of higher education. The reform raised the mobility of high school graduates across local labour markets in the years after they had completed their secondary studies, which indicated increased mobility between high school and post-secondary education. We estimate that the reform enhanced the annual migration rate of high school graduates by 1.2 percentage points over a 3-year follow-up period. This represents a substantial increase, because their baseline migration rate is 3.7 %.

We found that noise and air pollution are place-based perception variables with a so-called halo effect: residents in wealthier neighborhoods do not perceive their environment as being highly polluted because of their higher sense of place. In addition, we found a counterintuitive positive sign for the effect of objective measures of pollutants on housing prices but a significantly negative effect of the subjective measures. For these reasons, we conclude that housing prices are better explained by subjective evaluation factors than by objective measurements.","[Chasco, Coro] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Le Gallo, Julie] Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, F-25030 Besancon, France",Autonomous University of Madrid; Universite de Franche-Comte,"Chasco, C (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Francisco Tomas & Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",coro.chasco@uam.es; jlegallo@univ-fcomte.fr,"Chasco, Coro/IUN-0313-2023; Le Gallo, Julie/F-9167-2018; Chasco, Coro/L-2577-2013","Chasco, Coro/0000-0001-8098-9979; Le Gallo, Julie/0000-0002-7296-2415; Chasco, Coro/0000-0001-8098-9979",,,,,66,61,63,2,73,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

In particular, we look for evidence of a chilling effect in minority yield rates (the probability of enrolling in a UC school conditional on being accepted) after Proposition 209. Using individual-level data on every freshman applicant to the UC system from 1995 to 2000, we find no evidence that yield rates fell for minorities relative to other students after Proposition 209, even after controlling for changes in student characteristics and changes in the set of UC schools to which students were admitted. In fact, our analysis suggests Proposition 209 had a modest warming effect. We investigate and rule out the possibility that this warming effect was driven by changes in the selection of students who applied to the UC, changes in financial aid or changes in minorities' college opportunities outside the UC system. Instead, we present evidence consistent with the idea that Proposition 209 increased the signaling value of attending UC schools for minorities.

Yet very little is known about the traffic initiated by the provision of these services. Particularly the role of firms in this context is an unexplored field of research. To know how firms influence the travel behaviour of their employees, is however crucial for public authorities and for development of political measures. The paper analyzes different types of travel behaviour and provides new perspectives on how firms affect this behaviour, focusing on the field of service-related traffic. Two different empirical data sets (from two German surveys) are used to reveal crucial predictors. These allow insight into the impact of firms on their employee's travel characteristics and patterns. In a first step, applying cluster analysis, we show that four types of travel behaviour exist, which differ significantly in their travel parameters. In a second step, using regression modelling, we provide evidence that internal structure, internal process as well as external structure have a significant impact on travel patterns and behaviour. Against the background of increasing road traffic, especially in urban areas, public authorities can use the results to understand and mitigate service-related traffic. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines the impact of this deregulation on the market structure and the operators' cost efficiency over the last ten years. First, we perform a qualitative before-and-after-deregulation analysis of Japan's bus market, finding that there has been little change in the structure of the Japanese bus market so far. Second, we investigate the effectiveness of the deregulation and internal organisational factors by using a dataset of publicly owned (municipal) bus companies. We estimate the total cost frontier functions in order to examine their effects, showing that it is the internal organisational factors (i.e. governance structure) that affect the operator's efficiency, not deregulation. In fact, the coefficient of subsidies to companies is positive, with statistical significance, thereby suggesting that cost efficiency decreases as the subsidy ratio increases. The coefficient of the contracting-out (MCGL) dummy also obtains statistically significant results: thus, we provide an account of how contracting out clearly improves operators' cost efficiency. The deregulation variable did not show significant results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The SEC has property rights to take away from foreign firms their discretion over what form of internationally-credible GAAP they must comply with in order to enter US securities markets. This takings decision is costly for foreign firms because it requires them to incur higher marginal audit fees associated with complying with US GAAP and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Utilising an argument developed by the property rights literature, a model is presented which assumes four participants: (a) Congress; (b) the SEC; (c) foreign based firms; and (d) audit firms, who compete for political influence over the determination of internationally credible-GAAP. The optimal audit fee compensation schedule required to be incurred by foreign based firms in order to produce internationally-credible GAAP financial reports is found to depend upon with which of these interest groups the SEC's preferences coincide. Evidence is provided which supports the proposition implied by the model that European firms overinvested in the audit expenditures required to comply with the US disclosure and legal requirements.","EDHEC, Dept Comptabilite Droit Finance & Econ, F-59057 Roubaix 1, France",Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Klumpes, PJM (通讯作者)，EDHEC, Dept Comptabilite Droit Finance & Econ, 24 Ave Gustave Delory,CS 50411, F-59057 Roubaix 1, France.",Paul.Klumpes@edhec.edu,"Klumpes, Paul/AAD-2596-2022","Klumpes, Paul/0000-0002-3357-6087",,,,,27,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Technical and cost efficiencies were obtained by using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Wood trait prices used to perform the cost efficiency corresponded to economic weights derived from a partial regression. These values were 1.1, 29.7, 0.3 and 0.4 NZ $/m(3) for small end diameter (cm), stiffness (GPa), basic density (kg/m(3)) and largest branch (mm) respectively. The most efficient logs were those with the highest difference between recovery value and price. There were positive and significant correlations between technical efficiency and wood stiffness (0.46, p<0.05) and between cost efficiency and log recovery value (0.85, p < 0.05). The most efficient logs had a ratio of 1:4 between stiffness and small end diameter whereas logs that did not generate structural lumber presented ratios close to 1:8. This information will inform the development of breeding objectives, and help segregating and pricing logs by using traits patterns that result in efficient logs for the production of structural wood.

However, documented Transportation Demand Management (TDM) practices at campuses are mostly from the developed world, and contrast markedly with Beirut, which lacks an organized public transport sector and effective law enforcement. Further, the AUB campus population comes from wealthier households and has higher car ownership compared to the rest of Lebanon. Thus, conventional strategies such as subsidizing transit passes and restricting or pricing parking are not perceived to be appropriate solutions for AUB and many other developing world cases. We examine five American campuses to learn: What are the impacts of increasing campus parking supply? How can transit be promoted without an organized public transit sector? And, how can we incentivize a high-income campus population to use campus transit services? Lessons for AUB are: campus transport services do not always stem from existing public transport services - some campuses have successfully initiated their own transport services; designing a campus transport service catered to the target population can be extremely effective for example in dealing with high-income clients; and ridership on mass transport systems is partly dependent on driving disincentives such as limited, priced parking. Based on these findings, we propose a new mobility solution at AUB, dynamic taxi-sharing, and present preliminary mode shift survey data indicating a potential market and positive reductions in vehicle trips.

Competencies are not only a central part of the strategy process of a company. Corporate Strategy literature states that that human asset in particular can fulfil the criterion' of a sustainable competitive advantage' (Storey, 2007). The utilization of competencies is a key target of companies, as it is important in realizing a full return on investment. The paper analyses the state-of-the-art of competence theories with a specific recognition to the aspect of social capital. The author argues that the management of company competencies is a contributor to the utilization of competencies and links these aspects to social capital. In order to achieve the main goal of the underlying work the paper is structured as follows: first, the presentation of the state of the art in the area of competencies and social capital based on literature review; afterwards, the discussion is made in order to prove the main hypothesis. As a result the author concludes with a model showing the key bond between company competencies, individual competencies and social capital. With this, the paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of competencies for business managers and scientist. The findings are valuable to contribute to the utilization of individual competencies especially in the prism of social capital which will pay off for industrial companies and employees in long term.

The financial institutions limit the loans granted due to the lack of guaranties. The research aims to analyse the way in which granting public financial aids for the start-ups, helps to improve the efficiency of these institutions by strengthening their competitiveness and their ability to survive in environments of economic slowing down. The research conducted an empirical analysis on a sample of companies with less than three years of age that have accessed to Mutual Guarantee Companies (MGC's) (2.218) and others that have accessed to the Spanish Official Credit Institute - Small and Medium Enterprises (SME's) ICO Line - (10,018). Meanwhile, a representing group of companies who have obtained financial aids has been extracted from the Sistema de Analisis de Balances Ibericos (SABI) database. The definition of these groups allows the application of a counterfactual methodology, which aims to detect the possible causal relationship between public aids and business performance by verifying the existence of significant differences in the efficiency variables. Considering the efficiency variables (profitability), the companies that have received public financial aids optimized it by maintaining a higher outperform than the obtained by the rest. However, the evolution of the companies backed by Mutual Loan-Guarantee Societies is effective during the period that they receive the aid, but once the funds are repaid the companies are positioned below the market levels. These results confirm that the aids granted by a MLGS get to overcome the barriers of accessing financing, while the ICO aids, due to the optimal results obtained, do not seem to fulfil this purpose.","[Crecente Romero, Fernando; Cano Ventas, Felipe; Garcia Barrio, Alberto; Ramon Torres, Santiago] Univ Alcala de Henares, E-28801 Alcala De Henares, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,,fernando.crecente@uah.es,"Romero, Fernando FCR Crecente/H-9547-2015","Romero, Fernando FCR Crecente/0000-0001-5728-1059",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,144,154,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100015,0

The work of the statutory auditor viewed with increasing distrust, so the legislative responded with new laws and directives to raise quality in audits. Aim of the research is to prove if there a standardized understanding of quality in the profession of auditors. After analysing important aspects in quality theories according to business administrations, service quality and quality in audits it was clarified that no single area of business economics offers a uniform definition or approach to the term quality. Neither the profession of auditors, nor the legislative which passes new laws and regulations stating by this, a higher quality will be reached, have a uniform view of quality. However, this is absolutely necessary for a uniform and broad understanding of quality, because quality in audits must be more than to do our jobs rightly (cf. Pfitzer, 2006, p. 187). For this reason, the author developed a New model of quality development of auditing companies, named the AuditCompanies-QualityDevelopment-Model (AC-QDModel). To fulfil all the expectations of the different receivers of audit services, all legal and professional requirements as well as one's own expectations, a model of audit quality has to be developed, that is very broad. As the term also needs to take into account the regulations mandated by law and by professionals, it must consider aspects of product-based, of manufacturing-based and user-based approaches (cf. Garvin, 1988, p. 319). Expert Interviews have been conducted to support the theoretical approach and literature review. In this paper the author focuses on all components of this new model and presents the possibility for the companies to design their individual quality model.","[Hahne, Gabriele] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,ghahne@wp-hahne.de,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,268,279,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100026,0

The role of regulation in the light of the EU's ladder of investment theory is investigated, along with the impact of NGA investments on price and service competition and consequently on the performance of operators. The main finding is that the regulatory failure (Le. delays) in enforcing local loop unbundling (LLU) at entry stimulating prices de facto has in fact induced huge Greenfield investments in fibre by the alternative operator, and as a response by the incumbent as well. The stiff price competition in the absence of new service competition has put in danger the performance of the operators which are, given the regulatory uncertainty of the recently imposed NGA regulatory regime, reluctant to further invest in fibre.","[Hrovatin, Nevenka; Cibic, Damir; Svigelj, Matej] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Hrovatin, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",nevenka.hrovatin@ef.uni-lj.si; damir.cibic@ef.uni-lj.si; matej.svigelj@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,72,1,1,0,12,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Then the environmental tax reform in the Czech Republic is examined when the theory is supplemented by authors' own knowledge. At present the. environmental taxation belongs to important tools of the state fiscal policy to gain further state budget income, to improve the environment and also to implement the concept of sustainable development. The principles of the environmental tax reform, which are researched in the paper, must be followed to accomplish these. In the next part of the paper the research results on the environmental taxation influence on households in the Czech Republic are presented and the focus is to determine the awareness of Czech households about environmental taxes. The Czech households reactions to the environmental taxes introduction are also researched. Important results of the performed survey of a hundred and two households are analysed in the paper. The paper also analyses and evaluates environmental taxation in relation to businesses operating in the Czech Republic. A survey of a hundred and ninety-three firms was carried out for this purpose. The results showed serious facts mainly concerning the awareness and reactions of Czech businesses to the Czech tax system ecologization.

Forests can sequester carbon from the atmosphere and provide biomass, which can be used to substitute for fossil fuels or energy-intensive materials. International climate policies favor the use of wood to substitute for fossil fuels rather than using forests as carbon sink. We examine the trade off between sequestering carbon in forests and substituting wood for fossil fuels in Finland. For Finland to meet its EU targets for the use of renewable energy by 2020, a considerable increase in the use of wood for energy is necessary. We compare scenarios in which the wood energy targets are fully or partially met to a reference case where policies favoring wood based energy production are removed. Three models are used to project fossil fuel substitution and changes in forest carbon sinks in the scenarios through 2035. Finnish forests are a growing carbon sink in all scenarios. However, net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be higher in the medium term if Finland achieves its current wood energy targets than if the use of energy wood stagnates or decreases. The volume of GHG emissions avoided by replacing coal, peat and fossil diesel with wood is outweighed by the loss in carbon sequestered in forests due to increased biomass removals. Therefore, the current wood energy targets seem excessive and harmful to the climate. In particular, biodiesel production has a significant, negative impact on net emissions in the period considered. However, we did not consider risks such as forest fires, wind damage and diseases, which might weaken the sequestration policy. The potential albedo impacts of harvesting the forests were not considered either. (C) 2013 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

In a modern approach the brand should be treated as a complex entity. The author argues that a modern approach goes beyond its traditional definition of a brand in its visual features acting as a differentiating device. A modern approach to brand conceptualisation is essential to be taken on board due to changing market conditions. Although branding principles were developed for product brands, which have traditionally been equated with branding phenomena, the principles can also be transferred to other brand categories: services, organisations and destinations. However, adjustments in emphasis stemming from particular characteristics of services, organisations and destinations are needed.","[Konecnik Ruzzier, M.] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Ruzzier, M.] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, SI-6000 Koper, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Primorska,"Konecnik Ruzzier, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",maja.konecnik@ef.uni-lj.si; mitja.ruzzier@fm-kp.si,"Ruzzier, Mitja/S-8193-2018","Ruzzier, Mitja/0000-0003-3367-6624",,,,,79,0,0,0,16,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In the situation of long and officially latent crisis there is a change of financing organization in the country. It includes a change in Federal budget expenditures on education, organizational changes in the quantity and structure of higher education institutions, the introduction of efficiency standards for activity of institutes and universities. So the main purpose of the paper is to analyze problems and prospects of higher education system transformation in Russia and develop proposals for the removal of problems identified. Methodology. Positive and normative analyses are used. The concept of state regulation of economy is a foundation of the investigation. Results: Solution of the reforming of higher education should be sought not on the way a significant reduction the number of higher education institutions. The high level of the population education - it is not only an investment to lift the domestic economy, but it is also a necessary condition for human potential development, so - for the country welfare. Reformation of the education system of the Russian Federation is carried out without considering the needs of society, which is manifested in the absence of a positive effect. However, comparison of the reform program with the changes of consumer preferences, market demands, as well as indicators and characteristics of educational institutions, will help to achieve a positive result. It is necessary to create of common educational websites, which will contain information actual at present on all courses of the higher school. Besides, much attention has to is paid to creation of the imitating models working as in real time, and in limited temporary terms in the various directions of training. Such approach will allow students to form necessary practical and professional skills which aren't fully formed at existing education system and practically are not realized in the traditional distance learning system.","[Maidan, Tatiana; Podolyanets, Lada; Porokhova, Anastasiya] Saint Petersburg State Univ Serv & Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",,,tatyana_maidan@mail.ru,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,423,431,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100039,0

Virtual cooperation is not dependent on the person of a manager but on communication which is ensured by various communication technologies. A part of methods used to lead a virtual team is identical with those which are used in conventional teams. Except for them, a manager is forced to focus more at team members and mutual communication because when working at a distance, they face obstacles in the form of anonymity and a more demanding task to build confidence in a team. Thus, in specialized literature, there is described in detail how to manage virtual teams, how to build environment of confidence, how to communicate effectively and how to solve difficulties which come with this type of cooperation. All the recommendations are meant to help managers to better knowing of issues concerning teams working mostly in virtual environments. On the basis of theoretical findings, we stated main starting points of our research. The aim was to find out which methods are used by managers leading a virtual team, whether specialized literature was helpful or whether they rather used their intuition and empathy. The survey was carried out with the help of questionnaires in an electronic form in Czech and English languages and the questionnaire consisted either of closed questions for recording statistical and demographic data, and open questions which were directed towards methods of team management and towards means of communication. For gathering data, the snowball technique was used. For our survey, there were gained altogether 20 respondents from 8 countries. The evaluated data show that virtual teams' management is for most interviewees rather a matter of intuition and that they do not consult specialized literature to a great extent. On the other hand, the choice of communication means for particular situations corresponds with descriptions in specialised literature. On the basis of gathered data, we take the liberty to suggest a recommendation for managers working with virtual teams.","[Pavlisova, Lucie; Seitlova, Klara] Univ Palackeho Olomouci, Filozoficka Fak, Katedra Aplikovane Ekon, Olomouc 77180, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,,lucie.pavlisova0710@gmail.com; klara.seitlova@upol.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,18,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87533-05-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,121,128,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349887500015,0

More specifically, after examining the trend in agricultural land average prices, both in current and constant terms, the dynamic formulation of Shift and Share Analysis (DSSA) was carried out, in order to check the growth gap between the average prices in the Sicilian provinces and the correspondent regional ones over the period, and trying to identify its causes also on the basis of the relationship between land values and the agro-food markets dynamics in the investigated period. The analysis of average land values shows a positive trend in current terms, but a steady erosion in constant values. The application of DSSA highlights that the average land values expressed in current prices have a positive market dynamics (except for the province of Palermo), but lower than the overall regional trend, whereas Agrigento and Ragusa growth rates are higher than the regional one. On the contrary, the analysis in real terms shows a heavily erosive dynamics of provincial average prices which is more marked than the overall regional one, with the exception of Agrigento where the negative growth rate is lower than the overall trend. The analysis also measured the growth differential between the dynamics of the average values for each crop typology and the overall regional trend. More specifically, the study pointed out the dichotomy characterising the Sicilian land market in the period 1992-2010: on the one hand, the positive data of arable and horticultural crops and, to a lesser extent, permanent grassland due to a good structural framework capable of absorbing the shortcomings at local level, on the other hand, negative growth differential recorded for tree crops, due almost exclusively to substantial structural weaknesses.","[Schimmenti, Emanuele; Asciuto, Antonio; Borsellino, Valeria; Galati, Antonino] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento DEMETRA, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Mandanici, Santi] Econ & Polit Agr, Bari, Italy",University of Palermo,"Schimmenti, E (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento DEMETRA, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",emanuele.schimmenti@unipa.it,"Asciuto, Antonio/ABB-3819-2020; Asciuto, Antonio/IAM-2785-2023; Galati, Antonino/H-5838-2012; Borsellino, Valeria/M-1482-2015; Schimmenti, Emanuele/L-8917-2015","Galati, Antonino/0000-0003-0753-2934; Borsellino, Valeria/0000-0002-6570-2156; Schimmenti, Emanuele/0000-0001-7376-7606",,,,,24,1,1,0,2,MEDIMOND S R L,40128 BOLOGNA,"VIA MASERATI 5, 40128 BOLOGNA, 00000, ITALY",,,978-88-7587-690-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,167,177,,,,,,11,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BA8IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338155900016,0

Those claims contradict real-world experiences in search. They demonstrate competitors efforts to compete not by investing in efficiency, quality, or innovation, but by using antitrust law to punish the successful competitor.

The Camp David agreements, the siege of Mecca, the Iranian Revolution and the occupation of Afghanistan not only closed a long historical cycle during which left-wing ideas were, by and large, dominant in the entire region. The interpretation of these events poses a serious challenge to historians today because of the massive gap between their complex causes (and internal chronology) and their outcomes. In order to read the extremely short period separating 1978 from 1980, a historian has to look first backwards in order to underline the importance of structural dynamics and dynamics of change in these different countries, and then to look forwards in order to understand their outcomes, without necessarily being able to link these two time-scales.","Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France",,"Bozarslan, H (通讯作者)，Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France.",Hamit.Bozarslan@ehess.fr,,,,,,,9,4,5,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

In recent years, however, variance filters have provided a fairly simple tool for rejecting the existence of price-fixing, with the added advantage that the methodology requires only a low volume of data. In this paper we analyze two aspects of variance filters: (i) the relationship that can be established between market structure and price rigidity, and (ii) the use of different benchmarks for implementing the filters. This paper addresses these two issues by applying a variance filter to a gasoline retail market that is characterized by a set of unique features. Our results confirm the positive relationship between monopoly and price rigidity, and confirm the variance filter's ability to detect non-competitive behavior when an appropriate benchmark is used. Our findings should serve to promote the implementation of this methodology among competition authorities, albeit in the awareness that a more exhaustive complementary analysis is required.","[Luis Jimenez, Juan] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Perdiguero, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, IREA, Dept Polit Econ, Grp Recerca Governs & Mercats GiM, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Barcelona,"Jiménez, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Despacho D 2-12 Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",jljimenez@daea.ulpgc.es; jordi.perdiguero@ub.edu,"Perdiguero, Jordi/K-8460-2017","Perdiguero, Jordi/0000-0003-0562-4181; Jimenez Gonzalez, Juan Luis/0000-0002-3808-2588",,,,,41,19,21,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Several particular results are searched: which ports are currently rising or dwindling in throughput; how is the structure of their network dynamics; and how to describe the resemblances and differences between these two transport patterns. In a densely connected logistic scheme, like the current maritime transport network, classic statistical techniques cannot show an accurate measure of the regional and global importance of a port or a route, within the deeply interrelated global market. The influence of a given harbor must be put in relation with the whole set of the network nodes. Standard statistic tools also cannot explain the chronological evolution of a complex system such this, needed of an importance metric and a proper visualization treatment. Graph theory provides powerful mathematical tools in order to achieve such requirements. Several calculations (degree and centrality) can be performed on each node, in order to describe clearly the structure and evolution of the complex system formed by ports of call and routes performed between them. Besides this, new software representation tools, like Gephi and Tulip, allow the immediate and deep comprehension of the relations between all the elements of the graph computed, and the temporal evolution of the whole network. In this paper we will apply these methodologies to the entire database of containership and general cargo vessel positions in three periods: March 2008-February 2009, March 2009-February 2010 and March 2010-February 2011. The relevance of the time intervals for this analysis, in terms of length and immediacy, will lead us to an accurate and dynamic diagnostic for the evolution during the crisis years in the transport patterns of the two traffics considered.

We find that new health events affect the accumulation of unsecured debt. Our estimates suggest that new health events increase unsecured debt by 6.3% ($230) to 9.3 % ($339); approximately 20% of the increase in unsecured consumer debt comes from OOP when experiencing new health events.

A survey of 225 US university students composing a culturally diverse sample revealed that these social norms and network variables have interactive effects on credit card overspending. Specifically, the results show that the perceptions that young adult consumers have about important others' credit card debt impact their overspending using credit cards when they feel that they are expected to consume at the same level as important others in shared experiences, and when they are strongly connected to these individuals.","[Sotiropoulos, Veneta] New York Inst Technol, New York, NY USA; [d'Astous, Alain] HEC Montreal, PhD Program, Montreal, PQ, Canada",New York Institute Technology; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Sotiropoulos, V (通讯作者)，New York Inst Technol, New York, NY USA.",vsotirop@nyit.edu; alain.dastous@hec.ca,,,,,,,60,29,35,2,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

But governance rules, central authority, scale of membership, and scope of activity vary across time and organizations. Furthermore, unlike citizens of federally organized nation-states, individual members are rarely direct (voting) members of confederal organizations. I present a simple model of public goods provision under the threat of exit showing that distributive conflict over the appropriate balance between the gains from cooperation available in confederal organizations with the loss of control for individual groups can explain this variation in governance as well as the infrequent enfranchisement of the rank-and-file at the confederal level. I illustrate my conclusions with a comparative examination of the origins and development of the Knights of Labor and American Federation of Labor.

We show that, under general conditions, including a perfect annuity market with actuarially fair return, imposing the optimum fertility rate and the optimum survival rate leads the competitive economy to the optimum steady state.

We incorporate into a standard mandated-benefit model social tolerance of gender-based discrimination, showing that the optimal length of maternity leave depends on it. The less tolerant a society is of gender-based discrimination, the longer the maternity leave it will mandate. Relying on recent research in psychology and linguistics according to which patterns in languages offer a window into their speakers' dispositions, we collected new data on the number of gender-differentiated personal pronouns across languages to capture societies' attitudes toward gender-based discrimination. We first confirm, using within-country language variation, that our linguistic measure is correlated with attitudes toward gender-based discrimination. Then, using cross-country data on length of maternity leave, while controlling for other parameters, we find a strong correlation between our language-based measure of attitudes and the length of maternity leave.","[Givati, Yehonatan; Troiano, Ugo] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Givati, Y (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,50,29,31,0,29,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Yet they are regularly subjects of folksongs, novels, and movies. In these outlets they are presented as folk heroes despite their crimes. Sociological explanations for this phenomenon based upon Eric Hobsbawm's concept of the social bandit and psychological explanations based upon myth building have been brought forth to explain the seeming contradiction. We propose an alternative explanation for the bandit hero phenomenon. We argue that bandits, acting solely in their own self-interest, unintentionally provide valuable services to societies under the rule of a predatory government. We identify three separate mechanisms by which bandits benefit society that do not necessarily hinge upon class struggles or historical dialectics. The social benefits that bandits generate form the foundation for their positive reception.","[Curott, Nicholas A.; Fink, Alexander] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Curott, NA (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, MSN 3G4,4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",ncurott@gmu.edu; afink2@gmu.edu,,,,,,,80,12,13,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Specifically, the relationship between public and private funds received by Spanish NGOs and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the period 2003-2007 is analyzed. The methodology is based on two analyses, one graphic and the other econometric, applied to a sample of 69 NGDOs, obtained from Directories of the Spanish NGDO Coordinating Committee. Results conclude that per capita GDP influences positively the fundraising activity of Spanish NGDOs. Furthermore, there is a substitution effect between public and private funds obtained by the NGDOs. Finally, the basic profile for a Spanish NGDO is that of a small or medium organization with a religious motivation that develops its work through volunteers with a legal form of association.","[Diaz-Foncea, Millan] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Direcc & Org Empresas, Fac Econ & Empresa, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Gomez-Quintero, Juan David] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Psicol & Sociol, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Trabajo, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Gimeno Lazaro, Tomas] Univ Zaragoza, Grp Estudios Sociales & Econ, Tercer Sect, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Díaz-Foncea, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Direcc & Org Empresas, Fac Econ & Empresa, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",llan@unizar.es; jdgomez@unizar.es; tgime-no@unizar.es,"Quintero, Juan David Gomez/AAA-3230-2019; Diaz-Foncea, Millan/IAP-4516-2023","Quintero, Juan David Gomez/0000-0002-2036-7817;",,,,,11,1,1,0,7,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Furthermore, it examines the implications of the Directive on the economic sector of the European Union, by focusing on the Directive's impact on EU competitiveness and other EU policies such as the Lisbon Strategy. This analysis is motivated by the following questions: what are the monetary costs of creating and maintaining the proposed database for data retention? What are the effects of these measures on individuals? What obstacles arise for the global competitiveness of EU telecommunications and electronic communications service providers as a result of these measures?

To address the gap, the impact of built environment characteristics such as population density, land use arrangements, and access to public transit on body mass index (BMI) is assessed for 207 older adults (age 50 and older) in Erie County, New York. A particular focus of inquiry is how frequency of driving and access to public transportation and the degree to which various urban forms provide support for these mode choices relate to BMI for older adults. Socio-demographic data and information about individuals' health is collected using a random survey of older adults; data about the built environment is calculated for the surroundings of each respondent's home using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Results from ordinary least squares regression models suggest that BMI of older adults may be more influenced by personal characteristics age, sex, physical functionality and neighborhood socioeconomic factors share of population within the respondents' census tract that is white, and median household income than by neighborhood land use and frequency of driving. Access to public transportation measured by the density of nearby bus stops exhibits an inverse and statistically significant relationship with BMI among older adults, suggesting that transportation access may play a greater role in the overall activity levels and BMI of older adults.

Around half of the population is purported to live within one mile of the 20,000 km Network. Traffic-free paths (separated from the public highway away from motor traffic) form about one third of the Network but account for around 80% of trips. The importance of NCN urban traffic-free paths in encouraging people to cycle is often assumed but despite large aggregate datasets characterising users, there is no research on the effects on the local communities which they serve. This paper presents research which aimed to identify the contribution of a typical section of NCN urban traffic-free path in encouraging cycling for everyday travel amongst a community living adjacent to this type of intervention. First, the paper outlines the characteristics of the NCN, the philosophy behind the development of urban traffic-free paths and the barriers to cycling which such interventions seek to overcome. Then findings of a controlled cross-sectional survey of two neighbourhoods in a medium size town in the English Midlands (which are demographically similar except that one is located adjacent to a section of NCN urban traffic-free cycle path intervention) are discussed. In conclusion the paper reveals that provision of NCN urban traffic-free cycle paths alone may be insufficient in encouraging a shift from car to cycling for everyday travel purposes. The data from the study corroborates evidence that suggests that a wider co-ordinated multi-faceted approach to promoting cycling is required which combines social marketing with physical measures including; wider speed restrictions in urban areas, investment in high quality segregated cycle facilities on major roads, and general land use and transport policies that 'advantage cycling' and reduce the convenience of the car.

This is accomplished through a reward system that seems largely to mimic the institutional devices used in other domains, such as intellectual property rights, by defining a proper set of incentives. Precisely the described solution relies on creating a specific economic framework able to foster economies of scale and grant a valuable property right over a specific litigation to an entrepreneurial individual, who in exchange provides the venture capital needed for the legal action, and produces inputs and focal points for amending regulations. In this light, aggregate litigation thus can be equally seen as an incubator for regulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Consumer mobility within city centres is encouraged to facilitate flows of consumption capital and generate consumer spending. Contextualised by international border studies and related EU integration policies, the Van Heekplein redevelopment project in Enschede, the Netherlands, is discussed here to scrutinise the redevelopment focus on economic flows in city centres. The paper brings to the fore how European border studies speak to city centre plans and their redevelopment focus resulting in a critique for ignoring the social production of borders. To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of consumer (im)mobility in city centres and processes of bordering, the paper proposes a perspective on borders as spatial folds. Analysing four types of folding the folding of bodies, forces, knowledge and the outside provides both a much more dynamic and kaleidoscopic picture of city centres and their users and a more comprehensive understanding of border perceptions and experiences and related practices of shoppers. Such an analytical perspective and approach not only seems of interest for border-related studies and policies at the urban level but also at the European level.","Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Spierings, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",B.Spierings@uu.nl,,,,,,,27,7,7,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Organizational culture (OC) has been defined as a pattern of basic assumptions that are manifested by the behavior of an organization. Positive OC is considered to be catalytic to performance enhancement. As construction aspires to be an efficient industry, this study aims to contribute in this regard by examining the relationship between organizational culture and the performance of construction organizations. Artifacts corresponding to OC identifiers and Performance indicators are short-listed from a literature review. These artifacts are arranged into constructs. The eight OC constructs are: Goal Clarity, Coordination and Integration, Conflict Resolution, Employee Participation, Innovation Orientation, Performance Emphasis, Reward Orientation and Team orientation. The performance indicator constructs are; Financial, Internal Business Process, Custom and Innovation & Learning. The artifacts were elaborated and operationalized for data collection. The constructs, as well as the OC-Performance relationship framework, were then analyzed and tested using Structural Equation Modeling. Innovation was found to be the most critical OC as far as performance of construction organizations is concerned. In today's knowledge based society, innovative organizations have proved to be the performers. This timely finding highlights the need for a culture that fosters creativity and supports innovation.","[Cheung, Sai On; Wong, Peter S.

We use our methods to characterize daily volatility spillovers across US stock, bond, foreign exchange and commodities markets, from January 1999 to January 2010. We show that despite significant volatility fluctuations in all four markets during the sample, cross-market volatility spillovers were quite limited until the global financial crisis, which began in 2007. As the crisis intensified, so too did the volatility spillovers, with particularly important spillovers from the stock market to other markets taking place after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers in September 2008.

While traditional views often hold that Chinese firms rely heavily on organizational proximity with parent companies and foreign customers to gain access to knowledge, we aim for insights into whether localized learning mechanisms based on informal social relations have emerged in the region after more than thirty years of industrialization. Based on a questionnaire survey of 359 innovative electronics firms, this paper demonstrates that firms which use social proximity to foster innovation are emerging in the PRD, and that it is mainly applied by domestic firms as a 'spying device' to catch up with the latest technology and market preference in order to trigger new product ideas. Nevertheless, the achievements of product innovation performance made by applying social proximity in interactive learning are fairly small, which underpins the instability of the trust-based interactive learning between firms in the region. The results of the paper provide insight into the development stage of the regional innovation system in the Pearl River Delta, calling upon an effective governance infrastructure to be put in place to stabilize interactive learning on the local scale.","[Fu, Wenying] S China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Gungazhou, Peoples R China; [Schiller, Daniel; Diez, Javier Revilla] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Wirtschafts & Kulturgeog, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",South China Normal University; Leibniz University Hannover,"Fu, WY (通讯作者)，S China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Zhongshan W Rd 55, Gungazhou, Peoples R China.",ferlicity31@163.com; schiller@wigeo.uni-hannover.de; diez@wigeo.uni-hannover.de,"Schiller, Daniel/A-1553-2019; Revilla Diez, Javier/J-2392-2019","Revilla Diez, Javier/0000-0003-2065-1380; Fu, Wenying/0000-0002-5617-4718; Schiller, Daniel/0000-0002-8312-0547",,,,,58,4,4,2,36,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

The European Commission established the general guidelines, and each state was free to establish its own architecture of funding programs respecting the imposed guidelines.

Most quantitative studies focus on the macroeconomic level. Microeconomic studies are scarce internationally and even more so in the case of China. Based on a survey of innovative firms located in China, this study assesses the importance of human capital in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to China. Using a sample of 77 innovative firms, and logistic estimation techniques, we concluded that even though human capital does not constitute a direct factor in attracting FDI to China, it is a positive indirect factor through firms' R&D efforts. Moreover, we found that connections with universities have a positive impact on the attraction of FDI, although the impact of human capital on the attraction of FDI is not sustained on the basis of additional contacts with universities. Evidence gathered suggests that it is important that public authorities recognize the interconnections between education and innovation policies and the implementation of FDI policies - human capital is only capable of attracting innovative foreign capital when associated with high levels of R&D.","[Teixeira, Aurora A.

The author has assumed that interpretation and definition of the price bubble morphology depends on identifying the synergic effect of individual actions. In his opinion, the descriptive model of defining the price bubble phenomenon is not essentially useful since it does not reach the core of this problem. Therefore it seems necessary to interpret the price bubble diversity through identifying the causes of their appearance and vaporisation as well as the nature of their inter-relationships, including any feedbacks. The useful research instruments proved to be the construction of idealized models of price bubble rise and collapse as well as a 'reverse bubble' model. It was assumed that the interpretation and definition of nomological variations between price bubbles requires discarding some basic assumptions of the orthodox economic theory. The causes of price bubble occurrence have been classified into four main groups, based on human choice constraints, namely the material, economic, institutional and psychological constraints.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Management & Tourism, Dept Microecon, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Tyc, W (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Management & Tourism, Dept Microecon, Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.",waldemart@onet.eu,"Cataldi, Antonio/AAM-7411-2021; Tyc, Waldemar/U-1236-2018","Tyc, Waldemar/0000-0002-5368-7964",,,,,20,0,0,1,10,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

A survey with a sample of 148 operators selected by stratified sampling was undertaken in two provinces: Mazandaran and Gilan. Stepwise regression analysis and path analysis were used to determine the influence of exogenous factors, farm and farmer characteristics, and the characteristics of innovations upon the adoption of IPM. Analyses revealed that IPM adoption behaviours were influenced by external factors as well as the gender, knowledge, and experience level of farmers; soil quality; access to information; mechanization level; and the feasibility of technologies. Finally, consideration of these variables as determinant factors in a 'targeted policy approach' is recommended to increase the sustainable use and widespread adoption of clean technologies for cleaner production.","Shahid Beheshti Univ, Dept Agroecol, GC, Tehran, Iran",Shahid Beheshti University,"Veisi, H (通讯作者)，Shahid Beheshti Univ, Dept Agroecol, GC, Tehran, Iran.",h.veisi@hotmail.com,"Veisi, Hadi/U-6057-2019","Veisi, Hadi/0000-0003-4484-8559",,,,,40,27,30,1,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Chile has substituted a funding system for the Defined-Benefit Pay As You Go (PAYG) pension system completely, and become the typical example of the privatization of social security. The United Kingdom has transformed the State Earnings Related Pension schemes into a part-funding system through the Contract-out policy. Continuing with the conventional route, Australia has become one of the few countries which have formed a unique pension system that mainly contains the zero & the second pillar. Sweden has reformed the PAYG system to a Non-Financial Defined Contribution (NDC) system. This paper makes an evaluation of the real effect of the current pension system of the four countries. From the perspective of profit, the real rate of return of the funding is often higher than the internal rate of return of PAYG. But if we take the total operating cost & transforming fees into consideration, the advantage of the Financial Defined Contribution (FDC) may not be that obvious. The market risk of funding system will be much higher than the PAYG as we use the coefficient of variation and VAR model to test. The NDC system in Sweden doesn't perform as well as the old PAYG in both the aspects of profit and risk aversion. Based on the essence of pension, which aims at poverty alleviation and providing a secure and stable income expectation for the elderly, and the feasibility of financial sustainability, we propose that we establish a pension system with PAYG as the main body, and other tier (such as FDC) as a supplement to the basic part. That can be a rational choice for the construction of the national pension system in the post-crisis era.","[Zhao Qing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,6,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89414-036-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,687,693,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316628500063,0

A review of rail PPPs over the last 30 years shows that some of them have failed, almost as though there was a curse on railway PPPs. Despite the evidence of risks 'associated with PPPs in the rail sector, the publicly owned French rail infrastructure manager (RFF) launched two major PPPs and a very large concession between 2010 and 2012. This decision was taken at the request of the government which made extending the network of High Speed Lines (HSLs) the cornerstone of its rail policy. After a description of the curse affecting some rail sector PPPs, the paper proposes a detailed presentation of the main on-going HSR projects in France. The aim of the paper is to explain how RFF and the French public authorities have tried to face the risks that affects rail sector PPPs. Why the government did recommend a concession for the biggest project and PPPs (in the strict sense of the term) for the other two? What are the main risks that remain for the public authorities when large projects face difficulties? The state is very often the lender of last resort but also the operator of last resort because it is usually highly unacceptable to simply close the service down. The paper also considers another major source of risk the fact that public decision-makers behave like risk lovers. In this way they provide their private sector partners with margins for manoeuvre that encourage opportunistic behaviours. In order to protect itself from the principal risk the state must first protect itself from itself! (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This scheme consists of carrying out model parameter estimation with data sampled at the highest available frequency and the subsequent prediction with data and models aggregated according to the forecasting horizon of interest. We develop explicit expressions that approximately quantify the mean square forecasting errors associated with the different prediction schemes and that take into account the estimation error component. These approximate estimates indicate that the hybrid forecasting scheme tends to outperform the so-called all-aggregated' approach and, in some instances, the all-disaggregated' strategy that is known to be optimal when model selection and estimation errors are neglected. Unlike other related approximate formulas existing in the literature, those proposed in this paper are totally explicit and require neither assumptions on the second-order stationarity of the sample nor Monte Carlo simulations for their evaluation.

Using household-level data from repeated cross-sections of expenditure surveys spanning long periods, the paper applies a decomposition of the Gini index by expenditure component. The results highlight the effect of the social diffusion of the car. The relative contribution of vehicle use items (e.g. fuels, maintenance and repair, parking, and registration) to total expenditure inequality has decreased over time, thus reflecting the increasingly widespread use of cars. Moreover, fuel taxes have become regressive, while the progressive character of taxes on the remaining car use commodities has weakened with time. Taxes on transport goods and services as a whole are progressive. However, this result is principally due to the progressivity of taxes on car purchases, a progressivity stronger by far in Denmark where these taxes are so high that car purchase costs can be afforded only by those with high incomes. These findings underline the necessity of taking into account equity issues when designing policies to attenuate the environmental impact of cars. Increasing car use costs, notably fuel prices, through an increase of uniform taxes would be particularly inequitable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We use Stockholm, and its current congestion charging scheme, as a case study by making various modifications in the transport system influencing the availability and attractiveness of public transport, bypasses and bottleneck capacities. We use a transport model to forecast the effects of the Stockholm charges given each transport system modification. Our main conclusion is that although the social benefit of a given charging system is considerably and non-linearly dependent on initial congestion levels, traffic effects and adaptations costs are surprisingly stable across transport system modifications. Specifically, the level of public transport provision has only small effects on baseline congestion, and therefore on the total benefit of the charges. Contrary to expectation, the charges' effect on traffic volumes remains virtually unchanged regardless of the changes in public transport supply. All results are compared to and consistent with the one-market standard model. We interpret our results with respect to common arguments against the transferability of experiences from cities having introduced congestion charges. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, getting a high customer satisfaction level is an essential task for municipalities and governments. For this purpose, a survey is conducted to question the attributes related to rail transit network (metros, trams, light rail and funicular) in Istanbul. In this study, we present a novel framework which integrates statistical analysis, SERVQUAL, interval type-2 fuzzy sets and VIKOR to evaluate customer satisfaction level for the rail transit network of Istanbul. Level of crowdedness and density in the train, air-conditioning system of trains' interior, noise level and vibration during the journey, and phone services are determined as the attributes need improvements. On the other hand, different improvement strategies are suggested for the rail transit network.

We do so using a novel data set that combines information from the Canadian long-form census and the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The analysis reveals that there is a positive relationship between innovation and inequality: cities with higher levels of innovation have more unequal distributions of earnings. Other factors influencing differences in inequality include city size, manufacturing and government employment, the percentage of visible minority in an urban population, and educational inequality. These results are robust to the use of different measures of inequality, innovation, alternative specifications, and instrumental variables estimations. Questions are thus raised about how the benefits of innovation are distributed in society and the long-term sustainability of such trends.","[Breau, Sebastien; Bolton, Kenyon C.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Kogler, Dieter F.] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland",McGill University; University College Dublin,"Breau, S (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",sebastien.breau@mcgill.ca; dieter.kogler@ucd.ie; kenyon.bolton@gmail.com,"Kogler, Dieter Franz/A-8496-2015","Kogler, Dieter Franz/0000-0002-6744-5632; Breau, Sebastien/0000-0002-5594-2674",,,,,98,63,70,2,82,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

However, scholarly literature that examines the different PBSP operation models and their appropriateness to specific settings has remained limited. This paper redresses this gap by addressing three key questions: (1) What types of PBSP operation models have been implemented so far? (2) How can we evaluate each type of operation model? (3) Using specific case contexts, what alternative operation models are available to enable the sustainable management of PBSPs? Our results revealed significant variability in the number of available bicycle docking stations in different cities' programs; the number of docking stations can range from single figures to over 1000. For instance, some Japanese cities display high proportions of private bicycle use but accommodate only small-scale PBSPs. Although models for PBSPs of all sizes are thought to result in certain social benefits, larger projects tend to be more profitable than smaller ones. However, the application of the hybrid model of PBSP operation and private bicycle parking management raises the profitability of small-scale models, rendering them more appropriate for implementation with a number of positive outcomes.

Studies on mobility of the elderly and associated constraints are, in Nigeria, recent but scanty. Hence, this paper explores elderly mobility characteristics, commuting patterns, quality of transport services and problems associated with the use of public transport services. Questionnaires were administered to 250 elderly aged 60 years and above using a purposive sampling technique. Findings showed that 58.4% of the sampled elderly lack personal means of transportation. The study revealed that an elderly generates about 2.88 trips per day. Trip destinations within a distance of 2 km of respondents' residence accounted for 65.60% trips generated. Daily frequency accounted for 38.56% of the visits to four trip destinations (work, social, religion and market). Walking accounts for 36.89% of travel mode of the elderly. Transport constraints identified include high transport fare, lack of bus stops, poor nature of roads, traffic congestion, poor attitude of commercial transport operators and the absence of state owned transport services. There is also a low level of satisfaction with transport services with significant variation in satisfaction with transport service among the different age groups. The paper suggests that government should include issues of elderly mobility and safety in the nation's transport policy in addition to the provision of affordable public transport services for the elderly.

In the experiment quarterly employment is temporally disaggregated using monthly unemployment as related series. The strategies under comparison make use of the contribution of sectoral data of the euro area and its six larger member states. The comparison is carried out among univariate temporal disaggregations of the Chow and Lin type and multivariate structural time series models of small and medium size. Specifications in logarithms are also systematically assessed. All multivariate set-ups, up to 49 series modelled simultaneously, are estimated via the EM algorithm. Main conclusions are that mean revision errors of disaggregated estimates are overall small, a gain is obtained when the model strategy takes into account the information by both sector and member state and that larger multivariate set-ups perform very well, with several advantages with respect to simpler models.

This study examines the determinants of the locations of three types of AFSPs: payday lenders, pawnshops, and check-cashing outlets.

Regulatory supervision potentially limits trading based on material, nonpublic information, as it provides another layer of corporate governance to mitigate outflows of private information. Yet regulators themselves may serve as a source of information leakage, thereby facilitating insider-trading activity. We find, first, that in comparison to nonsupervised firms, supervised firms exhibit substantially greater trading based on inside information prior to earnings announcements. Second, in the first few days after firms provide private information to regulators or when regulators possess private information inaccessible to corporate insiders, these firms exhibit greater symptoms of insider trading. Finally, within a given supervised industry, insider-trading symptoms appear more pronounced when regulators exhibit greater leniency or operate in states with more political corruption. These insider-trading activities translate into over $1 billion in annual transfers.","[Reeb, David M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Zhang, Yuzhao] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Zhao, Wanli] So Illinois Univ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",National University of Singapore; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Reeb, DM (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",,"Reeb, David/HII-8841-2022; Reeb, David/A-1124-2014","Reeb, David/0000-0001-9983-6139; Zhao, Wanli/0000-0001-8600-4720",,,,,27,11,12,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

In spite of recording a level of R&D capital lower than Italian industries, the technology-based industries in Spain have experienced a similar or higher long-run impact on TFP. This is mainly attributable to what occurred from the mid-1990s onwards when, thanks to increasing R&D efforts, the Spanish industries have been able to catch up with respect to the Italian ones.

Looking in detail at these two cases, this paper describes a type of relationship between economics and economic processes which deviates significantly from the currently widely discussed performativity of economics. Instead, a process of economic improvisation is identified that involves the composition of market arrangements without a pre-existing economic theory or model of the economic processes at stake. Improvisation, as this paper shows, is a key under-theorized element of neoliberal transformation processes in Chile and elsewhere, and crucial to understanding neoliberal action in critical moments. The paper also proposes distinguishing different modes of economic improvisation and how these become economic models.","WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, D-10785 Berlin, Germany",,"Farías, I (通讯作者)，WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.",farias@wzb.eu,,"Farias, Ignacio/0000-0002-6611-2975",,,,,63,19,22,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

While these developments have received some critical attention of late, existing accounts of the 'financialization of food' are limited to the extent that they view finance as an external force with emphasis placed on the unnaturalness of its relationship with agriculture and its distortive effects on agricultural markets. Recognizing that finance and agriculture have a long history, this paper offers a more nuanced account of the place of financialization in the agricultural sector. Specifically, it examines how agriculture's emergence as an investment opportunity has reconfigured the terrain of agricultural interests and logics while creating new knowledge demands and agricultural visibilities. These dynamics are explored through a case study of the role of finance and processes of financialization in the recent demise of the Canadian Wheat Board as a state marketing agency. Through this discussion, the paper offers valuable insights into not only the reworking of agriculture as a particular type of financial space, but also the nature and limits of financialization itself as a way of engaging with the world beyond urban financial centres.","York Univ, Dept Social Sci, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Williams, JW (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Social Sci, 4700 Keele St, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",jamesw1@yorku.ca,,,,,,,86,43,46,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

To capture the nonlinear dynamics of bank losses and revenues during periods of financial stress, we use a fixed effects quantile autoregressive (FE-QAR) model with exogenous macroeconomic covariates, an approach that delivers a superior out-of-sample forecasting performance relative to the standard linear framework. According to the out-of-sample forecasts, the realized net charge-offs during the 2007-09 crisis fall within the multi-step-ahead density forecasts implied by the FE-QAR model, but are frequently outside the density forecasts generated using the corresponding linear model. This difference reflects the fact that the linear specification substantially underestimates loan losses, especially for real estate loan portfolios. Employing the macroeconomic stress scenario used in CCAR 2012, we use the density forecasts generated by the FE-QAR model to simulate capital shortfalls for a panel of large BHCs. For almost all institutions in the sample, the FE-QAR model generates capital shortfalls that are considerably higher than those implied by its linear counterpart, which suggests that our approach has the potential to detect emerging vulnerabilities in the financial system.

Descriptive and correlation statistics and a multiway factor analysis (MFA) have been used to analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of 24 socio-economic indicators made available at the urban district/municipal scale. The socio-economic disparities observed along the urban-rural gradient in 1971 decreased only moderately in 2001. The MFA clearly separates urban districts from suburban municipalities in both 1971 and 2001. Results indicate that exurban development has impacted only partly Rome's urban form which remained mainly compact and dense with persisting socio-economic gaps between urban and suburban areas.

Our proposed dynamic factor model can be represented as a nonlinear, non-Gaussian state space model with parameters that we estimate using Monte Carlo maximum likelihood methods. We construct measures of global financial sector risk and of credit market dislocation, where credit market dislocation is defined as a significant and persistent decoupling of the credit risk cycle from macro-financial fundamentals in one or more regions. We show that, in the past, such decoupling has preceded episodes of systemic financial distress. Our new measure provides a risk-based indicator of credit conditions, and as such, complements earlier quantity-based indicators from the literature. In an extensive comparison with such quantity-based systemic risk indicators, we find that the behaviour of the new indicator is competitive with that of the best quantity-based indicators.

In this paper we explore how formal rules affect cooperative behavior. Our analysis is based on a series of experimental public good games designed to isolate the impact of exogenously requested minimum contributions (obligations) from those of the marginal incentives backing them. We find that obligations have a sizeable effect on cooperative behavior even in the absence of incentives. When non-binding incentives are introduced, requested contributions strongly sustain cooperation. Therefore, in contrast with cases in which incentives crowd-out cooperative behavior, in our experiments obligations and incentives are complementary, jointly supporting high levels of contributions. Moreover, we find that variations in obligations affect behavior even when incentives are held constant. Finally, we explore the behavioral channels of the previous results, finding that people's beliefs about others' contributions and the willingness to cooperate are both called into play.

Many DEA analysts, however, ignore the fact that DEA efficiency values are non-metric. They consequently do not hesitate to compute (arithmetic) means. They do not hesitate either to treat DEA values as metric data in econometric analyses. Instead of providing useful insights into the performance of public bodies, the confusion of non-metric data with metric data constitutes a lack of internal validity that may cause serious fallacies.

Because these reforms are passed at the state level, the costs of harming patients vary widely by geographic location. In this paper, I test whether malpractice reforms affect where physicians choose to practice and whether physicians who relocate in response to reforms are particularly prone to commit malpractice. Because a state's own reforms cannot separately distinguish moral hazard from adverse selection, and because those reforms are likely to have direct effects on measures of malpractice via the legal market, I focus attention on neighboring states' reforms. I find that when a state's neighbor passes a cap on noneconomic damages, both the physician-to-population ratio and the malpractice rate fall.

In this paper, the efficiency gains from the joint estimation of forecast uncertainty for all horizons in such samples are investigated. If the forecast uncertainty is estimated by seemingly unrelated regressions, it turns out that the covariance matrix of the squared forecast errors does not have to be estimated, but simply needs to have a certain structure, which is a very useful property in small samples. Considering optimal and non-optimal forecasts, it is found that the efficiency gains can be substantial for longer horizons in small samples. The superior performance of the seemingly-unrelated-regressions approach is confirmed in several empirical applications. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This method of analytical approximation allows accurate inferences for latent factors, parameters and forecasts in dynamic models with reduced computational cost. In the estimation of dynamic term structure models it also avoids some simplifications in the inference procedures, such as the inefficient two-step ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. The results obtained in the estimation of the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model indicate that this method performs more accurate out-of-sample forecasts compared to the methods of two-stage estimation by OLS and also Bayesian estimation methods using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). These analytical approaches also allow efficient calculation of measures of model selection such as generalized cross-validation and marginal likelihood, which may be computationally prohibitive in MCMC estimations.

Yet it is far from undisputed whether the broken windows policy was causal for reducing crime. The scope of the theory is not confined to crime. The theory claims that crime is inextricably linked to social order more generally. In a series of lab experiments we put two components of this more general theory to the test. We show that first impressions and early punishment of antisocial behaviour are independently and jointly causal for cooperativeness. The effect of good first impressions and of early vigilance cannot be explained with, but adds to, participants' initial level of benevolence. Mere impression management is not strong enough to maintain cooperation. Cooperation stabilizes if good first impressions are combined with some risk of sanctions. Yet if we control for first impressions, early vigilance only has a small effect. The effect vanishes over time. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

And central to this argument is a conviction that judges predictably uphold elements of presidents' policy agendas in war that would not withstand judicial scrutiny in peace. Few scholars, however, have actually subjected this claim to quantitative investigation. This article does so. Examining the universe of Supreme Court cases to which the US Government, a cabinet member, or a president was a named party over a 75-year period, and estimating a series of fixed effects and matching models, we find that during war Justices were 15 percentage points more likely to side with the government on the statutory cases that most directly implicated the president. We also document sizable effects associated with both the transitions from peace to war and from war to peace. On constitutional cases, however, null effects are consistently observed. These various estimates are robust to a wide variety of model specifications and do not appear to derive from the deep selection biases that pervade empirical studies of the courts.

We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters in DFHM. To improve its predictive power in practice, we also consider an extension of DFHM by replacing its constant coefficients of firm-specific predictors with smooth functions of macroeconomic variables. The resulting model is called the discrete-time varying-coefficient forward hazard model (DVFHM). Through local maximum likelihood analysis, DVFHM is shown to be a reliable and flexible model for forward default prediction. We use real panel datasets to illustrate these two models. Using an expanding rolling window approach, our empirical results confirm that DVFHM has better and more robust out-of-sample performance on forward default prediction than DFHM, in the sense of yielding more accurate predicted numbers of defaults and predicted survival times. Thus DVFHM is a useful alternative for studying forward default losses in portfolios.

And as standards become more pervasive, the stakes rise for all participants. It is not surprising then that many standards are covered by intellectual property rights, that battles over the licensing of those rights have reached a fevered pitch in several industries, and that competition agencies around the globe are seriously weighing whether and how to intervene in the standard setting process. One suggestion for such an intervention is the imposition of a licensing cap, referred to as the incremental value rule. We evaluate this proposal and find that even in contexts where this rule is efficient from an ex-post point of view, it induces important distortions in the decisions of firms to innovate and participate in standard setting organizations (SSO). Such a rule reduces the R&D investment that a firm makes in relevant technologies and lowers the probability that it will join the SSO.

The Japanese government revised the Building Standards Act in June 2007, requiring a stricter review process for approving the plans of large-scale buildings. This regulatory change increased the wages of certified architects in Tokyo by 30 percent but did not increase their total hours worked because of an inelastic labor supply. The stricter quality standards created a quasi rent for certified architects and owners of condominiums at a cost to consumers. Evidence suggests that the new standards increased the transaction price of existing condominiums by 15 percent in the Tokyo metropolitan area.","[Kawaguchi, Daiji; Kambayashi, Ryo] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Murao, Tetsushi] Kyushu Univ, Fukuoka 812, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; Kyushu University,"Kawaguchi, D (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",,,"Kawaguchi, Daiji/0000-0002-0595-9443",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22223003] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,19,4,4,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

In this paper, we compare the technology sourcing of foreign subsidiaries and domestic firms looking at domestic R&D outsourcing, international R&D outsourcing, domestic cooperation for innovation and international cooperation for innovation. We use data from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel for the years 2005-2009 for 10,206 innovative firms operating in Spain. We apply a multivariate probit specification which allows for systematic correlations among the different choices. The results show that the different technology sourcing choices are interdependent and that foreign subsidiaries show a different pattern of external technology sourcing. Compared to affiliated domestic companies, foreign subsidiaries show a smaller propensity for external technology sourcing via R&D outsourcing from independent firms in the host country, for international R&D outsourcing and for international cooperation for innovation. In contrast, foreign subsidiaries show a greater propensity for domestic cooperation for innovation. However, foreign subsidiaries are not a homogenous group in this respect.","[Holl, Adelheid] CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies IPP, Madrid 28037, Spain; [Rama, Ruth] CSIC, IEGD, Madrid 28037, Spain","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Economia, Geografia y Demografia (IEGD)","Rama, R (通讯作者)，CSIC, IEGD, C Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain.",ruth.rama@cchs.csic.es,"Holl, Adelheid/GXH-7017-2022; Holl, Adelheid/E-9628-2016; Rama, Ruth/K-6688-2014","Holl, Adelheid/0000-0003-4045-9468; Rama, Ruth/0000-0003-0193-473X",,,,,64,23,23,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

In many earlier studies of well-known entrepreneurship educators, the formulation of a business plan was identified as being the most important feature of any entrepreneurship programme or course. However, the relevance of a business plan has been a topic of intense and unresolved debates in more recent literature. This paper contributes to the literature with regard to the value a business plan adds to potential entrepreneurs. Furthermore it increases the understanding of how a detailed business plan (such as the approved business plan template of the University of Pretoria) can enable a potential entrepreneur to assess opportunities. The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of business plans and the methods of assessing opportunities, in order to reveal similarities between the business plan and opportunity assessment. Based on descriptive statistics and inferential statistics such as ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, the findings support the hypotheses that potential entrepreneurs distinguish between ideas and opportunities and develop opportunities through the formulation of a detailed business plan. The pertinent academic and practical significance of this paper is that it highlights statistically significant differences proving that a detailed business plan is a tool that enables potential entrepreneurs to assess opportunities. From a practical point of view, this should help potential entrepreneurs to establish more viable business ventures; however, this would have to be statistically tested in further research. Finally, the study re-establishes the importance and purpose of a business plan in the field of entrepreneurship.","Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Botha, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"Botha, Melodi/0000-0002-4014-9729",,,,,43,8,18,3,65,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Current research proves that market orientation correlates strongly with profitability. Strengthening market orientation should therefore be the main focus of the marketing department. However, over the last years, marketers within companies have faced serious criticism coming from the top management as well as from other business functions. This criticism stems from the generally shared opinion that marketing expenditures tend to rise whereas marketing effectiveness and efficiency seem to decline over time, as proved by relatively low satisfaction and loyalty levels of customers and their resistance towards marketing activities. This study investigates the main barriers of marketing effectiveness and efficiency within companies. Based on two focus groups with senior Czech marketing managers we revealed several key themes that reflect how local marketers perceive their jobs. We identified that marketing departments differ diametrically in activities they execute, that marketers face image problem within their companies and that they are not able to prove return of their activities sufficiently. Furthermore, we individuated barriers specific for our context not found in the literature. However, companies of different size and sectors have specifics which are discussed in the text. Managerial recommendations are added. All of these findings should be of high importance for both CEOs (resp. owners) and marketers, because increasing effectiveness and efficiency of the marketing function is their common goal.","[Karlicek, Miroslav; Chytkova, Zuzana] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Mkt, Prague, Czech Republic; [Tyll, Ladislav] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Business Adm, Prague, Czech Republic; [Mohelska, Hana] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business; University of Hradec Kralove,"Karlícek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Mkt, Prague, Czech Republic.",miroslav.karlicek@vse.cz; zuzana.chytkova@vse.cz; tylll@vse.cz; hana.mohelska@uhk.cz,"Karlicek, Miroslav/AAK-2659-2020; Mohelska, Hana/F-9896-2019; Chytkova, Zuzana/JWP-6522-2024","Mohelska, Hana/0000-0003-0441-0712;",,,,,21,4,4,2,16,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The aim of this research is to create a model of dependency of total profit from forest stand depending on its composition and prove that if the species composition is changed in favour of beech, the financial impact will be significantly negative. The model has area 100 ha with 100 forest groups which differ in age of one year All the silviculture and logging activities were done within one year for eleven site indexes. Total volume of cuts was used from the Mensuration and Growth Tables. Prices of contractors including their profit margin and wood price from the Czech statistical office were used for revenues and costs calculations related to the roadside. The profit from the pure spruce stand is higher than profit from pure beech stand. The costs for establishing plantation did not differ in absolute values so much. The difference between revenues is caused mostly by different price for species assortments according to their quality. The profitability of potential investment, which presents costs to the pure spruce stands with the highest site index +1 (36) is 234%, whereas profitability of beech stand in the same site index is only 151%.

We aim to explore the impact of other forces that explain the presence of tall buildings, by examining the existence of a building height premium. We find that Dutch firms are willing to pay on average about 4% more for a building that is 10 m taller, implying a substantial premium associated with tall buildings. This premium is thought to be due to a combination of a within-building agglomeration economies, a landmark and a view effect. Given functional form assumptions on the agglomeration effect, the results suggest that the sum of the landmark and view effect is about 2.8-5.5% of the rent for a building that is five times the average height.","[Koster, Hans R.

The paper describes how major issues faced by HRM can be addressed by adopting the tenets of positive psychology to align HR with the changes that are happening in the workplace and the economy. Further, it is explained that resilience, subjective well-being, hope and optimism would be able to demonstrate as a utilitarian capacity to accommodate emerging trends. The paper suggests a fundamental rethink to HRM issues and offers application of positive psychology as a feasible solution. This paper could be useful to design HR policies and interventions in a more thoughtful manner It is revealed that positive psychology has the potential to make a difference and thus, more empirical research is suggested.

This paper uses gravity model framework to capture the impact of global financial crisis on the trade potentials of Asian economies namely China, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines and South Korea with India in the post crisis era. The selected Asian economies have been defined by IMF as Emerging Asia which justifies their inclusion as a group despite heterogeneity in their growth patterns. The present study covers the period from 1985 to 2010 and deals with the annual data for bilateral trade flows and economic sizes of the countries taken in pairs. The gravity model equation is constructed on the basis of the mentioned variables and further estimated within panel structure considering the presence of panel co-integration. The bilateral trade potentials of the selected Asian economies are computed empirically to examine their expansion and contraction patterns of their trade participation with India in the post crisis era. This study points out serious concerns relating to protectionism, transport cost and liberalization policy. Among the economies in Emerging Asia, China and Philippines have reflected expansion in trade potentials amidst the financial crises as far as its participation in global trade with India is concerned. This calls for India to adopt a selective and cautious approach in choosing trade partners within Emerging Asia. (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Raj, J. Felix S.

We revealed diversity among FFPs of low cost airlines which confirms a broader role of FFPs out of pure customers loyalty issues covering also issues like product policy, price policy and policy of horizontal cooperation. We discovered main difference between older and newer FFPs of low cost airlines in collecting and rewarding options with regard to services of partnership airlines as well as in implementation of membership levels and purchase of credited units.

Our intention is to present and interpret the results of the analysis of primary research of funding the NGOs in the Slovak Republic and Austria and preliminary results of a pilot pre-research in the Czech Republic. Based on the historical development of these countries, especially the development of the non-profit sector within the conditions of every country and on the relevant empirical findings we assess and compare the current extent and potential of self-financing in the selected countries (including the extent of other sources of funding). We point out the benefits and risks connected to the examined issue and try to show that self-financing of NGOs must be understood in a broader context than just a business or a commercial activity and that it can be in compliance with the core work. Furthermore we explore the effect of self-financing on the principle of non-distribution-constraint of NGOs and we try to point out that self-financing can be in compliance also with this principle. By presenting these conclusions we fulfil the scientific goal of the paper, which is to identify particular benefits and risks of self-financing of NGOs based on relevant empirical findings from the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Austria.","[Vacekova, Gabriela] Masaryk Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic; [Svidronova, Maria] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Masaryk University Brno; Matej Bel University,"Vaceková, G (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",gabriela.vacekova@econ.muni.cz; maria.svidronova@umb.sk,"Vacekova, Gabriela/AAY-6823-2021","Vacekova, Gabriela/0000-0003-4804-9682; Murray Svidronova, Maria/0000-0002-4414-479X",,,,,18,21,22,2,24,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It argues that the extent to which researchers working on paper projects are socially embedded through social ties with colleagues inside and outside their academic department (but within the same university) is a causal step linking organisational values and norms to creative outputs. This study does not, however, find support for the proposed mediating effects. Instead, results indicate that three organisational culture dimensions - i.e. performance orientation, environmental orientation and innovation support - affect employees' creative project output through their social embeddedness outside the department (but within their own university). As the organisational culture and social embeddedness of employees outside the department are both contextual factors that matter (either indirectly or directly) for the generation of creative project outputs by researchers, this study concludes that no creative person and no project is an island.","[van Kessel, Frien G.

However, existing data is incomplete and not clear enough to clarify the relationship between the development of very convenient urban public transportation systems and compact urban structure. In this study, we quantitatively clarify the relationship between urban structure and the service level of urban public transportation including railways and tramways, and compare them among local cities in Japan, France and Germany, targeting all local cities where the populations are over one hundred thousand. Initially, we investigate urban public transportation frequencies of railways and tramways compared to the distribution of population and pedestrian spaces in city centers of all target cities in Japan, France and Germany. Then, we analyze the relationship between service frequencies at stations of the urban public transportation system and the urban structure following two viewpoints: the spatial distribution of population around the station and the spatial distribution of pedestrian spaces in the city center. As a result, in all three countries, generally the populations of the surrounding areas of stations with higher service frequencies are confirmed to be larger. As for the ratio of the population of the surrounding areas within a radius of 500 m from railway and tramway stations accounting for the population of each city, we showed the ratio of the population in station areas in France and Germany is high compared with that of Japan. Moreover, as for the proximity of pedestrian spaces to railway and tramway stations, we confirmed that the proximity of pedestrian spaces to railway and tramway stations in Japan is not high compared with France and Germany.

We find the challenge rate to robustly deter future horizontal (both relative and absolute) merger activity, and the court-loss rate to moderately affect absolute levels of horizontal-merger activity; however, the investigation rate, prohibition rate, and court-win rate do not significantly deter future horizontal mergers.

Our procedure starts by classifying a large number of components based on restrictions from common features. The result of this classification is a disaggregation map, which may also be useful in applying dynamic factors, defining intermediate aggregates or formulating models with unobserved components.

Consumers enrolled in self-insured health plans, for which employers are financially responsible for medical claims, make up a majority of Americans with employer-sponsored health coverage. Unlike their fully insured counterparts, self-insured plans are not subject to state health insurance regulation. They are also exempt from certain provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Employers who offer health plans can thus avoid certain insurance regulations and consumer protections by electing to self-insure. This research explores the impact of self-insurance on consumer welfare and how that is expected to change under the ACA. We describe the major consumer concerns regarding self-insurance - firm financial solvency, benefit generosity and stability, claims adjudication and recourse options - and present qualitative and quantitative evidence on their importance. We find a substantial degree of similarity between self-insured and fully insured plans with regard to benefit generosity and stability, at least with respect to available measures. In addition, we find no evidence that enrollees in self-insured plans face higher denial rates. While the ACA will not directly affect claims adjudication, it will improve recourse options for consumers with all plans and narrow the regulatory differences that existed between financing types. Policymakers must work to ensure the transparency of recourse options for enrollees in self and fully insured plans. In terms of financial solvency, while stop loss coverage is more common among smaller versus larger self-insured firms and such coverage typically commences at lower attachment points for smaller firms, roughly one-fourth of self-insured firms with fewer than 200 employees do not have such coverage. The ability of small firms without stop loss coverage to manage the risks associated with health care claims is uncertain, as are the consequences of health care expenditure-related risk for the overall financial solvency of the firm. Further, the financial security of firms who purchase stop loss coverage, and - by extension, the solvency of health plan benefits provided to employees - depends critically on the reliability of the stop loss insurer.

A Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach is used to reveal the unobserved latent aspects describing the service and the relationships between these aspects with the Overall Service Quality. Data from a Customer Satisfaction Survey conducted by the Transport Consortium of Granada (Spain) are analyzed. A total of 1200 surveys were collected, and two passengers' statements about the Overall Service Quality were gathered: the first one when passengers have not reflected on the attributes describing the service, and the second one after they have thought about them. This is the first time that the Overall Service Quality of a public transport system has been jointly explained by these two overall evaluations when a SEM approach is adopted. Some interesting results have been obtained. Three latent variables were identified representing the main characteristics of the service. The unobserved latent construct obtaining the highest weight on Overall Service Quality is Service, while Comfort and Personnel have little influence. The passengers' evaluation better explaining the Overall Service Quality is the evaluation made when passengers have reflected on the service. The findings of this research can provide operating companies and transport managers valuable information for designing appropriate transport policies attracting new passengers and retaining the current ones.

An issue in this debate is whether the construction of new infrastructure between core and peripheral regions induces economic benefits in these regions or not. Most of the studies that assess these benefits are ex-ante forecasts, whereas far less ex-post studies are known. In this paper we contribute to this debate by analysing the ex-ante and ex-post effects of the Westerscheldertunnel in the Netherlands which opened in 2003. This analysis was possible because various ex-ante studies about the effects of the tunnel were made before it was opened. Also, after the opening some surveys were held (including one by the authors). The analysis shows that changes subsequent to the opening of the Westerscheldetunnel are relatively small. This is in line with existing literature on similar cases. However, the ex-ante studies did forecast larger effects, particularly an increase in employment. Also, the effects that businesses expected were different from what they experienced. Their expectations were either too pessimistic or too positive. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It will have an impact on, for example, travel demand, infrastructure needs, traffic safety and the climate. The post-World War II cohorts, the so-called baby boomers, will comprise a large share of tomorrow's older population, and it is expected that they will differ from their parents' generation when they grow old. In order to better understand how the ageing baby boomers may affect future travel demand, the travel behaviour and expectations of Danish baby boomers were analysed based on 1772 standardised telephone interviews. In general, the baby boomers reported being healthy, independent and highly (auto)mobile. They were also optimistic regarding their level of mobility, capability to use a variety of travel modes and ability to lead an independent life in the future. However, there were significant gender differences in terms of present and expected car use in old age, which were somewhat similar to those observed in older cohorts. In addition, different sub groups of baby boomers could be identified based on their future expectations: the so-called Flexibles, Independents and Restricted subjects. The segments showed significant differences in current travel behaviour and living conditions, as well as some similarities to former segments of older road users. The results indicate that the baby boomers are likely to be strong consumers of the transport system also as they age, but that the group is also heterogeneous. Thus, overly optimistic scenarios about independent baby boomers who differ from the previous generations and whose need for external support in old age will be minimal may be unrealistic.

We find that the ICA had no effect on US transport costs; however, it reduced their volatility substantially. This evidence supports the view that the ICA helped stabilize cartel prices after a period of significant price wars.","[Blonigen, Bruce A.; Cristea, Anca] 1285 Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Blonigen, Bruce A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Blonigen, BA (通讯作者)，1285 Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",bruceb@uoregon.edu,"Blonigen, Bruce A/B-4517-2013",,,,,,31,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

It finds that legal investment tends to be too small under elite rule but too large under majority rule in comparison with the socially optimal level. Furthermore, elite rule, low legal quality, and high-income inequality may form a self-perpetuating circle that hinders economic development. In contrast to the conventional view, this article suggests that the often-observed association between heavy reliance on relational contracts and under development is most likely caused by the presence of elite rule rather than by a more collective-oriented culture per se because it is optimal for societies better at using relational contracts to start legal investment relatively late and to have lower quality of legal enforcement.","[Huang, Fali] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Huang, FL (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore, Singapore.",flhuang@smu.edu.sg,"HUANG, Fali/D-1429-2009","Huang, Fali/0000-0002-2540-2845",,,,,63,2,2,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In particular, a step toll is compared to its flat counterpart at two charging levels. The increments between steps are also increased in a peaked step toll scenario. Furthermore, results from simulation of the current toll ring are compared to real-world measurements in a first attempt to validate model predictions regarding impacts of a time-varying congestion charging scheme. In the model, car users have the possibility to respond to congestion charging by changing departure time, route or switch to public transport and travel times are calculated using mesoscopic traffic simulation. Validation shows that departure time choice adjustments because of congestion charging are overestimated by the model that is based on stated preference data. This warrants further research on discrepancies between stated and revealed adjustments to congestion charging. The current step toll reaches the highest social benefit estimate in model predictions, but differences in traffic effects between the current step toll and its flat counterpart are rather small. Furthermore, results show that demand changes occur in the model to a considerably greater extent for trips with low value of time. The differences in welfare effects is for that reason large for different trip purposes, indicating the importance of accounting for heterogeneous trips when modelling effects of congestion charges.

We investigate how university policy and funding acquisition impacts industry versus university ownership, and find that funding from large firms predicts involvement in patenting and, to a lesser extent, firm ownership. University ownership of academic patents is more likely the higher the amount of funding coming from SMEs, and at universities that outsource the filing of patents.

Special attention is paid to the dynamics of this process and the role that the interaction between the supply side and the foreign demand of accommodation plays. Thereby, I will emphasise how an unfavourable structure of the housing market, along with behaviour of local private landlords on the supply side leads to considerable problems concerning the housing market integration of migrants in Spain.

First, transport routes are divided into smaller route segments. Second, likelihood scores of security-related accidents in which dangerous freight is involved and possibly causing fatalities in the surrounding population, are determined per route segment. Third, the consequences of accident scenarios (using reference products and spatial plans) are calculated in terms of the number of people within the 1% lethality distance of the accident center. Fourth, using these likelihood scores and consequence figures, transport route security risk levels are determined. Fifth, transshipment risks are considered for determining the final transport route security risk levels. This leads to a multi-modal user-friendly security threat assessment tool which can be used by policy makers as well as by industrialists (shippers or Logistics Service Providers). The generic method allows for comparing the security risk levels of the different route segments and routes of transportation of hazardous goods and for taking countermeasures from a uni-modal as well as from a multi-modal perspective.

J,"Navone, LC",,,,"Navone, Livia C.",,,Property versus political holdouts: the case of the TGV rail line Lyon-Budapest in Italy,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Property rights economics; Eminent domain; Regulatory takings; Holdouts; NIMBY; Lyon-Budapest TGV line,TAKINGS; COMPENSATION,"The law and economics literature commonly justifies the state's taking power on the grounds that it is necessary to overcome holdouts and, thus, allow efficient development projects to move forward (A development project is efficient when the benefit it generates exceeds its cost.). By permitting the government to take private property rights non-consensually, the taking power limits the ability of private property owners to engage in strategic bargaining with the government and puts a cap on their ability to extract payments from the government in exchange for agreeing to transfer their rights. In this paper, I will argue that the standard story is highly incomplete and, therefore, inaccurate. It conveniently ignores the ability of politically powerful groups to block development projects by exercising their de facto veto power over proposed projects. Such groups do not necessarily have rights in any properties directly affected by the project. Once these groups, whom I call political holdouts, are added to the analysis, it becomes clear that the payment of just compensation-or any other aspect of eminent domain law and regulatory takings jurissprudence-will not help to remove their opposition and, a fortiori, cannot guarantee efficient development. I will explore the phenomenon of political holdouts and analyze its causes. As I will show, political holdouts are ubiquitous. Political holdouts may arise with respect to most of what passes for public policy projects, under either the aegis of eminent domain or the government's police power, and also with respect to non-NIMBY projects. This observation may seem counterintuitive at first. However, one should consider that efficient development projects create a surplus over which powerful interest groups compete. As should be clear, what is of interest to localities and political groups is not the overall utility of a particular development project, but rather their payoff from it. Municipalities may oppose projects that benefit them simply to increase their share of the overall surplus generated by the project. Hence, the problem I point out is significant and acute. In the remainder of this paper, I will discuss in depth how the problem of political holdouts affected the construction of a fast train line (the Lyon-Torino-Milano-Trieste-Khoper-Ljubljana-Budapest TGV line) in northern Italy.","Univ Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Navone, LC (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy.",livia.navone@eco.unipmn.it,,,,,,,53,0,0,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In this paper, I test whether the antidumping petition process itself can help domestic firms raise prices. I propose a method to identify whether firms in the industry experience a structural break in the level of market power possessed by the firms at the time that they file their antidumping petition. I use this methodology to analyze the impact of antidumping petitions on competition levels in two industries. I find little evidence that either of these industries increased their market power following the filing of petitions for trade relief, nor even from the protection that resulted from these petitions. These findings suggest that the widespread belief that antidumping leads to more market power may not always hold.","American Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Reynolds, KM (通讯作者)，American Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",reynolds@american.edu,,"Reynolds, Kara/0000-0002-2570-4384",,,,,18,3,4,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Yet relatively little is known by the outside world about the Chinese experience due to China's rather short history in the development of modern mass transit and land/property market. This paper attempts to fill the gap by presenting evidence from China, with a detailed case study of Beijing. Selecting three newly built suburban transit lines in Beijing, the study examined land development context and estimated hedonic housing price models to measure the proximity premiums associated with these three lines. The empirical evidence in Beijing, one of the first tier mass transit cities in China, shows that investments in mass transit can have significant and positive impacts on land development. Properties with transit proximity enjoy sizable price or value premiums. The study also confirms the international experience: transit impacts on land development are unlikely to occur automatically; they rely greatly on supportive regional and site conditions. Integrated planning and design for mass transit and land development are critical to expand and maximize the return of transit investments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The economic growth nurtured the life in the cities and cities have become a major livelihood destination for everyone. This migration of people contributed to the increased urbanization of Indian cities. The booming economy fostered the well-being and shaped the lifestyle of people in such a way that the dependency on private vehicle has become an unavoidable affair. Along with population growth, the increased vehicle ownership gave rise to overall spurt in travel demand. But the supply side lagged behind the demand adding to many of the transport related externalities such as accidents, congestion, pollution, inequity etc. The importance of sustainability is understood in the current urban transport scenario leading to the development and promotion of sustainable transport polices. The core agenda of these polices is to target the travel behavior of people and change the way they travel by creating a different travel environment. However, the impacts of many such policies are either unknown or complex. Hence, before adopting and implementing such policies, it is important for the decision makers to be aware of the impacts of them. The role of travel demand models comes here as they predict the future travel demand under different policy scenarios. This paper reviews the ability of travel demand models applied in India in analyzing the sustainable transport policies. The study found that the conventional model system in India, which is trip based four step aggregate methodology, is inadequate in analyzing the sustainable transport policies. A review of alternative approach, known as activity based travel demand modeling found that they are capable of handling such policies better than conventional models and are assistive to the decision makers in arriving at right mix of polices specific to the situations. Since there is no operational activity based travel demand model system developed in India, the study at the end envisaged a conceptual framework of an integrated activity based travel demand model based on the requirements identified from the review. This can potentially replace the existing travel demand models and can be used for planning applications once the modification & validation have been done according to the existing activity-travel behavior of individuals.

The analysis encompasses combinations based on principal components and trimmed means, performance-based weighting, and least squares estimates of optimal weights, as well as Bayesian shrinkage. For GDP growth and the unemployment rate, only few of the individual forecast combination schemes outperform the simple equally weighted average forecast in a pseudo-out-of-sample analysis, while there is stronger evidence of improvement over this benchmark for the inflation rate.

This paper presents a review of referendum voting behaviour in road pricing reform, in which a number of key factors that influence voters' behaviour are identified including voter expectations, awareness of what road pricing reform means, familiarity with the road pricing debate, perceived fairness, environmental concerns, car dependence, and the value of a trial. The two most important reasons that the majority of congestion charging proposals were voted against in referenda in jurisdictions such as Manchester and Edinburgh in the UK are uncertainty associated with the effectiveness of congestion charging and the lack of information on congestion charging. Based on two successful congestion charging referenda and ideas from research studies, this paper proposes a two-step approach to address the barriers to the successful implementation of congestion charging in a package of transport reform initiatives.

Two different scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, subjects have to decide whether to commute by car or by metro. Metro costs are fixed, while car costs are uncertain and determined by the joint effect of casual events and traffic congestion. In the second scenario, subjects have to decide whether to travel by car or by bus, whose costs are determined by a different combination of chance and traffic congestion. Subjects receive feedback information on the actual travel times of both modes. We find that individuals show a marked preference for cars, are inclined to confirm their first choice and exhibit travel mode stickiness. We conclude that travel mode choice is subject to cognitive heuristics and biases leading to robust deviations from rational behaviour. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The appeal of this proposal is that it merges information from the historical time series and the different information supplied by the market's expectation of risk. Forecast-combining methods, with weights estimated using quantile regression, are considered. We also investigate plugging implied volatility into the CAViaR modelsa procedure that has not been considered in the VaR area so far. Results for daily index returns indicate that the newly proposed methods are comparable or superior to individual methods, such as the standard CAViaR models and quantiles constructed from implied volatility and the empirical distribution of standardised residuals. We find that the implied volatility has more explanatory power as the focus moves further out into the left tail of the conditional distribution of S&P 500 daily returns.

Our results corroborate the dual role of the corporate debt and the dividends. When firms lack growth opportunities, they alleviate the problem of overinvestment. But, when firms have growth opportunities, they exacerbate the problem of underinvestment. Our results also suggest that legal and institutional environment can module this effect. Better legal protection of investors reduces the disciplinary role of financial decisions. Considering the importance of capital markets, we find that debt and dividends are less influential in countries with more active capital markets. Finally, there are some firm-specific features, such as the nature of controlling shareholders (e.g., the ownership concentration and the identity of these shareholders), which modify the relevance of debt and dividends in Asian firms.","[Lopez-Iturriaga, F.

The parking rate implementation is based on performance-based pricing where rates are increased, decreased, or not changed in neighborhoods with occupancy levels higher than, lower than, or within the desired level. We calculated the price elasticity of on-street parking demand, or the percentage change in block-level occupancy in response to a change in pricing, modified by time of day and neighborhood characteristics. This study is the first one that calculates price elasticity by time of day for on-street parking demand on a block level in the U.S. context. This study is also the first one that empirically derives how neighborhood characteristics affect on-street parking demand in response to pricing. Moreover, this study looks into how pricing results in changes in parking turnover rates, parking duration and total revenue generated. Results confirm our hypotheses price elasticity of the parking occupancy is inelastic and varies by time of day and neighborhood characteristics. In addition, the results showed that the pricing also affects parking duration: motorists park for a shorter time on average during the day in neighborhoods with increased rates and longer in neighborhoods with decreased rates. Performance based pricing policy seems to be lowering the turnover rates on average during the day in neighborhoods with increased rates, however, it appears working ideally in the peak-hours when the parking demand is the greatest, allowing more motorists to park. The decreased rate seemed to be increasing the parking occupancy during peak-hours when motorists see the benefit in paying lower fees. The study demonstrated that the estimated elasticities can be used to determine the optimal parking rate to achieve a desired level of parking occupancy on every block in the study area. This method can be easily applied in every city that has similar parking pay stations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The author shows that alternative formalizations of the intensity of readers' preferences alter the equilibrium level of media plurality, given that they affect demand for news. In particular, when the readers' disutility of consuming news that differs from their ideal variety is relatively high for politically close news, the media firms choose a multi-ideology strategy, because the increase in demand is large. On the contrary, when the readers' disutility of consuming news that differs from their ideal variety is relatively low for politically close news, media firms choose a single-ideology strategy because a multi-ideology strategy does not significantly increase demand.","[Pires, Armando J.

This paper examines landowner preferences for the attributes of working forest conservation contracts (WFCC) using a choice experiment. The attributes examined are contract duration (from 10 years to perpetuity), forest management requirements, and the extent of forestland covered under the contract. We find that contract attributes are valued very differently depending on landowner objectives and harvesting behavior. Landowner characteristics and forestland spatial characteristics including distances to development and large public forestlands were found to significantly influence the likelihood of contract acceptance.

Public transport (PT) together with cycling and walking are generally agreed to be sustainable alternatives to private car use. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of those aspects of PT quality most likely to attract car users. Toward achieving this aim, relevant research was sought to answer the following two questions: What quality attributes of PT services are attractive to users? And what changes in quality attributes of PT services would encourage modal shift from private motor vehicles to PT? Using a qualitative systematic review, it is concluded that while service reliability and frequency are important PT attributes in general, those attributes most effective in attracting car users are largely affective and connected to individual perceptions, motivations and contexts. Reduced fare promotions and other habit-interrupting transport policy measures can succeed in encouraging car users to try PT services initially. Attributes over and above basic accessibility, reliability and mobility provision, perceived by the target market as important service attributes, must then be provided in sustaining the switch from car use after promotional tactics have expired.

In order to identify strategies that may be most effective at increasing pedestrian and bicycle transportation in a specific local context, practitioners need a greater understanding of the underlying thought process that people use to select travel modes. Previous research from the travel behavior and psychology fields provides the foundation for a five-step, operational Theory of Routine Mode Choice Decisions. Walking and bicycling could be promoted through each of the five steps: awareness and availability (e.g., offer individual marketing programs), basic safety and security (e.g., make pedestrian and bicycle facility improvements and increase education and enforcement efforts), convenience and cost (e.g., institute higher-density, mixed land uses, and limited, more expensive automobile parking), enjoyment (e.g., plant street trees and increase awareness of non-motorized transportation benefits), and habit (e.g., target information about sustainable transportation options to people making key life changes). The components of the theory are supported by in-depth interview responses from the San Francisco Bay Area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

First, whenever a firm faces multimarket competitors that sell goods in markets to which the firm itself has no access, the firm gains a strong incentive to expand production in its own market(s). In the capacity choice model, such a firm builds larger than Cournot capacity and pushes its competitors towards other markets. Consumers always benefit from multimarket competition. In asymmetric market structures, some firms may also benefit from multimarket arrangements, but in symmetric ones, all firms are necessarily harmed by it. Second, the intensification of indirect competition is not necessarily bad for the firm. It may be the case that, the more competitors its competitors have, the higher the firms profit. Finally, this model also has a multiproduct interpretation which suggests that a merger of single-product firms may be beneficial or harmful from a social welfare perspective, depending on whether the new entity will compete with several single-product firms or another multiproduct one.","Univ Vienna, Dept Econ, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Shelegia, S (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Econ, Brunner Str 72, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",sandro.shelegia@univie.ac.at,"Shelegia, Sandro/W-8497-2019; Shelegia, Sandro/M-3665-2015","Shelegia, Sandro/0000-0001-8765-5373; Shelegia, Sandro/0000-0001-8765-5373",,,,,22,4,5,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

S. states enacted laws expanding the rights of married women to own and control their separate property and to own their market earnings. The economic approach to property rights implies that as married women gain economic rights, the incentive to invest in girls' human capital will rise. This prediction is tested by examining the impact of these legal changes on girls' school attendance rates relative to boys'. State-level census data are used to examine the effects of these changes on school attendance among all school-aged children. Integrated Public Use Microdata Series data are used to examine their effect on school attendance among children ages 1519, who are just beyond compulsory schooling ages. Consistent with hypothesized effects, the empirical analysis shows that expanding women's economic rights resulted in higher relative rates of school attendance by girls and had the largest effect on the 15-19 age group.","[Geddes, Rick; Tennyson, Sharon] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lueck, Dean] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Cornell University; University of Arizona,"Geddes, R (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Tennyson, Sharon/G-8995-2015","Tennyson, Sharon/0000-0001-9674-6410",,,,,86,18,22,0,13,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

In particular, we find that: 1) sales, age and growth opportunities are restrictive determinants of investment for low levels of investment, but positive determinants of investment for high levels of investment; 2) debt and the interest rate are restrictive determinants of investment but only for low and intermediate levels of investment; 3) cash flow is a positive determinant of investment, but is more important for investment regarding low levels of investment; 4) GNP is a positive determinant of investment, but only for high levels of investment; and 5) investment in the previous period is a positive determinant of investment in the present period, but only for intermediate and high levels of investment.

In spite of that, airports' operating costs did not mirror the declining traffic trends and continued to increase during the same period. This paper sought to estimate the impact of the recession on airports' cost efficiency and financial performance. This is achieved by estimating the industry's short-run cost frontier over a balanced pool database of 194 airports observed between 2007 and 2009. Results show that airports struggled to control operating costs during the recession. Efficiency losses were estimated to be in excess of USD 5.5 billion, contributing to a significant reduction in industry operating margin. Results also suggest that airports that are corporatised and have not pursued extensive out-sourcing of activities are better able to manage their costs during periods of economic recession.

Here, I study a game where both public and private antitrust enforcement play a role. Plaintiffs face information acquisition costs (evidence-gathering) if they want to bring an SPD action, but they do not internalise the opportunity cost of the courts' resources. First, I show that any gain in deterrence has to be traded off against costly litigation and enforcement costs, and that these tradeoffs are heterogeneous across market sizes. Second, taking the competition authority's actions as exogenous, SPDs can improve welfare only if the competition authority is sufficiently effective: private damages are a complement to (good) public enforcement, not a substitute. Third, a resource-constrained competition authority, upon the introduction of SPDs, should investigate a larger proportion of industries (even at the cost of a higher error rate). That is, whilst a hands-off approach might have been warranted absent SPDs, this is no longer true once stand-alone actions are introduced.","European Univ Inst, I-50133 Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Calcagno, C (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Via Piazzuola 43, I-50133 Florence, Italy.",claudio.calcagno@eui.eu,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

It traces Catholic underpinnings of social, economic, and political thought and action and their applications to American urban life. It highlights new themes of a developing Catholic tradition that engages new problematic conditions and situations. These new themes and practices became imperatives related to current dynamics of urban and metropolitan growth. Thus this essay addresses the sources of this approach to the crisis of development found in the neighborhood movement and locates the particularly pivotal participation the Monsignor Geno C.

The tax base shrinks, so the rates paid by those least able to pay increase. The prevailing system of a low tax on land values leads to land speculation and private land banking, assuring that the landowner can hold out for a very high price for a very long time. A higher tax on land values (coupled with reduction in building taxes) creates an incentive to sell that land or do something with it rather than waiting. In cities that use land-value taxes, real-estate markets start to work again and neighborhoods recover. Clairton, Pennsylvania's adoption of a land-value-taxation system demonstrates the neighborhood revitalization to which it leads, as owner-occupied residences and multi-family units saw a relief in their tax burden. In contrast, vacant properties' contribution to the city budget tripled, providing the resources to pay for the education of Clairton's children and liberate working and middle-class families from the bonds of labor and capital taxation.","Ctr Study Econ, Philadelphia, PA USA",,"Vincent, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Study Econ, Philadelphia, PA USA.",,,,,,,,21,7,9,0,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We experimentally examine whether clients possess the sophistication necessary to design screening contracts and how contingent fee caps affect a client's ability to screen. When contingent fees are unrestricted, we find that most subjects are able to design contracts that screen low-quality attorneys, resulting in an increase in the quality of legal services. However, we find that contingent fee caps decrease the frequency of screening even if the cap is non-binding. Caps on contingent fees also reduce clients' ability to extract surplus, allowing attorneys to earn greater profits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, I argue that states are augmenting their regulatory capacity by promoting the interpenetration of national economic surveillance systems. I develop this argument by exploring the recent efforts of powerful states to address a particular form of offshore regulatory escape: tax evasion. Previous analyses of offshore processes have been framed by strong assumptions about the geographic domains of states and markets. I present a new analytic framework that weakens these geographic assumptions and explains why some states are more able than others to address offshore tax evasion through unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral channels. The framework is applied to explain the mechanisms through which powerful states have reclaimed evaded taxes and forced global transparency standards on tax havens after the GFC. I conclude that the regulatory changes brought about by recent attacks on tax havens constitute an important remapping of the fiscal state. These attacks provide an interesting case study of the ways in which states are augmenting their capacity to regulate a range of cross-border financial flows.","Victoria Univ, Ctr Strateg Econ Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Victoria University,"van Hulten, A (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Ctr Strateg Econ Studies, 300 Flinders St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",Andrew.Van-Hulten@vu.edu.au,,,,,,,82,8,8,2,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The paper also determines the extent to which the tax inherent in lottery purchases is regressive in its incidence on purchasers. It is found that gender, social class, marital status, the presence of children in the home and household size significantly effect lottery participation. Lottery expenditures are affected by income, location of the household, gender, age, education, social class and whether the household has positive betting expenditures.

A firm's production efficiency is determined by the levels of its managerial capability and its workers' firm-specific human capital in the model. Elaborating on the connection between firm dynamics and specific human capital, I show that the importance of managerial capability systematically influences firm dynamics and employment practices. The model offers a new perspective on the public policy implications of apparently anticompetitive entry restrictions. By incorporating a government that can enforce entry regulations in the model, I demonstrate that entry restrictions can improve welfare by mitigating the underinvestment problem in specific human capital.

This paper analyzes their rapid spread worldwide through an in-depth review of the existing literature. A comprehensive meta-analysis of the effects of PS on road traffic accidents and the duration of these effects has been conducted. The findings show that the strong initial positive impact (15 to 20% reductions in accidents, fatalities and injuries) seems to wear off in under eighteen months. This limited effectiveness is related to the absence of complementary enforcement to back up these measures. Without them, points systems could turn into a boomerang road safety policy, and even be abandoned at a later date.

The regulation of GHG emissions in the US, with adoption of 2016 standards and ongoing work toward 2025 standards, provides a rich case study to assess questions about the appropriate amount of lead-time to promote sustained long-term investment in vehicle efficiency technology. This analysis examines the milestones, phase-in, lead-time, investments, technology diffusion, and GHG emission progress-to-date toward 2016 standards in the US. The findings suggest that the 2016 rulemaking process establishes a strong model for regulatory lead-time, allowing for ample time for industry to make the necessary investments to meet their GHG reduction commitments by 2016. The 2025 rulemaking continues this strong precedent for extended regulatory lead-time and has led to near unanimous automaker support. The 13-year lead-time for 2025 standards is appropriate to help reduce technology investment risk and sustain long-term capital investments, and it is especially fitting for the difficult task of launching advanced electric-drive technologies for deep long-term GHG emission cuts.

There is a lack of evidence about what works to promote active travel. This paper aimed to explain the variation in active travel into Glasgow, a post industrial city in the West of Scotland. Methods: Census travel data from 2001 and data from a cordon count performed over 2 day in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were used to estimate the number of pedestrians and cyclists entering and leaving the City centre from four City sectors. Results: In 2001, pedestrian commuters (12.6%) were more common than cycling commuters (1.3%). There was no clear pattern in cycling or pedestrian commuting by deprivation. The number of cyclists crossing the cordon increased between 2007 and 2010 but interpretation of this is difficult because of variation in seasons and weather. The highest level of cycle commuting was from the sector with the best cycling infrastructure and the highest pedestrian commuting was in the sector without significant road or river barriers. The construction of a new bridge over the river Clyde was associated with an increase in the number of pedestrians and cyclists entering and leaving the cordon from that sector, even after accounting for displacement. Conclusion: Active travel in Glasgow is relatively uncommon but is facilitated in areas with fewer physical barriers and better infrastructure. Cordon counts can provide useful localised data on levels of active commuting into City centres. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, companies have developed a variety of initiatives to improve the mobility of their employees, although their visions and actions are often neglected in the research literature. This paper aims at identifying the good practice in mobility policies of workplaces located in Belgium. To achieve this objective, existing research and two large-scale Belgian surveys of commuting are analysed. First, workplaces are clustered in order to identify those where the alternative modes of transport which are promoted by the policy are popular among employees. Then, quantitative analyses are performed to find out what are the good practices of mobility policies. The results show that the best way of promoting an alternative mode of transport depends on company's characteristics. The promotion of bicycles is most appropriate for small workplaces, while larger workplaces and those located in built-up areas or city centres are more suitable for the promotion of public transport. Financial incentives, provision of facilities, diffusion of information and parking management all play an important role in mobility management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It carries out an empirical investigation of the role of corporate governance in financial development. We focus on French corporate governance reforms in order to examine whether these reforms are consistent with the reorganization of the French financial system, which took place during the period 1977-2004. This research aims at evaluating one proposition of the legal origin claims based on the idea that there is a strong and stable relationship between legal origin, investor protection and financial system. A key question the study addresses is how corporate governance rules and the French financial development have changed over time. Our study suggests that indicators related to investors' rights (shareholders, employees, and bondholders) have been increasing over time, despite the specific legal origin of the French system. On the contrary the creditors' rights have followed a less clear trend. Our econometric investigation is fairly new as the Law and finance literature has not until now provided corporate governance indicators suitable for French legislation. From that perspective, our work undergoes a multiple criteria analysis of corporate governance reforms. Following this approach, we suggest that the causality links between changes in the French legal environment and financial growth in France are more bidirectional than unidirectional.","[Deffains, Bruno] Univ Paris 02, F-75005 Paris, France; [Blazy, Regis] Univ Strasbourg, Ecole Management Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, LARGE, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Boughanmi, Afef] Univ Nancy, IUP Finance Nancy, F-54035 Nancy, France; [Guigou, Jean-Daniel] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Sch Finance, LSF Res, L-1246 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Lorraine; University of Luxembourg,"Deffains, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 02, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75005 Paris, France.",regis.blazy@urs.u-strasbg.fr; afef.boughanmi@univ-nancy2.fr; bruno.deffains@u-paris2.fr; Jean-daniel.guigou@uni.lu,"Boughanmi, Afef/O-4582-2019; Deffains, Bruno/F-2896-2018","Deffains, Bruno/0000-0001-9822-5272",,,,,19,5,6,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Both methods are based on the probability integral transformation for unidimensional forecasts. The first method tests multinormal densities and relies on the rotation of the coordinate system. The advantages of the second method are not only its applicability to arbitrary continuous distributions, but also the evaluation of the forecast accuracy in specific regions of its domain, as defined by the user's interest. We show that the latter property is particularly useful for evaluating a multidimensional generalization of the Value at Risk. In both simulations and an empirical study, we examine the performances of the two tests. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The FTC Proposal relies on non-standard and misguided definitions of economic terms of art such as ex ante and hold-up, and advocates new inefficient rules for calculating damages for patent infringement. The Proposal would so reduce the costs of infringement that the rate of infringement would increase as potential infringers find it in their interest to abandon the voluntary market in favor of judicial pricing. As the number of nonmarket transactions increases, courts will play an ever larger role in deciding the terms on which the patented technologies of one party may be used by another party. That will do more than reduce the incentives for innovation; it will upset the current set of well-functioning private coordination activities in the IP marketplace that are needed to accomplish the commercialization of new technologies. And that would seriously undermine capital formation, job growth, competition, and the consumer welfare the FTC seeks to promote. Like the FTC Proposal, we focus here within the context of standard-setting organizations (SSOs), whose activities are key to bringing standardized technologies to market. If the FTCs proposed definitions of reasonable royalties and incremental damages become the rules for calculating patent damages the FTC and private actors will be well poised to attack, after the fact, all standard pricing methods through some combination of antitrust litigation or direct regulation on the ground that even time-honored voluntary royalty arrangements result from some purportedly undue power of IP. The FTCs Proposal may encourage potential licensees to adopt the very holdout strategies the FTC purports to address and that well-organized SSOs routinely counteract today. The FTCs proposal for regulating IP by limiting the freedom of SSOs to set their own terms would thereby replace private coordination with government hold-up. We conclude that the FTC should abandon its Proposal and support the current set of licensing tools that have fueled effective innovation and dissemination in the IP marketplace. FTC forbearance will improve bargaining incentives, reduce administrative costs, and remove unnecessary elements of legal uncertainty in the IP system, thereby advancing consumer welfare.","[Epstein, Richard A.] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Epstein, Richard A.; Kieff, F.

It is theorized that due to the division of labor and a higher degree of specialization, high courts might be advantageous in terms of court productivity. Yet, they might also be disadvantageous in terms of a less coherent legal system. It is empirically tested whether the positive or the negative effects prevail. Results show that a larger number of high courts never has any positive effects on very broad outcome variables; indeed, with regard to some of these, a greater number of high courts is correlated with worse outcomes.

Under the Memorandum of Understanding with the IMF/EU/ECB Troika, Ireland must implement a severe fiscal austerity programme and reduce the size of its banking system. These goals must be achieved in the context of a deleveraging process in the household sector brought about by the need to repair balance sheets following a collapse in the value of housing assets. The current policy mix, which aims to reduce these stocks simultaneously, is unlikely to be successful, a feature we term the domestic trilemma. An external trilemma arising from the constraints of EMU membership also limits the policy choices for high-debt economies attempting to engineer an export-led recovery.

In other words, among all possible interim monetary indices manat's exchange rate is the most under control and predictable orientator for achieving ultimate aims of monetary policy - stabilization of price and financial system. As a whole it is considered that in the capacity of a conductor for the monetary and fiscal policy one of the following indices could be chosen - the exchange rate, money supply and the interest rate. It is not possible to target all those three indices at the same time. Fixation of exchange rate in this case does not allow the central bank to operate with interest rate.

In addition, we wanted to find a mathematical model to enable the correction of the accounting method for calculating the residual value because it can be successfully used by specialists in the field.","[Colbu, Ioana Cristina; Ivan, Paul-Panfil; Morosan, Andrei-Alexandra] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,,ioana_colbu@yahoo.com,"Ivan, Paul-Panfil/H-5058-2013; Ivan, Paul-Panfil/AAK-9865-2020","Ivan, Paul-Panfil/0000-0002-0281-0256; Ivan, Paul-Panfil/0000-0002-0281-0256",,,,,6,0,0,0,3,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",,,978-606-19-0103-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,131,136,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEN33,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317436900027,0

Recently, some studies have argued that despite corruption, linguistic and historical ties between home and host countries lead MNCs to prefer high-equity modes. Focusing on a rather unexplored setting, the African countries, most specifically the Portuguese-speaking ones (PALOP - Paises Africanos de LIngua Oficial Portuguesa), which include countries where levels of corruption are very high (e.g., Guinea-Bissau and Angola), high (e. g., Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe), and intermediate (e.g., Cape Verde), maintaining also close linguistic and historical ties with Portugal, we found that the FDI entry mode is associated with the less corrupt markets. Thus, our results do not support the recent contention that cultural and historical links are likely to perform a mediating role, by fostering foreign direct investment, in supporting African countries to overcome the dismal growth some have been facing in the last few decades. On the contrary, our findings highlight the pressing need for these countries to combat corruption if higher economic growth via FDI attraction is envisioned.","[Grande, Marlene; Teixeira, Aurora A.

A two-stage procedure proposed by Simar and Wilson (2007) is adopted. In the first stage, a bootstrapped data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is used to compute the efficiency scores. In the second stage, the bootstrapped DEA scores are estimated over a set of mills' institutional and managerial systems and other characteristics with a bootstrapped truncated regression. The results show that there is a wide dispersion in the technical efficiency among mills. Private ownership, autonomy and mill size have statistically significant positive impacts on efficiency. These results provide support for the ongoing reform and implications for future development of this area. (C) 2012 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

Their econometric analysis finds some support for the widespread belief that the Internet cannibalizes print media. On average, a 1% increase in companion website traffic is associated with a weakly significant decrease in total print circulation by 0.15%. This association is mainly driven by a statistically significant and negative mapping between website visits and kiosk sales, although they do not find any statistically significant relationship between website visits and subscriptions. The latter finding is reassuring for publishers because advertisers value a large subscriber base. Moreover, the authors show that the negative relationships between website visits and total circulation as well as kiosk sales are primarily associated with magazines that have a mainly male and Internetaffine readership and by magazines that are published with a less than weekly periodicity.","[Kaiser, Ulrich] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kaiser, Ulrich] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Kaiser, Ulrich] Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany; Inst Study Labor, Bonn, Germany; [Kongsted, Hans Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Kongsted, Hans Christian] Ctr Appl Microeconometr, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Zurich; Copenhagen Business School; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Copenhagen,"Kaiser, U (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Plattenstr 14, Zurich, Switzerland.",ulrich.kaiser@business.uzh.ch,"Kongsted, Hans/AAF-3936-2019; Kongsted, Hans/D-5226-2013","Kongsted, Hans Christian/0000-0003-1364-6970; Kaiser, Ulrich/0000-0003-4372-2479",,,,,30,11,12,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

This work investigates the loss given default (LGD) of mortgage loans using a large set of recovery data of residential mortgage defaults from a major UK bank. A Probability of Repossession Model and a Haircut Model are developed and then combined to give an expected loss percentage. We find that the Probability of Repossession Model should consist of more than just the commonly used loan-to-value ratio, and that the estimation of LGD benefits from the Haircut Model, which predicts the discount which the sale price of a repossessed property may undergo. This two-stage LGD model is shown to perform better than a single-stage LGD model (which models LGD directly from loan and collateral characteristics), as it achieves a better R-2 value and matches the distribution of the observed LGD more accurately.

Recently, however, a different string of arguments has entered the academic discussion emphasising the limited extent of the formalisation of firms' behaviour despite the institutional transition being complete. The aim of this paper is to show conceptually and empirically that a balance of formal and informal interactions is considered optimal for firms due to economic opportunities resulting from informality. The Greater Pearl River Delta (PRD), where Hong Kong (HK) firms act as cross-border intermediates between global customers and Chinese producers, serves as an example for studying the degree of informality applied when operating in two distinct institutional settings. A survey of electronics firms in HK investigates the way in which firms organise their contacting and selecting as well as their contracting processes when approaching global customers and Chinese producers. The findings show (I) that the degree of informality is greater when interacting with producers in the PRD due to the incompleteness of the institutional setting, but (2) that when acting with global customers, the behaviour of firms is only formalised to a certain extent. Informal interaction also serves as an opportunity for firms and is strategically used in an innovative organisational and management processes.","Joanneum Res Forsch Gesell MbH, Policies Ctr Econ & Innovat Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",,"Meyer, S (通讯作者)，Joanneum Res Forsch Gesell MbH, Policies Ctr Econ & Innovat Res, Sensengasse 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",susanne.meyer@joan-neum.at,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

To a panel with the cross-section dimension of 91 pairs of EU15 countries and with time ranging from 1964 to 2003, an extended gravity model of trade is applied in order to determine the effects of exchange rate volatility on bilateral trade flows of EU15 countries. The estimated impact is clearly negative, which indicates that exchange rate volatility has a negative influence on bilateral trade flows. Then, this traditional panel approach is contrasted with an alternative investigation based on fuzzy logic. The key elements of the fuzzy approach are to set fuzzy decision rules and to assign membership functions to the fuzzy sets intuitively based on experience. Both approaches yield very similar results and fuzzy approach is recommended to be used as a complement to statistical methods.","[Nuroglu, Elif] Int Univ Sarajevo, Fac Business & Adm, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Kunst, Robert M.] Univ Vienna, Dept Econ, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",International University of Sarajevo; University of Vienna,"Nuroglu, E (通讯作者)，Int Univ Sarajevo, Fac Business & Adm, Hrasnicka Cesta 15, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg.",enuroglu@ius.edu.ba; robert.kunst@univie.ac.at,"Nuroğlu, Elif/AAB-3717-2020; Kunst, Robert/C-7125-2017","Nuroğlu, Elif/0000-0002-1491-4722; Kunst, Robert/0000-0001-6831-2471",,,,,28,1,3,0,9,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Although a considerable effort has been made to explore the search for innovation, little attention has been placed on the concept of problemistic search. Indeed, there are only few studies that examine how the challenges that firms face in their innovation processes shape the nature and direction of their search activities. Using the Finnish Innovation Survey, this study explores the impact of different types of problems on the use of internal and external knowledge sources. The results show that firms under resource constraints tend to use external sources of knowledge in their search activities rather than internal ones. However, those firms who are constrained by finance tend to search both internally and externally. The paper explores the implications of these results for theory and future empirical research.","Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Lappeenranta 53851, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Paananen, M (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, POB 20, Lappeenranta 53851, Finland.",mikko.paananen@lut.fi,,,,,,,75,6,6,5,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Furthermore, this study uses the threshold error-correction model (TECM) to detect the nonlinear casual relationship between RMB exchange rate and macroeconomic variables that are nonlinear forms. The results show that RMB exchange rate and macroeconomic variables have nonlinear relationship with each other.

As both prices are linked to expected future economic performance they should exhibit a long-run relationship. Moreover, changes in sentiment towards commodity investing may affect the nature of the response to disequilibrium. Results support cointegration between stock and commodity prices, while Bai-Perron tests identify breaks in the forecast regression. Forecasts are computed using a standard fixed (static) in-sample/out-of-sample approach and by both recursive and rolling regressions, which incorporate the effects of changing forecast parameter values. A range of model specifications and forecast metrics are used. The historical mean model outperforms the forecast models in both the static and recursive approaches. However, in the rolling forecasts, those models that incorporate information from the long-run stock price/commodity price relationship outperform both the historical mean and other forecast models. Of note, the historical mean still performs relatively well compared to standard forecast models that include the dividend yield and short-term interest rates but not the stock/commodity price ratio.

The design of the packages, in turn, influences the performance of these systems. In this paper we propose an assessment methodology to evaluate the use of combined policy measures (i.e. policy packaging) for the implementation and management of the BRT systems. The framework is tested by comparing and analyzing two BRT systems of the cities of Santiago, Chile and Bogota, Colombia, trying to identify the relations between the system's performance, the measures in the policy packages and the institutional design involved in the project. Discussion of the results and conclusions pointing at future developments are presented at the end of the work.

Notwithstanding obvious improvements of the technical quality, many authorities are not fully satisfied with the outcome of their tendered contracts. Dissatisfaction with patronage development and with the customer focus is widespread. Many contracts are not seen as sufficiently effective in creating a growing PT market share. Enhancing the focus on passenger needs seems essential. There is no evidence that specific contract types or specific financial incentives can guarantee success in the passenger market. However, although tendered contracts obviously provide strong incentives to reduce costs, they seem to be weak in motivating the operator to care for passengers and create opportunities for expanding the market share of PT. The paper examines the reasons for these weaknesses, drawing on professional experiences gained in a 15-years period. In particular, it analyses the functioning of the interaction between the authority and the operator and the role of individuals in contract regimes. The paper develops conclusions for the next generation of contracts and suggestions for further research. The conclusions envisage the development of contractual relationships which strengthen the motivation to care for customers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although Colombia has a major waterway system that could facilitate regional communication, much of the territory is functionally disjointed, which is why the government and private operators seek to promote inland waterway transport and improve their safety. In the field of provision of waterway transport in inaccessible regions, this paper analyses the influence that perceptions of safety and comfort of the service have on the choice of river transport by passengers using hybrid choice models incorporating latent variables. The results of the hybrid choice model indicate that older workers attach less importance to the hull condition and safety; in turn, comfort is more valued by young workers and by those users who have a higher educational level. Variables such as the hull condition and how the boat is operated have a significant effect on the user perception of safety. Similarly, the results suggest that expanding the space between seats and developing strategies to improve the behaviour of other users significantly increase the perceived comfort of the service provided.

However, the vast majority of papers have been implemented in the US setting, and the few other works were single-country studies. In this research, we aim to provide new evidence on the abortion-crime link by examining this issue using a sample of 16 Western European countries. The cross-country investigation allows the exploitation of the different dates of abortion legalization in Europe. We perform regressions of crime rates on different measurements of abortion especially the share of aborted adults, defined as the accumulation of aborted children in the past that would have become adults. We find that abortion rate has a significant and negative impact on crime rates, specifically, homicide and theft. We also observe support for the impact of legalization of abortion on the reduction of crime when considering different calculations of the accumulation of abortions based on different criteria for the legalization of abortion. Thus, our results are consistent with the findings of Donohue and Levitt (2001) for the US. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It combines high-frequency information from emerging and advanced countries so as to explain quarterly national accounts variables through bridge models. The union of all bridge equations leads to our world bridge model (WBM). The WBM approach of this paper is new for two reasons: its equations combine traditional short-run bridging with theoretical level-relationships, and it is the first time that forecasts of world GDP and trade have been computed for both advanced and emerging countries on the basis of a real-time database of approximately 7000 time series. Although the performances of the equations that are searched automatically should be taken as a lower bound, our results show that the forecasting ability of the WBM is superior to the benchmark. Finally, our results confirm that the use of revised data leads to models' forecasting performances being overstated significantly. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.

After controlling for a broad set of individual and household characteristics, we find no difference in education between children of different religions. However, we do find more within-family inequality in children's educational achievements among Muslims relative to non-Muslims. The within-family variance is 15 % higher among Muslims relative to Catholics and 45 % higher relative to immigrants with other religions, but the intra-family inequality remains difficult to explain.

We use this model to analyze the optimal production and price setting decisions of a luxury good manufacturer and contrast them with the decisions that would be made by a social planner. We show that irrespective of the way social welfare is defined, a monopoly producer of the luxury good may select socially optimal prices and quantity. Thus the incentives of the monopolist and the social planner may to some extent be aligned. We also analyze whether the producer and social planner would be willing to sell the luxury good over the internet if this allowed to increase the number of potential customers for the product. We show that under reasonable assumptions the monopoly producer would not oppose the introduction of internet sales, whilst the social planner may do so, depending on the specification of the model's parameters.

For democracy to emerge in Ancient Greece a combination of several enabling factors proved decisive: the development of new military tactic, the phalanx, marked by the appearance of a new type of heavy infantry warrior, the hoplite, who owned individually some property, i.e. land, sufficient to permit him to finance his weaponry and a city-state culture. We describe the emergence of this new type of warrior, link this emergence to the establishment of individual property rights and show how this brought about a military revolution, exemplified in a new tactical formation, the phalanx. We then proceed by showing how the attitudes and learning processes made necessary by this new type of warfare were transformed in the civic values and virtues that shaped democratic institutions.

The magnitude of potential loss, the adverse social and economic consequences for millions of people and considerable fiscal strain imposed on government budgets by extreme weather events all indicate that governments can benefit significantly from the use of an insurance instrument capable not only of covering damage but also of providing an incentive for risk reduction behaviours. By examining the diverse insurance systems that exist in European countries and grouping them into five stylised models, natural hazards insurance is examined in terms of private and public involvement. The paper analyses the performance of different insurance models in relation to information imperfections (i.e. adverse selection and moral hazard) and market imperfections (i.e. charity hazard and transaction costs). In addition, the different models are examined in terms of the extent to which they incentivise mechanisms that facilitate the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to the inevitable impacts of climate change and the development of climate risk finance management. Some concluding remarks are offered regarding the possible future development of a European insurance model as a means of developing an economically effective response to natural hazards caused by climate change.","[Porrini, Donatella] Univ Salento, Lecce, Italy; [Schwarze, Reimund] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Leipzig, Germany",University of Salento; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Porrini, D (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Lecce, Italy.",donatella.porrini@unisalento.it,"; PORRINI, Donatella/N-6000-2015","Schwarze, Reimund/0000-0002-2734-9259; PORRINI, Donatella/0000-0003-0305-5456",,,,,34,35,35,1,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The planning horizon is 5 years in monthly steps. Due to the complex behavior of the monthly inflow time series we use a Bayesian dynamic linear model that incorporates seasonal and autoregressive components. We also use climate variables like monthly precipitation, El Nino and other indices as predictor variables when relevant. The Brazilian power system has 140 hydroelectric plants. Based on geographical considerations, these plants are collated by basin and classified into 15 groups that correspond to the major river basins, in order to reduce the dimension of the problem. The model is then tested for these 15 groups. Each group will have a different forecasting model that can best describe its unique seasonality and characteristics. The results show that the forecasting approach taken in this paper produces substantially better predictions than the current model adopted in Brazil (see Maceira & Damazio, 2006), leading to superior operations planning.

Pricing and advertising strategies are major tools that firms employ to persuade consumers to accept product innovation. Scholars have discussed the significance of pricing and advertising strategies for consumer decision behaviour. According to range theory, people use the range of recalled price experiences to set a lower and upper bound of price expectations, and the attractiveness of a market price is a function of its relative location within this range. Previous research indicates that the pioneer brand's initial price defines consumers' initial reference price, regardless of whether the pioneer brand employs a skimming or penetration strategy. Therefore, this study examined the effects that pricing strategies (i.e. market-skimming pricing vs. market-penetration pricing) and advertising strategies (functional advertisement vs. emotional advertisement) have on consumer-perceived quality, perceived risk, perceived value, and adoption in the context of green product innovation. We proposed a conceptual model comprising 8 hypotheses and adopted a 2 x 2 experimental research design, using a structured questionnaire to collect field data for testing the proposed hypotheses. The results showed that a market-penetration pricing strategy reduces consumer financial risk and increases consumer-perceived value, ultimately increases consumer purchase intention of product innovation. A functional advertisement seems to be more efficient than an emotional advertisement in influencing consumer adoption of product innovation. The results provide theoretical insights into product innovation and management implications for new product providers.","Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Grad Inst Business Adm, New Taipei City 24205, Taiwan",Fu Jen Catholic University,"Lee, BCY (通讯作者)，Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Grad Inst Business Adm, 510 Chung Cheng Rd, New Taipei City 24205, Taiwan.",bchome@ms18.hinet.net,,,,,,,71,12,13,6,147,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

An area that has received much less attention, but is nonetheless important when considering any pricing change, is the impact of such mechanisms on traveler welfare and travel time savings. While an increase in the cost of travel may achieve traffic flow efficiencies, it may also unduly burden low-income travelers or unjustly benefit higher-income drivers. An important aspect of the road pricing debate is not just whether pricing will produce an efficient market, but also if such pricing is implemented, how the generated revenue will be managed. We propose a model to analyze transport equity by measuring change in traveler welfare and travel time savings as a result of a mix of road pricing, revenue recycling (tax cuts) and transit subsidies. In this paper we introduce a multimodal travel demand model to incorporate road pricing mechanisms with various subsidy options. A base case and five scenarios are developed to address various hypothetical pricing scenarios. We find the structure of the road pricing mechanism on average has a small impact on annual per capita traveler welfare. Replacing the state gas tax with a VMT tax can have a positive impact on traveler welfare, particularly for lower-income groups and rural residents. A VMT tax increase would be the least detrimental to welfare, especially for low-income groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This article presents new data from two regional economies: Dublin, Ireland, and Cambridge, UK. It documents the role of 'work-life balance' provision across IT employers in shaping the cross-firm mobility of workers and the tacit knowledge, skills and competencies which they embody. The article disrupts the powerful premise that 'cross-firm labour mobility is always and everywhere good' which informs much of the regional learning literature.

Since ART increases the probability of pregnancy for older women of reproductive age, greater access to ART will make marriage delay less costly for younger single women of reproductive age. Linear probability models are estimated to investigate the effects of ART state insurance mandates on changes in marital status of women in different age groups using the 1977-2010 Current Population Survey. Results show that greater access to ART is associated with marital delay for white (but not for black) women: white women in states with an ART insurance mandate are significantly less likely to marry between the 20-24, 25-29, and 30-34 age ranges, but significantly more likely to marry between the 30-34 and 35-39 age ranges.","US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Abramowitz, J (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",joelle.h.abramowitz@census.gov,,,,,,,38,13,15,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

A key aspect of our analysis is the use of evaluation measures which take account of the entire predictive densities, and not just the probability assigned to the outcome that occurs. Overall, we find considerable heterogeneity in the performance of the surveyed densities at the individual level. However, it is hard to exploit this heterogeneity and improve aggregate performance by trimming poorly performing forecasters in real time. Relative to a set of simple benchmarks, density performance is somewhat better for GDP growth than for inflation, although in the former case it diminishes substantially with the forecast horizon. In addition, we report evidence of an improvement in the relative performance of expert densities during the recent period of macroeconomic volatility. However, our analysis also reveals clear evidence of overconfidence or neglected risks in expert probability assessments, as reflected in frequent occurrences of events which are assigned a zero probability.

Where escalating punishment schemes are present, there is an inherent value in keeping a clean criminal record; a person with a record may unintentionally become a repeat offender if he fails to exert self-control, and be punished more severely. If the punishment for repeat offenders is sufficiently high, one may rationally forgo the opportunity of committing a profitable crime today to avoid being sanctioned as a repeat offender in the future. Therefore, partial deterrence can be achieved at a very low cost through the use of escalating penalties, providing a behavioral justification for punishing repeat offenders more severely.

Thus, on the 7th position in 2000, this country has surpassed France, Britain, Germany and Japan, and became the second world economic power, after United States of America. China has managed the most spectacular leap of development in the modern history, with an average GDP growth of about 10% per year, which was based on an economic model founded on supporting investment, exports and openness to the world economy. However, in recent years it has become increasingly evident that the Chinese development pattern has generated structural imbalances which make it unsustainable in the long term. In the context of Globalization and of China's growing economic openness to the world economy, increasing competition on the global markets puts pressure towards internal changes. The paper aims to analyze the transition from quantitative growth to the qualitative one, based on increasing domestic demand and consumption. In the first part of the article will be presented the chinese economic system characterized by the phrase one country, two systems.

Starting from the reality that economy and culture are dimensions of the social life, having an interrelation, already in the 80s, the concept of culture is taken over and exploited within management. Thus, the anthropologic concept of culture, through reinterpretation and extrapolation, becomes what we nowadays call organizational culture. Essentially, the culture is an amount of human, individual and collective behaviors and values. It has its own dynamic, which guides and allows the group's operating mode.

Lack of data of sentiment proxies constrains authors to use only few proxies, namely, TRIN (Trading Index), trade volume (turnover), number of IPOs per month and change in four-month moving average. We have found that TRIN and moving average significantly affect the residual market returns. This paper also investigates the impact of sentiment on returns of different size portfolios. Results show that the impact of TRIN and trade volume is strong for large and medium size portfolios. However, the effect of TRIN is either low or insignificant for small size portfolio, indicating less interest of investors for neglected stocks. Granger causality tests show that there is unidirectional causality from TRIN to stock returns and strong bi-directional causal relationship between moving average change and stock returns. When conditional volatility is taken into account, effect of sentiment on returns from market and size portfolios decreases and we mostly observe significant effect of sentiment on small size portfolios. Finally, in the presence of other market-wide risk factors, sentiment factors weakly explain individual stock returns. Overall, we conclude that sentiment is a non-egligible consideration for portfolio investors in Bangladesh.","[Chowdhury, Shah Saeed Hassan; Sharmin, Rashida] Prince Mohammad Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia; [Rahman, M.

The questions rise if high frequency trading (HFT) provides more efficient, liquid markets and is economically beneficial. In this paper an algorithm based on statistical arbitrage is tested. Statistical arbitrage is a well-known trading strategy where profit arises from pricing inefficiencies between correlated financial instruments. An algorithm of statistical arbitrage tries to find a pair of correlated instruments that move together and take long/short positions when they diverge abnormally, hoping that the prices will converge in the near future. Recent computational expansion in financial modeling and the ever increasing demand for order execution speed is moving market making and price discovery strategies into high frequency trading (HFT) or the milliseconds realm, where HFT already generates nearly 2/3 of the overall trading volume. In this report we apply high frequency data from NYMEX exchange to test a trading system based on statistical arbitrage in one of the most liquid futures market, Le. natural gas futures. The overall results suggest that statistical arbitrage in HFT environment significantly outperforms traditional trading strategies, provides liquidity to the markets and denies the efficient market hypothesis.","[Driaunys, Kestutis; Masteika, Saulius; Sakalauskas, Virgilijus; Vaitonis, Mantas] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Informat, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Driaunys, K (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Informat, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",kestutis.driaunys@khf.vu.lt; saulius.masteika@khf.vu.lt; virgilijus.sakalauskas@khf.vu.lt; mantas.vaitonis@khf.stud.vu.lt,"Sakalauskas, Virgilijus/G-7293-2011; Sakalauskas, Virgilijus/KCY-0973-2024","Sakalauskas, Virgilijus/0000-0002-5572-8889; Masteika, Saulius/0000-0002-1770-670X",,,,,27,6,6,0,21,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Business is playing its part by offering training opportunities to employees. Collectively, they are spending more than the government's mandated level on training. However, the HIV and AIDS epidemic is eroding this investment in southern Africa where the HIV epidemic is at its worst. While there has been empirical work that provides estimates on the cost of HIV and AIDS to business, there is very little data on the actual amounts large companies spend on training, and how much of this investment is eroded as a result of HIV and AIDS deaths. Using an estimate of the HIV and AIDS death rate in the private sector and survey data which identifies training expenditure by sector, the authors estimate the extent to which HIV and AIDS has potentially eroded this investment. The loss for all sectors was estimated at almost R10 million (R9,871,732) during the study year, which equates to USD1,183,661 per annum. This amount represented on average 0.73 per cent of the actual investment in training. The real costs of HIV and AIDS on business, which includes absenteeism, declining productivity and other costs are difficult to quantify, but they are likely to significantly exceed this lost training investment as a result of increasing morbidity and mortality rates due to HIV. It is therefore in a company's best interest to: (1) ensure that a sound HIV and AIDS policy is in place; (2) invest in effective prevention programmes; and (3) provide the appropriate ARV treatment to infected employees if this treatment is not easily accessible through the public health sector.","[George, Gavin; Surgey, Gavin] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Hlth Econ & HIV & AIDS Res Div HEARD, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Gow, Jeff] Univ So Queensland, Sch Commerce, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia",University of Southern Queensland,"George, G (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Hlth Econ & HIV & AIDS Res Div HEARD, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia.",,"Surgey, Gavin/GQP-5762-2022; George, Gavin/N-5756-2013; Gow, Jeff/L-9647-2017","George, Gavin/0000-0001-7258-8470; Gow, Jeff/0000-0002-5726-298X; Surgey, Gavin/0000-0003-1832-3716",,,,,26,3,4,0,6,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This study investigates the relationship between employment and ethnic identity and complements the literature by capturing a novel dimension of ethnic identity: openness to majority norms. Reproducing measures from earlier studies, I find that immigrants' employment outcomes do not systematically associate with their ethnic identity. However, immigrants who share social norms with the majority experience significantly better employment outcomes, particularly first-generation immigrant women. Furthermore, I show that interethnic differentials in majority norms could account for up to 20 % of the explained part of the employment gap between natives and first-generation immigrants. Those results shed more light on the interethnic employment gap and aspects of immigrants' identity relevant to economic integration.","[Gorinas, Cedric] Danish Natl Ctr Social Res SFI, DK-1052 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gorinas, Cedric] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Gorinas, C (通讯作者)，Danish Natl Ctr Social Res SFI, Herluf Trolles Gade 11, DK-1052 Copenhagen, Denmark.",cgorinas@asb.dk,,,,,,,43,22,25,1,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The implementation of internal communication strategies can be a way to enhance company efficiency and it can also increase and support engagement of employees in everyday company operations and connect the employees expectations and increase their morale. On the other hand, inefficient communication is a stress factor paralysing the key functions in a company structure and its strategy. The conducted research has proved the crucial role of internal communication in producing superior financial results and the implementation of internal communication into strategic management is considered to be a necessary condition for efficient internal communication in any company operating in the global market. The implementation of internal communication into strategic management of the company means accepting the importance of staff as communicators and partners and thus seeing them as the most important asset for the company. The conducted research carried out in 252 companies operating in the Czech market has shown that strategic and systematic internal communication is important for the company profitability and its competitiveness. Small companies do not focus on internal communication as such and solve the communication issues intuitively and ad hoc, however, it is important to set certain strategies of internal communication into a company management so that the problems of insufficient communication are eliminated as much as possible. The research has proved that in the companies which systematically manage their internal communication the efficiency evaluation of the internal communication is significantly higher than in the ones which do not manage their internal communication systematically, and in the companies which include internal communication in their strategic management the evaluation of efficiency of internal communication is significantly higher than in other companies.","[Hola, Jana] Univ Pardubice, Fac Hlth Studies, Dept Informat Management & Radiol, Pardubice, Czech Republic; [Pikhart, Marcel] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat Technol & Management, Dept Appl Linguist, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice; University of Hradec Kralove,"Holá, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Hlth Studies, Dept Informat Management & Radiol, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",jana.hola@upce.cz; marcel.pikhart@uhk.cz,"Hola, Jana/A-9900-2015; Pikhart, Marcel/D-8945-2012; Holá, Jana/KCZ-2593-2024","Hola, Jana/0000-0003-2671-0855; Pikhart, Marcel/0000-0002-5633-9332;",,,,,18,17,22,5,80,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However, taking a closer look at the art markets, it is rather the temporal dimensions that are striking. Art market actors (e.g. artists, critics, gallerists, buyers, collectors, curators) are gathering in temporary locations and at temporary events such as art exhibition openings, art fairs, auctions, performances and vernissages. Within economic geography literature, the role of temporary spaces and events has been increasingly discussed in relation to economic activities and their performance, efficiency and creativity. An important insight gained in this literature is how temporary events, despite their short-lived existence, create microcosms of an industry or sector. Some temporary events even gather enough resources, skills and power to become field-configuring. In this paper, the primary art market will be discussed from the theoretical perspectives of value-making processes, temporary spaces and events, and field-configuring events. More specifically, the study focuses on temporary spaces important to galleries involved in selling and promoting primary art and artists. It focuses on how temporary spaces constitute both a characteristic feature of the art market and important spaces for creating both cultural and economic values. Empirically, this paper is based on a study of the Swedish primary art galleries and in particular it deals with primary art galleries located in Stockholm, and studies how they use temporary spaces and events in creating both cultural and economic values to themselves, the artists and their artworks. Three empirical examples characteristic to primary art galleries are examined; the opening, the art fair and the mobile art district.",,,,,,,,,,,46,6,6,1,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Those users would be legally obliged to bear the brunt of freeway costs instead of avoiding the payment of any out-of-pocket costs. As expected, the implementation of ETC has not been successful because of the travel patterns of freeway users. The spike model was adopted in this study to minimise estimation errors caused by users who were unwilling to pay. The estimation results revealed that compared with other user groups, short-distance freeway users who did not pass through toll stations were less willing to pay for an OBU. In addition, the willingness to pay price for tolls increased with travel distance. In addition, this study demonstrated that short-distance freeway users who did not pass through toll stations evinced low levels of willingness to pay due to various factors, such as low freeway usage rate, trips that occurred during off-peak hours, and short travel time.

The engagement of the Czech Republic in European integration processes, the high point of which was the country joining the European Union, has had a considerable impact on the Czech economy and its engagement in international economic relations. As early as in the preaccession period, the territorial structure of foreign trade of the Czech Republic changed as the orientation to EU-member countries, especially Germany, became more prominent. Once the Czech Republic joined the EU, the country's foreign trade started undergoing dynamic development. The national economy's orientation to the EU is also visible in the domain of direct foreign investment. In the long-term view, nearly 90% of FDI received by the Czech Republic comes from EU countries. In terms of workforce movement, the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU has been projected in the rapid growth of foreign workers from Slovakia and from Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania (we do not include Ukraine, which is not a member of the EU).

Providing respondents with on-site experience about forest ecosystem management alternatives may influence their expectation of the effects from new policies and programs. In the research reported here, we investigate whether preference parameters for attributes of low-impact timber harvesting programs differ between respondents to a mail survey versus respondents provided with an on-site forest experience (walk through a research forest). The empirical analysis in our application shows that stated preferences for timber harvesting attributes are not statistically different between the mail and on-site applications of the survey, and this result is robust to pretest (before experience) and post-test (post experience) applications.

It is based on the analysis of the most relevant types of PA (national park, nature park, biosphere reserve), constituting part of the supply of tourism development, and a representative survey of the German population interested in holidays in the alpine area, representing the demand. Our analysis of the legal framework showed that all three types of PA facilitate tourism development, albeit in different ways. The survey included a generic choice experiment of alpine destinations with 17 attributes. Its location in or close to a PA was included as one variable. This destination demand study in an area of origin provided a different perspective on the preference for PA compared to other studies, and revealed significant differences between respondents with and without previous experiences in the Alps. The alpine experienced tourist is more likely to distinguish between the various types of PA such as national park and nature park. For the inexperienced alpine tourist, representing latent demand, the branding effect of PA is rather limited. For nearly all tourists, experienced and inexperienced, and across all segments, offers that include a nature experience are important. Nature experience, which is offered by all types of PA, is of high relevance within the destination choice and should therefore be used more intensely in destination marketing based on PA. Overall, this study shows that the role of PA for destination choice is not as strong as is reported by most of the published literature, as most of these studies are based on surveys in the destination and use single item scaling questions, which overvalue the role of PA.","[Proebstl-Haider, Ulrike] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Agr Univ Vienna, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Haider, Wolfgang] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Ctr Tourism Policy & Res, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Simon Fraser University","Pröbstl-Haider, U (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Agr Univ Vienna, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",ulrike.proebstl@boku.ac.at; whaider@sfu.ca,,,,,,,99,16,17,3,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

However, very little attention is paid to the topic, how different brand elements, attributes or factors shape in consumers' minds the perception of brand personality. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to fill the existing gap in the literature by providing a better understanding about what factors form the perception of brand personality. The qualitative study consisting of in-depth interviews was done in beer market, investigating how different attributes shape the consumers' perception of beer brands personalities. The study revealed that brand personalities were mostly impacted by design of bottle and label, design colours and advertisements.

The goal of the article is to propose a complex targeted FDI policy, the employment of which would give benefits to the host country and achieve its strategic goals.

Final results reveal that Lithuania, attracting FDI into research and development area, gains great benefits and exploits opportunities. At the same time, the highest costs might be generated while implementing a FDI policy in this area. A FDI policy towards service sectors would cause the least amount of risks.

To allocate indirect costs (also called as overhead or common costs) to cost objects cost drivers are selected as the cost allocation bases. Selecting the cost drivers is critically important for developing costing methodology. In order to improve the accuracy and credibility of the allocation the most appropriate cost drivers should be selected, and more than one cost driver should be applied. Thus the decision on which and how many cost drivers to use is of critical importance. The number of cost drivers should be optimal, as an excess number of cost drivers could lead to skewed results. The aim of this article is to present the theoretical framework of the cost drivers, including the selection of cost drivers, and to report on the author's research on cost accounting. The article describes cost drivers, specifies their meaning, gives an overview of their classification, typologies, and also discusses the selection methods, relevant research papers and other issues regarding the cost drivers.

Usually its parameters are estimated by generalized method of moments (GMM) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. However, the estimations could be heavily affected by outliers. To overcome this problem, in this paper an alternative approach, the weighted empirical likelihood (WEL) method, is proposed. This method uses moment conditions as constraints and the outliers are detected automatically by performing a k-means clustering on Oja depth values of innovations. The performance of WEL is evaluated against those of GMM and ML methods through extensive simulations, in which three different kinds of additive outliers are considered. Moreover, the robustness of WEL is demonstrated by comparing the volatility forecasts of the three methods on 10-minute returns of the S&P 500 index. The results from both the simulations and the S&P 500 volatility forecasts have shown preferences in using the WEL method.

The network planning changes included the concentration of services into corridors, more direct services, and greater network connectivity. Bus supply and patronage data are analysed for the 15 metropolitan bus contract regions in Sydney to test whether network planning changes increased patronage and whether the trade-offs in service planning had greater benefits than losses. Results show that changes in bus boardings are mainly driven by changes in km supplied, and that there are significant differences between the contract regions operated by State Transit Authority and private operators. The network reviews have a significant impact on boardings in several contract regions over and above the additional km supplied.

Renewable energy project selection is a multi actors and sophisticated problem because it is a need to incorporate social, economic, technological, and environmental considerations. Multi criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are powerful tools to evaluate and rank the alternatives among a pool of alternatives and select the best one. COPRAS (COmplex PRoportional ASsessment) is an MCDM technique which determines the best alternative by calculating the ratio to the ideal solution and the negative ideal solution. On the other hand, analytical hierarchy process (AB?) is widely used in order to calculate the importance weights of evaluation criteria. In this paper an integrated COPRAS-AHP methodology is proposed to select the best renewable energy project. In order to validate the output of the proposed model, the model is compared with five MCDM tools. The results of this paper demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed model in selecting the most appropriate renewable energy option among the existing alternatives.","[Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza; Fouladgar, Mohammad Majid] Islamic Azad Univ, South Tehran Branch, Young Researchers Club, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Moini, S.

After explaining the differential impact of the crises on EU economies, we analyze how the economic policies developed thus far not only are unable to resolve the current crisis pattern but also actually entail a risk to the present democratic models by transferring the legitimate control over governments from citizens and democratic parliaments to unelected, nonrepresentative international financial markets.","[Garcia-Arias, Jorge; Fernandez-Huerga, Eduardo; Salvador, Ana] Univ Leon, Dept Econ, E-24071 Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Garcia-Arias, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leon, Dept Econ, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",jrgara@unileon.es,"Fernández-Huerga, Eduardo/AAC-5767-2019; Garcia-Arias, Jorge/AGF-8614-2022","Fernández-Huerga, Eduardo/0000-0001-8974-0440; Salvador Chamorro, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-7709-4645",,,,,44,7,7,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

To do so, I implement a CGE model to explain Taiwan's economic miracle during the period 1965-2005. I find that Taiwan's demographic transition accounts for 22 % of per capita output growth and 17.7 % of investment rate for the period 1965-2005.

However, the general shortage in housing supply is contrasting with the low occupancy rate of newly constructed public housing units. In contrast, despite their bad living conditions, informal settlements have a high occupancy rate. In order to analyse the reasons behind this contradiction, the paper compares four neighbourhoods ranging from formal and semi-informal to informal housing production and including one rehabilitation project. The livelihood conditions in each settlement are unravelled with the concept of modes of economic integration from Polanyi. For this purpose, semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed with correspondence analysis. The findings indicate a preference among low-income groups for informal settlements because of three reasons: the advantages of geographical location, the nature of social networks and the strength of private redistribution systems, thus enabling an easier access to means of existence. The results and recommendations are further discussed in the paper.","[Abouelmagd, Doaa] Helwan Univ, Fac Fine Arts, Dept Architecture, Cairo, Egypt; [Abouelmagd, Doaa; Kesteloot, Christian] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Louvain, Belgium; [Abouelmagd, Doaa; Corijn, Eric] Vrije Univ Brussel, Cosmopolis, Brussels, Belgium",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Helwan University; KU Leuven; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Abouelmagd, D (通讯作者)，Helwan Univ, Fac Fine Arts, Dept Architecture, Cairo, Egypt.",dooa_abo@yahoo.com; chris.kesteloot@ees.kuleuven.be; eacorijn@vub.ac.be,"Abouelmagd, Doaa Ahmed/R-5227-2019","Abouelmagd, Doaa Ahmed/0000-0002-8370-5705; Kesteloot, Chris/0000-0002-4305-096X",,,,,42,3,4,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

There exist, on average, three opportunities to close arbitrage positions, at a time before completion dates, when the target and acquiring stock prices converge.

But global per capita emissions appear to be better constrained than total emissions, which we argue has an economic justification. Trend stationarity of per capita emissions may provide a means of characterizing the relative likelihood of global forecasts. On data spanning 1950 to 2009 a unit root hypothesis allowing for endogenous structural breaks is rejected, but adding in the 2010 observation pushes the p-value slightly over 0.1. Since structural breaks cannot be detected at the end of sample this may simply indicate a power problem. Using Monte Carlo simulations we conclude that the lower half of a well-known suite of IPCC emission scenarios is more likely to occur than the upper half, and the top quartile is particularly difficult to justify.

However, there is one aspect of social action that has persisted at least in spirit. The purpose of the article is to show how traditional mutual help remains important, has been transformed in the transition to modernity, and has contributed to the continuing development of Japanese society. Mutual help can be divided into three types: yui, reciprocity through exchanging labor; moyai, redistribution based on a common store of goods and resources; and tetsudai, nonreciprocal support in social rites of passage. While these customs have almost disappeared from modern life, the tradition of mutual help is still manifest in some modern civic activities. The social system of mutual help arose from indigenous conditions in order to overcome the tragedy of the commons. Modern society might do well to reconsider such mutual help networks in search of ways of solving both public and private social problems in Japan and overseas as well.","Ryutsu Keizai Univ, Dept Sociol, Ryugasaki, Ibaraki 3018555, Japan",,"Onda, M (通讯作者)，Ryutsu Keizai Univ, Dept Sociol, Hirahata 122, Ryugasaki, Ibaraki 3018555, Japan.",morio.onda@nifty.com,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23530679] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,82,4,6,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This generalizes most previous tests which compare forecast errors of a benchmark model with errors of a proposed alternative model, not allowing for shrinkage. We show that our test is a particular extension of a recently developed test of the martingale difference hypothesis. Using simulations we explore the behavior of our test in small and moderate samples. Numerical results indicate that the test has good size and power properties. Finally, we illustrate the use of our test in an empirical application within the exchange rate literature.

Younger production lines and lines that have undergone modernization are more likely to survive. Our results indicate that lines that are operated by integrated producers are more likely to exit.

Based on data from 2000-2007, for 248 electronics and information technology firms in Taiwan, we indicate that technology alliances do not encourage firms to diversify a technology base over time. Decisions in regards to the utilization of external TK can also be traced to TK distance, network centrality and complementary assets. First, TK distance has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the technology base scope. Second, the mere consideration of network centrality and TK distance cannot determine the technology base scope. Third, a firm converges its technology base through combined complementary assets with TK distance and network centrality.","[Lai, Hsien-Che] Natl Univ Tainan, Grad Inst Technol Management, Tainan 702, Taiwan; [Weng, Calvin S.] Takming Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",National University Tainan; Takming University Science & Technology,"Lai, HC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Tainan, Grad Inst Technol Management, 65 Yu Nan St, Tainan 702, Taiwan.",hsienche@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,9,11,5,99,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

We focus in this paper on West and North Africa which reveal similarities but also structural differences which are explored further. The importance of paratransit in its various forms is strongly observed in sub-Saharan Africa and to a lesser extent in North Africa. The attempts to regulate and organise this sector have been difficult; one interesting experience in Dakar occurred during a programme of fleet renewal. In parallel it is observed that there are positive but insufficient experiences of public transport authorities in some cities (Dakar, Abidjan) and similar projects postponed in other cities because of the institutional problems. One also observes the constant difficulties of designing sustainable schemes for bus companies. An answer to this crisis has been found in North Africa, through investment in new mass transport systems. However, mass transport projects in West Africa are very weak in comparison. The gap between public transport costs and income levels there remains a major obstacle to sustainable mobility exacerbated by the poverty of a significant part of the urban population in West Africa. Two other critical factors are also identified affecting sustainable mobility requirements, namely, the urban sprawl and increasing energy costs. Finally the conclusion recommends the use of research and expertise networks in order to help the design and the implementation of suited solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We report two main findings. First, for longer horizon forecasts, long memory models generally produce forecasts of the covariance matrix that are statistically more accurate and informative, and economically more useful than those produced by short memory models. Second, the two parsimonious long memory EWMA models outperform the other models - both short and long memory - across most forecast horizons. These results apply to both low and high dimensional covariance matrices and both low and high correlation assets, and are robust to the choice of the estimation window.

Second-generation immigrants' less favorable socioeconomic background largely accounts for this additional disadvantage, suggesting that immigrants are disproportionately affected by prevailing social inequalities at the transition to secondary school.

A Policy Implementation Strategy (PIS) adopts a broad view of implementation, which is argued to transcend formulation and decision-making, thereby offering a more realistic view of the policy process. Governmental decision-makers are often faced with having to choose one PIS from among several possible alternatives, at varying cost levels. In order to aid such a decision-making process, PIS effectiveness forecasts are proposed as a strategic decision-support tool. The methods currently available for such a purpose are found to include resource-intensive evaluative techniques such as Impact Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis. In this study, a Structured Analogies forecasting approach is proposed, and the empirical evidence suggests that it could be seen as a strategic tool in the hands of governmental officers.

Often, forecasts are produced using a Forecasting Support System that integrates univariate statistical forecasts with judgment from experts in the organization. Managers then add information to the forecast, such as future promotions, potentially improving the accuracy. Despite the importance of judgment and promotions, papers devoted to studying their relationship with forecasting performance are scarce. We analyze the accuracy of managerial adjustments in periods of promotions, based on weekly data from a manufacturing company. Intervention analysis is used to establish whether judgmental adjustments can be replaced by multivariate statistical models when responding to promotional information. We show that judgmental adjustments can enhance baseline forecasts during promotions, but not systematically. Transfer function models based on past promotions information achieved lower overall forecasting errors. Finally, a hybrid model illustrates the fact that human experts still added value to the transfer function models. (C) 2012 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However this practice is filled with difficulties of different kinds, from conflicting measures in the same package to simply bad packaging design, disregarding synergetic effects that can be achieved with the simultaneous or synchronized adoption of more than one policy measure. This problem has long been identified and is especially intense in urban areas. However it has not yet been solved. It is worth mentioning that there is a common perception by several authors that these difficulties are much related with the institutional design and legal framework which constitute an outset condition of the decision process. This perception will be only a departure hypothesis in our analysis, since the empirical work entailed in this research will be supported by a structured analysis of a large number of BRT implementation cases.

The period that followed was rich in lessons. New Zealand was at the time the only other country engaging in a reform based upon market initiative (implemented in 1991). Other countries chose for a less extreme and more consensual way to introduce competitive incentives, choosing the fundamentally different competitive tendering (CT) path. As a result, the so-called 'Scandinavian model' developed, based upon the London example of route tendering. Later the Netherlands adopted a network tendering approach, resembling the French practice of network tendering though with more operator freedom. This paper focuses on recent experiences (outside developing countries) with market-initiated competition, as opposed to authority-initiated competition through competitive tendering. The paper covers the experiences of Great Britain and New Zealand, and the opposite example of Sweden were a partial deregulation will soon be implemented as a result of disappointment with earlier results of CT. It describes the expectations that came with their introduction, and some of their perceived shortcomings, and analyses the legal changes enacted to cope with revealed shortcomings. By doing so, the paper describes, compares and draws a few conclusions on the institutional evolutions that can be observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It presents a six-stage metamorphosing circle starting from conception and going on to formatting, promotion, adaptation, transmutation and, finally, internal supervision as part of an institutionally bounded mode of production based on copy/paste and updating procedures. Such a mode is called pastiche production' and it may be considered as a less innovative variant of bricolage, more suited to those players in advanced economies who mediate between global financial markets and national retail credit markets. From this empirical perspective, the conceptual separation between innovation and imitation is reconsidered, as the two notions seem to be deeply entangled in practice, in the sense that what appears like innovation at the national level may basically be an imitative propensity on an international or global scale. Moreover, the idea that innovation and imitation represent core principles of social organization (cf. Tarde) is also questioned in relation to modern finance, as they appear less like causes and more like consequences of institutional practices and governance procedures designed to organize mass payment behaviour capable of generating regular and substantial cash flows.","[Lopes, Daniel Seabra] SOCIUS Res Ctr Econ & Org Sociol, Sch Econ & Management, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Lopes, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Lisboa, Res Ctr Econ & Org Sociol SOCIUS, Sch Econ & Management, Lisbon, Portugal.",dseabralopes@gmail.com,"Lopes, Daniel Seabra/I-7040-2013","Lopes, Daniel Seabra/0000-0001-8202-1355",,,,,56,10,11,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Likewise, WCM was measured by the average collection period (ACP), average pay period (APP), inventory turnover days (ITID) and comprehensively by the cash conversion cycle (CCC). The results indicate that the firms' have been inefficient with WCM and caused significant reductions in profitability.

These ratings influence the countries credit rating and ipso facto of their enterprises. Is a more scientific approach, eventually on a quantitative basis, not possible? Therefore, MULTIMOORA, a quantitative method, is suggested. MULTIMOORA compares multiple objectives expressed in different units as much as possible on a non-subjective basis. In opposition to similar methods MULTIMOORA does not need normalization, being based on dimensionless measures. Importance of an objective can eventually be given by the stakeholders concerned. MULTIMOORA is composed of three approaches: Ratio System, Reference Point and Multiplicative Form Methods, all the three of the same importance and each controlling each other. Twenty two objectives, 10 originating from statistics and 12 from statistics and forecasts, important for the future, characterize the 27 EU-Countries economies. A Dominance Theory, summarizing the three obtained ordinal numbers per country ranks the 27 European Union Countries concerning these countries credit rating into three CORE categories. If Standard & Poor's Credit Rating System is compared to this CORE method no many differences arise. Only CORE is the work of maximum four par time researchers against the 10,000 employees of Standard & Poor's worldwide. In addition Standard & Poor's is an example of qualitative judgment against the quantitative research of CORE. As the classifications of Moody's and Fitch are very similar to this one of Standard & Poor's the outcome would be the same for these other Credit Rating Agencies.","[Brauers, Willem Karel M.] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2600 Antwerp, Belgium; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Inst Internet & Intelligent Technol, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Antwerp; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Brauers, WKM (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, F Birontlaan 97, B-2600 Antwerp, Belgium.",willem.brauers@ua.ac.be; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Brauers, Willem/AAS-5072-2021","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X;",,,,,38,8,8,0,9,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The escape thesis argues that a significant stratum of informal workers enters and performs these occupations for their own reasons, in stable jobs, with possibilities for accumulation, personal and professional development. Based on these two analyses, the objective of this article is to formulate the conceptualization and application of a new methodology to identify and quantify the social-demographic and labor characteristics of workers in employment situations that comply with the thesis in escape, that such occupations are called post-informality. The proposal enumerates amply the manner of making the methodology operational, detailing the phases and processes to achieve the quantification of post-informal workers. This proposal intends to contribute to understanding the new tendencies of informal employment and thereby, contribute to implementing more efficient and effective public policies for resolving this problem of the current labor markets.","[Cervantes, Jose Juan; Acharya, Arun Kumar] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Inst Invest Sociales, San Nicolas, Nuevo Leon, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon,"Cervantes, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Inst Invest Sociales, San Nicolas, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.",yare95@gmail.com; acharya_77@yahoo.com,"Acharya, Arun/AAY-1516-2020","Acharya, Arun/0000-0002-2696-3038",,,,,30,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Trip demands were estimated with zero truncated negative binomial models to account for over-dispersion. The study established a recreational value of R2.167 billion in 2010 prices for the site as a whole. By partitioning the sample into visitors who indicated having been attracted or not to the area by its nature and biodiversity, a net biodiversity value of R2 866 per trip was calculated. Allocated between marine and terrestrial resources based on the proportion of activities related to each type of resource, the value of plant biodiversity was estimated to be R2 268 per hectare in 2010to 2010 prices.","[Conradie, Beatrice] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; Univ Cape Town, Ctr Social Sci Res, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Conradie, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",,"Conradie, Beatrice/ABG-3218-2020","Conradie, Beatrice/0000-0002-4675-6300",,,,,38,6,7,0,9,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Defining the key elements for a business environment contributing to such differences is an ambiguous issue. Mostly researchers tend to focus on the resulting factors (GDP, economic activity, number of enterprises, etc.), not on the initial ones. According to this report the decision on the location of a firm is treated as a prime factor attributing to the level of the development of the specific region in Latvia if all other factors are believed to be constant in a moment of time. The main purpose of this report is to go even deeper - namely, to make a research on a list of sub-factors of the business environment contributing to the decision on the location of a firm in Latvia. Different levels of regional competitiveness within a country, its ability to maintain high rates of economic growth and attract investors-those are the results of the specific composition of the business environment. After statistic data analyze (regression and correlation analyze) and research (study of the literature, expert interview method) on the general elements of the business environment in the world and in Latvia, as well as research on competitiveness elements, this paper reveals some crucial aspects for an average decision on the location of a firm; characterizes the overall set-up and offers a list of suggestions to solve the problem of imbalances.

The investigation of the CSR phenomenon is based on modern theories and concepts, such as corporate social responsibility, corporate social performance and sustainable development. Main characteristics of corporate social responsibility in Russia are given in the paper; main problems are exposed and ways to overcome them are outlined. Practical implication: the results of the study may be used in the operation of Russian companies. The conclusions and recommendations are based on empirical study. Corporate social responsibility is not terra incognita for Russia. There were a lot of philanthropy traditions in Russia in the 18-19th centuries. So it will be better to attribute contemporary processes in this sphere as a renaissance. There are certain reasons for Russian business to pay special attention to CSR phenomenon, i.e. economic crisis, international activity, demographic and social problems etc. Besides, states (governments) try to redistribute social responsibility - in favor of business. There are certain results of CSR renaissance in Russia in 2003-2012: There are a lot of companies, which demonstrate (or at least declare) their social responsibility in the non-financial reports (327 reports in 2000-2012); Society is now interested in domestic and transnational responsible companies; CSR is a sphere of scientific interest, moreover, it's now an academic discipline. But at the same time there are certain problems the ideas and principles of are not widely known (in comparison with Europe and USA), especially among domestic companies; corporate social activity is a result of non-market pressure, so it is re-active, but not active; CSR is not treated as a factor of sustainable development of companies. It's impossible to receive the benefits of CSR beyond market mechanism. Thus, it's difficult to overestimate the role of government in the process of creation and restoration of the institute of CSR.","[Sudova, Tatjana; Kanaeva, Olga] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,,s_tl@mail.ru,"Kanaeva, Olga/H-1511-2015",,,,,,7,0,0,0,11,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,584,591,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100055,0

However, most cross-industry analyses still overlook the organisational character of innovation in services. In this article, we use latent class analysis to examine the nature of innovation in 2148 firms from 20 service industries in Spain. On the basis of the analysis of 10 innovation types and 5 kinds of innovation activities, a taxonomy composed of 2 R&D-intensive and 2 non-R&D-intensive clusters is proposed. The findings indicate that organisational innovation counts for three of the four profiles, the new management techniques being the most common organisational innovation in all clusters. Furthermore, micro- and small-sized firms from several subsectors are more likely to be R&D-oriented than medium and large companies. The results underline the coexistence of different innovation patterns within the same industry as well as the predominance of hidden innovators in several industries.","[Trigo, Alexandre] Univ Santiago de Compostela, ICEDE Res Grp, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Trigo, Alexandre] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Appl Econ, Santiago De Compostela, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Trigo, A (通讯作者)，Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariais, Av Burgo Nac, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",alexandretrigo@gmail.com,,,,,,,97,23,25,1,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

While action is defined by conscious, disciplined, long-term goal-oriented behaviour, non-action is characterized by lack of focusing, lack of energy and the disability to cope. Non-action and passiveness are distinguished and different reasons for non-action are shown. Some leaders are non-active due to a lack of focus and tend to lack prioritizing (thematic straying), be driven only by the immediate situational needs only (reactiveness), lack planning and reflection (activism), be unable to develop new plans of action (use of behavioural templates) and lack the ability to translate intentions into actions (state orientation). Other leaders lack the energy to act, caused by the denial of the need for action (defensive avoidance), an inwardly, uninvolved attitude (distanced activity) or the subjective lack of influence (learned helplessness). After these different types of leadership behaviour and its roots are described, a short excursion shows the most important facts and differences between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. As a result, the different types of leadership behaviour are analysed in regards to their impact on subordinate motivation or demotivation. It is shown, that leadership action tends to be more motivating for employees then non-action, while still bearing some threats. Leadership action can motivate employees by serving as an example, giving orientation and meaning to their tasks. On the other hand, if a leader seems to be too perfect in its behaviour, employees tend to feel inferior and lose their motivation. Leadership non-action does not have any potential to motivate subordinates, even though the different characteristics do have different levels of negative impact on subordinate motivation. As a conclusion, hands-on suggestions are given how leaders should behave in their day-to-day worklife in order to motivate their subordinates.","[Wagner, Barbara] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,btwagner@web.de,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,14,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,663,669,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100063,0

Pursuant to this authority, states have established a complex web of regulations that limit the ability of beer, wine, and liquor producers to control the distribution of their product. From a consumer welfare perspective, one of the most potentially harmful state alcohol distribution regulations are post and hold laws (PH laws). PH laws require that alcohol distributors share future prices with rivals by posting them in advance, and then hold these prices for a specified period of time. Economic theory would suggest that PH laws reduce unilateral incentives for distributors to reduce prices and may facilitate tacit or explicit collusion, both to the detriment of consumers. Consistent with economic theory, we show that the PH laws reduce consumption by 2-8%. We also test whether, by reducing consumption, PH laws provide offsetting societal benefits in the form of reducing drunk driving accidents and underage drinking. We find no measurable relationship between PH laws and these social harms. These results suggest a socially beneficial role for antitrust challenges to PH laws and similar anticompetitive state regulation. If states wish to reduce the social ills associated with drinking, our results also suggest that directly targeting social harms with zero tolerance laws and lower drunk driving thresholds are superior policy instruments to PH laws.

This paper shows that in the absence of an AA, a network is stable if its alliances are large enough, and in the presence of an AA, more competitive structures can be sustained through bilateral agreements.

Given the implied policy potential, we conducted an extensive reward experiment in real world conditions on a congested motorway corridor in the Netherlands. In this paper the data collected in the experiment are used to estimate a number of discrete choice models that describe the commuter's behaviour with respect to departure time choice as well as transport mode choice. We apply the traditional scheduling approach where rush-hour travellers trade off travel time for schedule delay disutility, and we study how this equilibrium shifts upon the introduction of a reward. The results of our analysis provide a clear indication that a reward can be used as an effective policy instrument. The participant's behaviour implies that the shadow prices of schedule delay are close to constant over time, a finding which is in line with the classic assumptions in the literature. Preferences for different departure times for car trips within the rush-hour are found to be correlated. This indicates that shifting departure time is likely to be a more important behavioural response to policies for congestion relief than a modal shift or teleworking. If we compare the relative as well as the absolute sizes of the different valuations of schedule delay early, schedule delay late and travel time, we find that they are comparable to past findings in the literature.

Therefore, it is shown under which econometrically testable assumptions on accounting costs a meaningful lower bound for cartel-damage can consistently be estimated when using accounting data.

We analyse the innovative performance of Belgian firms and relate it to agglomeration measures, as well as to a number of control variables. Our findings show a positive impact of localisation and urbanisation economies on firm-level innovation output, lending support to the hypothesis that firms can benefit from their location within regions/sectors characterised by high employment concentration. In an analysis of low, medium, and high-tech manufacturing and service industries, localisation economies are shown to improve firms' innovativeness only for low-tech manufacturing and service sectors, while urbanisation externalities are shown to matter more for high-tech service sectors. This suggests that localisation economies can be an important source of competitiveness for low-tech sectors, while urbanisation economies improve innovativeness of high-tech service firms.","[De Beule, Filip; Van Beveren, Ilke] Lessius Univ Coll, Dept Business Studies, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [De Beule, Filip; Van Beveren, Ilke] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Louvain, Belgium; [Van Beveren, Ilke] Katholieke Univ Leuven, VIVES Ctr Reg Econ Policy, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"De Beule, F (通讯作者)，Lessius Univ Coll, Dept Business Studies, Korte Nieuwstr 33, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",filip.debeule@lessius.eu; ilke.vanbeveren@lessius.eu,"De Beule, Filip/X-6763-2019; Van Beveren, Ilke/C-8046-2013","De Beule, Filip/0000-0001-8581-6751; Van Beveren, Ilke/0000-0002-3766-1078",,,,,72,28,31,3,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

It considers a firm that is contemplating entering a market served by an incumbent. The firm can adopt either a decentralized or a centralized authority structure. In the former, authority is delegated to an agent, while in the latter, it is retained by the principal. We address the questions of how the toughness of future product market competition affects the delegation decision, and how this decision in turn affects product market competition. The delegation decision is determined by a trade-off between inducing the agent to take greater initiative and accepting lower operating profits from a less efficient decision taken by the agent.","[Hur, Jung] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea; [Riyanto, Yohanes E.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Econ, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Sogang University; Nanyang Technological University,"Hur, J (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Shinsu Dong, Seoul 121742, South Korea.",ecsjhur@sogang.ac.kr; yeriyanto@ntu.edu.sg,"Hur, Jung/AAV-7700-2021; Riyanto, Yohanes E./C-2939-2009","Hur, Jung/0000-0002-6013-0056; Riyanto, Yohanes E./0000-0001-7343-4043",,,,,24,5,6,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

To this end, we use annual data for the US, UK and Sweden over the past forty years and estimate country-specific systems of labour demand and Gini coefficient equations. Further to the statistical significance of our models, we validate their economic significance through counterfactual simulations. In particular, we evaluate the contributions of the labour share to the trajectories of inequality and employment during specific time intervals in the post-1990 years. We find that during the 1990s the cost of a one per cent increase in employment was in the range of 0.7 per cent-0.9 per cent higher inequality in all three countries. However, in the 2000s, whereas the inequality-employment sensitivity ratio slightly fell in the US, it exceeded unity in the countries on the other side of the Atlantic. It obtained its highest value in the UK, where a 1 per cent growth in employment was achieved at the expense of 1.3 per cent worsening in income inequality. We argue that the inequality-employment sensitivity ratio can be viewed as a barometer of socio-economic pressure, and thus the evolution of the wage-productivity gap and its impacts on the personal income distribution and labour demand deserve the attention of policy makers.","[Karanassou, Marika] Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England; [Sala, Hector] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Bellaterra 08193, Spain",University of London; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Karanassou, M (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",m.karanassou@qmul.ac.uk; hector.sala@uab.es,"Sala, Hector/K-6370-2017","Sala, Hector/0000-0002-3043-2790",,,,,46,3,3,0,13,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Therefore, two between-subjects experimental studies explore the potential for allowing the marketing of SLT as a reduced-risk alternative to cigarette smoking. Specifically, this article addresses the issue of whether a harm reduction message with the simultaneous presence of the U.S. government-mandated warning would: (1) change intentions of smokers to use SLT products; or (2) attract those who would not otherwise use any tobacco. Results suggest that an advertiser making a harm reduction statement in the presence of the warning leads to limited changes in consumers' risk perceptions of SLT products or intentions to try the product. Exposure to the experimental ads did not make nonsmokers significantly more likely to try SLT products, but also did not make smokers indicate that they were likely to switch to SLT products.","[Capella, Michael L.; Taylor, Charles R.; Kees, Jeremy] Villanova Univ, Villanova Sch Business, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",Villanova University,"Capella, ML (通讯作者)，Villanova Univ, Villanova Sch Business, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",michael.l.capella@villanova.edu; raymond.taylor@villanova.edu; jeremy.kees@villanova.edu,,"Taylor, Charles/0000-0003-2057-0345",,,,,38,15,16,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The result holds true even if antitrust authorities are allowed to re-shape their leniency program in reaction to the higher damage level. Larger damage payments imply lower incentives to self-report if damages are not fully encompassed by the leniency program; in effect, the program has to be more generous to enforce self-reporting.

The purpose of this article is to understand the effect that corporate entrepreneurship strategy has on firms to revitalize, reconfigure resources and transform into firms that are ready to compete in the global economy. Empirical tests are conducted to determine to what extent elements of pro-entrepreneurship architecture are able to predict development capability, strategic repositioning, and growth based outcomes. A first-phase survey is conducted to verify the presence and strength of entrepreneurial orientation while the second phase of the study identifies elements of organizational architecture able to predict firm outcomes. The main contribution of this article is that firms resourcing and rewarding policies, as well as cultural and structural orientations, derived from a corporate entrepreneurship strategy, play a significant role in realizing desired outcomes. The study has important implications for emerging economies where growth is often the primary goal of organizations, and where corporate entrepreneurship can be critical for firm profitability and survival.","Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Commerce Law & Management, Wits Business Sch, Grad Sch Business Adm, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Urban, B (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Commerce Law & Management, Wits Business Sch, Grad Sch Business Adm, POB 98, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",boris.urban@wits.ac.za,"urban, boris/Q-1768-2019","Urban, Boris/0000-0002-6212-0169",,,,,124,8,9,1,43,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

First, we estimate a conditional equilibrium-correction model of money demand, which is theory consistent and accounts for the main features of the data. Next, we compare its forecasts with those obtained by other methods: a VAR in differences, naive models, robustified devices, forecasting aggregates using disaggregates, and pooling of forecasts using different models and windows. They are evaluated over an unstable period in which there was often uncertainty about the economic regime. For forecasting the growth rate of M2, it can be useful to complement the equilibrium-correction model with other approaches like univariate AR models, either individually or by pooling.

The aim of this study is to show the way in which important types of outliers can be incorporated into linear innovations state space models for exponential smoothing methods. The types of outliers include an additive outlier, a level shift, and a transitory change. The general innovations state space model and a special case which encompasses the common linear exponential smoothing methods are examined. A method for identifying outliers using innovations state space models is proposed. This method is investigated using both simulations and applications to real time series. The impact of an outliers location on the forecasts and the estimation of parameters is examined. The forecasts from outlier and basic non-outlier models are compared.

Later, and in agreement with this new constitutional order, the figure of community councils was institutionalized; this makes it necessary to systematize, based on theoretical referents, how such institutions operate to achieve their declared legal ends. Therefore, it becomes unavoidable, as in all social organizations, to pay attention to the communicational factor; if this is set aside, citizen participation could not be operative or effective. Communication, participation and citizenship configure the triad that supports the viability of the new model. Methodology is of a documentary character, based on which the previously described analysis categories are developed and articulated. Conclusions are that serious weaknesses exist in the internal and external communications process and in the community councils. These difficulties need to be overcome in order to strengthen and consolidate the exercise of citizenship, conditioned by the pre-existence of communicational mechanisms that make viable internalization of the necessary values belonging to a new meaning for the political actors' condition in the framework of participative democracy.","[Morales Villalobos, Eduviges; Nunez Munoz, Ingrid; Hernandez Leon, Mairely] Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Polit, Inst Estudios Polit & Derecho Publ Dr Humberto J, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Villalobos, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Polit, Inst Estudios Polit & Derecho Publ Dr Humberto J, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",eduvigesm@gmail.com; ingridknm79@hotmail.com; mairelyh@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

However, some neighbourhoods are characterised by relatively high out-migration of firms; disadvantaged neighbourhoods in particular. This suggests that there may be factors at the neighbourhood level that steer relocation behaviour of local entrepreneurs. In this paper, we investigate how entrepreneurs valuate location aspects, including social and physical characteristics of the neighbourhood, and how this valuation relates to planned or actual firm relocation. The results show that the neighbourhood plays only a modest role for being a (potentially) mobile firm. Rather, relocation (propensity) results from growth ambition, and the most important reasons for both relocation and staying put are therefore the size and quality of the business premises itself or personal housing preferences. Policy aiming at retaining entrepreneurs in neighbourhoods is most successful if targeted at the supply of appropriate business space.","[Sleutjes, Bart] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Volker, Beate] Univ Utrecht, Fac Social Sci, Interuniv Ctr Social Sci Theory & Methodol ICS, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Utrecht University,"Sleutjes, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",b.w.h.sleutjes@uu.nl; b.volker@uu.nl,"Volker, Beate/E-7992-2013",,,,,,24,3,4,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

An optimal bankruptcy law is a commitment device that implements efficient choices both before (ex ante) and after (ex post) financial distress, even if moral hazard is binding. We designed an experiment focused on ex ante efficiency and we found that the restricted auction mechanism was able to direct an optimal amount of effort toward entrepreneurial activities. This result confirms the theoretical predictions. Nonetheless, we found that under a plain unrestricted auction mechanism our experimental subjects chose to allocate into their firms a larger amount of effort than that predicted by theory. Although difficult to justify on theoretical grounds, this experimental evidence is robust. Our behavioral interpretation is that this result is due to moral sentiments, such as the natural propensity of subjects toward socially desirable behaviors. In fact, we show that it vanishes once these motives are removed.","[Di Cagno, Daniela; Spallone, Marco] Luiss Guido Carli Univ Rome, Rome, Italy; [Spallone, Marco] Univ G DAnnunzio, Pescara, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Spallone, M (通讯作者)，Luiss Guido Carli Univ Rome, Rome, Italy.",mspallone@luiss.it,,"di cagno, daniela/0000-0002-9208-7654",,,,,28,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We consider as major sources of uncertainty the stochastic growth of demand for the industry output (e.g. electric energy) and the ensuing lack of information on the pollution levels of individual firms, their behavior and the behavior of the regulator. These sources of uncertainty are common in pollution permit trading as not only does the market respond to the volatility of fundamentals but also to the vagaries of the institutional structure, created by public policy and enforced through regulation. The paper shows that in the presence of strategic behavior on the part of the agents involved, even though both the level and the volatility of output increases over time, trading of permits is a highly effective instrument of risk management, since it allows the firms to pool the risks arising from the volatile environment, thereby simplifying enforcement, reducing emissions and improving resource allocation. Moreover, uncertainty plays a subtle influencing role, since on one hand it broadens the regulator's deterrent power over potential polluters, while on the other it reduces the expected value of the sanction for the individual firm.","[Scandizzo, Pasquale L.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Knudsen, Odin K.] JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, Washington, DC USA",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Scandizzo, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",scandizzo@uniroma2.it,"Scandizzo, Pasquale/HIZ-8395-2022","Scandizzo, Pasquale/0000-0002-8824-3589",,,,,30,1,2,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Contrary to the apparent views of legislators, this paper shows that costs and revenues are not the only parameters determining whether or not operators are able to provide services in a commercially viable way. Apart from the local characteristics of the specific service, we show that the classification of services as commercial versus non-commercial is determined in large part by the public transport authorities that set minimum quality standards to be provided by operators. Our analysis shows that the authorities awarding the contracts in some cases affect market organization significantly depending on how they make use of this power. Furthermore, market organization differs substantially with respect to the awarding structure and the contractual relationships, thus creating a challenge for operators and authorities in an embryonic market.

This paper focuses on identification of key factors which are essential for successful project portfolio implementation and therefore increased attention is required.","[Cechurova, Lenka] Univ W Bohemia, Plzni, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Cechurová, L (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Plzni, Czech Republic.",lcechuro@kmo.zcu.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-171-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,48,52,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393447700007,0

The paper theoretically analyses the conception, aims and features of Ecological Tax Reform. This paper also analyses intended consequences of Ecological Tax Reform and practice of other countries implementing it. Also the evaluation of Lithuania's demand for entering Ecological Tax Reform in the context of the EU countries was carried out. The last chapters of the paper is dedicated to the discussion upon the vulnerability of Lithuanian economic activity caused by entering Ecological Tax Reform and the importance of labour, export and energy intensities in terms of ecological tax reform. The paper concludes that Ecological Tax Reform should be launched gradually, maintaining the revenue neutrality. This tax reform should be easily managed, internationally harmonized and combined with other measures. Entering Ecological Tax Reform in Lithuania, one should consider the ability of adjustment of the most vulnerable spheres of economic activity to Ecological Tax Reform and the ability of those spheres not to discount the possibility of exemption.","[Ciegis, Remigijus; Pusinaite, Rasa] Vinius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Tamasauskaite, Egle] Kaunas City Municipal, LT-44251 Kaunas, Lithuania",,"Ciegis, R (通讯作者)，Vinius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",remigijus.ciegis@aula.vukhf.lt; egle.tamasauskaite@kaunas.lt; rasa.pusinaite@khf.vu.lt,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,10,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

However, regulators cannot adequately interpret or utilize such knowledge, for reasons including their social distance from the sites of knowledge production, the diversity of financial firms' proprietary risk models, firms' abilities to game the rules thus rendering the 'metrics' meaningless and several backfiring aspects of global regulatory networking and reform. Calls for yet more information about trading, posed in terms of the merits of transparency, result in information swamping of regulators. Meanwhile, while policy-makers tinker with regulatory structures ('architecture'), political reaction to the crisis de-legitimizes public regulation as a project. Yet there is one positive aspect of the reforms - enhancing powers for 'resolution' of financial firms in ways that impact upon investors while minimizing wider destabilization - upon which the regulatory information requirement can and should be refocused. To protect the public interest, legal transparency is required, trading transparency is not. This paper introduces these issues by drawing on critical work on transparency and markets.","EUR, Erasmus Sch Law, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Dorn, N (通讯作者)，EUR, Erasmus Sch Law, Postbus 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",dorn@law.eur.nl,,,,,,,49,12,14,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The analysis finds strong support for the hypotheses that loan loss provisions have been used for both income smoothing and regulatory capital management. Additionally, it finds that some non-discretionary components of loan loss provisions have been irrelevant during the years of the global financial crisis.

Using ethnographic data on HIV clinics, I argue that awkward knowledge is kept inert in two main ways. Information can be sequestered, often under a pile of regulatory paper or a document describing an organization's routines, creating an illusion of knowledge while deflecting questions. Alternatively, with distributed ignorance people avoid seeing awkward patterns by using the division of labour and organizational boundaries as pretexts to keep key facts apart. Normal organizational processes that make a show of gathering and disseminating information are in fact often deployed strategically to create an illusion of knowledge while keeping important facts inert.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Heimer, CA (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, 1810 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",c-heimer@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,54,48,62,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This paper presents an application of a stated preference valuation approach aimed at evaluating the social preferences of the population of the Basque Country, Spain, for the key attributes of a regional Natura 2000 network site. According to our results, individuals' willingness-to-pay (WTP) is higher for attributes associated with non-use values (native tree species and biodiversity conservation) than for attributes associated with use values (agricultural development and commercial forestry). The paper concludes that management policies related to Natura 2000 network sites should account for both for the importance of non-use values and the heterogeneity of the population's preferences in order to minimize potential land use conflicts.

While in SMEs weak resources and capabilities contribute to occurrence of development problems, this study suggests that SMEs can enhance their efficiency to produce innovative output by improving their capabilities (external or internal). These capabilities augment the value of resources and can be acquired through external collaboration, non-technological innovation or former innovations.

It has however, broadly failed to integrate class relations generally and labour in particular into its approach. This article suggests that we can understand this failure by revisiting and critically interrogating GCC's intellectual foundations-in World Systems Theory and Schumpeterian conceptions of capitalist innovation. It also argues that if carefully reformed, these foundations can provide a useful framework from which to conduct research into processes of contemporary development. A central argument of this paper is that evolving capital-labour relations co-determine processes of capitalist expansion and development, and that a commitment to understanding and investigating these relations should be placed more firmly at the centre of GCC analysis.","Univ Sussex, Ctr Global Polit Econ, Brighton BN1 9RN, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Selwyn, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Ctr Global Polit Econ, Brighton BN1 9RN, E Sussex, England.",B.selwyn@sussex.ac.uk,,,,,,,98,139,151,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We test the concept using the Electronic Business 300 data-set for 2000-2005. We find that lead firms and component suppliers earn higher gross margins and net margins compared to contract manufacturers. However, the differences are minimal for return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). We also find that active component suppliers gain higher profits than passive component suppliers. These findings suggest that the smiling curve is right if value is defined in terms of gross margins, but the cost of sustaining a position on either end of the curve is so high that returns on investment are similar across the curve.","[Shin, Namchul] Pace Univ, Seidenberg Sch Comp Sci & Informat Syst, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Kraemer, Kenneth L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA; [Dedrick, Jason] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY USA",Pace University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Syracuse University,"Shin, N (通讯作者)，Pace Univ, Seidenberg Sch Comp Sci & Informat Syst, 163 William St, New York, NY 10038 USA.",nshin@pace.edu,,,,,,,31,76,79,3,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the crisis on economic performance and functioning of the labour market in the Visegrad group countries. Real gross domestic product and the unemployment rate are the main analyzed indicators. Quarterly data from the Eurostat database in the period between 2000 and 2010 were used. In order to estimate potential output and the natural rate of unemployment was used Hedrick-Prescott filter. Data shows that all V-4 economies in pre-crisis period were in the positive output gap. It means that the factors of production are used with such intensity that was regardless of the subsequent economic crisis unsustainable in the long term. In assessing the impact of economic crisis on the Visegrad group economies, it was found that the smallest impact of the crisis was on the Polish economy, whose economic performance has fallen at least among EU Member States during the crisis. Moreover, the labour market was in the positive unemployment gap in the pre-crisis period. Within the paper, one objective was also to estimate relationship between economic performance and the unemployment rate. The VAR model was used as the main method for calculations.

While the priority is given to sustainable mobility in cities, the development of the supply leads to increasing operating costs, but the receipts from customers is insufficient to cover the expenses. Taking the example of French cities, the article analyses the reasons of the explosion of deficits. As the design of the network is in France under the full responsibility of Transport Authorities, the growth of the supply is often driven by public policy objectives (accessibility to the city for disadvantaged people, reducing car use and CO2 emissions) rather than by the demand. Even if the patronage starts again increasing since 2000, the global performance of the network is not satisfying, as evidenced by the rather weak rate of utilisation (on average 4 trips per vehicule.km). Apart from the successful development of right-of-way systems (such as tramways), the extension of bus routes to lower density areas explains this mitigated result. It is suggested to develop a line-based performance measurement in order to favour an optimisation now essential to cope with public funding restrictions.

This artide aims at appraising such a public policy by measuring its welfare impact, expressed as the Net Present Value (NPV) of the overall changes generated over 2007-2010. Faster bikes perform more kilometres in Paris. Some people shift from cars, buses, and subway to bikes and Velibs. Switching from a passive mode of transportation to bicycle has a positive health impact. The amounts of CO2, local pollutants, noise and congestion externalities generated by each mode are also changing. By contrast, the speed of car is slightly reduced, partially because of a narrowed road capacity. Public finance is affected by the change in fiscal revenues collected whereas the bike rental system's operator (Decaux) realizes some profits. Finally, the pro-bicycle policy has an initial investment cost and a residual value. All these changes are calculated and computed in a same monetary unit. This policy is (slightly) beneficial for society (a total NPV of +136 M(sic)) even if the cost for public finance (-704 M(sic)) is dose to the bikers' benefit (+859 M(sic)). Velibers are highly subsidized by the city. This policy is also working at the expense of the cars' drivers (- 286 M(sic)) while positive externalities are not very important (+101 M(sic)) and Decaux's profits are moderated (+166 M(sic)). Several sensitivity analyses are conducted to identify the key drivers of the policy's success.","[Koning, Martin] French Inst Sci & Technol Transport Dev & Network, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Kopp, Pierre] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Koning, M (通讯作者)，French Inst Sci & Technol Transport Dev & Network, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",,,"Koning, Martin/0000-0001-9892-4786",,,,,39,5,5,0,15,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

This was the first national study in The Netherlands (and one of the first world-wide) to investigate these topics empirically in a joint framework. Stated preference (SP) questionnaires were designed for interviewing travellers, where the hypothetical alternatives were described in terms of travel time, travel costs and travel time reliability, the latter being presented to the respondents in the form of five possible travel times having equal probability. For passenger transport, we first collected interviews using an existing internet panel. Additional data collection recruitment was done by asking travellers at petrol stations/service areas, parking garages, stations, bus stops, airports and ports to participate in the survey. One important conclusion is that the SP survey using members of this internet panel leads to substantially lower VOTs than the SP survey with en-route recruitment, probably because of self-selection bias in the internet panel. We estimated discrete choice models in which the values of time differ between trips with different time and costs levels, different time and costs changes offered in the SP, and different observed characteristics of the respondents (e.g. education, income, age, household composition). By using a panel latent class model, we also account for unobserved differences between respondents in the value of time and for repeated measurements/panel effects. The reference values of time and the reference reliability ratios were estimated on the 2011 sample only, but the effect of time and cost level, time and cost changes offered and socio-economic attributes was estimated on both the 2009 and 2011 samples.

However, a large strand of current economics research is engaged in identifying mechanisms through which unskilled immigration, while solving the pension problem, is causing undesired shifts in general welfare. This work shows that recurring unskilled immigration will not only reduce the general welfare but may also be challenging the pension system by reducing the pension benefits themselves.

S. commercial banking sector. A core component of antitrust law is the calculative practice of market definition, which involves identifying not only the product or service attributes of a market but also, pointedly, its geographic extent. Geographic market definition-and the geographic knowledges it furnishes-is the focus of the article. It argues that these legal market maps (the law's markets, that is to say) materially shape on-the-ground market and competitive realities. The article develops this argument through a study of the recent history of U. S. antitrust theory and practice in regard to commercial banking. It claims that the particular nature of the geographic models created through this practice is pivotal to explaining the history of evolution of that sector in the final decades of the twentieth century-and most especially, large-scale industry consolidation at the national scale. In the process, the article aims to contribute not only to financial geography but also to three relatively-underdeveloped economicgeographic literatures: on the implication of geographic knowledges in political-economic change; on the geographies of markets; and on the role of the law in economic-geographic transformation.","[Christophers, Brett] Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Christophers, Brett] Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University; Uppsala University,"Christophers, B (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",brett.christophers@ibf.uu.se,,,,,,,79,13,15,0,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

It first examines the departure-time choices of urban rail passengers who face unreliable rail services and analyzes these choices empirically by using data on the reactions of passengers that use the Tokyu Den-en-toshi Line in Japan. A model of commuters' choices is then formulated by using the scheduling approach where their preference toward travel-time reliability is reflected in their departure-time choices. The presented model assumes that an individual maximizes his or her utility on a workday by allocating time to activities and by determining the start time of each activity. It is also assumed that the individual's utility function consists of the following four subutility functions: morning in-home leisure time, rail travel time, the difference between arrival time at the workplace and preferred arrival time at the workplace, and the difference between arrival time at the workplace and the official work start time. To consider variability in travel time, an error component is introduced into the subutility function of rail travel time, for which two types of probability functions are examined: exponential function and censored-normal distribution. The results show that the model with the censored-normal distribution can successfully describe the empirical data. The consumer benefits that stem from improvements in travel-time reliability are then estimated by using the departure-time choice model for these four cases. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is discussed, particularly in the context of the urban rail network in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical research finds that vertical restraints are generally welfare enhancing. We examine cartels that used vertical restraints to support collusion. We find that one-quarter of a sample of convicted contemporary international cartels used vertical restraints. Some of these cartels used vertical restraints to control downstream firms who might otherwise have undermined collusion. In other cases, distributors themselves had market power and received a share of cartel rents in return for their willingness to exercise that power as part of a cartel. This raises questions for antitrust policy toward vertical restraints in highly concentrated industries or in those with a history of cartel activity.","[Levenstein, Margaret C.; Suslow, Valerie Y.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Levenstein, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,32,7,8,1,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The analysis shows that three (out of four) perceived obstacles are barriers to university-industry interactions and negatively affect the probability of engaging in collaboration with industry.

This paper takes the firm perspective and examines cognitive distance regarding not only the host region, but also the knowledge of the firms involved. It uses qualitative information from an extensive study of Chinese affiliates in Germany. In contrast to many other studies, this paper shows that a fast and successful process of becoming embedded in the host region can hamper the subsidiary's success, as it may cause conflict with the parent firm.","[Si, Yuefang] E China Normal Univ, Ctr Strateg Studies, Dept Urban & Reg Econ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Si, Yuefang; Liefner, Ingo] Univ Giessen, Dept Econ Geog, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",East China Normal University; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Si, YF (通讯作者)，E China Normal Univ, Ctr Strateg Studies, Dept Urban & Reg Econ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, 500 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",yfsi@re.ecnu.edu.cn; ingo.liefner@geogr.uni-giessen.de,,"Liefner, Ingo/0000-0003-1828-5836",,,,,42,20,20,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This paper examines three possible accounts of the normative relation between functionings and capabilities, and the implications of each of these accounts in terms of degrees of paternalism. The way in which capability theorists apparently oscillate between these different accounts is shown to rest on an apparent tension between anti-paternalism (which favours an emphasis on capabilities) and anti-fetishism (which favours an emphasis on functionings). The paper then advances a fourth account, which incorporates a concern with the content-independent or 'non-specific' value of freedom. Only the fourth account would remove all traces of paternalism from the capability approach. Whatever reasons advocates of the capability approach might have had for rejecting this fourth account, those reasons are not internal to the capability approach itself.","Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Pavia,"Carter, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",ian.carter@unipv.it,,,,,,,37,30,32,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

I also rely on Campaign Media Analysis Group advertising data and campaign finance measures to disentangle the effects of advertising from campaign spending. Results show that attacks have deleterious effects on the incumbency advantage but only in nonpartisan elections. In this regard, the preference for nonpartisan elections among many reform advocates has rendered some concerns about the pernicious effects of negativity into self-fulfilling prophecies.

This article extends this literature by employing propensity score matching using the first wave of data from the Growing up in Ireland child cohort study. We argue that the Irish case is of particular interest given the highly selective nature of non-marriage. We find that, on average, non-marriage has negative effects on a child educational development at age 9 but the effects are smaller in relation to health outcomes and the child's self-concept. However, selection effects account for a non-trivial proportion of the differences in child outcomes across lone-mother and cohabiting families although hidden bias remains an important issue. This has important implications for policies which promote marriage as the key to child development as it appears that much of the benefits of marriage are not related to marriage per se but to the socio-economic background of mothers.","[Hannan, Carmel; Halpin, Brendan] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Hannan, C (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.",carmel.hannan@ul.ie,"Halpin, Brendan T/H-9667-2012; Hannan, Carmel/P-6246-2015","Hannan, Carmel/0000-0003-1560-0351; Halpin, Brendan/0000-0003-2146-5926",,,,,34,7,10,0,22,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Although the present framework meets most criteria of international good practice, there is considerable scope for improvement to meet Ireland's future needs, especially for restoring public debt sustainability - as it is no longer under the direct tutelage and protection of the EU and IMF. To this end, the paper outlines a set of options to strengthen the fiscal framework consisting, among others, of (a) a binding public debt rule; (b) an indicative structural budget balance rule; (c) a pay-go rule, and (d) steps to broaden the mandate and amplify the resources of IFAC. It is argued that these options should help pave the way to further gains in credibility in financial markets, and ultimately, to higher economic growth and stability.","Woodrow Wilson Int Ctr Scholars, Washington, DC 20560 USA",,"Kopits, G (通讯作者)，Woodrow Wilson Int Ctr Scholars, Washington, DC 20560 USA.",,,,,,,,38,4,4,0,6,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The results show an extremely small level of integration of small farms into fruits and vegetable supply chain due to several constraints such as high transaction costs, no participation in any kind of collective actions such as producers groups or different forms of cooperation/associations with commercial purposes.","Inst Agr Econ, Dambovita, Romania",,"Alboiu, C (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ, Dambovita, Romania.",,"Alboiu, Cornelia/HTM-0226-2023; Alboiu, Cora/HTN-6511-2023","Alboiu, Cornelia/0000-0001-6609-2962;",,,,,7,0,0,1,4,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,774,783,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100099,0

It is reasonable that both social relationships-strong or weak-may have domestic position in employment decisions because different cultural backgrounds may lead to several of behavior patterns. On one hand, strong ties are important for positions which are crucial and scarce, especially when one's personality is not distinctive. On the other hand, for jobs which require general skill and experience, weak ties can provide enough help. It also should be noticed that specific approaches-cultural limitation, homogeneity and structural hole-are observed in both social ties when influencing employment.","[An, Suxia; Yu, Lixia; Hou, Yuwei] Xingtai Univ, Xingtai 054001, Hebei, Peoples R China",Xingtai University,,Ansuxia2002@aliyun.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-154-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,442,446,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA7DK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337485500069,0

These tests are asymptotically valid for serially independent observations, but in the presence of serial correlation they are markedly oversized, as has been confirmed in a simulation study. We therefore summarize robust test procedures for serial correlation and propose a bootstrap approach, the relative merits of which we illustrate by means of a Monte Carlo study. Our evaluations of directional predictions of stock returns and changes in Euribor rates demonstrate the importance of accounting for serial correlation in economic time series when making such predictions.

Science is ultimately a product of individual scientists with their own personal backgrounds and experiences, and there is no unique methodology to de-personalize and objectify knowledge. Social scientists, in particular, use a variety of tools for their investigations: They gather evidence from different sources, under different conditions and with different instruments. They are both the locus where different sources of evidence aggregate and also a direct source of evidence that comes in as intuitions and background knowledge. Acknowledging this wide variety of sources of evidence and methods in social science, different kinds of methodologies for reaching consensus have been developed. What kind of consensus is indicative of good science? What are the rules for consensus formation? And, is there a normative aspect to the formation of scientific and policy making consensus? The contributions of this book focus on experts: those institutional figures that act as a liaison between science and policy makers, politicians, governments, and other public domains.","[Boumans, Marcel] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Martini, Carlo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Off A509, Helsinki, Finland",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; University of Helsinki,"Boumans, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Valckenierstr 65, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.j.boumans@uva.nl; carlo.martini@helsinki.fi,"Boumans, Marcel/AAX-1395-2021","Boumans, Marcel/0000-0002-8717-8148; Martini, Carlo/0000-0001-9061-8020",,,,,35,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-08551-7; 978-3-319-08550-0,ETHICAL ECON,,,2014,50.0,,,,,,1,13,,10.1007/978-3-319-08551-7_1,0.0,,,13,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358528600001,0

Since China's civil aviation transportation is highly monopolized, aviation operation entities occupy a dominant position, leaving travel agencies very little power to make decisions on ticket sources and prices. By exploring the nature and constitution of aviation and tourism industrial chain, the paper discusses the business model that travel agencies can take to change their current position in the chain and the way to extend to the upriver. Firstly, travel agencies in the downriver segment should find their own uniqueness and become a irreplaceable segment in the chain; secondly, travel agencies in the middle river segment could negotiate with airlines for charter flight or introduce a third party into the game to take a more active role; thirdly, by internalize the industrial chain, travel agencies can fight to move to the upriver.","Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Guo, YJ (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",guoyj@cats.org.cn,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,4,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,DOCKLAND,"7 POINT PARK CRESCENT, DOCKLAND, VIC 3008, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9924140-8-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,306,310,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2MF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358894900050,0

This essay tries to probe into the relationship between the two, analyze and then crack the constraints.","[Hong, Bigang] Shaoyang Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Shaoyang 422000, Peoples R China",Shaoyang University,,hong6210@126.com,,,,,,,2,0,0,3,13,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-154-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,60,64,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA7DK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337485500008,0

Creating a resilient supply chain could be the answer; however, this is a new area of study that still needs to be properly investigated. Although, resilience could be defined as the ability of a substance to get back to its original state after deformation, there is still no concrete definition of a resilient supply chain or supply chain resilience. This paper therefore analyses the supply chain and the risks it faces, investigates the resilience of the supply chain, and gives appropriate strategies and tools that would help avoid these risks, and as a result, an organization would be able to bounce back after any deformation along its supply chain.

Solution of this trade-off is virtually projected into the implementation of social policy and results achieved in macro economics policy, with the goal to define the optimal scope and character of the income redistribution processes. The submitted empirical study responds to this problem through the solution of research question concerning the existence of a relationship between the extent of selected classes of social protection expenditure (expenditure on policy of family, old age and unemployment) and the achieved level of economics development, quantified by Human Development Index (HDI). The existence of this relationship is statistically tested in the sample of 15 countries of the world economy The research sample is heterogeneous in relation to the analysed indicators and it concerns countries with a different attained level of economics development and income redistribution policy. In most surveyed countries, based on the results of quantitative analysis was confirmed the impact of social protection expenditure on the reached level of economic development. In the area of family policy and old-age pensions this impact was positive and in the area of employment policy this impact was negative. A high level of heterogeneity of selected countries with respect to the observed aspects proves a markedly different extent and nature of redistribution processes. The findings of the research should therefore be analysed more deeply through the redistribution theory of defined compromise trade off between efficiency and equity. The compromise in each country depends on the character of the subparts and the models of social policy. From our perspective, these are models of family policy (liberal, social-market, universalistic), labour market policy (scandinavian, liberal and consensual corporate democracy model) and concepts of pension policy (presented by liberal, socio-democratic and conservative model of social policy). The amount of expenditures of social protection (on the old age, family policy and unemployment) in selected countries provides basic outline of tendencies of these expenditures, which differ according to adopted concepts in family policy, employment policy and policy of the pension system.","[Merickova, Beata Mikusova] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Halaskova, Renata] Coll Logist, Dept Econ Legal & Social Sci, Prerov, Czech Republic",Matej Bel University,"Mericková, BM (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",beata.mikusovamerickova@umb.sk; renata.halaskova@vslg.cz,"Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/AAN-7235-2021","Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/0000-0002-3187-9201",,,,,28,10,10,0,16,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The aim of this paper is to link international R&D strategies of small and medium-sized enterprises to the spatial organisation of R&D activities. A survey of Austrian firms forms the basis of the analysis. The findings show a clear spatial concentration of foreign R&D activities of Austrian firms in Western and Eastern Europe, especially Germany. However, this general distance decay function is distorted by regions' evolutionary trajectories and their peculiarities, such as cultural and cognitive proximity, and by the scope of R&D envisaged by the firm. The analysis reveals that knowledge-exploiting strategies are more common for activities in emerging economies, whereas knowledge-gaining and learning strategies drive the establishment of activities in countries with an advanced national innovation system. Furthermore, small and medium-sized firms tend to internationalise via international cooperation rather than via the establishment of own subsidiaries abroad. Plans for future activities show only limited change in this respect.","[Berger, Martin] Niedersachs Minist Wissensch & Kultur, D-30169 Hannover, Germany; [Meyer, Susanne] AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, A-1220 Vienna, Austria",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Meyer, S (通讯作者)，AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, Donau City Str 1, A-1220 Vienna, Austria.",susanne.meyer@ait.ac.at; martin.berger@mwk.niedersachsen.de,,,,,,,53,1,1,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

The research encompassed 168 managers within 8 companies of different structure and ownership type. A Pareek questionnaire was used to measure the dimensions of corporate culture. The managers have expressed their opinions on different corporate culture dimensions on a 4-level scale. In particular, the following were considered: openness, confrontation, trust, authenticity, proactivity, autonomy, cooperation and attitude towards experimenting. Determining dominant corporate culture dimensions has primarily a purpose of identifying: the current state of value dimensions of culture, differences between Opinions of managers in public sector versus those in production companies, differences between opinions pertinent to different managerial levels, and opinions about possible impact of certain dimensions of corporate culture on behavior of employees within the companies encompassed in the study Survey results indicate a clear difference in the assessment of organizational culture in relation to the level of managers, types of organizations (manufacturing or service) and ownership status of the organization (public or private). Higher levels of management rate higher the majority of dimensions of organizational culture as compared to the lower levels of management. Managers of manufacturing industrial systems rate higher the dimensions of organizational culture in comparison with the managers of the service sector. Managers, as bearers of the culture, can contribute to establishment of desired cultural values that will promote the development of organization. In the long turbulent transition period that Serbia has been going through and which has a negative impact on business performance of the companies it is vital to determine the difference between the existing values and those desired that would contribute to the fastest development of the companies.","[Mitrovic, Slavica; Grubic-Nesic, Leposava; Milisavljevic, Stevan] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci Novi Sad, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Melovic, Boban] Univ Podgorica, Fac Econ, Podgorica, Montenegro",University of Novi Sad; University of Montenegro,"Mitrovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci Novi Sad, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",mslavica@uns.ac.rs; nesle@uns.ac.rs; steva@uns.ac.rs; bobanm@ac.me; dragutin@uns.ac.rs,,"Grubic-Nesic, Leposava/0000-0001-7112-0948; Mitrovic, Slavica/0000-0002-6463-3734",,,,,29,11,13,2,49,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The distinctive feature of the arm's length model is the separation of policy formation and implementation, and the transference of these political functions to different institutions (the Ministry of Culture and Culture and Art Council). Ministry sets financial, administrative, legal, and overall policy framework for the council, but the council has a considerable measure of independence in decision making. This model is considered to be intermediate between the state model, in which political institutions make all important cultural policy decisions, and the liberal model, in which state funds culture only indirectly (through taxes). The first part of the paper discusses the aims of the arm's length model in cultural policy and the main features of Art (or Culture) council as an arm's length body. This part is based on a comparative analysis of the activity of councils in various countries. The second part of the paper describes and analyzes the transition process from state to arm's length cultural policy in Lithuania. The part is based on the qualitative analysis of the Lithuanian political documents and public discussions about cultural policy issues, and on secondary data analysis.

In this case, the efficiency of your service enables you to charge a lower fee, which in turn allows firm to boost the volume of activity and earn sufficient profit from each unit.

For developing countries, whether technical change is biased towards particular factors is of central importance. We apply the framework of Acemoglu, D. (2002, Directed technical change', The Review of Economic Studies, 69, 781-809) to develop explanations for the following questions: What kind of production function is appropriate to special economies? If and to what degree technical change is biased towards particular factors? Based on inter-provincial panel data of China, this paper shows that: First, biased production functions are more appropriate than neutral ones. Second, the elasticity of substitution between labour and capital is less than a unity within the interval of 0.50 to 0.70, which indicates the asymmetric effect of technical progress on the productivity of capital and labour (a bias clearly in favour of capital). Third, the extents of bias in CES, VES, and CEEDx are 0.424, 0.108, and 0.213, and more biased towards capital at 3.6%, 1.3%, and 2.2% (from 1978 to 2010).

A monopolist in a primary market competes with a rival in a complementary market. Bundling is the monopolist's preferred strategy, since it either extracts surplus from the rival's investment, or forces the rival to provide low quality. Bundling may reduce welfare without foreclosing the rival, but improves welfare when preventing undesirable investment. Since prohibiting bundling is not appropriate, we introduce a price test for bundled offers that preserves efficiencies from both bundling and quality investment, thereby improving welfare relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario. We consequently argue that this test should be applied whenever possible.","[Avenali, Alessandro; D'Annunzio, Anna; Reverberi, Pierfrancesco] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Ingn Informat Automat & Gest Antonio, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [D'Annunzio, Anna] Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Sapienza University Rome; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Reverberi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Ingn Informat Automat & Gest Antonio, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",pierfrancesco.reverberi@uniroma1.it,,"D'Annunzio, Anna/0000-0002-6396-0231",,,,,22,18,19,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Given that transformational evolution is dominant in the social realm while variational evolution reigns in the organic world, the question is if Hodgson and Knudsen's Generalized Darwinism bridges the ontological gap between the two types of evolution. It is argued that the three successive strategies of the authors-deconstruction of Lamarckism, appropriation of the Price equation, redefinition of the replication notion-are all based on controversial semantic innovations. Most importantly, it is shown that Generalized Darwinism, in its effort to address the transformational character of social evolution through the notion of generative replication, is compelled to radically restrict the importance of Darwinian natural selection.","Univ Aegean, Dept Financial & Management Engn, Business Sch Chios, Lesvos, Greece",University of Aegean,"Liagouras, G (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Dept Financial & Management Engn, Business Sch Chios, Lesvos, Greece.",g.liagouras@fme.aegean.gr,"Kim, Soohyun/N-6460-2014","Liagouras, George/0000-0002-4410-2741",,,,,66,6,6,0,128,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

However, caution is often recommended due to the ideological concepts that are embedded in classical political economy. This article argues that many of the ideological concepts that are often attributed to classical political economy are actually not part of classical political economy, but rather of a vulgar form of political economy, a project that emerged after Ricardo. This vulgar project, often termed as Ricardian economics, is often mistakenly taken to be a development of classical political economy, but it is actually a rupture with the classical political economy of Petty, Smith, and Ricardo, as Marx, and later Sraffa, argued. Once this is acknowledged, the relationship between classical political economy and heterodox economics becomes clearer.","[Martins, Nuno Ornelas] Ctr Estudos Gestao & Econ, P-9700042 Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal; [Martins, Nuno Ornelas] Univ Azores, P-9700042 Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal",Universidade dos Acores; Universidade dos Acores,"Martins, NO (通讯作者)，Ctr Estudos Gestao & Econ, Rua Capitao Joao DAvila, P-9700042 Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal.",nmartins@uac.pt,"Martins, Nuno/B-6012-2009","Martins, Nuno/0000-0001-7966-6435",,,,,54,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Insight in these local economic impacts of ports and inter-regional spillovers is crucial for future investment decisions and local acceptance of port development. Inter-regional spillovers from port activities are commonly assumed in the academic literature on port economics, but rarely ever quantified. This article fills this gap by quantifying the backward linkages of four large ports in North-West Europe: Rotterdam, Antwerp, Hamburg and Le Havre. To assess the extent and distribution of inter-regional economic spillovers, we disaggregate national input/output-tables to the level of the functional port area and calculate the relevant Leontief multipliers. The results in this paper suggest a wide range of Leontief multipliers with different inter-regional patterns. The ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp have smaller overall multipliers but relatively large impacts on their own regional economies, in particular on the petro-chemical sector. In contrast, the ports of Hamburg and Le Havre have higher overall multipliers and show relatively high impacts on regions further away from the port, such as Bavaria and Ile-de-France. The policy implications of these results are discussed.","[Merk, Olaf M.] OECD, Publ Governance & Terr Dev Directorate, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Manshanden, Walter J.

Due to Ireland's poor financial situation, the choice of infrastructure investment has become more important than ever and hence, large expensive projects such as an underground Metro line called Metro North have been widely criticised. The main objective of this research is to investigate and identify the most efficient transport solution for the Dublin city centre-airport route. The Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) (over ground heavy rail) spur and Metro North are explored along with a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) route and a Luas (tram) line. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was employed to identify the most efficient solution for the city centre-airport route and to establish the reasons for inefficiency. The findings of this research indicate that, when costs are included in the analysis, the BRT Airport is the most efficient option for the airport route providing the greatest value for money. Metro North and Luas Airport, at present, do not provide enough transportation benefits to justify their excessive cost over the BRT solution. The DART Spur is found to be the cheapest rail option but also the one with the fewest benefits. The findings and methods used in this research could be used in other public transport investment cases to ascertain the best case for investment and could be used in conjunction to cost benefit analysis. This research adds to the field of implementing DEA in the field of public transport investment analysis. While DEA has been applied to other areas of transport analysis few have compared different investment and mode options on one route. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although integration facilitates a shift in the allocation of tasks and resources, health outcomes either improved or were unaffected by integration on average.

This strong collinearity is particularly problematic in linear or log-linear models, commonly used for elasticity estimation, and in a case study of Santiago, Chile, robust results with such specifications proved elusive. This paper presents a method based on discrete choice models to estimate the elasticities in an integrated fare system that overcomes these econometric problems, generating results that are both robust and consistent with those reported in the literature.

We examine whether the promisor's ability to accurately determine when to breach is maintained when taking into account the value of time that distinguishes between immediate performance and paying damages in court. We show that if prejudgment interest does not equal the promisor's subjective value from time (e.g. if the court uses the promisee's interest rate to fully compensate him), the promisor's breach decision will be distorted. When renegotiation is feasible this problem of excessive breach is mitigated, however asymmetric information about discount factors can lead to a renegotiation process that is doomed to fail. Punitive damages behave similarly. Specific performance without ancillary monetary awards always creates a pie for division between the parties. Ancillary awards for delay are unlikely to change this, but ancillary awards for partial breach make specific performance behave more like expectation damages, although to a lesser degree.

We evaluate this proposition using an alternative data source and a different econometric methodology. Rather than inferring demand shocks from an econometric model, we utilize a direct measure of global demand shocks based on revisions of professional real gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecasts. We show that forecast surprises during 2003-2008 were associated primarily with unexpected growth in emerging economies (in conjunction with much smaller positive GDP-weighted forecast surprises in the major industrialized economies), that markets were repeatedly surprised by the strength of this growth, that these surprises were associated with a hump-shaped response of the real price of oil that reaches its peak after 12-16 months, and that news about global growth predict much of the surge in the real price of oil from mid 2003 until mid 2008 and much of its subsequent decline.

I theoretically show that when the law protects franchisees from unequal treatment, the subsequent changes to the franchisees' standards tend to be too rigid, both across stores and over time. To increase flexibility, franchisors should modify standards informally when possible, while retaining the authority to modify them formally in situations where the franchisees may be tempted to renege, particularly due to free-riding. I also show that when the prohibition of unequal treatment is replaced with a rule-of-reason approach-whereby courts allow unequal contract terms that are economically beneficial-the rule of reason may backfire because it makes any informal agreements less attractive and, hence, harder to sustain. Finally, I provide evidence that, consistent with this model, car manufacturers in Italy use informal compensation to selectively enforce standards and retain the authority to modify the standards when intrabrand competition is strong, so that dealers are tempted to free-ride.","[Zanarone, Giorgio] Colegio Univ Estudios Financieros, Madrid, Spain",CUNEF Universidad,"Zanarone, G (通讯作者)，Colegio Univ Estudios Financieros, Dept Business Organization, Madrid, Spain.",gzanarone@cunef.edu,"Zanarone, Giorgio/K-4513-2014","Zanarone, Giorgio/0000-0003-0226-9188",,,,,55,14,14,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In the utility-improving regimes of our setup, including tolls or the UGB, core densities are lowered in each city but more and smaller cities emerge at long-run equilibrium. If lot size and other goods are sufficiently complementary in consumption, it is optimal that total land area increases in the aggregate even as congestion tolls or the UGB decrease the total area of each city.

The inception of this hitherto largely undeveloped site took place in the early 1990s, a period which we suggest characterising with the notion of EUphoria, that is, a widely held belief in the future of a borderless Europe. EUphoria is seen as the key to bringing together otherwise separate discourses under one shared ambition of constructing a cross-border business estate. With the fading of EUphoria, however, Avantis resurfaces as a shared problem and appears to have been built on expectations and promises held within a discourse of European integration rather than among private investors. In retrospect, Avantis as a product of EUphoria remains a EUtopia, albeit with very few believers.","[Jacobs, Joren; Kooij, Henk-Jan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Jacobs, J (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.",joren.jacobs@ru.nl; h.kooij@fm.ru.nl,,,,,,,32,8,8,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We address this gap in the literature by studying 18,935 non-CEO compensation contracts across 1,809 privately held venture-backed companies. Our key finding is that employee compensation varies with the degree to which VCs versus founders control the business. We show that relative to founder-controlled firms, VC-controlled firms pay their hired-on (i.e., nonfounder) employees higher cash salaries, provide stronger cash and equity incentives, and have more formal pay policies in place. We also observe that founder employees earn less cash pay and face weaker cash incentives than do hired-on employees, but have stronger equity incentives. We propose that the compensation differences we identify arise because the preferences and capabilities of controlling shareholders significantly influence the quality of the human capital attracted and retained by the firm.","[Bengtsson, Ola] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Hand, John R.

We examine the interaction between these two branches of antitrust, given the budget constraint of the public agency, and taking into account the ensuing incentives for firms in terms of choice between cartels and mergers. To the extent that a tougher anti-cartel action triggers more mergers and vice versa, we show that the two antitrust branches are complementary. However, if the merger's coordinated effect is taken into account, then for a sufficiently large such effect the agency may optimally have to refrain from controlling mergers and instead spend all resources on fighting cartels.

In our empirical application to forecasting the covariance matrix of the daily EUR/USD and Yen/USD return series, we find that our method produces more precise out-of-sample covariance forecasts than the DCC model.

In the face of continuously decreasing chief executive officer (CEO) tenure, CEOs, however, seem to have few incentives to embrace long-term oriented behaviour. Instead, the question of foremost importance to self-interested CEOs is whether short-term orientation already harms financial performance in the three to four years of their own tenure, and whether CEOs stand a chance of benefiting from long-term orientation while still in office. CEOs thus face an intriguing ethical dilemma between optimizing their financial pay-off within their own tenure and securing the longer-term well-being of the corporation, its employees, and other major stakeholders. Consequently, our longitudinal study focuses on the medium-term performance implications of short-term and long-term orientation in Europe's largest publicly listed companies. Results indicate that short-term orientation negatively impacts on medium term performance while long-term oriented behavior is positively associated with corporate performance in the medium term. Our findings advance managerial myopia theory, and provide insights into one of the most central ethical dilemmas faced by corporate executives today.","Univ St Gallen, Inst Management, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Brauer, MF (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Management, Dufourstr 40A, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",matthias.brauer@unisg.ch,,,,,,,53,22,25,3,56,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The case of Transantiago, in the capital city of Chile, provides a good example of this. The very ambitious Transantiago project, implemented in 2007 in Santiago, integrated the bus and the subway systems, changing the route structure of the bus services, introducing a common and integrated fare system and electronic payment device, and tendering the operation of approximately 4,600 buses (which by the launch of the system in February 2007 had increased to 5600) to 10 private companies replacing some 4000 small operators which owned 8000 buses. In the beginning, the system faced huge difficulties. Operators' revenue formula basically consisted of a fixed payment, which changed slightly with the actual patronage. This quickly turned out to be a problem, and as technological support became available (several months after the launch), compliance measures were implemented, directly affecting the operators' revenue. The first measure considered the seat/standing places per hour of the buses in operation, for each company, and compared it to the theoretical figure. As a result, buses operating during peak hours increased from 4600 to 5600 in just two months. Subsequent indexes included service frequency and regularity, as well as effective bus-km, aggregated by company first and later by service. This paper shows how the successive implementation of these performance indexes had an impact on the operation of Transantiago in the first years, discusses the difficulties faced to implement them and highlights the importance of technological support to make possible the application of adequate compliance measures.

J,"Crozet, Y; Chassagne, F",,,,"Crozet, Yves; Chassagne, Florian",,,Rail access charges in France: Beyond the opposition between competition and financing,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Access charges; Barriers to entry; Competition; Marginal cost; High speed rail; Infrastructure financing; Mark-up; Welfare,,"Access charges to the railway infrastructures, and in particular of the high speed lines, poses many theoretical and practical questions. Besides the need to decide whether it is better to apply a principle of marginal cost or a full cost approach, a difficulty arises with regard to the possibilities of competition between various operators. France is especially affected by this problem since access charges are particularly high while at the same time competition is non-existent. Is this absence of competition explained by the high level of access charges? After describing the principles which underlie the pricing scheme for high speed trains in France, this paper attempts to find out if these tolls constitute a barrier to entry. After building a model that summarizes the components of supply and demand on the Paris Lyon journey, this paper shows that the considerations relating to demand (peak hour or off-peak hour) are more fundamental than access charges, which do not in themselves constitute a barrier to entry. Barriers exist, but they involve access charges in relation to the allocation of slots which would make it possible to guarantee certain profitability to a new entrant. Break-even points are proposed which show that SNCF's potential competitors have margins for manoeuvre. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Jansson, K; Lang, H",,,,"Jansson, Kjell; Lang, Harald",,,"Rail infrastructure charging EU-directive, Swedish concerns and theory",RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The first railway package is being recast by the legislative bodies of the European Union. One point of departure in this paper is how Swedish agencies treat issues concerning marginal cost based charges, financing charges and allocation of scarce capacity and it discusses these issues from a welfare point of view, partly by use of theoretical modelling. It is seen here that the Swedish infrastructure manager (the Swedish Transport Administration) so far has no method for calculation of marginal costs as a base for charging, especially for costs of scarce capacity, and that the infrastructure manager is applying or discussing various methods for allocations of scarce track capacity. The EU-recast gives no guidance on principles for calculation of charges for scarce capacity, so we recommend the Swedish Transport Administration to develop such charges. The Administration seems to ignore important externalities that should be taken into consideration from a welfare point of view, with respect both to efficient charging and to allocation of scarce capacity. The analytical modelling part of the paper aims to derive these charges in principle, taking these externalities into account. If financing charges exceeding social marginal costs are applied, the model shows how to minimise the welfare loss of these increases. It also shows that financing charges should primarily be applied to market segments that cause large external costs from the operation of the train, where its customers have low valuation of wait time and delay time, where customers of other segments have high valuations of delay and where increased profits for other operators are induced.

Business failure prediction (BFP) is an effective tool that helps business people and entrepreneurs make more precise decisions in the current crisis. Using CBR as a basis for BFP can improve the tool's utility because CBR has the potential advantage in making predictions as well as suggestions compared with other methods. Recent studies indicate that an ensemble of various techniques has the possibility of improving the performance of predictive model. This research focuses on an early investigation on predicting business failure using a CBR ensemble (CBRE) forecasting method constructed from the use of random similarity functions (RSF), dubbed RSF-based CBRE. Four issues are discussed: (i) the reasons for the use of RSF as the basis in the CBRE forecasting method for BFP; (ii) the means to construct the RSF-based CBRE forecasting method for BFP; (iii) the empirical test on sensitivity of the RSF-based CBRE to the number of member CBR predictors; and (iv) performance assessment of the ensemble forecasting method. Results of the RSF-based CBRE forecasting method were statistically validated by comparing them with those of multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, single CBR, and a linear support vector machine. The results from Chinese hotel BFP indicate that the RSF-based CBRE forecasting method could significantly improve CBR's upper limit of predictive capability.

We identify the main characteristics of accounts in arrears and examine the role of ability-to-pay and equity factors in the recent hike in mortgage delinquency rates. We find that borrowers who took out their mortgage for buy-to-let purposes, those with high loan-to-value ratios and those with high repayment burdens are all more likely to be in arrears. This is also the case for borrowers with properties in regions that have suffered more severe economic shocks, as proxied for by changes in the regional unemployment rate. Our empirical analysis suggests that affordability issues and general macroeconomic developments have had an important and sizeable effect on arrears trends over time, suggesting that policy efforts to target the growing level of mortgage arrears need to take account of these issues.","[Lydon, Reamonn; McCarthy, Yvonne] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Lydon, R (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",reamonn.lydon@centralbank.ie; yvonne.mccarthy@centralbank.ie,,,,,,,26,19,21,0,4,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Most research has been done in low bicycle countries where walking is the main active mode. The paper presents an analysis for the Netherlands and Flanders, two European countries with high bicycle use. The study analyses two aspects of school travel behaviour: home-to-school distances and modal choice. Both are analysed for primary and secondary school students. A descriptive analysis learns that in Flanders trip lengths to primary schools are significantly larger than in the Netherlands and that the bicycle is more frequently used in the Netherlands. Analyses of influencing variables for both home-to-school distance and modal choice demonstrate that 'hard' factors that define the objective conditions for school choice (crucial for home-to-school distance) and modal choice are most influential. They regard the locations of eligible schools and the qualities of the eligible modes. Just one other factor is significant in the explanation of home-to-school distances: car ownership. On the other hand, modal choice is influenced by several other socio-cultural factors, where age of the pupil, size of the household, and car ownership are most important. Most outcomes are in line with other studies. The observed high bicycle use demonstrates that the bicycle has the potential to account for a large number of trips and can even be the dominant mode in school travelling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine intraday returns and find that the loss of value occurred just after the SEC's announcement on October 4. We find similar results for July 22, 2011, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the Business Roundtable.

In reality, many of these infrastructure projects are associated with significant risks stemming from the lack of knowledge about future cost and benefit streams. The fundamental premise of the PPP concept is to efficiently allocate risks between the public and the private partner. The return based on deterministic analysis may not depict a true picture of future economic outcomes of a PPP project for the multiple agencies involved. This deficiency underscores the importance of risk-based economic analysis for such projects. In this paper, the authors present the concept of Value-at-Risk (VaR) as a measure of effectiveness (MOE) to assess the risk share for the public and private entity in a PPP project. Bootstrap simulation is used to generate the risk profile savings in vehicle operating cost, and in travel time resulting from demand-responsive traffic. The VaR for Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is determined for public and private entity. The Methodology is applied to a case study involving such a joint venture in India, the Mumbai Pune Expressway/National Highway 4 (MPEW/NH4), and fiscal implications from the perspective of the public and the private entities are examined. A comparison between deterministic and risk based economic analysis for MPEW/NH4 is presented.

Government's reluctance to reduce VAT for certain food groups can be understood - although this may improve the level of welfare in low-income households, simultaneously it could reduce the social security benefits for the same households. However, as has been shown in other studies, the level of income affects the healthy food consumption and thus also public health, and via this the economic long-run growth, too. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess which food group consumption is more sensitive to the level of income and price changes. The study is based on  Household Budget Survey 2010 by CSB which contains 3798 Latvia's household survey data. It was calculated three indicators: (1) the households' available income for consumption per equivalent consumers, (2) the average price of product or product groups, (3) real consumption of product or product group by equivalent consumer. For each of the product are evaluated two models. The first model is used to estimate elasticity of demand for product dependent on households' available income for consumption. The second, to estimate elasticity of demand dependent on product average prices. Results show that if the introduction of the reduced VAT rate for certain food groups is politically supported, then they could be: bread, fruit and vegetables, fish and fish products.","[Brekis, Edgars] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Nipers, Aleksejs] Riga Internat Sch Econ & Business Adm RISEBA, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia; RISEBA University of Applied Sciences,"Brekis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",edgars.brekis@lu.lv,"Nipers, Aleksejs/F-7847-2015; Brekis, Edgars/B-4654-2013","Nipers, Aleksejs/0000-0002-6496-6694;",,,,,4,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,106,114,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100011,0

However, the attention paid to theoretical and practical marketing problems by enterprises is insufficient. This particularly refers to the analysis of marketing strategy effectiveness. It is not clear how marketing affects enterprise performance. To perform this analysis, the quantitative evaluation of enterprise marketing activities is required. Enterprise marketing is a complex multi-faceted phenomenon. Its various aspects are described by multidimensional and often oppositely directed criteria. Therefore, in this case, multicriteria evaluation methods can be successfully used for analysis. The state of the enterprise marketing system is described by sets of criteria. Therefore, the problem of adequate evaluation of their weights arises. Sometimes, it is possible to reduce the number of evaluation criteria by developing their hierarchical system. However, the question arises how the transformation of a single-level system of criteria into the respective multi-level system affects the calculation results.","[Ginevicius, Romualdas; Podvezko, Valentinas; Ginevicius, Adomas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Ginevicius, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",romualdas.ginevicius@vgtu.lt; valentinas.podvezko@vgtu.lt; vvfievk@vgtu.lt,,"Ginevicius, Romualdas/0000-0003-2067-4398",,,,,39,15,18,1,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

There have been pervasive research studies on this topic as well as on exploration of factors affecting project success. The objective of this research study is to identify and ascertain which of the project's attributes affect project success. The study also recognizes the role of organization maturity in achieving the success. Data sample is collected through interviews and self administered questionnaires. Using a sample of 71 project managers and other higher management officials, correlation studies are done. The correlation is investigated between project characteristics and organization maturity with project success. The Pearson Bivariate Correlation method is used to test the significance of the correlation. In order to perform the correlation analysis the SPSS version 20 is used. The results revealed significant negative correlation between project success and higher risks. A negative relation is also found for the higher complexity level and long duration of the project. No significant relation is found between project success and project budget, technicality involved and prior knowledge of the potential risks. On the other hand the organizational maturity is found to have a significant positive relationship with project success. This study identifies the importance of project related factors and organization maturity for achieving project success. It is suggested that the organizations should address the project related factors during the planning phase of their project. They should focus on reducing the following three things: a) the complexity involved in the project, b) the potential risks in the project and c) the overall duration of the project. It is also found that the standardization and optimization of the processes increase the maturity level of the organization which in turn increases their success.","[Khan, Rao Aamir; Spang, Konrad] Univ Kassel, D-34125 Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,,rakhan@uni-kassel.de,"Khan, Rao Aamir/M-4303-2019","Khan, Rao Aamir/0000-0001-7041-7168",,,,,34,0,2,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,376,384,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100035,0

Last year each Czech citizen drank on average 134 litres of beer, which puts the Czechs on the first place with the Irish being second. Yet in 1995 beer consumption reached 160 litres. Average weekly half-litre portions consumed by males dropped from 9.5 in 2007 to 7.7 in 2010. For women this figure is stable and on average it is 2 half-litre portions per week. At the same time, there is a drop in beer-drinking frequency and the number of beer consumers in the Czech population. Reasons are commented by Jan Vesely, executive director of the Czech Beer and Malt Association, rather simply: Trend in the drop of beer consumption is a logical consequence of several phenomena. Firstly, long-term changes in population lifestyle, pressure from employers to use working hours in more efficient manner and, last but not least, the fact that great beer-lover generation is slowly fading. Based on his long-term involvement in the brewery industry and continuous research in this field, the author of the article has divided the reasons for beer consumption drop into two factors, inner and outer The most important outer factors can be seen in an increase of excise tax on beer, military service being not obligatory anymore, alcohol checks of workers in the workplace, especially professional drivers, a lower number of tourists, a partial decline in beer drinking in the young generation, a low number of regular beer drinkers in towns and the country, an increased margin for tap beer in restaurants and pubs and the use of taps with a compensator as well. Among the most important inner factors are pricing policy of breweries, efforts of breweries owners to maximize their profits, marketing concentrated mainly on males visiting pubs regularly, individual beer imports from neighbouring countries although without any statistical facts, beer quality unification, i.e., Euro-beer production. Whereas the production of large breweries has been decreasing, the production of microbreweries has been growing, often offering accommodation and catering services as well.","Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Dept Management & Mkt, Fac Management & Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Kozák, V (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Dept Management & Mkt, Fac Management & Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",kozak@fame.utb.cz,"Kozak, Vratislav/H-6470-2012","Kozak, Vratislav/0000-0002-2148-5380",,,,,22,6,6,0,32,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Famille-rose porcelain-making is an innovative technique, directly effected by cloisonne enamel porcelain-making technique and it is based on five colored porcelain-making technique (developed in the reign of Emperor Kangxi), Famille-rose ceramic linings are mostly made with arsenic glass white base, and then arsenic glass white is blended with other pigment which will change its original color into a softer degree after blending.

Mexico did not get closer to the levels of economic and social development of its NAFTA partners, and it lost as compared to other Latin American countries. As main reason for this failure the paper identifies the unsuccessful upgrading in global commodity chains: Mexico has been transformed into an exportation platform assembling imported inputs. Interested just in the country's huge reservoir of cheap labor, foreign firms have shown little if any propensity to expand backward linkages or to invest in technological or organizational upgrading of local suppliers. Moreover, and different to China, the Mexican state has done little to balance the private sector's lacking commitment to research and development.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Parnreiter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55 Geomatikum, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",parnreiter@geowiss.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,69,5,5,0,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

In particular, the agri-environmental measures encourage the agricultural activities with lower environmental impact. Agricultural policies for the conservation of the rural landscape are born from the need to protect certain characteristics of the territory. Assuming a willingness of consumers to pay a surplus to enjoy a quality landscape, the paper has investigated the effect of agri-environmental measures dedicated to the landscape on real estate values.

The results show that, especially by the municipalities falling in the Poli Urbani area, there is a link between house prices and adherence to agrienvironmental measures dedicated to the landscape.","[Sali, Guido; Mazzocchi, Chiara] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Agr & Ambientali Prod Territorio, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Corsi, Stefano] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Milan, Italy; [Corsi, Stefano] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Metodi Quantitativi, Milan, Italy",University of Milan; University of Milan; University of Milan,"Sali, G (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Agr & Ambientali Prod Territorio, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",guido.sali@unimi.it,"SALI, GUIDO/M-4156-2015","SALI, GUIDO/0000-0002-6923-7730",,,,,11,0,0,0,3,MEDIMOND S R L,40128 BOLOGNA,"VIA MASERATI 5, 40128 BOLOGNA, 00000, ITALY",,,978-88-7587-690-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,159,166,,,,,,8,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BA8IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338155900015,0

It contents a short summary of important concepts of a consumer's choice analysis. The goal of the article is to give a basic survey of attitudes to the analysis of consumer's behaviour. However, it is especially concerned with the possibilities of the marginalist analytical apparatus use in a consumer's choice. Consumer's preferences are viewed as exogenous variables in a neoclassical theory. They are not explained in a framework of the concept but are viewed as given ones. Methodological individualism, rational behaviour, equilibrium and perfect information of a consumer are next features of this concept. Simple precautions are a necessary condition for the model application. Methodological individualism means that principles of individual subjects behaviour are the most important determining factors of model functioning. These subjects abide by the principle of total utility maximizing in given conditions. The concept of equilibrium is static. Perfect information precautions need not be necessarily fulfilled because contemporary concepts of consumer's behaviour function in the conditions of risk and uncertainty Institutional concepts of consumption are derived from T Veblen's theory of leisure class consumption. Preferences are influenced by the position of a consumer subject in the social hierarchy. Not only preferences, resources and individual behaviour but also social institutions are important factors of consumption in institutionalist concepts. Consumption is also viewed as social behaviour. Psychological aspects of consumer subjects behaviour are also important.","[Sredl, Karel; Soukup, Alexandr; Severova, Lucie] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Theories, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Srédl, K (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Theories, Prague, Czech Republic.",sredl@pef.czu.cz; soukupa@pef.czu.cz; severova@pef.czu.cz,"Šrédl, Karel/J-2521-2017; Soukup, Alexandr/J-2629-2017; Severová, Lucie/J-2548-2017",,,,,,9,6,6,0,22,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Taking cognisance of the importance of external collaboration between health insurers and healthcare service providers, the study is able to diagnose perceptions of strategic regulatory factors and their impact on levels of EO. The focus of the study is on the demand (financing) and supply (healthcare delivery) structures of the healthcare value chain, incorporating health insurers, health insurer administrators and healthcare service providers. A conceptual model is formulated on the basis of literature and tested using confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicate that EO at organisational level is a strong predictor of health insurer product innovation and that external collaboration between health insurers and healthcare service providers is a weak predictor of health insurer product innovation. Practical implications are that both the supply and demand side structures indicate that the restructuring of relationships between health insurers and healthcare service providers is a necessary driver for collaboration in terms of health insurer product innovation progress and success. Healthcare executives need to work with, and actively lobby regulators to ignite both demand and supply side innovation activities in the healthcare value chain of the private healthcare industry of South Africa.","[Urban, Boris; Streak, Milton] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Urban, B (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,"urban, boris/Q-1768-2019","Urban, Boris/0000-0002-6212-0169",,,,,63,4,4,0,48,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This study investigates how such outbreaks can affect the performance of biotechnology stocks. In the past 10 years, major statutory infectious diseases in Taiwan have included ENTEROVIRUS 71, DENGUE FEVER, SARS and H1N1. The empirical results indicate that there is a significant abnormal return on company shares in Taiwan's biotechnology industry because of statutory infectious epidemics. The relationship between the financial ratios of biotechnology companies and abnormal returns was analyzed as part of this research. The results show that the influence on R&D ratios, current ratios and assets are significant. Empirical findings reveal that the investors rationally measure operating conditions of the biotechnology companies during outbreaks of major infectious disease and adjust portfolio allocation accordingly.","[Wang, Yi-Hsien; Yang, Fu-Ju] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Li-Je] Chinese Culture Univ, Grad Inst Int Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University; Chinese Culture University,"Wang, YH (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei, Taiwan.",holland@mail2000.com.tw,"Wang, Yi-Hsien/U-6102-2019","Wang, Yi-Hsien/0000-0002-5755-9089",,,,,42,56,57,1,37,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This discount attribution standard has been applied in cases involving share-based loyalty rebates for a single product; in those cases, the contestable portion of demand plays the role of the tied product, and the non-contestable portion constitutes the tying product. Economists have developed an alternative test that predicts the impact on consumer welfare by comparing the standalone price of the tying product to the profit-maximizing price that would prevail the absence of the bundled (or share-based) rebate. Economists have proposed to implement this test by comparing the price of the tying good before and after the implementation of the loyalty rebate. We propose a framework that builds on these concepts, expanding the analysis to model fluctuations in market conditions. In a review of three recent cases in the pharmaceutical industry, we find that comparisons based on a simple before-after approach are often clouded by confounding factors. By explicitly modeling shifts in demand and cost structures, our proposed framework provides a more robust mechanism for applying these consumer-welfare-based tests.",,,,kevin.caves@naviganteconomics.com; hal.singer@naviganteconomics.com,,,,,,,21,3,3,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

It is argued that existing accounts of the airport as a space of transit as well as a place for shopping and entertainment have underrated the complexity and interdependency of the interests at stake in the airport design, as well the value of an airport terminal as an urban design exercise. This is particularly relevant in the discussion of the transformation of spaces of mobility, such as airports or railway stations, into multifunctional public spaces and may also be valid for urban spaces where mobilities are becoming increasingly important.

This paper focuses on revealing perceptions of truck drivers to urban congestion and safety challenges and gauges their interests in potential geometric or operational solutions, including managed truck lanes and tolling. A survey of 500 long-haul truck drivers was administered in Knoxville, Tennessee, at the crossroads of major north-south and east-west interstate highways. The dataset was evenly divided between independent owner-operators and company employed drivers. These two populations had somewhat varied trip making behavior, but their perceptions of traffic problems were consistent. The most problematic factors on Knoxville's urban highways include aggressive drivers, congestion, car lane changing behavior, and merging vehicles. The survey suggested several alternative truck lane management configurations and most of the respondents supported moving truck lanes to the inside travel lanes to avoid merging and lane-changing cars, either through traditional truck lanes restrictions or truck-only lanes. Respondents were polarized for and against the current truck lane restrictions; mandating trucks use the right two lanes. The mean willingness-to-pay to avoid ten minutes of congestion (through truck management) is about $2.00, lower than other studies. The results of this survey could be generalizable to other urban areas since most traffic is non-local. Future managed lane approaches can balance driver perceptions with operational efficiency to provide acceptable and high performing truck infrastructure. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

British investors, Iranian government officials, oil workers and other actors battled over the construction and employment of a formula during the course of three different but interconnected disputes over oil profits, labour and production rates. Opening up the dynamics of a petroleum formula exposes how, on each occasion, certain political possibilities were opened or closed in the co-assembling of the Iranian state and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Scholarship on oil and Iran has not been able to account for the kinds of non-human actors, tools and machinery involved in the building of such a large-scale political project as an oil industry. Thus the paper draws on the current research on formulas and markets in science and technology studies but takes a different direction by looking at their political construction in the resolution of not just financial and economic problems, but social and political ones.",,,"Shafiee, K (通讯作者)，309 Orenda Circle, Westfield, NJ 07090 USA.",ks718@nyu.edu,,,,,,,46,7,7,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Some authors have described the consistency principle as a 'fairness principle'. Others have written that it is not about fairness, that it should be seen as an 'operational principle'. We dispute the particular fairness interpretations that have been offered for consistency, but develop a different and important fairness foundation for the principle, arguing that it can be seen as the result of adding 'some' efficiency to a 'post-application' and efficiency-free expression of solidarity in response to population changes. We also challenge the interpretations of consistency as an operational principle that have been given, and here identify a sense in which such an interpretation can be supported. We review and assess the other interpretations of the principle, as 'robustness', 'coherence' and 'reinforcement'.","[Thomson, William] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Thomson, W (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",wth2@mail.rochester.edu,,"Thomson, William/0000-0002-8081-7816",,,,,46,49,51,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

It argues that a commodity chain and, more specifically, a whole chain approach, can be employed to examine such linkages and to contextualise economic relations. After outlining the main features of a whole chain methodology, the paper applies it to a case study of a real ale microbrewery in Northumberland in the North East of England. As well as examining the upstream and downstream nature of the microbrewer's own business supply chain, material from interviews with wholesalers, bottlers, pubs and other brewers is included to develop a locally sensitive cultural economy perspective. The paper reveals the complex nature of economic relationships and organisation for microbrewing, the different forms of trust that typify such supply chain relationships and tensions between difference and localness in relation to selling real ale.","Univ W England, Countryside & Community Res Inst, Gloucester GL2 9HW, England",University of West England,"Maye, D (通讯作者)，Univ W England, Countryside & Community Res Inst, Oxstalls Lane, Gloucester GL2 9HW, England.",dmaye@glos.ac.uk,"/AAC-2349-2022; Maye, Damian/AAS-7693-2020","Maye, Damian/0000-0002-4459-6630",,,,,30,21,23,0,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

If it selects greenfield investment, it has two ownership choices: whole ownership or a joint venture with a local company. Controlling for industry- and country-specific characteristics, we find that the more productive a firm is, the more likely it is to choose FDI rather than exporting and greenfield investment rather than M&A.","[Raff, Horst] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Raff, Horst] Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Ryan, Michael] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Staehler, Frank] Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Staehler, Frank] CESifo, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",University of Kiel; University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Western Michigan University; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Ifo Institut,"Raff, H (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 1, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",raff@econ-theory.uni-kiel.de; michael.ryan@wmich.edu; frank.staehler@uni-tuebingen.de,,"Ryan, Michael/0000-0001-9381-3112",,,,,37,33,35,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Secured creditors generally prefer liquidation whereas unsecured creditors tend to promote firm's reorganization. As a consequence, secured creditors might be an obstacle to reorganization when all classes of creditors have to vote to approve the reorganization plan. To complete this analysis, we study the link between bankrupt firm's capital structure and the likelihood of reorganization when bankruptcy Courts (instead of creditors) decide whether or not firms are reorganized. Our main result is that the reduction of secured creditors' influence on the reorganization process might constitute a means to promote bankrupt firm's reorganization. More generally, the paper analyses the link between the amounts/numbers of both secured and unsecured claims and the final issues of a Court-supervised reorganization process.","[Chopard, Bertrand] Nancy Univ, Univ Strasbourg, BETA, Fac Droit & Sci Econ Nancy,CNRS, F-54035 Nancy, France; [Blazy, Regis] LARGE Univ Strasbourg, IEP Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Chopard, B (通讯作者)，Nancy Univ, Univ Strasbourg, BETA, Fac Droit & Sci Econ Nancy,CNRS, 13 Pl Carnot, F-54035 Nancy, France.",Bertrand.Chopard@univ-nancy2.fr,,,,,,,12,15,15,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This article contributes to this debate in two ways: first, we focus on interindustry vertical integration, and second, we consider the effects on vertical integration of unrelated and vertically related variety at the local level. The latter was measured using information from input-output tables and captured the opportunities for outsourcing within the local system. A data set of 24,663 Italian business groups in 2001 was used to estimate Tobit models to investigate the influence of vertically related variety and other agglomeration forces on the degree of vertical integration of groups. We found that vertical integration is influenced by industry specialization at the local level and that higher vertically related variety reduces the need for firms to integrate activities, since they have more opportunities to acquire intermediate goods and services within the local system. We analyze the manufacturing and different macroareas and show that this relationship is also influenced by technology and differences in the organization of economic activities at the local level.","[Cainelli, Giulio] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, I-35123 Padua, Italy; [Iacobucci, Donato] Marche Polytech Univ, Dept Informat Engn, I-60131 Ancona, Italy; [Cainelli, Giulio] CNR, CERIS, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Padua; Marche Polytechnic University; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Cainelli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",giulio.cainelli@unipd.it; iacobucci@univpm.it,"Iacobucci, Donato/H-6468-2017","Iacobucci, Donato/0000-0001-8463-1106",,,,,54,57,59,2,76,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Khiyar al-'Aib is a legal Islamic mechanism by which, one party, both parties or even a third party can nullify a contract, electronically or conventionally. Khiyar (option) means the authority to nullify a contract and Aib means defect. In fact, it is a right given to the purchaser to cancel the contract if he discovers that the object acquired has defect that diminishes its value. In on-line contracts, the consumer has no direct contact with the merchant and cannot easily verify the quality of the goods, thus creating a situation in which contracting parties are not at equal bargaining strength. Therefore, application of Khiyar al-'Aib (option of defect) would be helpful in protecting consumer rights in the virtual world. This paper explores the Islamic principles by taking Iranian laws as well as the European law as a point of reference.","[Bagheri, Parviz] Bakhtar Inst Higher Educ, Ilam, Iran; [Bagheri, Parviz; Hassan, Kamal Halili] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Law, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Hassan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Law, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",Pb0873@yahoo.com; k.halili@ukm.my,,,,,,,24,0,0,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This Essay explores some of the psychological and political forces that can complicate or even hinder law reform efforts. Even when there is a general institutional drive for law reform, as there is in the EU, scarce reform resources force attention to be focused on salient issues, while a status quo bias in individual member states by government officials can provide a braking inertia regarding nonsalient legal reforms. This braking influence can be seized upon and enhanced by interest groups that oppose reforms, especially where there is an alternative to proposed law reforms for private entities. In the case of contract law harmonization, contract doctrine that is not focused on providing consumer protections remain nonsalient, commercial entities can solve the confusion of diverse laws by choosing their own, and interest groups in nations whose laws and dispute resolution forums are commonly chosen will oppose harmonization. Thus, the current state of affairs may prove relatively difficult to alter.","Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Law, Nashville, TN 37240 USA",Vanderbilt University,"O'Connor, EO (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Law, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.",erin.ohara@law.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,19,5,5,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

I also make a Wittgensteinian appeal to context and human sociality as an indispensable tether for what we mean by a fair experience and what we know, epistemologically speaking, about fairness.

Put in a nutshell Baumol's theory contends that labor intensive, stagnant sectors of the economy will become permanently more costly relative to the other less labor intensive and technologically more progressive sectors. As a result society may have difficulties to afford the services of these sectors. Local public transport seems to be an obvious candidate for this type of industry. We perform efficiency and productivity analyses in order to test this hypothesis. Our findings confirm the existence of Baumol's cost disease for this sector. This does not necessarily imply, however, that funding problems will increase in the future, at least as long as local transit is looked at in isolation. Funding problems may arise, though, if other stagnant sectors successfully compete for scarce public financing.","[Evangelinos, Christos; Wieland, Bernhard] Tech Univ Dresden, Friedrich List Fac Transportat Sci, Inst Transport & Econ, Dresden, Germany; [Kuehnhausen, Tilo] Transport Author Berlin Brandenburg VBB, Berlin, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Evangelinos, C (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Friedrich List Fac Transportat Sci, Inst Transport & Econ, Dresden, Germany.",Christos.Evangelinos@tu-dresden.de; Bernhard.Wieland@tu-dresden.de,"Evangelinos, Christos/AAM-4500-2021","Evangelinos, Christos/0000-0002-2451-7544",,,,,40,4,4,1,14,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

To meet appropriately the safety and mobility needs of all affected parties, traffic incidents call for a high level of cooperation and coordination of the agencies involved. Effective traffic IM activities rely in particular on flexible communications and information systems. On the basis of experiences from the military domain, it is possible to develop strategic concepts that ensure the improvement of information sharing and collective action. Such concepts can also be applied to enhanced traffic IM information systems. This paper provides a review of the state of the art in this field and illustrates the empirical usefulness and benefits of traffic IM.","[Steenbruggen, John; Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Smits, Jan M.] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Innovat Sci, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Grothe, Michel] Geonovum, NL-3818 LH Amersfoort, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Steenbruggen, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",john.steenbruggen@rws.nl; pnijkamp@vu.nl; j.m.smits@tue.nl; m.grothe@geonovum.nl,"Grothe, Michel J./S-7374-2018","Grothe, Michel J./0000-0003-2600-9022; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132",,,,,123,5,6,0,14,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

This contribution aims to address this theoretical issue through recourse to the literature on proximity. We analyse the modalities of coordination of organizations within clusters for the creation of localized specific assets. This paper develops the idea that cluster dynamics are governed by two relational logics: a professional and a historic. We show that those logics, each having positive and negative impacts on cluster dynamics, give rise to different ways of mobilizing categories of proximity as well as different ways of articulating them. Our case study shows that a major issue for clusters consists in combining both logics for building enduring competitive assets while staying able to adapt to changing competitive conditions.","[Amisse, Sylvain] Univ Angers, Grp Rech ANgevin Econ & Management, UFR Droit Econ Gest, F-49036 Angers 01, France; [Muller, Paul] Univ Haute Alsace, Grp Rech Apprentissage Innovat & Connaissance Org, Mulhouse, France",Universite d'Angers; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Haute-Alsace (UHA),"Amisse, S (通讯作者)，Univ Angers, Grp Rech ANgevin Econ & Management, UFR Droit Econ Gest, 13 Allee Francois Mitterrand,BP 3633, F-49036 Angers 01, France.",sylvain.amisse@univ-angers.fr,"Müller, Paul/IUN-0504-2023",,,,,,55,4,4,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Through comparative statics analysis, we find that consideration of timber value and fluxes in biomass carbon increase harvest age relative to the timber only solution, and that the effect on optimal harvest age of incorporating fluxes in the dead organic matter and wood products pools is indeterminate. We also present a numerical example to examine the magnitudes of these effects. In general, incorporating the dead organic matter and wood products pools have the effect of reducing rotation age. Perhaps more interestingly, when initial stocks of carbon in dead organic matter or wood products pool are relatively high, consideration of these pools can have a highly negative effect on net present value.
