This paper investigates whether this also holds for less self-evident areas of life such as the timing of births. We use a natural experiment when the German government changed its parental benefit system on January 1, 2007. The policy change strongly increased economic incentives for women to postpone delivery provided that they were employed. Applying a difference-in-difference-in-difference approach, we find very strong evidence that women with an employment history near to the end of their term indeed succeeded to shift births to the New Year and, therefore, could benefit from the new and more generous parental benefit system. Suggesting a model of chain reactions, we also report evidence that some women with due dates earlier in December tried but did not succeed to shift births to the New Year.","[Neugart, Michael] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Law & Econ, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany; [Ohlsson, Henry] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Technical University of Darmstadt; Uppsala University,"Neugart, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Law & Econ, Marktpl 15, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany.",neugart@vwl.tu-darmstadt.de; henry.ohlsson@nek.uu.se,"Ohlsson, Henry/A-7017-2008","Ohlsson, Henry/0000-0001-8826-0410; Neugart, Michael/0000-0002-3348-8570",,,,,19,37,43,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

In the backdrop of the economic and cultural globalization, it appears much important to discuss the international development model of Chinese traditional instrumental music. Along with analysis and discussion, this paper proposes several opinions of the sustainable healthy development of the contemporary Chinese traditional instrumental music and even national musical culture, which will help to realize the Chinese traditional music develop with the times change. The word of globalization is a concept and a phenomenon process of human social development. Generally it refers to the frequency of global contact, the growth of human life on the basis of global spectrum, the rise of global awareness and the interdependence of countries in politics, economy and trade. [1] In the late 1970 s, China began to implement the reform and opening up, which brought about overall engagement and increasingly frequent exchanges of Chinese and the western culture. More and more interchanges and integrations of literature and art from different nations exerted great influence on foreign culture due to sinofication. Gradually blending into the Chinese national culture, foreign culture, in turn, produced an effect on Chinese culture and even partially variation of Chinese culture. At that time, the westerners achieved rapid development of modern industry and then they began to pursue individual liberation. Modernism was a phenomenon at that time, which affected all the art in the 20th century including literature, painting and music. China was certainly involved and the signs of modernism could be traced in every field of Chinese art. With the collision of Chinese and foreign culture and art, Chinese artists begin to gradually get rid of political instruction and absolute following western techniques of creation before the 70s. They selectively inherit the past traditional art and absorb western modern art for the reason that they create diversified works centered by individual value orientation and aimed to express art itself. Compared to the western music, Chinese traditional music spreads far slower in the world because aesthetic consciousness produces limitations of Chinese national music accepted by people of other countries. Then how can Chinese music reach out to the world in the soil of nation? The answer is that we should enhance our international influence and carry out effective globalization, which means we are supposed to turn the national into the global and make our traditional culture understood, accepted and favored in the world. The so-called globalization requires the creation and performance of the national culture should adapt to economic and cultural globalization. Therefore, appropriate adjustment and development pattern exploration are needed on such aspects as the national instrumental music, the route of transmission and specialized market operation, etc.","[Rui, Liu] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Commun, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwest Jiaotong University,,,,,,,,,3,0,0,1,7,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,17.0,,,,,,510,513,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4DW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335444300099,0

Many different institutions have tried to find frameworks for new business reporting models, some of them have failed (unfortunately most of them) and some of them have succeed. The author will focus on those who have succeed. The perquisite to build the reporting model is reviewing stakeholders' information needs. The researches point that stakeholders try to find as many information on non-financial performance as possible but access to that information is very restricted.

Within this research, aspects of Business Process Management are understood with the meaning of the views or positions on the issues of Business Process Management with a focus on the objectives, factors, components, support, benefits and barriers to BPM implementation. The purpose of the research was to monitor the attitudes, opinions and judgments of managers of Czech firms to individual aspects of BPM. Since this is a subjective expression, which is subsequently necessary to evaluate statistically were used in this study a scaling method, based on a quantification of qualitative data. The meeting the objective of this article was conditioned by confirmation or refutation of the hypotheses aimed at extending the concept of BPM in the Czech Republic and its understanding, the utilization rate of BPM in the Czech manufacturing companies, the complexity of BPM components and the orientation of Czech managers to support management processes. The complete results of the research showed positive development in almost all observed aspects. The largest positive change occurred in the perception of the importance of process performance measurement. This shift can be evaluated very positively, because the performance measurement process is the basis and prerequisite for continuous improvement of processes, which helps to ensure that the established BPM is dynamic and does not involve redrawing of the existing processes into process maps only.","[Tucek, David; Hajkova, Michaela] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Ind Engn & Informat Syst, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Tuckova, Zuzana] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Enterprise Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Tucek, D (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Ind Engn & Informat Syst, Zlin, Czech Republic.",tucek@fame.utb.cz; mhajkova@fame.utb.cz; tuckova@fame.utb.cz,"Tuček, David/ABG-8573-2020; TuÄkovÃ¡, Zuzana/AAM-1965-2021",,,,,,18,15,15,0,41,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach, which is a data mining (DM) based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), called intelligent MOPSO (IMOPSO). The first step of the proposed IMOPSO is to find efficient solutions by applying the MOPSO approach. Then, the GRI (Generalized Rule Induction) algorithm, which is a powerful association rule mining, is used for extracting rules from efficient solutions of the MOPSO approach. Afterwards, the extracted rules are applied to improve solutions of the MOPSO for large-sized problems. Our proposed approach (IMOPSP) conforms to a standard data mining framework is called CRISP-DM and is performed on five standard problems with bi-objectives. The associated results of this approach are compared with the results obtained by the MOPSO approach. The results show the superiority of the proposed IMOPSO to obtain more and better solutions in comparison to the MOPSO approach.","[Haeri, Abdorrahman] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Ctr Excellence Intelligence Based Expt Mech, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran; University of Tehran,"Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran.",tavakoli@ut.ac.ir,"Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Reza/P-1948-2015; haeri, abdorahman/S-8933-2018","Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Reza/0000-0002-6757-926X; Haeri, Abdorrahman/0000-0003-0610-8998",,,,,33,11,11,0,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Controlling for self-selection in an analyst's decision to issue a cash flow forecast, we find that relatively more accurate earnings and cash flow forecasts reduce the probability of turnover. Relative earnings forecast accuracy decreases the probability of turnover more than relative cash flow forecast accuracy. We conduct two cross-sectional tests. We find that relative cash flow forecast accuracy is more important in the analyst's career outcome when cash flow forecasts are potentially more useful to investors. We find that relative cash flow forecast accuracy is more heavily weighted in the career outcome when the number of other analysts providing cash flow forecasts for the firm is larger. This finding is consistent with economic intuition that relative performance evaluation is more effective when larger groups of individuals are compared.

Although more than 60% of families saw their wealth decline over the two-year period, a sizable fraction experienced gains in wealth, while some families' financial situations saw little change on net. The shifts in wealth do not appear to be correlated in a simple way with families' characteristics. Instead, the patterns of mixed losses, gains, and modest shifts in wealth generally hold within groups defined by demographic characteristics or by 2007 wealth or income.

Valuations that can be applied for evaluating policies to improve perceived security are obtained. Consistent results are achieved, indicating that the method is promising for incorporating aspects in the physical environment in the welfare analysis. The results indicate a systematic variation in value of walk time in different physical environments and it is more dependent of the physical environment for women than for men. This paper thereby contributes to the literature by showing that results by social sciences can be verified using methods and theories traditionally used in transport and welfare analysis and may therefore be incorporated in standard CBA.

Although recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of some forecasting heuristics, the questions of why and when a heuristic would work remain unaddressed. This study aims to answer such why and when questions by looking empirically at the specific context of forecasting for customer prioritization. Based on widely-applied probabilistic models, a series of simulations reveal that: (1) we are not usually able to identify the future top X% of customers in a customer base accurately, even if we know the exact data generation process; (2) a simple heuristic can perform as well as a probabilistic model even if the model maps the data generation process exactly; (3) the relative performances of the model and the heuristics can be explained by several easily-obtainable descriptive statistics. The heuristic works because the minimal information it relies upon is relatively robust and relevant in a random world. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates empirically the case of Spain. From 1999 to 2009, Spain had a large wave of immigration from different areas of the globe. At the same time, crime rates increased. However, in comparison with other European countries that received similar massive immigration waves during the same period, crime rates in Spain increased less considerably. We show that there is a significant relationship between crime and immigration. Nevertheless, the explanation is found in the specific characteristics of the different immigrant groups, particularly in the amount and type of human capital, which result is largely in tune with the previous studies on U.S. immigration and crime.

Coase's argument decisively depends upon the agents having resources to bargain. Since rents, understood as the return to a certain activity in excess of its opportunity cost, are natural providers of such resources, they play a vital role in the logic of the Coase theorem. It has been recently argued (Halpin, 2007) not only that Coase provides an incomplete analysis of rents but also that he is committed to a flawed argument over rents by neglecting the role of alternative activities. This paper recasts Coase's argument in the presence of rents and alternative activities to show that the theorem can be vindicated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This measure combines an efficiency component using a Linear Expenditure System (LES) and an equity component using the Atkinson Index of Inequality. The efficiency component includes the behavioural response to price changes for non-subsistence expenditures thereby producing a Cost of Living Index. The Atkinson Index of Inequality produces an inequality measure and this is combined with the Cost of Living Index to produce an overall welfare measure. This extends upon the existing Irish literature on this issue by accounting for this broader set of components. The results show that changes in the cost of living have differed substantially between households both in terms of demographics and the position of the household in the income distribution and that behavioural response can potentially improve the welfare position of households in response to price changes in most years.,"[Loughrey, Jason; O'Donoghue, Cathal] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, TEAGASC, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Teagasc,"Loughrey, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Galway, TEAGASC, Galway, Ireland.",jason.loughrey@teagasc.ie,"O’Donoghue, Cathal/AAW-4109-2021","O’Donoghue, Cathal/0000-0003-3713-5366",,,,,32,6,6,0,7,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We analyze the regional evolution of the German laser systems industry in West Germany in the 19752005 period. We find that regional knowledge in the related field of laser source production and the presence of laser-relevant universities and public research organization were conducive to the first emergence of laser systems producers. Upstream laser source producers influence entry into the downstream laser systems industry primarily through their own diversification moves. Public research was less important in the submarket of materials processing laser systems, which is less directly science based than other parts of the laser systems industry.

The differences in how innovation affects firm growth is explored for small and large publicly quoted US pharmaceutical firms between 1950 and 2008. We observe that the positive impact of R&D on firm growth is highly conditional upon a combination of firm-specific characteristics such as firm size, patenting and persistence in patenting. For small firms, R&D boosts growth for only a subset of firms: namely, those that patent persistently for a minimum of five years. For large pharmaceutical firms, on the other hand, R&D may have a negative impact on growth; potentially resulting from the low R&D productivity these firms have suffered from since the mid-1990s. These results raise important issues around the R&D and firm growth relationship for small and large firms as well the role of persistence in innovation for boosting firm performance.","[Demirel, Pelin] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Mazzucato, Mariana] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Nottingham; University of Sussex,"Demirel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",Pelin.Demirel@nottingham.ac.uk,"Mazzucato, Mariana/H-4456-2011","Demirel, Pelin/0000-0003-3223-6723; Mazzucato, Mariana/0000-0001-9183-5000",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F028180/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F028180/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,55,106,111,5,96,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The key contribution is to provide an empirical test of the relative importance of geographically proximate versus distant interaction, using a two-step procedure to remove potential endogeneity in interaction decisions. In doing so it finds that only national and only international interaction have the expected positive effects on the probability of innovation, while engaging in both national and international interaction has no effect. The findings support hypotheses on the importance of both geographically proximate and distant interaction for innovation, though the lack of significance for both national and international interaction means there is no evidence to support the proposition that these forms of interaction are complementary.","[Doran, Justin; Jordan, Declan; O'Leary, Eoin] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Doran, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland.",justin.doran@ucc.ie,"Jordan, Declan/M-1745-2019","Jordan, Declan/0000-0002-2446-0111; O'Leary, Eoin/0009-0003-0054-1480; Doran, Justin/0000-0002-9875-901X",,,,,59,8,8,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

An analytical framework discussing the various effects of international trade on R&D activities is presented. This is followed by an empirical analysis that uses a dynamic empirical specification for current R&D expenditures and for a cumulative measure of R&D stock. The empirical investigation is applied to a panel dataset covering Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's countries. The empirical results show that increases in import intensity levels induce reductions in private R&D expenditures whereas increases in export intensity levels promote larger private R&D expenditures.

We find that the European vehicle fleet is robust to proposed biofuels mandates owing to an existing fuel tax and tariffs structure that favours diesel vehicles. Harmonising excise duties on diesel and gasoline or lowering tariffs on biofuel imports, however, is shown to reverse the trend toward more diesel vehicles and significantly alters the efficiency costs and environmental effectiveness of renewable fuel policies.","[Gitiaux, Xavier; Rausch, Sebastian; Paltsev, Sergey; Reilly, John M.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Rausch, S (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E19-411, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rausch@mit.edu,,"Paltsev, Sergey/0000-0003-3287-0732; Rausch, Sebastian/0000-0002-6379-8406",Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1028163] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,42,6,7,0,6,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

The representative theory of learning society ( organizations) by Peter Senge considers the process of learning as a basic condition for preparing the whole society to civilization and the ongoing social changes.","[Kominarec, Igor] Katedra Politol FF UPJS Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia",,,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,SOCIETAS SCIENTIARUM OLOMUCENSIS LI,OLOMOUC,"KRIZKOVSKEHO 10, OLOMOUC, 77900, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87533-04-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,197,200,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BIB28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000327205300024,0

First, financial, industrial-technological and cadre infrastructures are undeveloped. This impedes the formation of steady innovation chains basic research - the applied scientific research and experimental-design developments - the commercial technologies. Secondly, the investment needs of the economy considerably exceed the volume of the long-term borrowed resources, which needs domestic particular financial sector. Thirdly, the Russian producers outgoing on the international markets are situated in the unequal competitory conditions in comparison with the exporters from other countries. The formation of the effective system of development institutions is a way to solve these problems. Therefore state undertook decisive steps toward the formation of this system in recent years. Development institution is a specialized state (quasi-state) organization (corporation), created for the eliminating market failures in a concrete sphere, which restrain the economic and social development of the country. The development institutions meet four basic challenges: overcoming failures of market in the sphere of innovations (quasi-innovation); elimination of institutional failures (forming of the absent, but necessary segments of market); development of economic (power engineering, transport, other communications) and social infrastructure; equalizing of the essential regional unbalances of development. The development institutions in Russia have some shortcomings. The system of the development institutions created up to the present moment in Russia is enormous and cumbrous. Majorities of existing institutions possess the extremely insignificant scales of activity. Their ineffectiveness and opacity is one additional drawback of domestic development institutions. Furthermore, for the development institutions in Russia the absence of coordination is typical. In spite of variety of development institutions in the country, the economy is still developing due to the export of raw material, and situation is not assembled to change. Practically all development institutions existing in Russia are only money bags, which distribute the financial resources between priority projects.","[Maidan, Tatiana] St Petersburg State Univ Serv & Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics,,tatyana_maidan@mail.ru,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,391,398,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100036,0

Annual financial statement data were used for 55 manufacturing companies listed on the JSE Limited over a five-year period in a cross-sectional analysis. The study found that return on equity has the most significant relationship with technical efficiency, followed by return on assets. The market value ratios price/earnings and dividend yield have no significant relationship with technical efficiency. The value of this study is that it is the first of its kind where technical efficiency, which aggregated operating, profitability and marketability efficiencies, is used to determine the relative importance of not only the readily available profitability ratios, but also market value ratios.","North West Univ, Sch Accounting Sci, Potchefstoom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Oberholzer, M (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Accounting Sci, Potchefstoom, South Africa.",,,,,,,,52,2,2,1,22,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

While people are preconditioned to believe that these firms perform well and have high valuations, this is not always the case. In order to explain this phenomenon, we adopt a lens of strategic orientations that influence innovation: market orientation and technology orientation. By using 10-year panel data, and a content analysis examining the relative orientations of our sample firms, we find that the market-oriented and technology-oriented tendencies of innovative firms influence firm performance and value. Relatively market-oriented innovative firms can guarantee instant performance by offering customers new products and services that they want. However, customers may not be loyal to one particular innovative firm. By contrast, relatively technology-oriented innovative firms are not subject to customers' fastidious choices and have higher firm values. Furthermore, environmental uncertainty negatively influences the relatively market-oriented innovative firms' value as well as sales performance.","[Park, Namgyoo K.; Park, Uisung D.; Lee, Jeonghwan] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 151916, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Bld 58,Room 308,San 56-1 Sillim Dong, Seoul 151916, South Korea.",tankee@snu.ac.kr,"park, Uisung/HQY-2102-2023","Park, U.

Key aspects of both elaboration and implementation of the new instrument, worked out by the authors, are presented in the essential parts of the article. An original approach to the threats identification is offered, by viewing threats as products of actions and inactions of various, internal and/or external to the organization, parties concerned in their capacity of licensing institutions. By presenting empirical results of their implementation, the instruments of measuring and evaluating of threats are substantiated, provided threats evolve from the aggression degree of licensing institutions. The aggression is viewed as a result of the license infringement, where the license is issued from licensing institutions to the organizations and it covers organizations critical indicators and their critical values. The instruments of the consecutive measuring and evaluating of various managerial decisions about limitation of the threats to the organizations are substantiated further in the article.

Business processes and business data form a coherent unit as business processes need relevant data for their execution while business data should fully serve to business processes. A change of the information system as a whole or a modification of a partial module of the information system are initiated exclusively by changes in the flow of instances of the business flow; this means either external changes such as customers' requirements, change in suppliers' approach or internal changes such as a change in activity flow or change in work activities as such. Current information systems are developed on the platform of relation database systems with the basic principle of relation data model. Analysis and design of a relation data model requires application of specialized methods leading to definition of relation schemes including integrity constraints. For development of a data model technical expertise is necessary which cannot be delegated on actors of working activities or managers of business processes. However, only the actors in process instances and managers of the process know their needs in relation with execution of the process, therefore, they should characterize their requirements on the module of the information system by identifying the data content. Information system serves as support for carrying out particular business process. Composition of indicators is changeable together with methods of measuring and evaluating and also the process itself changes as a result of its improvements. When controlling the values of indicators, it is necessary to take into account that within one process it is possible to measure indicators and then evaluate the same process or it is possible to measure indicators which provide data about quality or lack of quality of another process. The composition of indicators for measuring and evaluating quality of process performance or any change in the method of controlling should be an impulse for change of information environment.

Based on recent literature and empirical research, an established model was applied to five European cities. Not surprisingly, there is low acceptability for coercive measures like road pricing in general, but a closer look reveals a more differentiated picture, The impact of several factors on eventual acceptability was analysed. Consequently, critical factors can be identified in order to develop more effective strategies. Moreover, the role of trials is discussed. Acceptability is higher, if the necessity for a measure has well been communicated and if personal benefits can be expected. The results indicate that the underlying model can be regarded as a very valid measurement tool for acceptability of coercive traffic demand management measures. The paper also has implications for designing and successfully implementing urban road pricing schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence from the New York City group ride vehicle project,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Jitneys; Informal transit; New York City; Regulatory innovation,TRANSPORTATION; INNOVATIONS; IMMIGRANTS,"Many US cities have unsuccessfully experimented with jitney projects to improve transit service, reduce costs, and adapt to shifting demographics. The impetus for this research was to take advantage of a natural policy experiment, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission's (TLC) Group Ride Vehicle (GRV) Pilot Project, to evaluate why jitneys often fail when regulated to supplement conventional transit The Commission developed the pilot project in response to service cuts on dozens of New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) bus routes throughout the city. These cuts, coupled with higher transit fares, dramatically limited transit access for many city residents. Shortly after the service reductions went into effect in June 2010, the Commission announced the pilot project to bring commuter vans (commuter vans are the licensed jitneys in New York City) to five service areas that lost regular bus service. They expected the project to improve access for New Yorkers and create opportunity for jitney drivers and operators. The pilot project targeted service areas in Brooklyn and Queens, and the Commission received commitments from five existing commuter van operators to participate in the project The project was controversial for multiple reasons, including the City's willingness to privatize formerly public transit service and the imposition of two fares for Group Ride Vehicle riders traveling into Manhattan. The first Group Ride Vehicle began service in September 2010, and despite optimism from operators and the TLC, the program was unofficially discontinued after only a few months. Though the pilot project failed to attract riders, it highlighted the importance of commuter vans for transit-dependent populations that rely on them and suggests many challenges to formalizing informal transit in the United States. Using the Group Ride Vehicle project as our starting point, we explore why informal jitneys in the United States succeed, and whether the conditions under which they prosper are compatible with conventional transit operations. Focus groups with operators, unstructured interviews with drivers and riders and participant observation are used to help explain the challenges facing the formalization of jitney services in New York. Our analysis identified four reasons why the GRV project failed: (1) a lack of subsidy to maintain service and build demand, (2) a two-month gap between the service cuts and jitney service implementation, (3) poorly branded service, and (4) confusing language used to describe the program. We argue that some of these factors are more perceived than real, but all of them reflect the difficulty of scaling up a niche jitney service to a general purpose transit service.

This paper focuses on instances where the value of a platform depends on the adoption decisions of a small number of firms, and analyzes the strategic competition among platforms to get this oligopolistic side on-board. I study a bilateral contracting game among platforms and firms that allows for general externalities across both contracting and noncontracting partners, and examine when a market will sustain a single or multiple platforms. When firms can join only one platform, I provide conditions under which market-tipping and/or market-splitting equilibria may exist. In particular, even without coordination failure, congestion effects, or firm multihoming, multiple platforms can co-exist in equilibrium despite being inefficient from the perspective of the contracting parties. Expanding the contracting space to include contingent contracts may exacerbate this inefficiency.","NYU Stern Sch Business, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",,"Lee, RS (通讯作者)，NYU Stern Sch Business, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA.",rslee@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,37,18,20,0,49,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

These curves provide an indication of growth at different percentiles of the distribution and may be used to address the issue of whether growth was pro-poor or not. The analysis suggests that growth was broadly pro-poor over the period as a whole and also over two sub-periods of 2003-2007 and 2008-2011, reflecting periods of boom and recession respectively.

Products that are enhanced by inclusion of patented features should generate incremental profits. Incremental profits can be assessed by considering demand for products with patented features and contrasting that demand with demand for the same product without the patented features. Profit calculations must be based on valid estimates of demand as well as assumptions about how competitive forces affect demand via computation of market equilibria. A conjoint survey can be used to estimate demand. Recently, conjoint methods have been applied in the patent setting, but the measures of value used are purely demand based and do not involve equilibrium profit calculations.

Thus, this study concludes that the increase in R&D investment alone is not sufficient to improve the firm performance which in turn highlights the complementary role of desorptive capacity.","[Kim, Hyojoon; Kim, Youngwoo; Cho, Keuntae] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Management Technol, Seoul 440746, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, K (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Management Technol, 2066 Seobu Ro, Seoul 440746, South Korea.",ktcho@skku.edu,,,,,,,31,13,15,3,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

To overcome the traditional limitations of informal, inter-personal collaboration, the Japanese government has made intensive institutional and organisational reforms to establish formal boundary-spanning organisations in universities since the late 1980s. This paper investigates the roles, effects, and limitations of boundary-spanning organisations, such as (1) UI Cooperative Research Centres initiated in 1987, (2) Approved Technology Licensing Organisations in 1998, and (3) Intellectual Property Headquarters in 2003, which have mediated different types of UIC. The research results suggest that formal boundary-spanning organisations can significantly drive the growth of UI collaborations and that the different types of UIC require a functional specialisation in boundary-spanning organisations by developing coordinative expertise, human resources, institutional arrangements, and organisational structures. Furthermore, for instituting effective organisational management of UIC in university, this research emphasises the significance of integrity and coherence among different boundary-spanning functions.","Gachon Univ, Coll Social Sci, Songnam 461701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Gachon University,"Lee, KJ (通讯作者)，Gachon Univ, Coll Social Sci, Kyungwon Campus,1342 Seongnamdaero, Songnam 461701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",leekjoo@gachon.ac.kr,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25380554] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,32,14,15,0,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This analysis is based on a unique database of all banks in the Netherlands that existed in the period 1850-1993. We found that spatial clustering of the Dutch banking industry was not driven by the fact that banks performed better in the Amsterdam region: being located in Amsterdam decreased rather than increased the survival chances of banks. However, banks in Amsterdam were disproportionally active in acquiring other banks outside Amsterdam. Experience in M&As accumulated mainly in the Amsterdam region, which in turn had a positive impact on the survival chances of banks located there. Our findings suggest that M& A activity was a driving force behind the spatial clustering of the Dutch banking industry between 1850 and 1993.","[Boschma, Ron] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden; [Boschma, Ron; Hartog, Matte] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Utrecht, Netherlands",Lund University; Utrecht University,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden.",Ron.Boschma@circle.lu.se; m.hartog@uu.nl,,,,,,,71,18,27,0,69,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

We compare the models on the basis of their accuracies in out-of-sample forecasting, both point and density. Our results show that it is difficult to say that any one model of trend inflation is the best. Several different trend specifications seem to be about equally accurate, and the relative accuracy is somewhat prone to instabilities over time. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.

In particular, three metropolitan super-regions' have become China's most competitive knowledge-based economies, consisting of the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Bohai Gulf Region. This paper benchmarks the competitiveness of these regions, with a view to exploring which region is best positioned to become the most dominant knowledge-based economy over time. Through the theoretical lens of dynamic comparative advantage, it is shown that each region has hugely increased its competitiveness through improvements in the capacity to absorb and diffuse knowledge. It is further shown that due to multi-dimensional advantages the Yangtze River Delta, incorporating the Shanghai metropolis, is best positioned to become the dominant hub of China's future knowledge economy. It is concluded that China's leading regions will require further economic policy adjustments in order to secure their future competitiveness.","[Huggins, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Planning & Geog, Ctr Econ Geog, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales; [Luo, Shougui] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Thompson, Piers] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England",Cardiff University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Nottingham; Nottingham Trent University,"Huggins, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Planning & Geog, Ctr Econ Geog, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",HugginsR@cardiff.ac.uk; sgluo@sjtu.edu.cn; piers.thompson@ntu.ac.uk,"Thompson, Piers/R-5828-2019","Thompson, Piers/0000-0003-1961-7441",,,,,136,13,14,2,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Using United Nations data, a trade network is proposed and a set of variables that represent the participation of countries in autocatalytic trade cycles is constructed. A clear relationship between these variables and economic growth is found since more innovation is produced in countries that are part of trade cycles. However, the relationship changes with autocatalytic trade cycle sizes, categories of goods and time scales. Moreover, autocatalytic trade cycles also have a positive effect for the trade flows involved, although this effect differs significantly depending on the size of the cycles. This new approach based on autocatalytic trade cycles emphasizes the benefits that countries can extract from trade cycles and points out the need of policies that foster these benefits. These conclusions strengthen existing literature, and also add new insights to innovation policy and the pursuit of economic prosperity.","[Bakker, Jurrien J.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Appl Econ, Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat MSI, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Afonso, Oscar] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, NIFIP, CEFUP,OBEGEF, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Silva, Sandra T.] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEFUP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",KU Leuven; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Afonso, O (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, NIFIP, CEFUP,OBEGEF, Rua Roberto Frias S-N, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",j.j.bakker@student.tue.nl; oafonso@fep.up.pt; sandras@fep.up.pt,"Silva, Sandra T./M-9110-2019; Afonso, Oscar/B-6016-2009","Silva, Sandra T./0000-0002-8843-3999;",,,,,39,1,1,0,15,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Modifications to competition law rules in developed economies, however, may not always be practical for emerging market economies to adopt.

This article provides an overview of some of the significant developments in the 2010 U.S. Horizontal Merger Guidelines from an emerging market perspective. While taking into consideration the general characteristics of emerging market countries, the treatment of four specific topics under the new Guidelines will be scrutinized from a law and economics perspective: market definition, market shares and market concentration, market entry, and coordinated effects.

These two factors reduced the cost of contracting and limited the potential risk of opportunism.

This study examines state laws that required loan applicants to receive information about the risks of foreclosure before they could sign certain mortgage contracts. Skeptics suggest that disclosures are largely ignored by consumers, yet controlling for other factors this study shows that loan applicants in states with enhanced warnings about foreclosures were more likely to reject high-cost refinance mortgage loan offers from a lender. Enhanced disclosures with features such as risk warnings, signatures, and referrals to counseling are being implemented as part of Dodd-Frank consumer finance reforms.

These methods include the dummy variable approach, the dynamic treatment effects (DTE) method, and the so-called straight-line methods. The key results show that both the dummy variable and the DTE methods perform better than the straight-line methods. Moreover, the last should not be used when the underlying cost and demand drivers over the cartel period are substantially different from those prevailing before or after. The dummy variable approach and the DTE method provide very similar estimates of the cartel overcharge, though there is no reason to expect that this would always be the case. Finally, this article contributes to the ongoing debate on optimal fines and on the societal benefits of having a proper antitrust enforcement by showing that that the fines levied by the AGCM in this particular case were below optimal levels, and that the benefits from this intervention of the AGCM are roughly seven times its annual budget.","Autorita Garante Concorrenza & Mercato, Rome, Italy",,"Notaro, G (通讯作者)，Autorita Garante Concorrenza & Mercato, Rome, Italy.",giovanni.notaro@agcm.it,,,,,,,24,3,3,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Opinion leaders usually show a higher involvement in their purchase decisions than other consumers. This leads to a higher stability in their answers when being asked about their preferences. An important question that previous research has not analyzed yet is whether and how to capture this finding in preference-based market forecasts. The authors study these aspects for a representative sample of 364 consumers in the mobile phone market of a large European country. They find that assigning higher weights to the preferences of opinion leaders in aggregate market forecasts results in estimates that are more consistent with observed market shares than forecasts in which all consumers are given equal weights. The authors further test different measures of opinion leadership and find that sociometric indicators outperform psychographic constructs to account for the outcome of opinion leadership in preference-based market forecasts.

Given the lack of direct evidence of collusion, the accusation against the health insurance providers was based mainly on economic and econometric evidence provided by these authors during the trial. This article shows that, when properly assessed, such empirical evidence does not support the claim of collusion.

Policy makers have been puzzled by the question of why the contracted WIC price is substantially lower than the retail (non-WIC) price. Our explanation is that winning the WIC contract is extremely valuable to a manufacturer because of a spillover effect: The increased retail shelf-space that is dedicated to the WIC brand and the WIC logo increases non-WIC sales. We identify this effect by showing the variations in market shares of winning and losing firms that follow WIC contract changes. Immediately after the contract change, there is an immediate increase in the market share of the WIC contract winner and an equal drop in the loser's share because of new WIC purchases. Then, over an extended period, the spillover effect increases the winner's share and decreases the loser's share as retailers shift shelf space from the loser to the winner.","[Huang, Rui] Univ Storrs, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Perloff, Jeffrey M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Connecticut; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Huang, R (通讯作者)，Univ Storrs, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Univ Connecticut, 314 WB Y Bldg U4021,1376 Storrs Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",rui.huang@uconn.edu,,,,,,,16,4,4,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

In these times of an emerging global creative economy the debate is becoming increasingly complex as global governance is faced with serious challenges of a political, economic, cultural, environmental, social, technological and, last but not least, legal nature. Against the backdrop of a global food crisis, both in terms of food security and food safety for all, the present article explores some of the broader regulatory aspects of these challenges by looking at the regulation of food and notably novel food as engineered by the use of bio- and nano-technologies. It aims to show how the preservation of the integrity of law over time, and with it the objectives of providing legal predictability and legal certainty, are threatened by deficiencies in the institutional design of the current international legal framework as well as in the conceptual understanding underlying the legal instruments adopted by these institutions. The analysis at the international level is complemented by a brief look at the domestic level exemplified by the situation in the European Union and the People's Republic of China against the backdrop of their attempts to formulate and successfully implement policies enhancing their competitive advantages in the creative economy.","Univ Macau, Fac Law, Taipa, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Neuwirth, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Law, Ave Padre Tomas Pereira S315, Taipa, Peoples R China.",rjn@umac.mo,"Neuwirth, Rostam/AAC-5120-2021","Neuwirth, Rostam/0000-0002-0641-5261",,,,,79,3,5,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In spite of the different theoretical frameworks used and results obtained, these approaches tend to highlight, in the main, the pivotal role of the Chinese state. China's red, or party-driven, capitalism is highly concerned with the risks inherent in current economic growth. The concept of 'sustainable economic growth' thus becomes paramount in today's official political discourse and refers to change in the type of reform (see 'Conceptualising the sustainability of the Chinese capitalist system'). Because of its core role in modern economic growth, the financial services sector is analysed in this chapter by means of (i) statistical analysis ('Statistical analysis of the financial services sector in China') and (ii) policy elements and political implications ('Reforms and control of the banking sector and of financial services'). The concluding section ('Concluding analysis') presents an analysis of the risks inherent in this sector and in modern Chinese capitalism as a whole; it also highlights the weaknesses of the system. The chapter argues that issues of political control and vested interests in the Chinese system create serious challenges for further reform and internationalisation. While China's financial sector as a whole seems to be reasonably stable, the issues of how to pursue the objective of further internationalisation puts the central leadership at odds with strong inner-party opposition.","[Gottwald, Joern] Ruhr Univ Bochum, East Asian Polit, Bochum, Germany; [Gottwald, Joern] Univ Trier, Polit Sci, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Gottwald, Joern] Natl Univ Ireland, Irish Inst Chinese Studies, Cork, Ireland",Ruhr University Bochum; Universitat Trier; University College Cork,"Andreosso-O'Callaghan, B (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, Chair East Asian Econ, Bochum, Germany.",,,"Andreosso, Bernadette/0000-0002-4145-4231; Gottwald, Jorn-Carsten/0000-0001-6849-3444",,,,,49,0,0,0,3,CHANDOS PUBL,SAWSTON,"80 HIGH ST, SAWSTON, CAMBRIDGE CB22 3HJ, ENGLAND",2052-2126,,978-1-78063-449-4; 978-1-84334-768-2,CHANDOS ASIAN STUD,,,2014,,,,,,,149,167,,,,,,19,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6UP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354492600008,0

The measurement of the performance of the experts is based on the expert's assessment of seed variables. These performances are used to determine the weights of the expert's judgments in the aggregation of them. The disadvantage of the rational-consensus method in social science is the lack of agreed upon seed variables, and that it does not instead use the shared knowledge captured by models. Moreover, there seems to be sufficient evidence that combining models with expert judgments leads to better judgments.

While the literature states that the economic success is based on the effective utilization of intangible assets, in the public sector there is low level of interest in their identification, measurement and disclosure. In the light of the theoretical evidences, the purpose of our research is to verify the developed stage of intangible assets process in Romanian municipalities as regards the awareness, measurement and disclosure in 2012 annual reports. Also, the paper presents the most influential factors of intangible assets information disclosure. In order to do this, a disclosure index has been created, based on the requirements related to the intangible assets, taking into account the referential of Romanian regulations (OMFP 1917 updated) and International Public Sector Accounting Standards The research is based on content analysis and in-depth interviews methods for collecting data from the 104 Romanian municipalities. The analysis led to the conclusion that the disclosure index of intangible assets is 0.28, where the municipality population and assets are the variables that are considered explanatory of the variation of the disclosure index in the regression analysis performed. There were identified no supplementary measurement ways of intangible assets voluntary disclosed, although the Romanian municipalities present some characteristics related to intangible assets. While management control is more and more important in local public administration, aiming to improve internal performance, the measurement and disclosure of intangible assets becomes a goal.","[Bunget, Ovidiu Constantin; Blidisel, Rodica Gabriela] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Audit, Timisoara, Romania; [Feleaga, Liliana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Accounting & Management Informat Syst, Dept Accounting & Audit, Bucharest, Romania; [Popa, Irimie Emil] Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Audit, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",West University of Timisoara; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Bunget, OC (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Audit, Timisoara, Romania.",ovidiu.bunget@e-uvt.ro; rodica.blidisel@e-uvt.ro; Liliana.Feleaga@cig.ase.ro; irimie.popa@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Ionescu-Feleaga, Liliana/AAT-1346-2021; Bunget, Ovidiu Constantin/AAM-4201-2020","Ionescu-Feleaga, Liliana/0000-0002-2087-2186;",,,,,43,12,12,5,49,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This model suggests first a concave relationship between intrateam task disagreement and decision-making comprehensiveness. It also conjectures that conflict communications influence the effectiveness of decision-making comprehensiveness on new product project teams' performance. An empirical test of the proposed framework involves a survey of 220 cross-functional new product project teams. The findings show that an inverse U-shaped relationship exists between a project's intrateam task disagreement and its decision-making comprehensiveness. It also indicates that collaborative communication has a negative effect on innovativeness, whereas contentious communication adversely affects constraint adherence. However, decision-making comprehensiveness partially moderates the relationships between conflict communications and project team performance. Some managerial and research implications of the findings were also discussed in this study.","[Chang, Tsun-Jin] Shih Chien Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Yeh, Shang-Pao] I Shou Univ, Dept Tourism, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Shih Chien University; I Shou University,"Chang, TJ (通讯作者)，Shih Chien Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung Campus, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,30,1,3,1,61,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The main aim of this article is to present various points of view on the globalization and enterprise internationalization process with a special accent on the analysis of the specifics in the internationalization process of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Those enterprises represent a significant part of the Czech economy because they considerably contribute to the creation of vacancies and GDP; they are a source of innovation and technological progress and the factors of their successful functioning in foreign trades differ from the large-sized enterprises. For this reason, SME shave been more frequently analysed in an effort to identify key factors, which involve their ability to succeed in international activities. Those factors could positively influence other SMEs in their plans to participate in the foreign trade. However, not all the enterprises have equal conditions for entering the foreign market field. In some business spheres, the export of SMEs is supported, which is considerably helpful, mainly in case of enterprises with insufficient funds. Some of the other spheres facilitate access to the foreign market because of their sort of production. Besides analysing the internationalization process of SMEs, this article is also focused on identification of both key factors of success and risk factors of the process. Determinants of SMEs success in the foreign market were examined using several extensive researches among Czech small and medium-sized enterprises of various business spheres. Results of the research have produced interesting information. It was discovered that all SMEs, although they operate in different business spheres, share similar problems concerning the internationalization process. Key factors, which determine success of Czech small and medium-sized enterprises in the internationalization process, are analogous in spite of diverse business spheres, but nevertheless every particular branch has a strong effect on an opportunity and willingness of SMEs to participate in the internationalization process.","[Kubickova, Lea; Prochazkova, Lenka] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kubícková, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Brno, Czech Republic.",lea.kubickova@mendelu.cz; lenka.prochazkova@mendelu.cz,"Kubickova, Lea/U-3322-2017","Kubickova, Lea/0000-0002-4154-1802",,,,,28,13,14,2,43,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

More significant increase is evident from the accession into the EU when Slovakia adopted the commitment to increase the acreage of agricultural land for the implementation of organic farming. At the same time it was possible to draw farmers' subsidies for the establishment and functioning of organic production. This factor played an essential role in 2004 and between 2008-2009 when the most significant impact on the development of active farmers was evident. At the present (2013) there are 355 organic farmers in Slovakia, out of this amount 11 belong to the process of conversion. There is the highest share of organic farmers in Presov region (24.42%) and Kosice region (17.44%). The lowest amount of organic farms is evident in Bratislava (3.78%) and Trnava (5.81%) regions. From the focus of agricultural production point of view the animal organic production prevails the plant production. The main motivation behind the farmers 'decision to change the conventional to organic production is still a financial incentive to compensate the loss of the income from reduced production and additional costs related to the implementation of organic farming. The motivating factor would definitely be the farmers' support from the part of the state in the forms of enhancement of the sales of organic products, improved counseling system and promotion.

We present second generation panel cointegration tests of the theory for the European Union countries and candidate countries for the period 1990-2011. In the first step, we tested heterogeneity and cross-section dependence among countries and found that all series have cross-section dependence. For that reason, we used second generation panel unit root and panel cointegration tests. These tests have the consideration of cross-section dependence, so it is important to consider this to improve the reliability of the estimation results.

Marketing decision-makers found the traditional MI and marketing tools of great value in supporting marketing decision-making, but the value of several of the newer MI tools and technologies was less clear.

This study analyzed the relationship between the mainly four motivation factors and tourist satisfaction, and found that visitors who mainly intended to learning and study hold the highest satisfaction, while the other three have no obvious influence on satisfaction. So the conclusion is that tourist motivation has great positive impact on tourist satisfaction and the extent of impact is affected by tourist destination attribute characteristics. If the mainly motivation of tourists is similar to or consistent with destination's attribute characteristics, it will have a high positive impact on tourist satisfaction, in turn, it will have a low or even negative impact.","Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Wang, HF (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",whflaura@hotmail.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,3,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,HAWTHORN EAST,"STE 4, LEVEL 3, 695 BURKE RD, HAWTHORN EAST, VC 3123, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9924140-8-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,767,773,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2MF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358894900124,0

The republican state promotes freedom as non-domination in relations between the state and the citizen as individual (imperium) and the citizens as collectivity (dominium). Republican democracy consists of the mixed government, rule of law, and contestatory citizenry. Its functioning may be presented in the condominium model. One of the proposed conditions of achieving non-domination is referral of certain decisions to independent bodies, auditors, solicitors and impartial experts. However, problems arise when one takes into account the variety of expert types, and especially the fact that not all of them fulfill the impartiality condition. This may pose some challenges to the condominium model.

This predictor is useful in many econometric applications that are usually based on unbalanced panel data and have a nested (hierarchical) structure. Examples include predicting student performance in a class in a school, or house prices in a neighborhood in a county or a state.

Following countries like Germany and Austria, the latest Dutch policy proposal is to introduce mandatory quota for employers with more than 25 employees to create job openings for the disabled for 5 per cent of their workforce. A first calculation of possible job openings shows that from a national perspective a mandatory quota seems promising. However, due to differences in the regional economic structure the arrangement will not be sufficient to solve spatial inequalities in regional exclusion of disabled at the level of municipalities nor for larger regions at the NUTS 1 level like the North of the Netherlands. We conclude that more attention should be paid to the spatial variation in impact when the national government decides to decentralise the implementation of national policy measures to municipalities.","[Edzes, Arjen J.

In particular, it is found that the commercialization activity fully mediates the association between network diversity and the business outcome.

It then contextualises the scenarios, emphasising the need for the longer view, the importance of decarbonising the economy, and in engaging decisions makers at all levels in a fully participatory process to confront the need for strong action on mitigation and adaptation. This is illustrated with an example from Delhi to demonstrate some of the recent developments and applications of these principles.

Our study used a robust quasi-experimental research design to measure the impacts of Eugene, Oregon's Safe Routes to School program on walking and biking. Using data collected between 2007 and 2011 at 14 schools with and without Safe Routes to School programs, we showed that the Safe Routes to School program was associated with increases in walking and biking. Education and encouragement programs were associated with a five percentage point increase in biking. Augmenting education programs with additional SRTS improvements such as sidewalks, crosswalks, covered bike parking, and Boltage was associated with increases in walking and biking of 5-20 percentage points. The study results illustrate the potential for the Safe Routes to School program to change behavior and should encourage other communities to plan for multi-modal school travel.

Low-carbon transport measures can be classified according to their strategies and instruments. It is more useful for decision making to identify what options are more feasible and effective among available ones in each type of cities. This paper gives an overview of the trends and effects of low-carbon measures for urban transport, dependent upon the development stages and types of urban land-use transport systems. Typical measures affecting low-carbon transport systems all over the world are classified through the CUTE matrix to capture the trends. Then, their prospective effects on CO2 mitigation are discussed by reviewing empirical studies. These reviews show that the feasibility and effectiveness of transport strategies are significantly affected by the development process of cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine Portugal's metropolitan transportation sector through the fiscal federalist lens, in light of the country's decentralization efforts and new relevant legislation. We clarify basic principles of fiscal federalism and adapt them to the finance of metropolitan transportation systems - typically characterized by multiple jurisdictions, numerous externalities and equity concerns - showing the inadequacy of general practice. Portugal's overall public finance system partially adheres to fiscal federalist principles; the transportation sector less so. Metropolitan transportation faces particular troubles, with few direct user fees, prices inadequately reflecting costs, and heavy reliance on central government subsidies for public transportation investments and operations. A new law creating metropolitan transportation authorities is only modestly consistent with fiscal federalist principles, since it inadequately details financial responsibilities and remains under heavy central government control. Absent additional reforms, the new metropolitan authorities should aim to make the transportation finance system explicit and test incentive grants to induce inter-municipal cooperation.

The aim of this research is to extend and apply the SSA method, using the UK Industrial Production series. The performance of the SSA and multivariate SSA (MSSA) techniques was assessed by applying it to eight series measuring the monthly seasonally unadjusted industrial production for the main sectors of the UK economy. The results are compared with those obtained using the autoregressive integrated moving average and vector autoregressive models. We also develop the concept of causal relationship between two time series based on the SSA techniques. We introduce several criteria which characterize this causality. The criteria and tests are based on the forecasting accuracy and predictability of the direction of change. The proposed tests are then applied and examined using the UK industrial production series.

I argue that the Catholic Church used vermin trials to increase tithe revenues where tithe evasion threatened to erode them. Vermin trials achieved this by bolstering citizens'' belief in the validity of Church punishments for tithe evasion: estrangement from God through sin, excommunication, and anathema. Vermin trials permitted ecclesiastics to evidence their supernatural sanctions'' legitimacy by producing outcomes that supported those sanctions'' validity. These outcomes strengthened citizens'' belief that the Church''s imprecations were real, which allowed ecclesiastics to reclaim jeopardized tithe revenue.","George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Leeson, PT (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,,,,,,,52,32,34,0,13,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The elimination of conference's role of enforcing tariff rates should improve slot utilization by promoting efficient pricing. This paper develops a backhaul pricing model to investigate the effect of confidential service contracts on the structure of liner market. In view of the increasing gap between head haul and backhaul freight rates in the European Union after year 2002, a linear joint pricing equation is numerically applied to the homebound and outbound freight rate indices at ports of Antwerp/Hamburg.

For the macro-social analysis level, data from the socio-economic context and public policies were considered. To approach the meso-social analysis level, family profiles were studied. To understand the micro-social dimension, the case study of a family with working children was considered. Each dimension had a type or set of traits corresponding to it that were studied and analyzed and then put together to interpret child labor. It required the use of methods and styles of qualitative and quantitative research. The study seeks to understand within what broader framework the history of Yanina and her children fall in a fragmented social setting marked by regional inequalities. The primary sources are documents from public organisms and the life history of Yanina, regarding her family with working children. Conclusions are-that the conditioned transfer in two fragmented programs is not sufficient as a public policy, because intervention is required for the different micro-, meso- and macro social aspects.","Univ Salvador, Fac Ciencias Educ & Comunicac, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Silva, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Salvador, Fac Ciencias Educ & Comunicac, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",msilva-kusy@yahoo.com.ar,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

We find that this act had virtually no noticeable effect on the overall level of entrepreneurship, measured by self-employment, partly because potential entrepreneurs were more likely to seek limited liability to offset the reduction in wealth protection imposed by the new law. That is, the incorporation rate increased for small businesses after the new law was enacted. This increase emphasizes that limited liability provided by incorporation is an important strategic variable that potential entrepreneurs utilize in response to changes in personal bankruptcy law. This study implies that incorporation is an important parameter to consider in understanding the relationship between bankruptcy law and entrepreneurial activity. The policy implication of this study is that entrepreneurs do respond to changes in personal bankruptcy law, even though it is intended for consumers, so this potential side effect should be considered when designing a new law.","Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Paik, Y (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, 3670 Trousdale Pkwy,BRI 306, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",Yongwook.Paik@marshall.usc.edu,"Paik, Yongwook/F-2589-2018","Paik, Yongwook/0000-0003-2789-5441",,,,,47,14,14,1,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

One solution rarely employed is for the court to appoint its own neutral economic expert under Rule 706 of the Federal Rules of Evidence when a lawsuit contains a claim for damages that will require rigorous analysis of data. Based on my recent experience as Judge Richard Posners court-appointed economic expert on damages in patent infringement litigation, I explain how the wider use of Rule 706 would assist the judge and jury and would facilitate the prompt settlement of intellectual property, antitrust, securities, contract, business tort, and other complex disputes.

The findings suggest that online WOM and expert reviews play a critical role in moviegoers' consumption behavior in the age of the Internet and social media.","[Kim, Sang Ho] Daegu Univ, Dept Journalism & Mass Commun, Gyeongbuk, South Korea; [Park, Namkee] Yonsei Univ, Sch Commun, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Park, Seung Hyun] Hallym Univ, Sch Commun, Chunchon 200702, Gangwon, South Korea",Daegu University; Yonsei University; Hallym University,"Park, SH (通讯作者)，Hallym Univ, Sch Commun, 1 Hallym St, Chunchon 200702, Gangwon, South Korea.",parksh@hallym.ac.kr,,,,,,,53,51,62,8,118,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

J,"Mitric, S",,,,"Mitric, Slobodan",,,Urban transport lending by the World Bank: The last decade,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Urban transport; Development lending; World Bank; Motorization; Poverty; Sustainability; Public transport regulation,,"Over the preceding decade, the World Bank committed about US$7.5bn in loans for urban transport projects in its client countries, involving total project costs of nearly US$13bn. Projects are designed by the client city/national governments and the World Bank in an interactive, give-and-take process. As is common in development finance, urban transport projects entail an investment program and a set of policy and institutional initiatives. A majority of Bank-funded operations in this period focused on public transport modes. A clear and overarching strategic thrust is evident, favoring private delivery of services with a strong public role through city-specific regulatory agencies. Depending on the context, projects involved efforts to introduce private operators and competition into an all-public set-up, or tighten up weakly regulated, informal public transport markets. A notable feature of many projects in the latter context is the use of investments in bus rapid transit infrastructure to reach multiple goals: improve transport services, maintain affordability for low-income passengers, attract new passengers, reduce negative environmental impacts, and leverage complementary reforms of policies and institutions. The Bank's program in China, unique in its local context of a dynamic urban society moving away from a near-universal reliance on bicycles, initially did not focus on public transport but on urban roads and traffic management. Towards the end of the last decade, the motorization process and the outlook of decision makers entering a more mature stage, projects in China started to converge towards what the rest of the Bank's program was doing - searching for a more sustainable path to urban transport development. Overall, the thrust of the Bank-funded program was in the sustainable direction, but it addressed only a part of a sustainability-oriented agenda. The major missing piece was a considered engagement with urban roads and general traffic within a sustainable framework. This would involve tackling street congestion and related negative impacts, shifting priorities between modes, and generating revenue to fund transport system operation and expansion.

We show that there always exists a monotonic equilibrium, and further, that the monotonic equilibrium is unique for either concave distribution functions or strictly convex distribution functions with nonincreasing reverse hazard rates. There exist nonmonotonic equilibria when the distribution functions are strictly convex and the difference of the participation costs is sufficiently small.

Jury verdicts from previous trials provide information that could be used to help set beliefs about the potential damage award that would be granted in a dispute if it were to go to trial. But if past jury verdicts do have an impact on litigant beliefs then growth in observed awards could alter behavior in ways that change which cases ultimately get resolved at trial. In other words, the average jury award today could influence the set of cases we see at trial in the future. This paper derives and tests some empirical predictions about how past verdicts change the number of future trials and the expected trial outcomes. The findings suggest that recent verdicts alter the settlement behavior of litigants, making them more likely to proceed to trial with lower value cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike other laws, which most often attempt to channel behavior, revenue-raising taxes attempt to avoid changing behavior; so, it is not obvious whether or when knowledge of the tax law is desirable. I argue that whether knowledge of the tax law is desirable depends on three factors: expectations about the tax in the absence of knowledge, the type of tax, and the quality of the tax. These factors may often be hard to observe, which leads to the conclusion that it may often not be desirable to try to manipulate knowledge of the tax law.

Two kinds of outputs are taken into account by our DEA model, portfolio return and stochastic dominance indicators. As a unique contribution, we state the benefits of the DEA approach in the DARA, CARA, and IARA framework, and evaluate the efficiency of mutual funds based on fund strategies as well as the performance of best mutual funds among their group. The evidence shows that the efficiency scores of technical, management, and scale are respectively 0.81, 0.921, and 0.874 for the DARA model, while the efficiency scores of two models of CARA and IARA are negligible. Also, we rank each management strategy in any model based on two methods - the number of referencing and the weighted value so that the managers of inefficient strategies must pattern the managers' ability of reference (efficient) strategies to improve their efficiency on the fund market in future.","[Baghdadabad, Mohammad Reza Tavakoli; Tanha, Farid Habibi; Halid, Noreha] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, JALAN REKO, Grad Sch Business, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Baghdadabad, MRT (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, JALAN REKO, Grad Sch Business, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",Mr_tavakkoli@yahoo.com; farid_ht@yahoo.com; noreha@ukm.my,"Halid, Noreha/ABE-5063-2021","Halid, Noreha/0000-0002-4853-3012",,,,,21,4,4,0,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The main hypothesis of the underlying research paper is that Employee Satisfaction has an Impact on the Level of Company Value. Based on a deep theoretical research, a secondary data analysis from the United States and a primary data analysis from Germany, the author showed in several publications that there is a dependency between employee satisfaction and financial results, respectively company value. The company value or the value of a company can be measured by the Equity Value. In this primary data analysis the author compared 11 companies which took part in the Great Place Contest 2007 and 2009 or only in 2009 regarding their Equity Values and Great Place to Work Scores. The figures of these companies were provided to the author in an anonymous form. The author had no influence on the number of companies the Great Place to Work Institute provided to him. The Great Place to Work Institute tried to find companies, which attended both contests and also show their financial data in the ElektronischenBundesanzeiger. Thus, the following paper aims to foster these results with some additional primary statistical analysis for testing this hypothesis. For this investigation the author did various types of statistical analyses which seem to confirm the underlying proposition. With different types of correlation analyses the relationship between. Equity Value and. Great Place to Work score was elaborated. A correlation analysis has been conducted on the basis of available data.

The proposed WLCRT method is based on the linear combinations of matrix algebra calculations. It has distinct advantages in preference modeling, weight elicitation, and aggregation performance. In this method, the decision matrix of preferences is constructed using a 7-point Likert scale. The weights of criteria are elicited from the proximity matrix of preference relations using the eigenvector method. Then, the weighted generalised means are used to aggregate preference information as well as to rank the order of decision alternatives. The WLCRT method can flexibly reflect different decision attitudes for the decision maker. It is both technically valid and practically useful, and can be used in dealing with multiple criteria analysis problems involving ranking of alternatives.","I Shou Univ, Dept Creat Prod Design, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan",I Shou University,"Chou, JR (通讯作者)，I Shou Univ, Dept Creat Prod Design, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan.",jrchou@isu.edu.tw,,,,,,,55,14,15,1,17,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Data from the Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity in Melbourne, Australia was used to compare the household characteristics, neighbourhood characteristics and household income of saturated and non-saturated households. These predictors were then entered into two binary logit models. The largest influence on car saturation was the number of adults in the household where households with three adults were 45% less likely to be car-saturated than one-adult households, ceteris paribus. The presence of a young adult was particularly influential, likely because young adults are less likely to be licensed and less likely to be able to afford their own vehicle. The impact of household size is a concern in Australia where the average household size has been slowly decreasing; however this trend may be countered by an increase in young adults living at home for longer.

Many economists from all over the world have been trying to find company's bankruptcy forecasting model using different methods with the aim to achieve the best results. For this purpose discriminant analysis, probit and logit analysis have been usually used. As mentioned statistical methods needed to meet assumptions as linearity, normality and independence among predictor variables, new methods with nonlinear nonparametric properties such as neural networks have been developed and applied. Despite of many advantages of neural networks, still the above mentioned - classical statistical methods have been mostly used. In the presented paper we provide a review of bankruptcy prediction studies divided into two time periods: before and after year 1966. Three of the bankruptcy prediction models: Altman model, Beerman discriminatory function, Index IN05 have been chosen for the validation on the real data of companies established in Slovakia. We have developed new modified model while using regression analysis to get higher predictive performance on analysed sample than chosen models. To validate selected bankruptcy prediction models performance we have chosen approach based on the data minig validation methods. Hence, our study is focused on the performance evaluation at two levels: precision - proportion of correctly predicted bankruptcy of totally predicted bankruptcy; and recall - proportion of correctly predicted bankruptcy of really bankrupted companies. Based on the matched sample of 1560 firms from the time period 1993-2007, our findings based on precision and recall indicate, that chosen models are inappropriate for Slovak economy and new quest for new models should be undertaken.","[Delina, Radoslav; Packova, Miroslava] Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva & Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Delina, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva & Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia.",radoslav.delina@tuke.sk; nniroslava.packova@tuke.sk,"Packova, Miroslava/AAE-5555-2020; Delina, Radoslav/L-6141-2015","Delina, Radoslav/0000-0003-0412-9840; Packova, Miroslava/0000-0001-7042-0981",,,,,21,37,37,0,26,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Compared internationally the German banking system is presumably very decentralized, however more research is needed to assess the state and influence of banking systems' spatial organisation on a cross country base.","[Gaertner, Stefan; Floegel, Franz] Inst Arbeit & Tech, D-45886 Gelsenkirchen, Germany",,"Gärtner, S (通讯作者)，Inst Arbeit & Tech, Munscheidstr 14, D-45886 Gelsenkirchen, Germany.",gaertner@iat.eu; floegel@iat.eu,"Flögel, Franz/AFV-0732-2022","Flögel, Franz/0000-0002-7874-3029",,,,,94,2,2,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Currently, partnering is the one of the most effective ways to access a broad set of resources. In the ICT industry, we can observe a significant number of alliances, networks, and mergers and acquisitions. The contribution of this paper is to investigate how a contextual factor - namely, national culture - influences the alliance portfolio formation and a firm's performance. We also aim to contribute to the issue of alliance portfolio formation. First, the concepts of alliance portfolio and culture as an explanatory factor are elaborated upon and their relevance to the study discussed. Second, using a sample of 30 ICT leaders and 10,247 of their alliances, we explore the effect of alliance strategy on firms' performance as well as the connections among culture, firms' performance, and alliance strategy. The study confirms that, in a global ICT industry (i.e., the most dynamically changing and riskiest environment), weak alliances may increase a firm's performance more than strong, traditional strategic alliances. Culture may be used as one of the explanatory factors affecting firms' performance as well as firms' alliance strategies.","[Golonka, Monika] Kozminski Univ, Dept Management, Warsaw, Poland; [Rzadca, Robert] Kozminski Univ, Business Strategy Dept, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University; Kozminski University,"Golonka, M (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Management, Jagiellonska St 59, Warsaw, Poland.",monikagolonka@kozminski.edu.pl; rzadca@kozminski.edu.pl,,"Rzadca, Robert/0000-0002-6308-0875",,,,,71,6,6,2,29,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The development of high-tech industry has become an important symbol of a country and the regional scientific advance level and the level of development of productive forces, which is also the key factor of economic development. High-tech enterprises in China are facing a series of problems, one of which is the lack of sustainable development. Starting with the high-tech enterprise human capital characteristics, this paper will propounds that the corporate culture is the driving force of high-tech enterprises to maintain its competitive advantage, which will effectively motivate and restrict the high technological qualified staff to meet its characteristics and advantages. Enterprises operating environment has transformed to the dynamic state of uncertainty from relatively static state. High-tech enterprise is the important symbol of national and regional scientific progress, productivity level, which is also the key factor to the rapid development of the national economy. High-tech enterprises are facing increasingly severe challenges in such complicated and changeable environment. Compared to the traditional enterprise, the outstanding feature of a high-tech enterprise is high knowledge and high technology, high risk and high innovation, high growth and short-period. High knowledge and high technology are composed of intellectual capital transformation of technical and management personnel in hi-tech enterprises. High risk and high innovation are the significant characteristics of high-tech enterprises. A technical and management personnel is the direct supply innovation force. High growth within a short period is depending on the technical and management talent cooperation to acquire a dominant role in the competition. High-tech enterprises in China started relatively late, which had exposed the problems of short life, slow development, weak competitiveness and risk resistance. To solve these problems, we must start from the human capital of high-tech enterprise, research the human capital characteristics to play its leading advantage, which is directly related to the development of the whole industry, but also related to the sustainable development of the scientific and technological progress and economic region.","[Hou Jing; Meng Jianfeng] Langfang Teachers Univ, Sch Management, Langfang 065000, Peoples R China; [Qin Ming] China Petr Pipeline Commun Corp, Langfang, Peoples R China",Langfang Normal University,,,"de Lima, Andréia/G-8040-2014",,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,17.0,,,,,,456,459,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4DW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335444300088,0

The MPR of Latvia is assessed to find out if it has had a functional development or not. Functional MPRs are considered those that deliver sustainable economic growth, employment and a more equitable income distribution. A macroeconomic policy regime is a set of policies (foreign exchange policy, industrial policy, monetary policy, fiscal policy and wage policy), the financial system and institutions in which the economies are embedded. The observations and findings made so far point towards the direction of a dysfunctional development of the MPR in Latvia, causing great instability in the economic development, capital outflow and instability in the financial system. This paper provides an alternative model in which the foreign economic policy and industrial policy, with the help of the financial system which provides sufficient finance for the manufacturing sector, play the paramount role in reducing the current account imbalances; wage policy provides anchor for the price development; monetary policy provides stability in the financial system and fiscal policy cares about real stabilization, higher employment and more equal income distribution.","[Kazandziska, Milka] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,,mkaza@zedat.fu-berlin.de,"Kazandziska, Milka/AAR-7430-2021",,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,363,375,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100034,0

Of all cultural dimensions studied, future orientation and humane orientation proved to be the best predictors for managerial values. On the other hand, the degree to which top managers value the welfare of the local community and nation, ethics and the economic effectiveness of their company, influences positively their employees' motivation and organizational commitment. Results point to the universality of certain values and the need for top management to communicate them effectively in today's global environment. The aim of the article is, through the analysis of the phenomenon of waste, to reveal the situation of waste pickers in the society and the paradoxical relationship between the society and them. The tasks are to formulate and shortly discuss historical aspects of waste, its management and secondary use, through the historical role of waste pickers in the system of waste management; to analyze the concept of waste and its possibilities as an analytic means for the analysis of phenomena in social life; to shortly introduce the subculture of waste pickers, and time symbolic meaning of their work. Waste accompanies humanity from its very beginning. When civilizations develop, waste loses its natural role. It becomes unnecessary trash which is disposed as far as possible from people who creates it. Thus, in the contemporary world waste does not become a part of life for anybody to save the poorest (shadow) layers of society. These layers of society (similarly like waste in the material world) are considered not important, redundant. However, like waste goes through the process of decay and gets a new sacred power of creativity, so can the marginalized people, passing through the processes of stigmatization and exclusion, become for the society a new challenge. This challenge can give a possibility that would lead society towards a fuller integration of all its parts and to more mature functioning.","Vilnius Univ, Dept Social Work, Fac Philosophy, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Petruzyte, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Dept Social Work, Fac Philosophy, Univ Str 9-1, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania.",donatai@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,1,1,1,19,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

During this time it went through systems of various exchange rates. While fixed system was implemented at the beginning of its existence, since 1997 the Czech Koruna has moved to a system that allows greater exchange rate volatility. Businesses must cope with this volatility, and therefore seek appropriate methods of forecasting future exchange rate movements. One of the methods is forecast by forward rates. The indisputable advantage of this method is the low cost associated with the detection of forward exchange rate for the most traded currency pairs. The euro and dolar are the most important currencies in the Czech republic for foreign trade. Con-sequently it is necessary to forecast exchange rates for the Czech Koruna and USD and Euro. One of the tools for forecasting the future spot rate is the forward rate. In this paper, we verify the hypothesis the forward rate does not provide long-term profit.

The paper examines the role of demography in this regard. We first use a standard overlapping generations model to derive the mechanisms by which demographic change can affect the labour share. It turns out that demographic change can affect the labour share either by altering the domestic capital intensity, by causing factor-biased technological change or in a small open economy framework by creating a gap between domestic savings and investments. The latter affects the country's investments abroad and in return its net foreign asset income which directly leads to changes in the labour share. Empirical estimations based on these insights, provide evidence that an increases in the expected retirement durations and old-age dependency ratios as well as declines in labour force growth rates have indeed been major forces behind the decline in labour shares that took place in many countries. These effects tend to be larger in open economies and pension reforms towards a funded pension system seem to have accelerated the effects.","[Schmidt, Torsten; Vosen, Simeon] RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany",,"Vosen, S (通讯作者)，RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",Simeon.Vosen@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,37,9,12,1,55,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

In other words, sustainability means that an organisation works continuously for as long as possible in the marketplace of the services provided. The basis to ensure the sustainability is to create and adopt strategies. Strategic management has become an essential part of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Although it is difficult for an NGO to create a long-term strategy when its donors support this NGO either for a specific purpose (and thus not for creating a strategy) or for a short term period (usually for one year which makes it really difficult to plan a strategy and certain steps when their financing is insecure). This scientific paper presents research results of the current state of sustainability of non-governmental organisations in the Slovak Republic. Using secondary data analysis of the NGO Sustainability index compiled annually by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), two questionnaires were created. One was dedicated to Slovak NGOs whereas the second one was sent to an expert group in Slovakia. Primary data obtained by the sociological questionnaire and by the Delphi method were analysed with relevant statistical methods. The results of the analysis allow us to formulate proposals to strengthen the sustainability of NGOs in Slovakia. The presentation of these results enables us to fulfil the scientific goal of the paper which is to evaluate the current state of the sustainability of non-governmental organisations in Slovakia and propose internal factor-based solutions to enhance their sustainability. In this article, we did not analyse the external and legislative factors, e.g. changes in tax assignation system due to the limited scope of the paper.","Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Svidronová, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",maria.svidronova@umb.sk,,"Murray Svidronova, Maria/0000-0002-4414-479X",,,,,15,22,22,0,28,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The empirical results indicate that, from the perspective of trade scale, the export and import in the eastern and national regions have an expansion effect on the urban-rural income gap, and, in the central regions, they have a reduction effect. Furthermore, export in the western regions has a reduction effect while import in these regions did not have a significant effect. From the perspective of trade structure, the trade of high-tech products and labour-intensive products in the national and eastern regions has an expansion effect, and the trade of the above-mentioned products in the central regions has a reduction effect. The trade of labour-intensive products in the western regions has a reduction effect, and that of high-tech products an expansion effect. From the perspective of trade mode, processing trade and general trade in the national and eastern regions have an expansion effect, while in the central regions they have a reduction effect. General trade in the western regions would expand the urban-rural income gap, and processing trade does not have a significant effect. Consequently, when the South African Government is working out trade multiplicative and corresponding policy, they should consider the development of foreign trade and should pay attention to the labour market structure.","[Wei, Hao; Li, Hongbing; Guo, Ye] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Wei, H (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,33,7,7,5,45,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Over the period December 2001 to April 2011, the empirical results of asymmetric threshold cointegration analysis suggest that there exist significant and complete pass-through between policy rate and loan rates. Positive and negative departures from the equilibrium converge to long run path almost at the same speed. Pace of convergence is about two to three months for all loan rates. Policy rate has significant short run impact on loan rates. Our analysis revealed that there is no significant relationship between policy rate and bank deposit rates due to sluggish adjustment of deposit rates. Lastly, the speed and behavior of interest rate pass-through between policy rate and loan rates did not change when we encounter the effect of 2008 financial crisis. Having a banking sector dominated financial system in Turkey, the results suggest that banks adjust loan rates faster than deposit rates. This indicates that Central Bank can affect the consumption behavior of people, in other words aggregate demand through loan rates.","[Yuksel, Ebru] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06810 Beytepe, Turkey; [Ozcan, Kivilcim Metin] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Dept Econ, Karatay Konya, Turkey",Hacettepe University; Necmettin Erbakan University,"Yüksel, E (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06810 Beytepe, Turkey.",eyuksel@hacettepe.edu.tr; kivilcim.metin@gmail.com,"Yüksel Haliloğlu, Ebru/AHH-2914-2022","Yuksel Haliloglu, Ebru/0000-0001-8267-0339; METIN OZCAN, KIVILCIM/0000-0002-9310-3492",,,,,34,10,10,0,20,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In determining the optimal quality, there is a trade-off between information rent and internalization of the vertical externality.

We find that the estimated effect of the number of police on recorded and victim-reported crime is similar for property crime but different for violent crime.

Exclusive employment contracts (i.e., covenant not to compete) are common in many industries, but the Courts often refrain from enforcing them, citing harm to workers due to restricted turnover. We analyze the interaction between these two channels of surplus extraction and argue that in the presence of collusion, enforcement of exclusive contracts can, in fact, benefit the workers: Although a strong enforcement of exclusivity restricts labor turnover, it can also hinder the firms' ability to sustain collusion in the labor market. We characterize the optimal level of enforcement and find that both perfect enforcement and no enforcement can be socially suboptimal. Moreover, a stronger enforcement can improve matching efficiency by rendering collusion unsustainable and may lead to a more equitable surplus distribution between the firms and the workers.

Nevertheless, and despite the major differences between political systems, scientific forecasting work has proved to be broadly possible, with noteworthy extensions to new countries. This article extends the literature further by developing a new forecasting model for local elections in Turkey. The basic motivation of this article is to test the usefulness of political forecasting in the contexts of alternative democratic settings. Turkey, in that sense, seems to be an interesting case for a number of reasons. First, the Turkish Republic has been a multi-party democracy since the mid-1940s. Although it has been interrupted by three military coups, the party and election system in Turkey has brought real alternations in the government starting from very early years of the multi-party system. So, it is plausible to argue that Turkish voters have the tradition of evaluating the performances of political parties, as in any other Western-type democracy. That is to say, the dynamics of evaluations of political parties in Turkey follow a similar pattern to other contemporary democracies, being driven by economic and political forces. The main contribution of this analysis is the introduction of an explicit model, which can forecast the impact of economic and political variables across local elections in Turkey by using reliable, public, and macro-level data. In particular, this study offers a new forecasting model which tries to forecast the Justice and Development Party's (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi, AKP) vote share in 81 cities.

By incorporating CBA results into an MCA framework this approach retains the strengths of each appraisal method and provides a procedure for decision makers to create an initial ranking of projects which is consistent between all candidate investments and has a clear link to policy goals. We further develop an approach for an incremental analysis that eliminates mutually exclusive projects and allows decision makers to develop a cost-effective investment programme in compliance with their strategic goals. Stakeholder confidence in the outcome of any infrastructure investment ranking exercise is important and can be enhanced by an understanding of the robustness of the ranking to variations in key inputs to the assessment exercise. Two complementary perspectives on sensitivity testing are outlined which between them facilitate an assessment of the robustness of the project ranking obtained. The applicability of the approach has been successfully demonstrated for the National Secondary Road Network in Ireland. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We initially study the effect of disclosure rules assuming that firms are not liable for the harm caused by their products. Mandatory disclosure is obviously superior to voluntary disclosure given the information about product risks that firms possess, since such information has value to consumers. But firms acquire more information about product risks under voluntary disclosure because they can keep silent if the information is unfavorable. This effect could lead to higher social welfare under voluntary disclosure. The same result holds if firms are liable for harm under the negligence standard of liability. Under strict liability, however, mandatory and voluntary disclosure rules are equivalent because information concerning product risks is irrelevant to consumers (JEL D18, 062, D82, H23, K13, L15).","[Polinsky, A.

Model selection over the period 1979-2003 generates pseudo out-of-sample forecasts, four quarters ahead, until 2007. The largest gain in forecast accuracy against naive benchmark models comes from incorporating equilibrium correction into the long-run. For more sophisticated models, aggregating the weighted forecasts of the sub-components outperforms the aggregate forecasts. The analysis also contributes to an improved understanding of sectoral inflationary pressures. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Among the cost categories supported by the trading actors are transaction costs to which rare empirical studies have been devoted. Therefore, based on the theoretical concept this article empirically analyzes the importance of the transaction costs generated by cashew nut trading in the north of Benin. The empirical data were collected in two villages. Using a paired-sample T test this study shows that the transaction costs are relatively important, but are not the major cost category. The average production cost is higher than the average transaction cost incurred by the trading actors. Although the transaction costs are on average lower than the other costs category, they are viewed by most actors (82 percent) as a serious constraint in the trading system due to moral hazard problems arising from the existence of these costs. By analyzing the specific factors that influence the magnitude of the transaction costs borne by the actors, the article shows that some socio-cultural and environmental characteristics of the actors are determinant of the level of transaction costs incurred.",,,,,,"Degla, Pamphile/0000-0003-1592-1606",,,,,33,5,7,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

C. B. Phillips (1998) demonstrated that deterministic trends are a valid representation of an otherwise stochastic trending mechanism; he remained skeptic, however, about the predictive power of such representations. In this paper we prove that forecasts built upon spurious regression may perform (asymptotically) as well as those issued from a correctly specified regression. We derive the order in probability of several in-sample and out-of-sample predictability criteria (F test, root mean square error, Theil's U-statistics and R2) using forecasts based upon a least squares-estimated regression between independent variables generated by a variety of empirically relevant data-generating processes. It is demonstrated that, when the variables are mean stationary or trend stationary, the order in probability of these criteria is the same whether the regression is spurious or not.

As an answer to this problem the paper proposes a Multi-Objective Decision Support System for Project Selection. Project Selection is subject to an evolution concerning the objectives to strive after. If before the stress was put on market analysis, Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return and other micro-economic targets, macro-economic objectives receive more and more attention such as employment, value added and the influence on the balance of payments. Employment is a human right, sometimes even written down in national constitutions. Traditional Cost-Benefit does not respond to these purposes. Indeed in Cost-Benefit all benefits (objectives) have to be translated into money terms, leading sometimes to immoral consequences. On the contrary Multi-Objective Optimization takes care of different objectives, whereas the objectives keep their own units. However different methods exist for the application of Multi-Objective Optimization. These methods were tested after their performance. MOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio analysis) and MULTIMOORA (MOORA plus a Full Multiplicative Form), showed positive results; the more if they were assisted by Ameliorated Nominal Group and Delphi Techniques. A simulation exercise for Tunisia illustrates the use of these methods. The needs of the Tunisian textile industry are analyzed and as an answer three projects facing multiple objectives are simulated.","[Brauers, Willem Karel M.; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Internet & Intellectual Technol Inst, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Brauers, WKM (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Internet & Intellectual Technol Inst, Vilnius, Lithuania.",willem.brauers@ua.ac.be; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Brauers, Willem/AAS-5072-2021","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X;",,,,,42,16,17,1,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We show that society can be equivalently viewed as a sequence of hyperbolic discounting agents. Under uncertainty about future pay-offs we determine, as solution to an intergenerational non-cooperative dynamic game, the optimal timing of irreversible conversion. We show that under both naive and sophisticated beliefs about future time-inconsistency, the option value attached to the conversion decision is eroded and earlier conversion occurs.

It begins by examining various existing accounts of crisis which disagree about the causes, but share the belief that the crisis represents a problem of socio-technical malfunction which requires some kind of technocratic fix: the three variants on this explanation are the crisis as accident, conspiracy or calculative failure. This paper proposes an alternative explanation which frames the crisis differently as an elite political debacle. Political and technocratic elites were hubristically detached from the process of financial innovation as it took the form of 'bricolage', which put finance beyond technical control or management. The paper raises fundamental questions about the politicized role of technocrats after the 1980s and emphasizes the need to bring private finance and its public regulators under democratic political control whose technical precondition is a dramatic simplification of finance.","[Engelen, Ewald] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Erturk, Ismail; Froud, Julie] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Erturk, Ismail; Froud, Julie; Williams, Karel] Univ Manchester, Ctr Res Sociocultural Change CRESC, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Leaver, Adam] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Management, London, England; [Leaver, Adam] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Moran, Michael] Univ Manchester, Dept Polit, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Amsterdam; University of Manchester; University of Manchester; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Engelen, E (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",adam.leaver@mbs.ac.uk,"Erturk, Ismail/W-4693-2019","Leaver, Adam/0000-0001-6199-6057",,,,,69,66,71,1,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

In this paper we investigate whether additional predictive power can be gained by adding selected financial variables belonging to either the USA or the euro area. We use vector autoregressions (VARs) that include the US and euro area GDPs as well as growth in the Rest of the World and selected combinations of financial variables. Out-of-sample root mean square forecast errors (RMSEs) evidence that adding financial variables produces a slightly smaller error in forecasting US economic activity. This weak macro-financial linkage is even weaker in the euro area, where financial indicators do not improve short- and medium-term GDP forecasts even when their timely availability relative to GDP is exploited. It can be conjectured that neither US nor European financial variables help predict euro area GDP as the US GDP has already embodied this information. However, we show that the finding that financial variables have no predictive power for future activity in the euro area relates to the unconditional nature of the RMSE metric. When forecasting ability is assessed as if in real time (i.e. conditionally on the information available at the time when forecasts are made), we find that models using financial variables would have been preferred in several episodes and in particular between 1999 and 2002.

However, there is an increasing awareness that this intellectual tradition tends to overemphasize the role of geographic proximity in the transfer of knowledge between firms and to under-theorize the contribution of nonlocal knowledge flows. With a sample of 143 manufacturing firms from Singapore, this research attempts to answer three interrelated questions: (1) Does local networking effort provide firms with added value above and beyond what is available to them by just being there? (2) Does local collaboration contribute more to innovation performance than nonlocal collaboration? (3) What is the joint impact of local and nonlocal collaborations on innovation performance? We find that while local and nonlocal collaborations are statistically indistinguishable from each other in terms of their relative importance, they represent complementary spurs to innovation.

The Seoul Metropolitan Integrated Urban Model (SMIUM) combines the Seoul metropolitan input-output model with random utility-based location choice models and endogenous real estate markets. The major findings of this study can be highlighted as follows. First, Seoul's BRT contributes to increased development density in urban centers, acting as a centripetal force to attract firms from the suburbs into urban cores and supporting arguments for Smart Growth proponents. Second, unlike its redistributive effects on nonresidential activities, the BRT has a limited effect on the redistribution of residential activities, implying that residential locations are less sensitive to accessibility improvements made by the BRT than are nonresidential locations. Third, reflecting the transferred space demands from the suburbs to the urban cores, the CBD reaps the highest property value gains, while all of the outer ring zones suffer from reduced property values.

It concerns both, financial institutions and their regulator/supervisor bodies. A crucial input factor, when the admissible or even optimal portfolio is detected, is the measure of dependency. Although there exists a wide range of dependency measures, a standard assumption is that the (joint) distribution of large portfolios is multivariate normal and that the dependency can be described well by a linear measure of correlation the - Pearson coefficient of correlation is therefore usually utilized. A very challenging question in this context is whether there is some impact of alternative dependency/concordance measures on the efficiency of optimal portfolios. Therefore, the alternative ways of portfolio comparisons were developed, among them a stochastic dominance approach is one of the most popular one. In particular, the definition of second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) relation uses comparisons of either twice cumulative distribution functions or expected utilities. Alternatively, one can define SSD relation using cumulative quantile functions or conditional value at risk. The task of this paper is therefore to examine and analyze the SSD efficiency of min-var portfolios that are selected on the basis of alternative concordance matrices set up on the basis of either Spearman rho or Kendall tau. In order to carry out the analysis the real data of FX rate returns over 2007 and 2008 are used. It is documented that although all portfolios considered were SSD inefficient especially a portfolio based on Kendall measure is very poor (at least in terms of SSD efficiency). Moreover, the inefficiency during the crisis year 2008 was much lower than during one year earlier.","[Tichy, Tomas] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,kopa@karlin.mff.cuni.cz; tomas.tichy@vsb.cz,"Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020; Kopa, Miloš/H-4481-2014","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330; Kopa, Miloš/0000-0002-9438-4484",,,,,25,3,3,0,7,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We have identified environmental factors that affect the creative R&D performance of the Korean GRIs and analysed how these environmental factors are affected by the Korean government's newly adopted project-based system (PBS), which has intensified competition and expanded project scale. For an empirical analysis, a survey was conducted with researchers at GRIs holding doctoral degrees, inquiring about institutional environmental factors, factors affecting the creative research environment and their creative performance. According to the analysis, the creative performance of Korean GRIs is influenced by factors such as the managerial ability of research team leaders, autonomy in project undertakings, horizontal organization, diversity, and flexibility. However, these creative environmental factors are also affected by changes in institutional environment through a new system introduced by government. In an institutional environment where competition is intensified by the introduction of a new system, managerial ability of research team leaders, autonomy in undertaking projects and flexibility are significant factors affecting creative performance compared to an institutional environment at a lower level of competition. Under an environment where the scale of R&D projects has been expanded through the introduction of a new system, autonomy, horizontal organization and diversity are considered significant factors affecting performance. The results of the analysis imply that institutional changes led by the government not only affect factors relating to creative research environments at GRIs but also impose significant and varying influence over the outcome of creative research.","[Lee, Min-Hyung; Ahn, Doo-Hyun] Specialty Construct Ctr 26F, Sci & Technol Policy Inst, Seoul, South Korea","Science & Technology Policy Institute (STEPI), Republic of Korea","Lee, MH (通讯作者)，Specialty Construct Ctr 26F, Sci & Technol Policy Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",mhlee@stepi.re.kr,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

What's more this article analyses the legal feasibility of the viatical settlements mainly from the law of the insurable interest law and the policy transference, the analysis shows that there is no conflict between the viatical settlements transactions and our existing the Insurance Law.","[Liu Xihua; Cui Song] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Lin Qiaozhen] Postal Savings Bank China, Zhejiang Branch, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Qingdao University,"Liu, XH (通讯作者)，Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,8,0,1,0,0,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89414-036-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,284,293,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316628500023,0

In many countries, and Romania is no exception, anti-crisis public measures focus on higher public investment or investment in public objectives, like investment in infrastructure projects as an important mean to maintain economic activity during the crisis and support a rapid return to sustained economic growth.

Sustainable development is defined as the development of community providing opportunity to gain comprehensive well-being at present as well as for the future generations by integrating environmental, economic and social issues, yet not exceeding the acceptable impact on the environment. A chaotic growth of cities jeopardises the environmental stability. At present, the process of real estate development is based on the principle of sustainability. The principles of sustainability have been applied to the designing, evaluation, construction, operation and demolition of buildings. Sustainable real estate development is bound up with construction of recreational buildings.

We build theoretical framework on each of these categories by presenting contributions of various scholars and ultimately focus on two elementary attributes of organizational environment: simple-complex and stable-dynamic dimensions. After some in-depth investigation of the already obtained results on these dimensions, we propose the concept in which the simple-complex dimension consists of intensity, frequency and speed of changes within the environment and stable-dynamic dimension, which contains the parameters of a number of elements, their interdependence and complexity.

Seeking to shape effective policies to combat with gender inequality and to measure achieved progress in this area; the indices of gender inequality play important role. There are many indicators of inequality representing different aspects on gender inequality ranging from social-economic to institutional and cultural issues. The main measures of gender inequalities can be found in the following areas: education; poverty; health; labor market; access to resources; education; globalization; governance; conflict and emergencies; human rights etc. However it is necessary to have one indicator which allows assessing gender inequality in all aspects to compare countries in terms of level of gender inequality. It is important to have good statistics disaggregated by gender. Such statistics helps to evaluate the status quo, inform policies, and stimulate and measure change by raising awareness amongst policy-makers and providing a foundation for development of new policies in this area. There are some limitations of certain statistics and the validity of certain indicators for gender inequality measurements. In addition the validity of certain indicators are questionable. There is a need for new indicator, covering all issues of gender inequalities. Integrated indicator of gender inequality is proposed in the paper.

In the 1990s, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems became the state of the art tool to replace self-made legacy systems. With the trigger Year 2000 and Euro currency a lot of the systems reached the final stage of further maintenance and had to be replaced. While the market of ERP implementations at big global companies reached almost saturation, the small and medium size companies (SME) are at the beginning. The decision for an IT-ERP package and its implementation is an extensive, lengthy and costly process which often runs into problems or cost overruns [1]. The acquisition process is one of the key challenges at the beginning of a longer journey. This paper aims to present a discussion of the key influencing characteristics that affect the decision making process for ERP software at a SME. Design /methodology /approach. The research is based on a literature review comparing the various decision processes and the validation of key characteristics. There is not the one set of characteristics available to use for ERP acquisition, so a literature comparison was executed. This set has been tested in a case study project, setting priorities and the correlations within the structured execution process. Findings. The identified set of characteristics has been challenged in a case study executing a structured acquisition process. The hypothesis, that the triggers in relation to the prioritisation of the characteristics are strongly dependent on a structured selection process was confirmed during the study. The success of the decision will be measurable after implementation of the system. Currently, according to business material and literature the selection process is mainly vendor driven not based on acquisition requirements and values. Originality/value.

Previous research is generally unable to disentangle these effects because of reliance on cross-sectional data. Using longitudinal data, this paper finds that employees who will be self-employed in the future overestimate their short-term financial wellbeing by more than those who never become self-employed. Optimism is higher still when self-employed. These results suggest that the greater optimism of the self-employed reflects both psychological disposition and environmental factors.

Which institutional frameworks are implicated? What have been the results obtained both for public finances and for travelers? What are the key elements for explaining recorded performance gains? What lessons could be drawn for railway reform? In summary, it appears that improved performance has been possible in Switzerland even in the absence of competition. These improvements are due to the nature of public governance and its impact on the various stakeholders. Public authorities have imposed ambitious but negotiated targets on operators, coupled with severe financial constraints, in a context of decentralization of public procurement. Given this new institutional framework, railway companies and especially the former state-owned railway, the national incumbent SBB have achieved significant productivity increases through management and technical innovation. Client satisfaction, at the heart of the reform, also contributes to these successes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First, in France, if the aim of reform announced by the Minister is to re-build the SNCF's monopoly, our fear is that, instead of stimulating French railways, this will cause a downward slide in the sector by threatening its production and costs. In this context, the key aspect of the reform required by the fourth railway package is to create a real separation between the rail operator and the infrastructure manager. Second, our comparative analysis of the performance of the French and German railway systems shows the financial indicators in the two countries to be almost identical, except that Germany has higher productivity indicators than France. This result shows that France, instead of focusing on reducing transaction costs - which only represent 2% of the total costs, should give priority to productivity gains. It is imperative to implement a programme in France that aims to revive productivity in the railway sector, for example by reducing the workforce. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that efficiency of local bus lines is slightly better than operational effectiveness without indicating a clear positive or negative relationship between the two performance components. Traffic conditions and population density seem to be important exogenous factors influencing performance. We employed bootstrapping techniques to check robustness of DEA results and we explain that performance assessment is more reliable when correcting for bias. We found that production models we developed for evaluating performance do not always exhibit the same technology of returns to scale, indicating that comparison across ratings pertaining to different performance dimensions should be made with caution. DEA results enabled us to perform clustering of bus lines based on the derived piecewise production functions. We defined the variables of these functions so as to allow performance improvement monitoring over service design changes in any given bus public transport network. It is found that for most of the bus lines in Thessaloniki, scheduling of buses with fewer seats would be a more successful performance improvement measure than reducing their span of service.

Experts will tend to overstate their positions to a like-minded decision maker (DM) and this constitutes a Pareto improvement over sending a sincere message. When the message space is bounded, overstatement may interfere with the DM's ability to aggregate the experts' information, because communication is less precise when the same message is sent for many states of the world. Despite this, I show that experts are willing to send either the most extreme message to the DM, or a partially overstated message, because by doing so the expert can decrease the likelihood the DM makes a suboptimal decision due to his subjective interpretation of the advice. Because the expert inflates his message toward the policy he believes the DM would be better off choosing, rather than sincerely revealing his information, I refer to this behavior as a paternalistic bias.","Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Lightle, JP (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",jlightle@fsu.edu,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Earlier Thredbo workshops focused mostly on setting and measuring performance standards and incentivizing performance. This year's workshop also looked more widely. The first additional topic was the context in which the performance regime is operating: how well is the market developed and what consequences does that have for the regime? The second was the maturity of the regime. Which conditions have to be fulfilled to have a fully-fledged and mature performance regime? These questions were addressed based on papers (and workshop participants) discussing performance in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Greece, France, Ireland, Sweden, The Netherlands, Chile and Latin America more widely, and The United States. Key findings are that a wider set of conditions has to be in place to make a performance regime work. Appropriate technology is needed to capture good quality data. Mature institutions that is, with the necessary legal powers to enforce contracts, guard against capture by the operators, and with appropriate staffing and resources are also crucial. Maturity differs widely in the countries covered in the workshop, and thus different solutions are needed in different contexts. In particular, in situations of low maturity, regimes that place greater emphasis on passenger/demand metrics are likely to be more appropriate. The distinction between enforcing and incentivizing is also important in developing an appropriate performance regime. A suggested analytical framework for an effective performance regime which takes account of the above factors is set out, together with areas for future research. Obtaining greater information on the marginal costs and benefits of improving performance and also how better to benchmark complex and diverse operations against each other are key areas for future research. Other key research needs identified include: how to strike the right balance between enforcement versus seeking improvement; operationalizing KPIs (e.g. targeting frequency versus punctuality); and understanding real as opposed to assumed behavior by authorities and public and private operators.

In the case of an emergency situation, target is to satisfy local/national authorities to minimize risk and travel time simultaneously, when road network has been partly affected by natural disasters. A real road network consisting 89 nodes and 103 two-way edges in addition to pre-specified affected area has been utilized for validation through due analytical process. Results revealed that the main factor should be used further to choose the right origin to support the affected nodes, vastly depend on the edges, connecting to the other parts of the network. Sensitivity analysis also shows that although chaotic variables of damage severities would depend on the initial conditions, but using an iterative procedure can help decision makers to select a most probable path when they do not have access to clear information on how much severity may be allocated to the affected links.

We observe the earnings of children born in 1960 and 1970 along with their biological fathers and mothers. The earnings mobility between sons and daughters relative to the earnings of their mothers and fathers is estimated. Our results suggest that divorce is associated with increased mobility, except between mothers' and daughters' earnings. Transition matrices reveal that the direction of the mobility is negative; children of divorced parents tend to move downward in the earnings distribution compared to children from intact families. Finally, we utilize information on the earnings mobility of siblings in dissolved families who grew up when the family was intact. The difference between pre- and post-divorce siblings is in turn compared with sibling differences in intact families.","[Bratberg, Espen; Rieck, Karsten Marshall Elseth; Vaage, Kjell] Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Bratberg, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, Bergen, Norway.",espen.bratberg@econ.uib.no; karsten.rieck@econ.uib.no; kjell.vaage@econ.uib.no,,,,,,,32,8,8,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Estimating the effects that various outside factors have on both the flagging out decision and the PSC inspection rate can help with determining appropriate policies for improving maritime safety. However, studying the impact of one on the other without taking into account their endogenous effect could result in biased estimations. This paper integrates a binary logit model for flagging out decisions, and a linear model for explaining the PSC inspection rate, in a Three-stage Least Square framework, by combining actual ship registration data from the Lloyd's ship register with the corresponding PSC inspection records from Paris MOU, Tokyo MOU, and India MOU. The empirical results show that PSC inspections actually increase the possibility of flag-out, not only because of the high inspection rate, but also through the variables used in setting the inspection priority, such as ship age. Estimation biases are also identified if endogeneity is neglected, such as the contribution of ship type, ship size, and PSC inspection rate to the flag-out behavior, as well as the importance of flying a foreign flag on the PSC inspection priority.

Several model specifications are used to understand and explain non-motorized travel behavior in terms of household, person and built-environment (BE) variables. Marginal effects of covariates for models of vehicle ownership levels, intrazonal trip-making, destination and mode choices, non-motorized trip counts per household, and miles traveled (both motorized and non-motorized) are presented. Mode and destination choice models were estimated separately for interzonal and intrazonal trips and for each of three different trip purposes, to recognize the distinct behaviors at play when making shorter versus longer trips and serving different activities. The results underscore the importance of street connectivity (quantified as the number of 3-way and 4-way intersections in a half-mile radius), higher bus-stop density, and greater non-motorized access in promoting lower vehicle ownership levels (after controlling for household size, income, neighborhood density and so forth), higher rates of non-motorized trip generation (per day), and higher likelihoods of non-motorized mode choices. Intrazonal trip likelihoods rose with street connectivity, transit availability, and land use mixing. Across all BE variables tested, street structure offered the greatest potential behavioral impacts, alongside accessibility indices (for both motorized and non-motorized access). For example, non-motorized trip counts are estimated to rise 26% following a one standard deviation increase in this variable, and walk probabilities by 27% following a one standard deviation increase in this index at the destination zone. Regional and local accessibility and density (of population plus jobs) variables were also important predictors, depending on the response being modeled. Simulated model applications illuminate when and to what extent significant travel behavior changes may be witnessed, as land use settings and other variables are changed, to reflect existing neighborhoods.

The paper's main claim is that the IWCNM bypasses the theoretical core of the global city paradigm, for which reason an evidential crisis continues to undermine the strength of the global city argument.

J,"Evans, A; Schäfer, AW",,,,"Evans, Antony; Schaefer, Andreas W.",,,Simulating airline operational responses to airport capacity constraints,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Network optimization; Airline operations; Game theory; Airport capacity; Flight delays; Simulation,,"Between 1960 and 2011, worldwide scheduled passenger air travel grew by more than 7% per year. Most projections suggest that the demand for air travel will continue to increase strongly, by around 5% per year over the coming decades. This strong anticipated growth, however, does not account for any air transport infrastructure constraints. Airport and airspace capacity may not be expanded at a rate sufficiently high to enable the projected demand growth, which may lead to lower than anticipated growth in aviation. This paper describes and applies a recently developed model that predicts airline operational responses to airport capacity constraints. It does this by simulating a Nash best-response game between competing airlines, in which each airline maximizes its profit by adjusting flight frequencies and passenger routing, attempting to gain market share by increasing flight frequencies, but at the cost of the added flights. The model is validated for a network of airports in the United States in 2005 and applied to simulate airline operational changes through 2030 under two capacity-constrained scenarios: frozen 2005 capacity levels on (i) a system-wide scale, and (ii) only at Chicago O'Hare International, a primary hub airport. Simulated passenger demand, air traffic, flight delays, system CO2 emissions and Chicago O'Hare NOx emissions are compared to a case in which airport capacity is expanded according to existing airport expansion plans. The simulation results indicate that the air transport system would adjust operations within a constrained network in such way as to avoid airports with high delays. While most system-wide implications for operations and environmental impact seem to be manageable, local impacts at congested hub-airports may be significant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our focus on predictive densities acknowledges the possibility that, although some predictors can cause point forecasts to either improve or deteriorate, they might have the opposite effect on higher moments. We find that normality is rejected for most models in some dimension according to at least one of the tests we use. Interestingly, however, combinations of predictive densities appear to be approximated correctly by a normal density: the simple, equal average when predicting output growth, and the Bayesian model average when predicting inflation.

Two technologies with random marginal costs are available to produce a homogeneous good. If the risks that are associated with the technologies are correlated, then the firms might invest in a technology with a negative expected return or, conversely, might not invest in a technology with a positive expected return. If the technology with the lower expected cost is riskier than the other technology, then this low-cost technology will be eliminated from the firm's portfolio if the risks are highly correlated. With imperfect competition, the portfolios of firms are different, and the difference in risk tolerance can explain the full specialization of the industry: The less risk-averse firms use the low-cost technology, and the more risk-averse firms use the less risky, higher-cost technology.","[Meunier, Guy] INRA, ALISS UR1303, F-94205 Ivry, France; [Meunier, Guy] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Meunier, G (通讯作者)，INRA, ALISS UR1303, 65 Blvd Brandebourg, F-94205 Ivry, France.",guy.meunier@ivry.inra.fr,"Meunier, Guy/E-8948-2018","Meunier, Guy/0000-0002-9052-921X",,,,,32,5,5,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Promoting environmentally sustainable transport is defined as follows: (1) Reducing the volume of motorised travel; (2) Transferring travel to modes generating less external effects, and (3) Modifying road user behaviour in a way that will reduce external effects of transport. External effects include accidents, congestion, traffic noise and emissions to air. Four economic policy instruments are compared: (1) Prices of motor fuel; (2) Congestion charges; (3) Toll schemes; (4) Reward systems giving incentives to reduce driving or change driver behaviour. The effects of these policy instruments are stated in terms of elasticities. All four economic policy instruments have negative elasticities, which means that they do promote environmentally sustainable transport. Long-term elasticities tend to be larger than short term elasticities. The long-term elasticities of reward systems are unknown. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As aviation policy makers and regulators strategically plan for their future, they need to consider the systematic and synergistic effects of common factors which comprise the operating environment of the industry's organisations. Thus, during the process of aviation systems planning governments should perceive the generic conditions which exist in the economy as a whole as equally important to air transport exclusive conditions. This paper highlights the significant impact of the national macro-environment factors on a country's air transport sector and it suggests including these elements within the context of civil aviation strategic planning. Country level data is collected on seventeen input variables versus four output variables on a sample of 52 countries. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is used to identify the descriptors with significant impact on air transport output, namely: passenger traffic, aviation total contribution to GDP, aviation total contribution to employment and air connectivity levels. The identified significant drivers are found to create an enabling environment that determines the capacity of an economy and society to benefit from the air transport system's productivity. The results call upon aviation policy makers and regulators to assess the national macro-environment forces during the situation analysis part of the strategic planning process. The identified operating environment conditions act as a framework for providing clear policy orientations and for facilitating the identification of areas where policy intervention could improve air transport sector's performance. A well-defined aviation strategy allows aviation policy makers to identify and address nation wide strategic issues and provides aviation industry's stake holders with guidelines to help maintain and enhance their competitive position in both domestic and global markets.

Whereas interventions during childhood are considered crucial to increase the skills of disadvantaged individuals, in this paper, we try to understand whether interventions which take place later in life can also be effective. With this aim, we evaluate the effects on student achievement of a number of remedial courses provided by an Italian university. We use a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to identify the causal effect of remedial courses relying on the fact that students were assigned to the treatment if their performance in a placement test was below a certain cutoff point. We deal with partial compliance by using the assignment rule as an instrumental variable for the effective attendance to remedial courses. From our analysis, it emerges that students attending the remedial courses whose results were just below the cutoff point acquire a higher number of credits than students whose results were just above the cutoff.

Some observers fear that states use authorization to adopt more lax policies in a regulatory race to the bottom. This paper presents a simple model of the interaction between the federal and state governments in such a scheme of partial decentralization. Our model suggests that the authorization option may not only increase social welfare but also allow more stringent environmental regulations than would otherwise be feasible. Our model also suggests that the federal government may choose its policies so that states that desire more strict regulation authorize, while other states remain under the federal program. We then test this hypothesis using data on federal regulation of water pollution and of hazardous waste, which are two of the most important environmental programs to allow authorization. We find that states that prefer more environmental protection authorize more quickly under both policies. This evidence suggests that states seek authorization to adopt more strict policies instead of more lax policies compared to federal policies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Guerra, E",,,,"Guerra, Erick",,,Mexico City's suburban land use and transit connection: The effects of the Line B Metro expansion,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transit investments; Mexico City; Land use and transportation; Suburbs; Metro; Developing-world transit,BUILT ENVIRONMENT; SELF-SELECTION; TRAVEL-DEMAND; MODE CHOICE; RIDERSHIP; IMPACTS; RAIL; TRANSPORTATION; POLITICS; DENSITY,"Over the past half century, government agencies in Mexico City have invested heavily in high-capacity public transit, particularly the 225-km Metro system. Nearly all of this investment has been in central locations of the metropolis. Only recently has service coverage been extended into the periphery, which has accounted for the majority of postwar metropolitan population growth. The Metro's Line B, which opened in phases in 1999 and 2000, significantly expanded Metro coverage into the densely populated and fast-growing suburban municipality of Ecatepec. Comparing travel behavior and land use measures at six geographic scales, including the investment's immediate catchment area, across two time periods six years before and seven years after the investment opened this paper investigates the effects of one of the first and only suburban high-capacity transit investments in Mexico City. While the investment sparked a significant increase in local Metro use, most of this increase came from people relying on informal transit, rather than cars. This shift reduced average transit expenditures and travel times for local residents. However, it also increased government subsidies for the Metro and had no apparent effect on road speeds. In terms of land use, the investment increased density around the stations but appears to have had little to no effect on downtown commercial development, where it might have been expected to have a significant influence. In short, the effects of Line B demonstrate much of the promise and problem with expanding high capacity transit service into the suburbs. Ridership is likely to be high, but so too will be the costs and subsidies, while the effects on car ownership and urban form are likely to be modest. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Distinguishing three notions of identity - self-perception, perceived identity and social affiliation - I claim that the relevant constraints implied by this argument are minimal. Some of Sen's arguments about perceived identity and social context do not establish any further constraints. Sen also argues that a model of multiculturalism and some forms of education can restrict, or fail to promote, reasoned and informed identity choice. This argument is better understood in the light of Sen's work on capability and justice, notably his concern with ways in which underdogs can adapt and his emphasis on public reasoning. It highlights limitations on information and opportunities for reasoning. I suggest that these lead to genuine constraints on (reasoned and informed) identity choice. The paper focuses on Sen's work, though its claims are also relevant to George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton's analysis of identity.","Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Qizilbash, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",mozaffar.qizilbash@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,62,4,5,1,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

We investigate the proposed relationships between comprehensive HR systems, WLC and IWB using variance-based structural equation modelling. We found that HR systems that are perceived as comprehensive significantly enhance IWB and decrease feelings of WLC. Contrary to our expectation, we found a significant yet positive effect of WLC on IWB. Employees may respond to WLC constructively by being innovative, improving their environment and making the work-life interface manageable. By promoting IWB, HR systems might also help employees to deal with residual-and, perhaps, unavoidable-levels of WLC.","[Abstein, Adriana; Heidenreich, Sven; Spieth, Patrick] EBS Business Sch, Dept Innovat Management & Entrepreneurship, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany; [Spieth, Patrick] Univ Kassel, Fac Business Studies, Dept Innovat & Technol Management, D-34109 Kassel, Germany",European Business School (EBS) University; Universitat Kassel,"Heidenreich, S (通讯作者)，EBS Business Sch, Dept Innovat Management & Entrepreneurship, Rheingaustr 1, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany.",sven.heidenreich@ebs.edu,"Spieth, Patrick/AAI-9232-2020","Spieth, Patrick/0000-0002-4408-1768",,,,,114,28,34,5,67,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Empirical analysis finds that, other things equal, the fares for airport-pairs where Delta and Northwest competed with each other prior to the merger did not increase by much following the merger. This result is consistent with the additional finding that the impact of changes in low-cost carrier competition is large while the effect of changes in competition from legacy carriers is slight. Since both Delta and Northwest Airlines are legacy carriers, the results for other legacies suggest that the merger should not have exerted a dramatic impact on fares.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Luo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",dluo1@uci.edu,,,,,,,20,29,48,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

In the coming program period from 2014 to 2020 it is expected to be a major pillar of EU structural funds. The notion of smart specialisation incorporates some basic principles of evolutionary economics and centers on the idea of an entrepreneurial discovery process of new trajectories on the regional level. It does not, however, sufficiently take into account the relevance of individual agents, their actions, and their relations with each other in the identification, creation, development, and destruction of technological and economic trajectories. For this, a focus on micro-level dynamics is needed that provides the base for experimentation. Therefore, this paper proposes the new concept of smart experimentation. This notion aims to complement smart specialisation. It is anchored not only in evolutionary economics, but also in relational economic geography.","Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Benner, M (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, Berliner Str 48, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",benner@uni-heidelberg.de,"Benner, Maximilian/HNP-0981-2023","Benner, Maximilian/0000-0003-1386-808X",,,,,28,28,29,2,42,BUCHENVERLAG,BAD SODEN,"POSTFACH 1128, BAD SODEN, 65796, GERMANY",0044-3751,,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Nowadays, more and more groups and research centres, universities, associations, funding agencies, publishing houses are developing their institutional open access policies. Scientific research funders are beginning to mandate, in an increasingly active manner, open access to the research they fund. Institutional policies are currently developed for three types of organisations: scientific research institutions (universities, laboratories, departments); scientific research funding agencies; publishers of scientific journals. For each type of organisation, open access policy registries are created. The analysis of the three types of institutional open access policies is hereby presented. The academic community has two important roles in ensuring public access to research results. The first consists of working together with politicians and decision makers at all levels, with a view to encouraging sustainable open access mandates and policies. This means raising awareness of decision makers not only at the level of their own institution, but also of funding agencies, as well as at national and international political level. The second role consists of continuously creating resources with open access to information.

By considering the case of Milan, where a charge to enter the city centre was introduced in 2008, and by relying on an unexpected and temporary suspension of the tax, we analyse the effect of the policy on flows of vehicles classified by type of engine. We have found that a road pricing scheme shifted users from Euro 0-3 vehicles (i.e., those vehicles particularly polluting according to the European Emission Standards classification and produced before 2000-2001) to liquefied petroleum gas, bi-fuel and hybrid vehicles. However, the environmental benefits of the policy were limited by a substantial increase in the usage of motorbikes. This evidence calls for a consideration of the behavioural reactions of road users when making ex ante evaluations of the social profitability of road pricing schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Personal features of decision makers ( their abilities and limitations) as well as motives and intentions do play role in the decision-making process. In line with behavioral approach to the problem, the personal factor in the decision-making process often governs selection of a business location.

Contribution of our study to foreign direct investment and firm performance the matters is using quarterly frequency data to examine relationship between foreign ownership and quarterly economic growth in selected NACE business sectors. Hanousek et al. [9] argue that Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) have some several impacts at the Czech microeconomic level. We argue then, it could be interesting to compare domestic and foreign ownership with weighted GDP growth rate in the Czech Republic. If foreign equity in the country and rentability of foreign owned companies affect GDP more than rentability of domestic companies, foreign ownership is more efficient for the Czech economy. From our point of view, microeconomic data in pooled sample could influence macroeconomy of the country. It motivates recent study We are estimating panel regression models with cross section weights. Our endogenous variable is weighted GDP growth rate in pooled data of all our selected business industries. Our exogenous variables are average equity growth rate and growth rate of return on equity (ROE), both in pooled sample of selected Czech industries. This study proved positive impacts of foreign ownership on GDP in the Czech Republic. Foreign-owned companies have a positive impact on GDP growth rate through both increase in equity and increase of ROE of Czech firms. In the case of domestic-owned firms the positive impact of ROE change was not demonstrated.","[Roubickova, Michaele; Heryan, Tomas] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Roubícková, M (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic.",roubickova@opf.slu.cz; heryan@opf.slu.cz,"Heryan, Tomas/J-6424-2015","Heryan, Tomas/0000-0003-2027-7149",,,,,24,4,4,1,11,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The integral portfolio of debtor assets and debt service liabilities, based on the borrowed funds, is chosen as a solution for the above-described problem. In the paper, an asset is understood as a position of government expenditures, where funds borrowed by the government are used and create a quantifiable profit (value) or the measurable damage or loss is avoided if funds are borrowed. Actually, liabilities are the main debt service positions. Naturally, the value generated by assets, as well as funds spent to settle the liabilities, could be analytically adequately evaluated only in stochastic dimension. Consequently, multidimensional multicriteria stochastic optimization technique is used as a technical solution to the formulated problem. In analytical decisions, the budget funds borrowed by the government are treated as marginal funds. Taking into account a completely new decision technique that has been invoked for government debt management, the methods of decisions are described quite particularly.","[Rutkauskas, Aleksandras Vytautas; Stasytyte, Viktorija; Maknickiene, Nijole] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Rutkauskas, AV (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",ar@vgtu.lt; viktorija.stasytyte@vgtu.lt; nijole.maknickiene@vgtu.lt,"Maknickienė, Nijolė/AAQ-9121-2021","Maknickienė, Nijolė/0000-0003-2785-5183; Stasytyte, Viktorija/0000-0003-3451-9233",,,,,31,4,4,0,27,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The authors validated their method by comparing movie types vs. movie genres in terms of their box-office revenue explanatory power. All three types of box-office revenues (opening week revenue, total revenue, revenue-perscreen) differed significantly across movie types, whereas only the opening week revenue showed a significant difference across movie genres, suggesting that movie types may be a better predictor of a movie's box-office performance than movie genres that have been frequently used in prior research on box-office performance prediction.","[Shon, Ji-Hyun; Kim, Young-Gul] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, KAIST Business Sch, Seoul 130722, South Korea; [Yim, Sang-Jin] CJ E&M Pictures CJ Entertainment, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Shon, JH (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, KAIST Business Sch, 85 Hoegiro, Seoul 130722, South Korea.",jinashon@gmail.com,"Kim, Young gul/C-2033-2011",,,,,,57,10,11,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

The first scheme weights the forecasts according to the values of reversed ordered CUSUM (ROC) test statistics, while the second weighting method simply assigns heavier weights to forecasts that use more recent information. Simulation results show that, when structural breaks are present, forecasts based on the first weighting scheme outperform those based on a procedure that simply uses ROC tests to choose and forecast from a single post-break estimation window. Combination forecasts based on our second weighting scheme outperform equally weighted combination forecasts. An empirical application based on a NAIRU Phillips curve model for the G7 countries illustrates these findings, and also shows that combination forecasts can outperform the random walk forecasting model.

When applying these techniques, practitioners usually select a single model using either information-based criteria or pretesting. In this paper, we consider the alternative strategy of combining models rather than selecting a single model. Our strategy of weight choice for the candidate models is based on the minimization of a plug-in estimator of the asymptotic squared error risk of the model average estimator. Theoretical justifications of this model averaging strategy are provided, and a Monte Carlo study shows that the forecasts produced by the proposed strategy are often more accurate than those produced by other common model selection and model averaging strategies, especially when the regressors are only mildly to moderately correlated and the true model contains few zero coefficients. An empirical example based on credit rating data is used to illustrate the proposed method. To reduce the computational burden, we also consider a model screening step that eliminates some of the very poor models before averaging. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters.

The method incorporates a carbon sequestration benefit function into the land expected value model in order to quantify the social benefit arising from carbon sequestration by the planted trees. This is used to calculate the optimal rotation age for newly planted forests that maximizes social utility. The minimum subsidy required to motivate farmers to participate in the afforestation program was calculated using a modified decision model that accounts for the subsidy's impact. The maximum subsidy offered by the government was taken to be the NPV of the carbon sequestration achieved by afforestation. Data on Robinia pseudoacacia L trees planted on the Loess Plateau were used in an empirical test of the model, which in this case predicts an optimal subsidy of 254.38 yuan/ha over 40 years. This would guarantee the maintenance of forest on land designated for afforestation until they reached the socially optimal rotation age. The method presented herein offers a new framework for designing afforestation subsidy programs that account for the environmental service (specially, the carbon sequestration) provided by forests.

In order to cast light on the economic function of these consortia, this article provides empirical evidence on the standards related to informal consortia, and on the RD contributions of members and outsiders. We find that standards related to consortia are characterized by a more fragmented ownership of intellectual property rights (IPR) and a strong degree of technological rivalry. We also find that among the firms contributing to a standard, technological specialists are less likely to be member of a consortium. Companies are more likely to be members of the same consortium with companies specializing in RD that is substitutable rather than complementary to their own patent portfolio. One possible interpretation of these findings is that a main benefit of standards consortia is to reduce the cost of standard development by eliminating wasteful RD duplication and settling conflicts of interest upfront to formal standardization.","[Baron, Justus] Northwestern Univ, Searle Ctr Law Regulat & Econ Growth, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Baron, Justus] Sci Po Paris, Dept Economics, Paris, France; [Pohlmann, Tim] Mines ParisTech, Cerna, Ctr Econ Ind, Paris, France; [Pohlmann, Tim] Berlin Univ Technol, Chair Innovat Econ, Berlin, Germany",Northwestern University; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech; Technical University of Berlin,"Baron, J (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Searle Ctr Law Regulat & Econ Growth, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",Justus.Baron@sciences-po.org; tim.pohlmann@tu-berlin.de,,,,,,,44,22,23,1,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In so doing, the article contrasts various narrower sub-categories of the broad holdup problem, including patent holdup, reverse patent holdup, and government holdup. The article elucidates a number of existing legal institutions and organizations that significantly mitigate the threat of patent holdup, including particular doctrines in the law of patent remedies and particular private ordering arrangements such as Standard-Setting Organizations (SSOs). It also highlights some of the unfortunate unintended consequences of currently popular suggestions for mitigating patent holdup. It then explores the economic incentives driving the actions by both patent holder and licensee to show different categories of holdup risk they create. It closes by introducing a suggested framework for courts and administrative agencies to use to directly target the identified categories of holdup risk, and thereby limit harmful side effects.","[Kieff, F.

When is a royalty FRAND? Drawing from both legal theory and economic theory, I propose an interpretation of FRAND that distinguishes and reconciles the conflicting definitions of FRAND and provides courts a practical approach to identifying FRAND royalties. A proper understanding of a FRAND royalty requires recognizing the combinatorial value of standard-essential patents. That recognition reveals the fallacy in attempting to apply the ex ante incremental value rule to the determination of a FRAND royalty. FRAND royalties divide the aggregate royalties generated by the standard among the holders of patents essential to the standard. Such a division should maximize the surplus resulting from the standards creation. It must also satisfy an individual-rationality constraint for the patent holder and the licensee, thereby encouraging continued participation in the setting and implementation of open standards, as opposed to greater reliance on proprietary standards.","[Sidak, J.

We make three important findings. First, different sectors require different types of intermediaries who play different roles. In the high-tech sector, government research institutes and international industrial associations have gained the trust of transnational corporations (TNCs) and are able to keep pace with rapid technological change. In the mid-tech sector, public-sector development agencies can act as brokers' and leverage the knowledge of TNCs to strengthen local suppliers' capabilities, and local industrial associations can act as mediators' in solving conflicts between local firms. In resource-based sectors, public sectoral development agencies can act as resource providers' to local firms, and local industrial associations can broker coordinated efforts among members to achieve common goals. Second, the division of labour between public and private intermediaries is crucial; public intermediaries should play a leading role in producing the public goods' that are necessary to upgrade sectors, whereas private intermediaries should play an active role in producing club goods' for the sustainability of sectors. Third, different intermediary roles require different underlying capabilities.","[Intarakumnerd, Patarapong] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Chaoroenporn, Peera] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; Thammasat University,"Intarakumnerd, P (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan.",prpu6@hotmail.com,,"Intarakumnerd, Patarapong/0000-0001-6190-1388",,,,,15,19,20,1,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This paper argues that the legitimacy of the new Aboriginal identity' population stems not from its ability to measure Aboriginal identity more accurately than previous enumerative strategies, but from the fact that its self-identification' categories better produce the kind of data used by officials to implement development-based policies in their attempts to improve Aboriginal quality of life in Canada. Using interviews from Aboriginal census field agents, the paper explores how and why such policy classifications have come to be so deeply misrecognized as exhaustive or acontextual categories of identity and the kinds of Aboriginal sociality they potentially foreclose upon in doing so.","Univ Alberta, Fac Native Studies, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H8, Canada",University of Alberta,"Andersen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Fac Native Studies, 2-31 Pembina Hall, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H8, Canada.",chris.andersen@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,56,9,10,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We find that consumers who underestimate their nonmortgage debt (31.5% of the sample) also take out larger mortgages relative to income. Consumers who underestimate or overestimate their total debt as well as their monthly debt payments are more likely to accept the offer of financial coaching. Moreover, overconfidence in financial matters reduces the take-up of financial coaching. These biases in perceived financial status appear to be systematically related to behavior among a group of relatively inexperienced consumers. These findings suggest that efforts to extend homeownership may need to include debiasing mechanisms to help less informed consumers accurately assess their current debt levels and ability to make ongoing mortgage payments.","[Moulton, Stephanie; Loibl, Caezilia] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Samak, Anya; Collins, J.

A comparison is made of two concepts central to transport infrastructure planning in Sweden; Regional expansion and Environmentally sound transport. These concepts signify different perspectives on the benefits and problems with transport. The analysis explains how these clashing perspectives are resolved in the planning process. A discourse theoretical framework is applied to analyse the interplay between the concepts, the framings of problems and solutions, knowledge production practices and the outcomes of the planning process. The main finding is that the growth paradigm, captured in the concept of Regional expansion, has a strong influence on the planning discourse and restricts environmental policy options. The existing planning practices are mainly supporting the growth paradigm and contribute to an emphasis on certain problems and issues e.g. lack of capacity in the transport system and commuting trips. This results in other possible options e.g. reducing road transport volumes, or addressing leisure and service related travel, being excluded from the planning discourse. A number of consequences for the outcome of the planning process are discussed and possible ways of reframing problems are suggested. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Non-preventive enforcement is aimed at detecting and punishing offenders, while preventive enforcement seeks to prevent potential offenders from carrying out illegal actions (for example, officers on patrol can physically prevent crimes in progress, such as thefts or assaults). The deterrent effect of preventive enforcement is greater than that of non-preventive enforcement when it successfully deprives offenders of illicit gains and punishes them. However, preventive enforcement averts not only inefficient offenses but also efficient ones; as a result, it will be inferior to non-preventive enforcement in circumstances in which the available sanctions are high, enforcement is cheap, and a sufficient number of offenses are socially efficient. In our set-up, one potential outcome is that as available sanctions increase, enforcement efforts also increase, while deterrence remains unchanged (because there is less preventive enforcement). Finally, we show that in a framework with preventive enforcement, imprisonment need not be maximal, in contrast to the standard finding reported in the literature. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The focus is on Italy's PEX rules. PEX enables companies to make manufactured loans that generate tax exempt interest income by combining stocks with forwards or options. Borrowing through similar manufactured loans allows companies to bypass restrictions to deducting the cost of borrowing. PEX induced arbitrage exploitable through stock and options portfolios is available even when put-call parity holds for European options. Derivatives that hedge a stock can inherit the PEX regime of the stock they hedge. PEX gives companies that own a stock a tax timing option, which can be exploited through stock straddle strategies, i.e. long-short positions in the same stock, and which can generate valuable tax savings.","Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, Alcuin Coll, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Realdon, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, Alcuin Coll, Univ Rd, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",mr15@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,11,0,1,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Specifically, we explore the extent to which assemblers buffer their equity-affiliated suppliers from demand fluctuations to a greater extent than is the case for unaffiliated suppliers. Our empirical analysis suggests that assemblers buffered their affiliated suppliers from the effects of a negative demand shock in 1992-95, apparently favoring affiliates over unaffiliated suppliers during this period, as predicted by the hostage model. However, affiliates in our sample also more frequently adjust production to accommodate short-run demand fluctuations faced by the auto assemblers.

However, the existence of such costs has rarely been investigated in empirical papers. In this paper, we look at the psychic costs of migration by using alcohol problems as an indicator. Rather than comparing immigrants and natives, we look at the native-born in a single country and compare those who have lived away for a period of their lives and those who have not. We use data from the first wave of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing which is a large, nationally representative sample of older Irish adults. We find that men who lived away are more likely to have suffered from alcohol problems than men who stayed. For women, we again see a higher incidence of alcohol problems for short-term migrants. However, long-term female migrants are less likely to have suffered from alcohol problems. For these women, it seems that migration provided psychic benefits, and this is consistent with findings from other research which showed how migration provided economic independence to this group. The results remain when we adjust for endogeneity and when we use propensity score matching methods.","[Barrett, Alan; Mosca, Irene] Trinity Coll Dublin, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing TILDA, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Barrett, Alan; Mosca, Irene] ESRI, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Barrett, Alan] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Barrett, A (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing TILDA, Dublin 2, Ireland.",barretal@tcd.ie,,"Barrett, Alan/0000-0002-1106-2528",,,,,47,17,22,0,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

To derive testable hypotheses on the firm location choice an analytical framework that combines the firm heterogeneity and the new economic geography literatures is used. In this framework, agglomeration economies, technical infrastructure, and labour market characteristics may affect location decisions of foreign investors. The hypotheses derived from the theory are validated empirically using the regional dataset at NUTS 2 level of spatial aggregation for the period 19992010.

While demand management measures have been promoted in a small number of countries, including vehicular restrictions as well as the promotion of public transport modes, there are currently no congestion pricing programmes in operation in Latin America. This paper begins with an overview of travel demand management, including its principal aims as well as its primary objectives within the Latin American context. It discusses past efforts to promote traffic restraint and perspectives for developing congestion pricing schemes in both Sao Paulo and Santiago. Finally, it examines the potential role of congestion pricing as a demand management tool. While it is one of the most effective demand management measures in the industrialised world, a number of barriers currently prevent it from being widely adopted in Latin America.

The TDFS process comprises three stages - preliminary data analysis, the generation of quantitative forecasts and judgmental adjustments - which correspond to the three key system components: the data module, the quantitative forecasting module and the judgmental forecasting module, respectively. These stages (modules) interact with one another. This paper focuses on a recent case study that illustrates the functional ability of the TDFS as a support system, providing accurate forecasts of the demand for Hong Kong tourism. Specifically, the quantitative forecasts are generated by the autoregressive distributed lag model, then adjusted by a panel of experts comprising postgraduate students and academic staff. The results show that this combination of quantitative and judgmental forecasts improves the overall forecasting accuracy. (C) 2012 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A longitudinal design is used. Natural, interaction-based peer groups are identified through the Social Cognitive Map procedure. Findings indicate that high-status rather than low-status peers in a group are influential on individuals. Strong influence of high-status peers is observed in both boys' and girls' groups. High-status peers are particularly influential on low-status individuals in girls' groups and on high-status individuals in boys' groups. Additionally, high-status peers' influence is stronger on African Americans than on Hispanic Americans and tends to be stronger on Hispanic Americans than on White Americans. These findings imply that special attention should be given to high-status youth in groups who highly endorse social benefits of material possessions. Characteristics of the target youth (e.g., gender, ethnicity and individual status) should be considered in future efforts for reducing the pervasiveness of materialism.","[Shi, Bing] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xie, Hongling] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Sun Yat Sen University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Shi, B (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",bishi@temple.edu; hongling.xie@temple.edu,"shi, bing/ACA-2588-2022","Shi, Bing/0000-0003-1724-7264",,,,,56,10,14,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The paper proposes a broader notion of performativity, one that not only concerns theory but is also extended to the entire economy, which observes itself in all of its operations. This conception has the advantage of being connected with critical approaches inside economics, which highlight the central role of uncertainty and surprise. It can explain how and why performativity turns into counter-performativity and how financial operators exploit uncertainty when orienting their behaviour, expecting and using the unpredictability of the future.","Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Fac Sci Comunicaz & Econ, I-42100 Reggio Emilia, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Esposito, E (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Fac Sci Comunicaz & Econ, Viale Allegri 15, I-42100 Reggio Emilia, Italy.",elena.esposito@unimore.it,,,,,,,90,73,74,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The simulation-based approach is employed to obtain the DUE condition for the case of multiple-origin multiple-destination traffic flows. The dynamic traffic assignment simulation program (DTASP), developed in C language is used to assign the traffic dynamically on the road network, whereas method of successive averages (MSA) is modified and used to arrive at the DUE condition. The artificial intelligence technique of genetic algorithms (GAs) is applied to obtain the optimal signal setting parameters and path flow distribution factor for DUE condition. The methodology developed in such a way that joint optimization of signal setting parameters with DUE is obtained. The proposed method is applied to the real network data of Fort Area of Mumbai city comprising of 17 nodes and 56 unidirectional links with 72 Origin Destination pairs, where all the 17 nodes are signalized intersections. The traffic flow condition for the optimized signal setting parameters is considerably improved compared to the existing signal settings. The results prove that the GA is an effective technique to solve the joint optimization problem for the real network data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Varia, H.

In this study, we used economic, human development, and social learning perspectives to explore the entrepreneurial motivations among female university youth in Saudi Arabia and formulated three hypotheses on the gender differences in these motivations. We conducted a survey among undergraduate students at King Saud University in Spring'2010 (n = 856) and tested our hypotheses using analysis of variance (chi-square tests and t-tests). Consistent with research on female entrepreneurs around the world, our results indicate that female university youth in Saudi Arabia are more likely than men to start an entrepreneurial venture out of necessity, whereas men are more likely to have a financial success motivation. At the same time, and in contrast to findings from studies on entrepreneurial motivations in the context of Western Europe and the USA, young Saudi university women report a narrower range of entrepreneurial motivations, compared to men. The implications of this exploratory study point to the need for initiatives specifically focused at young women in order to increase their confidence that entrepreneurship is a viable route to accomplish a broad range of career reasons.","[Almobaireek, Wafa N.] Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Business & Adm, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia; [Manolova, Tatiana S.] Bentley Univ, Dept Management, Waltham, MA 02452 USA",Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University; Bentley University,"Manolova, TS (通讯作者)，Bentley Univ, Dept Management, 175 Forest St, Waltham, MA 02452 USA.",wmobaireek@ksu.edu.sa; tmanolova@bentley.edu,,,,,,,73,34,36,1,64,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Yearly tallies of road victims by severity category, typically computed nowadays from police reports, emerged over time in many countries from systematic determination by Administrations of Justice of the non-criminal nature of reported individual road crash and damage events. Such data series on retained accidents, as available over the last 150 years (notably in France), imply very important gains in kilometric safety rates over time with the replacement of horse-drawn carriages by motor vehicles and with the spread of motor vehicles themselves. However, multivariate statistical analyses reaching beyond two-way frequency tables are recent: aggregate national fatality rates were first modeled (as Gaussian distributions with a regression component) by Smeed in 1949, but morbidity rates were then neglected; and samples of discrete occurrences of individual accidents (of any severity) were first modeled (as Poisson distributions with a regression component) by Weber in 1970, but without concern for national population values. These Seminal single-outcome models gave rise to two streams of explanations, distinct to this day, that share a public health epidemiological emphasis on the establishment of multiple correlations which give rise to testable corrective policy interventions. These are still of limited value in the explanation of the simultaneous peaking of fatalities in many OECD countries in 1972-1973 (called the Mystery of 1972-1973, hypothesized here to be occasioned by the passing of the demographic baby boom wave) and as guidance in the design of policies for the containment of road risk arising from the intrinsic dangerousness of individuals.

In this paper is applied Buhlmann-Straub model for determining credible premium in third-party vehicle insurance. Loss ratio is the ratio of total losses incurred in claims divided by the total premiums earned. This is an indicator of how well an insurance company is doing. This ratio reflects if companies are collecting premiums higher than the amount paid in claims or if it is not collecting enough premiums to cover claims. Loss ratios for vehicle insurance usually range from 40 % to 60 %. Companies that have high loss claims may be experiencing financial trouble. The overall loss ratio in the Slovak market of third-party vehicle insurance in 2011 increased slightly to 57.13 %. High loss ratio showed AXA - 83.21 %, Generali - 69.41 % and KOOPERATIVA VIG - 65.69 %. These three together have insurance in 2011, a significant proportion of insurance in the Slovak Republic, to 45.06 %. These facts are the reason why we decided to assess the adequacy of the insurance premium in seven companies which in 2011 had a market share of 94.35 % in the Slovak insurance market. Credible premium is determined as a linear combination of premiums, determined from the data on their own risk and premium determined on the basis of information from similar risks. Credible premium is a compromise between the individual premium, i.e. premium determined solely from its own data on the risk premium and the collective, determined from data on collective risk. The credibility factor takes the value from 0 to 1 and expresses credibility of own experience. The highest credibility factor is in Allianz-SP and KOOPERATIVA VIG, which had the highest market share vehicle insurance and thus most of their own data on claims.","Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Matemat & Kvantitativnich Metod, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Gogola, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Matemat & Kvantitativnich Metod, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",jan.gogola@upce.cz,"Gogola, Ján/AAO-9699-2020",,,,,,11,3,3,0,7,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In comparison to other developed countries (e.g. Ireland, Spain, Greece, USA, Denmark, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia or Bulgaria) was the decrease in residential property prices only gradual and the default rate is lagging behind the average of the developed countries. The volatility in residential property prices could follow the accumulation of systemic risks of owner-occupied housing, especially the growing share of low-income households with mortgage debts among home-owners. The article therefore aims to answer following research questions. First, was there significant increase in the share of low-income households repaying their mortgages in the owner-occupied housing sector in the Czech Republic after 2005? Second, was there significant increase in 'innovative' mortgage products (e.g. interest-only mortgages, mortgages denominated in foreign currencies etc.) on the Czech mortgage market after 2005? Supplementary question was, whether balanced housing market, i.e. housing market with significant share of rental housing, could be one of the reasons of lower volatility in residential property prices, in comparison to housing market oriented mainly toward owner-occupied housing. The analysis showed that the hypothesis about sharply growing share of low-income households repaying mortgages in the owner-occupied housing sector in the Czech Republic after 2005 can be rejected. Also the share of 'innovative' mortgage products in the portfolios of Czech mortgage lenders seems to be rather negligible. Therefore we concluded that there is no evidence about significant accumulation of systemic risks on the Czech housing market. Moreover, the comparison of impacts of economic crisis in selected countries showed that balanced housing market could pose the best protection against negative impacts of economics crisis and against increased volatility in residential property prices.",,,,petr.sunega@soc.cas.cz; martin.lux@soc.cas.cz,"Sunega, Petr/B-9288-2014; Lux, Martin/B-8177-2014","Sunega, Petr/0000-0001-9918-0731; Lux, Martin/0000-0003-4703-3443",,,,,27,2,2,0,13,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

On the other hand, malpractice leads to modest mortality reductions; the value of these more than likely exceeds the costs of malpractice liability.

Some of these works focus on the determinants of delay in litigation but very little analysis has been dedicated to examining if tactical delay may actually help the settlement process. The paper shows that in European merger litigation merging parties may decide to tactically challenge discovery attempts, which causes a delay that is strategically used to gain more time to take the necessary steps to avoid a lengthy in-depth investigation. This type of delay can be beneficial to both merging parties and could also contribute to the saving of regulatory resources, and reduce the risks threatening the success of a potentially efficiency enhancing merger.

The viability of the system can be enhanced through an understanding of commuters' opinions and experiences. Using Lagos, Nigeria, as a case study, the purpose of this study therefore is to investigate commuters' opinions and experiences about several elements of the city's transportation system. The results of the survey indicate that commercial vehicles represent the dominant mode of transportation in the city while the most-frequently mentioned causes and locations of traffic congestion are law and order issues such as motorists who pick up and drop off passengers on the roadway, informal economic entrepreneurs who occupy bus stops, and police and traffic warden checkpoints. Most of the respondents reported experiencing road rage during their daily commute, and the reported reasons are mostly law and order issues. Most of the respondents indicate that they at least sometimes stay late at work in order to avoid evening time traffic congestion, and virtually all the respondents support the provision of information about traffic situation either as electronic messaging or on radio stations. The study offers suggestions that can be used to reduce traffic congestion, and improve the quality of commuters' transportation experiences. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores their projected choices and motivations in the context of (1) post-materialist values; (2) economic constraints; and (3) social status theories; and draws upon survey research among 140 upper elementary school children in the Netherlands between September 2010 and January 2011. Comparative analysis shows that there are significant differences in attitudes of children from different socio-economic backgrounds. Pupils from the affluent predominantly ethnically Dutch schools showed greater awareness of and concern about their parents' and general use of cars, and less desire to own a car in the future, children from less economically advantaged schools demonstrated lower environmental awareness and concern and more desire to own a car in the future. This study is based on a small sample and indicates a need for large-scale follow-up study of children's attitudes towards cars. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This is particularly true in an inventory management context, where the interactions between forecasting and stock control are not yet fully understood. In this paper, the relationship between the forecasting performance and inventory implications is explored under an ARIMA representation of the demand process. Two distinct scenarios are incorporated in our analysis: Forecast Information Sharing (FIS) and No Information Sharing (NIS) in a two-stage supply chain. We approach the problem analytically and by means of simulation. The validity of the theoretical results is assessed on a real sales dataset from a major European superstore. The results indicate that the gain in accuracy from Forecast Information Sharing depends on the demand process. The translation to inventory savings then depends on the magnitude of the forecast accuracy improvement, regardless of the demand process. Insights into pertinent managerial issues are also offered, and our paper concludes with an agenda for further research in this area. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.

We present a basic economic model of generic manufacturers investment decisions and argue that these incentives should be taken into account in evaluating policy issues.

This paper reviews legal services advertising restrictions in the United States and abroad. A theoretical model is developed which incorporates advertising intensity, litigation costs, and an endogenous number of lawsuits. Since advertising induces victims to bring suit, it increases the level of injurer care. However, litigation costs are also incurred. At the optimum, the marginal benefit of deterrence equals the sum of marginal litigation and advertising costs. Extensions of the model are considered, including the possibility that advertising stirs up frivolous lawsuits and that firms use advertising to rent seek. Fee shifting and alternative fee structures are also discussed. Although blanket prohibitions on attorney advertising are likely suboptimal, some regulations may be justified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

No empirical study has yet been done to examine whether the proposed ex ante self-assessment method produces accurate takings compensation. This article fills the empirical gap by analyzing data from Taiwan's 1954-1977 regime, which was similar to the proposed scholarly models. I find that most landowners rationally reported their self-assessments at below market value, which was less than or equal to landowners' economic value, mainly because the condemnation probabilities were much lower than the property tax rates.

SPV provides a good framework for raising funds, linking participants legally and assuring supply, production and marketing of products. SPV brings together various parties like lenders, financial institutions, public sector and export credit agencies, guarantors, suppliers and off-takers. There is often a lack of precedents to identify factors of SPV and the process is further hampered by undeveloped financial and legal structures of a country. A number of factors need to be considered before setting up of SPV for PPP projects. A questionnaire survey was thus conducted to explore the most important factors in setting up SPV for PPP power projects from a wide range of personnel involved in the PPP processes in Asia. The objective of this paper is to investigate the current practice of setting up SPV and associated legal and financial impacts onto it. Analysis of the response data reflects experts' opinion in identifying the influential factors and the choices in setting up SPV for PPP power projects in Asia. The findings of the paper would help the public sector in implementing PPP power policy development and private sector sponsors in managing the projects.","[Chowdhury, Abu Naser; Tiong, Robert Lee Kong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Chen, Po-Han] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan",Nanyang Technological University; National Taiwan University,"Chowdhury, AN (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore.",abun0001@e.ntu.edu; pohanchen@ntu.edu.tw; clktiong@ntu.edu.sg,"Lee Kong, Robert Tiong/A-3750-2011",,,,,,42,6,7,0,35,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Considering a linear in cost specification as a basis for comparison, a cost over income specification of modal utility is used to examine analytically the variation of the cost and time coefficients for a logit model - with all the usual properties - to a small change in the income variance; the simulated derivatives suggest that the cost coefficient changes by a substantially larger amount than the time coefficient. This is confirmed using a simulated data base for mode choice, showing that the value of travel time increases ten times as the coefficient of variation of income is increased from zero (linear in cost) to a modest 0.3. This shows the sensitivity of the value of time to the specification of income, a serious problem when using choice models for policy analysis. A practical procedure to test and a possible practical solution to this problem is also suggested.","[Jara-Diaz, Sergio R.; Munizaga, Marcela A.; Guerra, Reinaldo] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Jara-Díaz, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.",,"Jara-Diaz, Sergio R/H-6705-2013; Munizaga, Marcela A/C-8958-2011; Jara-Diaz, Sergio/AAK-4221-2020","Jara-Diaz, Sergio/0000-0002-0442-5490; Munizaga, Marcela A./0000-0002-0485-5124",,,,,6,3,6,0,12,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

An optional instrument containing both facilitative general contract rules and mandatory consumer protection rules, one of the solutions proposed by the Commission, is gaining rapid support from key stakeholders. Drawing from firms' own views on the problems of legal diversity, and insights from organisational science, this article sets out the circumstances in which firms will likely consider a European optional code. Results are mixed: some firms may consider it, while others may ignore it. Much depends the firm's aspirations (i.e. SMEs cannot be assumed as-yet to have pan-European aspirations), how the firm perceives the problems of legal diversity, and how it searches for and decides upon solutions.

The authors strive to reveal the patterns of internationalization taking into account the aspects of main theoretical models. The research is based on the main ideas of stage, network and international entrepreneurship approaches. The main motives and barriers restricting internationalization process are based on the previous studies. In order to compare internationalization patterns of Lithuanian and Norwegian SMEs, quantitative research has been performed. The quantitative research is based on responses to a questionnaire embracing various aspects of internationalization. The sample of 300 SMEs was selected taking into consideration previous research. The survey allows concluding that Lithuanian SMEs emphasise geographic proximity as the most important criteria for international market selection. On the other hand, Norwegian SMEs perceive variables of international entrepreneurship theory as the important contributory factors in internationalization process. The authors conclude that Lithuanian SMEs rely on exporting; meanwhile Norwegian SMEs choose subcontracting/licensing or own representative abroad. Hence, Norwegian SMEs are seen at the more advanced stage of internationalization. Authors of the research have elaborated proposals, which are useful for further development of Lithuanian SMEs and take into consideration experience of Norwegian SMEs. The presented paper will contribute to the International Entrepreneurship Forum by providing new insights into further development of SMEs of Lithuania and Norway taking into consideration opportunities and threats.","[Korsakiene, Renata; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Korsakiene, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",renatakorsa@takas.lt; manuela@vgtu.lt,"Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/GVT-4155-2022; Korsakiene, Renata/E-8598-2017; /I-3713-2019","Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/0000-0002-9667-3730; Korsakiene, Renata/0000-0002-4119-4521; /0000-0002-9667-3730",,,,,42,47,69,7,63,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

IPTV service, a leading converged application that couples media content with telecom services, was recently launched commercially in Korea. We created a structural model of adoption-diffusion, using the perceived ease-of-use and usefulness of TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) as mediating variables, and a structural model of use-diffusion, with the rate of use and the variety of use as mediating variables. To empirically analyze these models, non-users of IPTV were surveyed using the adoption-diffusion model to identify factors influencing their intention to subscribe to the service. Meanwhile, users of IPTV were surveyed using the use-diffusion model to determine the factors that influence their satisfaction with the service and their intention to re-use it. Under the adoption-diffusion model, we found that trialability, household innovativeness and perceived risk were the determinants of user satisfaction with IPTV, and perceived ease-of-use, the mediating factor. Under the use-diffusion model, complementarity and communication were shown to be the determinants of users' satisfaction with IPTV, and variety of use, the mediating factor.

The data set is obtained from the bonds and bills market for the government securities in the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). Several results arise from our empirical analysis. First, we find strong evidence that there are stationary combinations of the long and short rates during the sample period. Secondly, when we restrict the cointegrating vectors to be the spread vectors between short and long rates we are not able to reject the restriction if the dynamic specifications of the systems include 2 lags of the interest rates. This result, however, is not robust to the lag length of 4 and 6 if the systems include interest rates with maturities longer than 6 months. Finally, the formal stability test results suggest that the regime change from the implicit to the full-fledged inflation targeting (IT) has no significant effect on the relationship among the interest rates on the short end of the term structure while the structural instability found in the relationship between the short rates and the long rates with maturity longer than 6 months might indicate the effect of the regime shift on this relationship. These results are in line with the conclusions of the literature that argues the EHTS to hold for the short end of the term structure when the focus of the monetary policy is to stabilize the short-term interest rates.","[Ozdemir, K.

J,"Jensen, KK",,,,"Jensen, Karsten Klint",,,UNACCEPTABLE RISKS AND THE CONTINUITY AXIOM,ECONOMICS AND PHILOSOPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Consider a sequence of outcomes of descending value, A > B > C >... > Z. According to Larry Temkin, there are reasons to deny the continuity axiom in certain 'extreme' cases, i.e. cases of triplets of outcomes A, B and Z, where A and B differ little in value, but B and Z differ greatly. But, Temkin argues, if we assume continuity for 'easy' cases, i.e. cases where the loss is small, we can derive continuity for the 'extreme' case by applying the axiom of substitution and the axiom of transitivity. The rejection of continuity for 'extreme' cases therefore renders the triad of continuity in 'easy' cases, the axiom of substitution and the axiom of transitivity inconsistent. As shown by Arrhenius and Rabinowitz, Temkin's argument is flawed. I present a result which is stronger than their alternative proof of an inconsistency. However, this result is not quite what Temkin intends, because it only refers to an ordinal ranking of the outcomes in the sequence, whereas Temkin appeals to intuitions about the size of gains and losses. Against this background, it is argued that Temkin's trilemma never gets off the ground. This is because Temkin appeals to two mutually inconsistent conceptions of aggregation of value. Once these are clearly separated, it will transpire, in connection with each of them, that one of the principles to be rejected does not appear plausible. Hence, there is nothing surprising or challenging about the result; it is merely a corollary to Expected Utility Theory.","[Jensen, Karsten Klint] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Jensen, KK (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",kkj@foi.ku.dk,"Jensen, Karsten Klint/Q-1879-2019; Jensen, Karsten/E-7714-2015","Jensen, Karsten Klint/0000-0002-3254-3136; Jensen, Karsten/0000-0002-3254-3136",,,,,8,2,2,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

In-depth interviews conducted with key actors over a three-year period show that opposing interests and actions hamper the development of integral and participative governance.

In recent years there has been an ongoing debate about urban fringes that are developing over and beyond the influence of postsuburban processes into decentralised and non-centred urban landscapes. This paper addresses the urgent need to consider polycentric functional service clustering in the urban fringes based on empirical evidence gathered in Vienna, Austria, which served as a case study. A spatial scan statistic is applied to detect local spatial clusters of services and the bivariate K(d)-function is used to investigate the spatial interaction between each nucleus. Due to some significant functional clusters, it has been concluded that agglomeration economies are still of prime interest. Furthermore, some significant attraction between the studied clusters is investigated. Overall, the results do not contradict the concept of postsuburbia yet, which is why a paradigm shift must be ruled out.","Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Helbich, M (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany.",marco.helbich@geog.uni-heidelberg.de,,,,,,,78,30,32,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The introduction of the pension option not only mitigates longevity risk for workers but also provides a higher expected present value of old-age benefits to workers than the one-time benefit option (on average). Based on a lifecycle model with uncertain lifespan, we expect that workers will increase current consumption and reduce savings in response to this policy intervention. We use data from the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE) in Taiwan to empirically test this prediction. In order to isolate other systematic structural changes or economic shocks from the true impact of the pension option on savings and consumption, we adopt a difference-in-differences (DID) approach in this study. Our results demonstrate that the implementation of pension benefits in LI lowers households' savings by 9.25% (NT$ 50,798) and raises consumption by 5.27% (NT$ 42,663) for LI workers. In addition, younger households tend to be more responsive to this policy in terms of increasing consumption, while some older households experience a significant decrease in savings.","[Chen, Hua; Weiss, Mary A.] Temple Univ, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Hsu, Wenyen] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Chen, H (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",hchen@temple.edu; wyhsu@fcu.edu.tw; mweiss@temple.edu,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,8,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89414-036-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,105,145,,,,,,41,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316628500010,0

The opposite effect is predicted when female employment induces male backlash. I identify the effect of female employment on spousal violence by exploiting the exogenous variations in rural women's working status driven by rainfall shocks and the rice-wheat dichotomy. The instrumental variable regression result indicates that female employment significantly reduces the incidence of spousal violence. This result is mainly driven by the exposure reduction effect that dominates male backlash.

Consequently, the topics of sample sizes and sample balance have not been subject to either formal study in credit scoring, or empirical evaluations across different data conditions and algorithms of varying efficiency. This paper describes an empirical study of instance sampling in predicting consumer repayment behaviour, evaluating the relative accuracies of logistic regression, discriminant analysis, decision trees and neural networks on two datasets across 20 samples of increasing size and 29 rebalanced sample distributions created by gradually under- and over-sampling the goods and bads respectively. The paper makes a practical contribution to model building on credit scoring datasets, and provides evidence that using samples larger than those recommended in credit scoring practice provides a significant increase in accuracy across algorithms.

Statistically significant differences exist in the POB of demographic groups, relating to age, marital status, home language, seniority and qualifications.

Since 1960's, the environmental liability insurance has been put into practice in many western developed countries, however no big progress has been made in China until recent years. In April, 2011, the environmental liability insurance program was launched in Baoding which has been selected to be the only pilot city in Hebei province. On November 15th, 2011, Baoding Branch of PICC Property and Casualty Company issued environmental pollution liability insurance policies to 15 enterprises in Baoding, which is a milestone for the environmental liability insurance development in Hebei province. By the end of 2011, 52 enterprises purchased environmental liability insurance. The experience accumulated in the course has great significance for extending this policy to other places in Hebei province. This study focuses on some hot issues rising when launching environmental pollution liability insurance in Baoding city, which include the role of the regulator, the attitude of the potential polluter, the preferred implementation mode and the risk evaluation standard.

Second, the article aims to forge a new set of links between GPNs and evolutionary economic geography (EEG), which has also attracted considerable recent interest as a framework for assessing the evolution of economic landscapes. In particular, I use evolutionary approaches and the concept of path dependence to develop a broader and deeper conception of the range of coupling, recoupling and decoupling processes that take place between regions and GPNs, going beyond strategic coupling per se.","Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"MacKinnon, D (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Daniel.MacKinnon@glasgow.ac.uk,,,,,,,93,288,320,7,159,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This assertion has been widely debated in recent years by a number of authors. In this paper we focus on the economic aspects of the protective function of forests, developing a quick and simple estimation method that can be applied on a local scale. We present the results of its application in an Italian Alpine forest. After having identified the main forest attributes directly or indirectly involved in protection, the economic value of the protective function for homogeneous zones was estimated by applying the replacement cost method. This value enables environmental concerns to be included in forest planning and political decision-making. (C) 2012 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

Nevertheless, few studies have been published in recent years on these markets. The main objective of this paper is to characterise the saffron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus Fr.) demand in Spain. Data sources in this study come from main Central Markets in Spain. Using econometric methods, we have found that the consequence of an increase in the price of the saffron milk cap has a negative effect on demand. However, changes in the percentage of persons born in Catalonia every year exercise a positive effect, and price increases in the Madrid market could also induce an increase in the Lactarius deliciosus demand in the Barcelona Central Market. The consequences of chanterelle imports on the Catalan demand for the saffron milk cap appear to be negative. Finally, results indicate that the saffron milk cap and oyster mushroom behave as complementary goods and, therefore, consumption of one of these mushrooms reinforces the other's consumption.

Issues such as the development of international activities, and factors favouring or disfavouring internationalization have been studied for both large as well as small and medium entrepreneurial subjects. The internationalization of entrepreneurial activities is represented by geographic expansion of entrepreneurial activities across national borders. The problems of the internationalization of entrepreneurial activities have seen a considerable interest among a number of significant economists. Internationalization theory subsumes to two diverse approaches - stage approach and global approach. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the internationalization process of the selected Czech entrepreneurial subjects in the Moravian-Silesian Region. The focus of this study is on small and medium enterprises and internal factors influencing their internationalization process. The paper is based on data collected in interviews with managers and founders of 67 Czech entrepreneurial subjects. The internationalization of the entrepreneurial subjects has been researched using the method of questioning. The research shows that the internationalization of entrepreneurial activities has been performed both by newly found firms and the firms already established on the market. We found that most entrepreneurial subjects followed a stage approach to internationalization.

We analyze the significance and scope of accurate court decisions and judicial error for labor contracting and identify the implications of these concepts on behavioral incentives and market outcomes. We find that imperfect judicial state verification and the diverging beliefs on a court ruling reduce the efficiency of contingent labor contracts and make them less effective in stipulating sufficient incentives for compliance. If increasing court accuracy in general is not feasible, the courts (and the legislator) should primarily mitigate type I errors. The common reversal of the burden of proof to the employer in labor laws reflects these insights. The model also indicates that the ability of judges to verify facts is a prerequisite for efficient law-making and contributes significantly to the economic role of courts.","Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Polit Econ, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University,"Christmann, R (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Polit Econ, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",christmann@hsu-hh.de,,,,,,,38,2,3,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This paper presents an analysis of how CFDs have affected equity market volatility in Ireland. EGARCH models are used to uncover volatility changes in the periods before and after the introduction of the new trading product in Ireland. We find that CFDs appear to have lowered asset-specific volatility across the majority of equities traded on the Irish Stock Exchange. These findings do not correspond to the expected volatility increase associated with leveraged products that are closely associated with high frequency trading. Our empirical analysis suggests that CFDs are having an alternative volatility reducing effect through the presence of bid and ask price overhangs that are generated through the hedging practices of CFD brokers.

It relies on a qualitative analysis of actors and institutions as well as social network analysis to more precisely fix the positions and roles of actors on either side of the border. The new cross-border institution, the EGTC agency, is a central actor in public transit policy networks and its function is more complex than the institutional analysis implies. Evaluating these roles in evolving cross-border public transit policy enables an assessment of the effectiveness of this new governance institution and the challenges faced by general-purpose cross-border governance structures in affecting policy areas in which political authority is fragmented.","[Durand, Frederic] CEPS INSTEAD, Dept Geog, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Nelles, Jen] CUNY Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY),"Durand, F (通讯作者)，CEPS INSTEAD, Dept Geog, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",frederic.durand@ceps.lu; gjennife@hunter.cuny.edu,"Durand, Frédéric/AAT-1744-2021",,,,,,48,19,19,3,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

However, the two liability rules are equivalent with regard to their effects on tacit collusion in the model pertaining to product liability.

This paper uses Irish household data from three Household Budget Surveys between 1994 and 2005 to test the PIH. Households that fail to consume their permanent income may do so because they have no access to credit or because they save, be it for a rainy day, a purchase, bequests, or simply because saving conditions are attractive. We find some evidence for credit constraints, for instance for mortgage households in arrears in the mid-1990s. Furthermore, mortgage households during the housing boom consistently consumed less than predicted by their permanent income, which may be related to planned house purchases or the Special Savings Incentive Account scheme.","[Gerlach-Kristen, Petra] Swiss Natl Bank, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss National Bank (SNB),"Gerlach-Kristen, P (通讯作者)，Boersenstr 15, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland.",petra.gerlach@snb.ch,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,8,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

It provides affordable connectivity, and fast and reliable services for a range of requirements. This paper presents barriers to introducing BRT based on the authors' experience in planning, implementing and improving these systems in cities of emerging countries. We conclude that most issues are related to institutional, financial, legal and political sectors. In particular, BRT planning faces: (i) institutional complexities and lack of technical capacity; (ii) lack of alignment among stakeholders; (iii) strong promotion of competing modes; (iv) perception of BRT as a lower quality mode; (v) traditional bias towards vehicle capacity expansions; (vi) opposition from existing bus operators; and (vii) lack of community participation. BRT implementation barriers include: (i) underestimating the implementation effort, i.e. optimism bias; (ii) discontinuities due to political cycles; (iii) lack of national policies supporting BRT development; (iv) insufficient funding for adequate implementation; and (v) rushed inauguration. By addressing and documenting common issues of many real world experiences, we expect to help cities enhance their ability to advance BRT as part of their portfolio of sustainable mobility improvements.

That left, as always, the problem of how best to deal with tactical planning as the core issue, and as always there was no simple solution. Government authorities should set the context in the form of contracts, which would inevitably influence the tactical planning process. But it was felt that operators, and particularly smaller locally based operators, would have a better knowledge of the needs of their passengers and of the commercial possibilities of alternative ways of serving them. Thus tactical planning would inevitably involve both government and operator, as well as other stakeholder groups. The workshop also considered issues related to the nature of the government authority that should have responsibility for public transport, the nature of the contract itself and how governments could best create the right environment for contract management, before reaching its conclusions on policy and on research needs.

However, we cautioned that this work was preliminary and likely to be sensitive to various assumptions made. In this paper, we have undertaken more detailed sensitivity analysis as follows. First, we have developed separate demand models for London and for the rest of Great Britain. Secondly, we have developed cost models to determine the extent to which costs are determined by external factors (such as fuel prices) or partially external factors (such as labour costs). Thirdly, we have developed fares models to assess the impact of changes in subsidy, in terms of both revenue support and concessionary fare reimbursements. We have also changed the measurements of consumer surplus so as to be more consistent with underlying economic theory. This work confirms the sensitivity of the long term evaluation of transport policy to assumptions concerning the counterfactual and trends in demand, supply and prices. Any policy lessons inferred from these long term evaluations need to take these sensitivities into account. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The vertical separation of infrastructure and services occurred in 2003. Open access for commercial passenger services is allowed, and it was utilised in 2011 when the incumbent on the key rail route Prague-Ostrava was challenged by a new operator; a third operator entered the route at the end of 2012. This resulted in an intensive on-track competition with tariff declines and service improvements. With the exception of the Prague-Ostrava route, the operation of other passenger lines is classified as a public service obligation and is subsidised from public budgets. Long-distance services are organised by the Ministry of Transport, and the usual form of procurement used to be a direct awarding of services to the incumbent. However, this is changing as competitive tendering is being used more frequently. Competitive tendering is also theoretically possible in regional transport, but in 2009, regional transport authorities decided to directly award all contracts to the incumbent for 10-15 years, effectively closing regional markets for that period.

The attribution of benefits to each of the travel alternatives needs to recognise that travellers may change their behaviour as a result of the project. These changes in demand arise not only from changes in the cost of each specific alternative but also from cost changes in other competing alternatives. The appropriate treatment of inter-modal effects is central to the determination of the user benefit produced by each alternative. The paper sets out a number of desirable criteria that source-related measures of user benefit should satisfy which include local consistency with the rule of a half. It explores the effect of alternative path specifications on the resulting measures and demonstrate that they can give different results when larger cost changes can occur, such as in modelling a new alternative. Appropriate measures that are able to treat this problem are developed and the results compared to those obtained by numerical methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking into account that previous research seems to find that the Europeanization process has had a favorable impact on national road safety performance, our main contribution is to test whether the same mechanism might lead to the convergence of Member States as a whole as a possible outcome. Based on typical convergence methodology for Economic Growth Theory, our findings reveal evidence of the full convergence of road fatality rates across a sample of EU countries during said time period. Compared to the uncertain results obtained by the literature on macroeconomic convergence, we do not find support for the convergence of sub-groups of countries, but a one-speed-convergence for all EU countries. This fact shows that convergence is achievable in certain EU areas even beyond economic convergence through successful efforts made jointly at national and community levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that the factors best able to assess the competitive advantage of a national merchant fleet include number of vessels, gross tonnage and deadweight tonnage of the fleet, number of seamen, and cargo volume transported by the fleet. We further discovered that Korean national merchant fleet has the greatest competitive advantage, followed by the fleets of Taiwan and Japan in that order, and found that aggressive shipping aid policies are a more effective way to ensure good performance than passive shipping aid policies.

These conditions include product and technological life cycles, social landscapes and market regimes and segment structure. I illustrate this framework by analyzing the French and American bicycle markets from the 1860s to the 1920s. In eras of ferment, consumers in specific segments constructed technological innovation systems with producers to shape product innovation. In other periods, markets turned to normal business and process innovation. Inter-segment relations also influenced innovation systems and national market trajectories.

This decision revived a long-standing debate among scholars and policy makers as to whether courts should intervene to protect the well-being of the disfranchised, by forcing states to improve schools, prisons, and mental institutions. We use data that span 1951-2006 to examine the impact of federal court orders condemning prison crowding, and the impact of states' releases from these court orders. We find that these interventions are associated with lower inmate mortality rates and fewer prisoners per capita. Correctional expenditures increase and welfare cash expenditures decrease while states are under court order, suggesting that the burden of improved prison conditions is borne by welfare recipients. Furthermore, states do not alter correctional spending and welfare cash payments spending after their release from court order, making the original changes in spending permanent.","[Boylan, Richard T.] Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Mocan, Naci] Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Mocan, Naci] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Rice University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Boylan, RT (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",rboylan@rice.edu,,,,,,,38,13,18,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In this article, we utilize a unique new dataset on constitutional review for 204 countries for the period 1781-2011 to test various theories that explain the adoption of constitutional review.

This translates into a negative relationship of precolonial population density and settler mortality with legal outcomes for common-law countries. By contrast, the implantation of the French civil law was not systematically influenced by initial conditions, which is reflected in the lack of such a relationship for this legal family. The common law does not generally lead to legal outcomes superior to those provided by the French civil law when precolonial population density and/or settler mortality are high.

This predictor is useful for panel data applications that exhibit spatial dependence and a nested (hierarchical) structure. The predictor allows for unbalancedness in the number of observations in the nested groups. One application includes forecasting average housing prices located in a county nested in a state. When deriving the BLUP, we take into account the spatial correlation across counties, as well as the unbalancedness due to observing different numbers of counties nested in each state. Ignoring the nested spatial structure leads to inefficiency and inferior forecasts. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that our feasible predictor is better in root mean square error performance than the usual fixed and random effects panel predictors which ignore the spatial nested structure of the data.

It is a detailed empirical case study into how the large-scale experiment of carbon markets has manifested in a particular area of professional expertise - financial accounting. Theories about the role of standards usefully draw attention to the hidden work of standards in society and help explain why some things are difficult to standardise. However, there are notable gaps in conceptualising how standards are integral to wider processes of policy and technology change. Ideas from governmentality and hybrid markets (agencements) are therefore used to explore further the role of standards within markets, and provide a welcome avenue for thinking afresh about the relationship between climate change and standards.","Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Lovell, H (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",heather.lovell@ed.ac.uk,"Lovell, Heather/L-6955-2018; Lovell, Heather/G-7019-2011","Lovell, Heather/0000-0003-1164-0356",,,,,64,28,29,1,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

It implements a procedure which allows consideration of unit roots with possibly fractional orders of integration both at zero (long-run) and cyclical frequencies. When focusing exclusively on the former, the estimated order of integration varies considerably, and non-stationarity is found only for the price/dividend ratio. When the cyclical component is also taken into account, the series appear to be stationary but to exhibit long memory with respect to both components in almost all cases. The exception is the price/dividend ratio, whose order of integration is higher than 0.5 but smaller than 1 for the long-run frequency, and is between 0 and 0.5 for the cyclical component. Also, mean reversion occurs in all cases. Finally, six different criteria are applied to compare the forecasting performance of the fractional (at both zero and cyclical frequencies) models with others based on fractional and integer differentiation only at the zero frequency. The results, based on a 15-year horizon, show that the former outperforms the others in a number of cases.

The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between mobility and overweight/obesity in an urban context, while considering physical activity in leisure time, socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics, and individual health status. Methods: Cross-sectional study based on the 2011 Barcelona Health Survey. We selected individuals who reported no physical limitations (N=2312). The dependent variable was Body Mass Index calculated from self-reported weight and height measures (low/normal or overweight/obese). The main explanatory variable was mobility (Participant walked >= 30 min; walked <30 min; travelled by public transport only; travelled in private motorised transport only). Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to study the relationship between mobility and overweight/obesity while also accounting for other variables. Results: In Barcelona, 47.8% of men and 28.1% of women aged 15-64 years were overweight or obese. Compared to individuals who used motorised transport only, lower risk of overweight/obesity was found in men travelling by public transport only [PR=0.75 (0.64-0.90)], walking <30 min [PR=0.81 (0.70-0.93)] or >= 30 min [PR=0.81 (0.73-0.90)]. We did not observe a significant association among women. Conclusion: Behavioural changes toward more active mobility could reduce the likelihood of being overweight or obese, mainly in men. This reinforces the idea of active transport as a public health strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study shows that the effect of labour mobility can only be assessed when one accounts for the type of skills that flow into the plant and the degree to which these match the existing skills at the plant level. As expected, we found that the inflow of skills that are related to skills in the plant impacts positively on plant productivity growth, while inflows of skills that are similar to the plant skills have a negative effect. We used a sophisticated indicator of revealed relatedness that measures the degree of skill relatedness between sectors on the basis of the intensity of labour flows between sectors.

In this paper we focus on a particular set of instruments for transnational governance of food supply chains: transnational contracts and agreements. Looking at transnational contracts as instruments for implementation of transnational private regulation, we compare different mechanisms for the enforcement of safety and sustainability standards in global food supply chains. We conclude that the regime of contractual remedies follows different logics from the ones of regulatory and certification regime. (1) The former aims at redressing the victim of the breach inducing compliance through a re-active approach; whereas the latter pro-actively tries to restore compliance with regulatory process in order to pursue regulatory objectives. (2) The former focuses mainly on products, the latter on process. (3) The former concentrates on individual transactions while the latter focuses on the interdependence of contractual relationships along the chain and creates collective governance mechanisms. This paper suggests that the combination of the two sets of remedies may reinforce coordination and cooperation along the chain, therefore improving the level of quality, safety or sustainability of certified production. A higher level of awareness about the impact of standards and certification on the contract rules on remedies can have other positive consequences: it may improve contract drafting, leading the parties to coordinate different remedial systems when addressing the consequences of the breach and the ones of certification remedies; it may help courts to better define the scope and preconditions of contractual remedies and their effects on transnational regulation; it may guide law makers and standard setting institutions, when providing principles, rules or guidance concerning the consequences of the breach within contracts and along the chain, particularly in the food sector.

In the present paper, we develop an economic voting model for forecasting the future success of the Austrian 'grand coalition', i.e., the joint electoral success of the two mainstream parties SPOE and OEVP, at the 2013 Austrian Parliamentary Elections. Our main argument is that the success of both parties is strongly tied to the accomplishments of the Austrian system of corporatism, that is, the Social Partnership (Sozialpartnerschaft), in providing economic prosperity. Using data from Austrian national elections between 1953 and 2008 (n = 18), we rely on the following predictors in our forecasting model: (1) unemployment rates, (2) previous incumbency of the two parties, and (3) dealignment over time. We conclude that, in general, the two mainstream parties benefit considerably from low unemployment rates, and are weakened whenever they have previously formed a coalition government. Further, we show that they have gradually been losing a good share of their voter basis over recent decades. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The main contribution is to provide deeper insight into the causal relationships between subcontractors' relational capabilities and their degree of internationalization, mediated by the level of subcontractors' involvement with local firms and the networks linked to international markets. While confirming the existence of a strong connection between subcontractors' relational capabilities and the level of subcontractors' involvement with local hubs of international networks, it was found that subcontractors' dependence on multinational enterprises could hamper their expansion into foreign markets. More specifically, the study offers only partial support for the so-called 'springboard' effect, i.e. the role exerted by local hubs of internationalized supply networks in projecting small subcontractors abroad.","[Balboni, Bernardo; Bortoluzzi, Guido; Vianelli, Donata] Univ Trieste, Dept Econ Management Math & Stat Bruno de Finetti, I-34127 Trieste, Italy",University of Trieste,"Balboni, B (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Dept Econ Management Math & Stat Bruno de Finetti, Piazzale Europa 1, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",bernardo.balboni@deams.units.it; guido.bortoluzzi@deams.units.it; donata.vianelli@deams.units.it,"Balboni, Bernardo/AAA-3474-2019; BORTOLUZZI, GUIDO/AAM-7948-2021","Balboni, Bernardo/0000-0002-3363-2202; BORTOLUZZI, GUIDO/0000-0003-0422-3036; Vianelli, Donata/0000-0001-9139-4698",,,,,77,8,8,0,14,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Physical asset investment decisions are based largely on rigid discounted cash flow tools which provide untimely and incomplete decisional criteria. While literature outlines the widespread use of traditional DCF techniques, it nevertheless reveals extensive limitations, including its static inflexibility and slow-to-evolve framework. ROA is a more recent valuation tool based on stock option theory. It brings into account added value found in the flexibility of managerial decision-making and uncertain conditions. This study implements a combined DCF and ROA capital budgeting tool within a Physical Asset Management (PAM) environment. The validity of the framework is realised through an industry-relevant case study presented by a South African mining company.","[Campher, C. A.; Vlok, P.

The heterogeneous group of diseases, including, among others, cancers, cardiovascular illnesses, chronic respiratory conditions and diabetes, affect people of all ages and social classes. It is estimated that chronic conditions are responsible for 60% of deaths globally (Abegunde et al., 2007). The burden is predicted to become worse in the coming years. A WHO study projected an increase of global deaths by a further 17% in the period 2005-2015 (The World Health Report, 2004). The heavy burden of chronic diseases and their multiple effects on productivity, and demography plays an important role in the performance of national economy. The correlation between health and economic growth is therefore one of most crucial issues worldwide. The aim of this paper is to discuss the scale and trends in the burden of chronic diseases for the economy of the European countries. The discussion is based on national statistics showing the burden of chronic diseases in OECD countries (sometimes limited to European countries only). Comparative analysis and descriptive analysis have been applied. The author takes into account direct, indirect and immeasurable costs of chronic illnesses. It is revealed that indirect costs are much higher than direct costs of many chronic diseases. Disability adjusted life year index has also been used to predict the burden of chronic diseases. The author concludes that economic development depends on human capital and health is one of the crucial issues shaping it. Based on the data, it can be stated that economic growth is strongly determined by the public burden diseases.","Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Econ, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Rudawska, I (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Econ, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",igita@wneiz.pl,,"Rudawska, Iga/0000-0002-2173-931X",,,,,27,1,2,0,14,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Local governments around the world have done important innovations to earn the trust of their residents and their comparative performance is of great interest yet a comprehensive framework to provide such benchmarking is not available. This paper attempts to fill this void, by developing a general framework for performance accountability of local governments and by relating real world practices to aspects of this framework. The proposed rating framework requires several types of assessments: (a) their compliance with due process and law; (b) monitoring of fiscal health for sustainability; (c) monitoring of service delivery; and (d) citizens' satisfaction with local services. The approach yields key indicators useful for benchmarking performance that can be used in self-evaluation and improvement of performance. t From an analysis of practices in local government performance monitoring and evaluation, the paper concludes that ad hoc ad-on self standing monitoring and evaluation systems are more costly and less useful than built-in tools and mechanisms for government transparency, self-evaluation and citizen based accountability such as local government output budgeting and output based fiscal transfers to finance local services.","[Shah, Anwar] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ SWUFE, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Shah, Anwar] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Shah, Anwar] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",Brookings Institution; The World Bank,"Shah, A (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ SWUFE, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",shah.anwar@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,12,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The fundamental reason is that the coal price forming mechanism is unreasonable, mainly in the unsound mechanism of coal supply and demand, unreasonable coal prices and incomplete price forming mechanism.

Considerable attention is given to GDP and GNP as measures of Ireland's taxable capacity but how appropriate are either of these measures given the structure of Ireland's economy and how does the structure compare internationally? The paper also examines the distribution of income tax and the threshold for the top marginal rate as a percentage of the average wage and identifies Ireland as an outlier internationally in terms of the rapid progression to the highest marginal rate. Consideration is then given to the microeconomic and macroeconomic impacts of various forms of tax what lessons emerge from the literature in terms of growth enhancing reforms to the overall tax structures and how that might apply to Ireland.

We use a two-country cointegrated model to conduct the counterfactual analysis, where the conditional forecasts are generated based on the Gaussian assumption. To deal with structural breaks and model uncertainty, conditional forecasts are generated from different models/estimation windows and the model-averaging technique is used to combine the forecasts. We also examine the robustness of our results to parameter uncertainty using the wild bootstrap method. The results show that forming the currency union would probably boost the Canadian economy, whereas it would not have significant effects on US output or Canadian and US price levels.

One of the more spirited discussions revolves around law enforcement agents targeting criminal activity based on a suspect's race and age. While racial profiling has received considerable attention, discussions about age-based patrolling and age-graded penalties have received much less attention. In the current analysis, we test the response, by age, of speeding on roadways (a crime that is often considered to be linked to age) to decreases in the probability of being apprehended. We find that all drivers appear to quasi-uniformly increase their speed in response to the reduced chance of being apprehended. Additionally, more egregious and seasoned offenders tend to be more responsive to fluctuations in law enforcement presence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This abandonment represents a high economic cost in any health system in addition to the negative effect that the abandonment can have on patient health. The Antimano Center for Attention to Child Nutrition (Centro de Atencion Nutricional Infantil Antimano-CANIA), does not escape this problem, which is more noticeable in that the demand for such care has increased. The aim of this research was to determine the factors associated with the causes of nutrition counseling abandonment by patients with malnutrition who attended CANIA during the 2000-2008 period. The sample consisted of 827 patients under social assessment who quit attending consultation and requested re-assessment. This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study. The variables studied related to socio-demographics, family and individuals. Frequency distributions, the chi squared statistics test with a significance level of alpha= 0.05 and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) were used. The variables significantly associated with the causes of counseling abandonment were: the mothers' level of education, social stratification according to Graffar's modified method, unstable incomes and failure to recognize the nutritional problem. In conclusion, the principle causes of abandonment were family limitations, carelessness and travels and/or moving. Recognition of a nutritional problem should be approached from the first encounter with the patient and his/her family. On the other hand, the level of education of the mother or legal guardian does not determine the recognition of malnutrition as a disease.","CANIA, Caracas, Venezuela",,"Velásquez, EN (通讯作者)，CANIA, Caracas, Venezuela.",enahr.cania@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

We use the results of a large survey conducted in 2009 in 33 European cities to analyse the likelihood of satisfaction with standard probit models. Results show that the highest levels of satisfaction correlate with the presence of a single LPT provider, as opposed to an industry structure in which multiple providers operate in the same market area.

In this study, we use a combination of content analysis and interviews to examine the use of emotional appeals, particularly guilt and fear, in food ads and how parents respond to them. We find that guilt is more frequently used in ads that target parents than has been shown for other audiences, and that parents often express negative self-images and coping strategies when viewing them.","[Stanton, Julie V.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Guion, Deirdre T.] N Carolina Cent Univ, Durham, NC USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of North Carolina; North Carolina Central University,"Stanton, JV (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jvs11@psu.edu; dguion@nccu.edu,,,,,,,46,11,13,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The way in which the argument is framed, however, obscures the nature of power in India and neglects altogether the significance of politics. Gupta's central argument that the injustice perpetrated by the state is the outcome of the arbitrariness of bureaucratic action fails to confront the abundant evidence of the significance of caste, class and gender privilege.

The authors employed the method of legal documents analysis in analyzing the IBF cases. The analysis highlighted four obstacles in adjudicating IBF in civil courts, namely; inadequacy of existing legal framework, complications of legal documentation, competency of civil court judges and expert evidence. It also analysed the four approaches adopted by the civil courts in deciding IBF cases; the 'parties to be bound by their agreement', the 'strict adherence to civil law', the 'justice and equitable' and the 'looking into the substance'.","[Markom, Ruzian; Pitchay, Sharina Ali; Zainol, Zinatul Ashiqin; Rahim, Anita Abdul; Merican, Rooshida Merican Abdul Rahim] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Law, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Markom, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Law, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",ruzian@ukm.my; epalhijau11@yahoo.com; shiqin@ukm.my; aar@ukm.my; rooshida@ukm.my,"zainol, zinatul/AAD-9144-2019; Zainol, Zinatul Ashiqin/AAG-6509-2020; Markom, Ruzian/B-6500-2016","Zainol, Zinatul Ashiqin/0000-0001-5671-7367; Markom, Ruzian/0000-0003-4014-5899",,,,,13,12,16,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This paper proposes a model called smooth transition mixed data sampling (STMIDAS) regression, which relaxes both of these assumptions. Simulation exercises indicate that the improvements in forecasting accuracy from the use of mixed data sampling are larger in nonlinear than in linear specifications. When forecasting output growth with financial variables in real time, statistically significant improvements over a linear regression are more likely to arise from forecasting with STMIDAS than with MIDAS regressions.

Research in experimental economics indicates that people are willing to pay to punish defectors. A complementary line of work in social psychology suggests that people think that it is right to punish wrongdoers. This work suggests that people are retributivists about punishment. However, all of the extant work contains an important potential confound. The target of the punishment is expected to be aware of the punitive act. Thus, it's possible that people punish because they want to communicate something to the wrongdoer, e.g. disapproval, the presence of a norm, etc. In three studies, we examine whether people will punish even when the punishee will be ignorant. We find that people are no less likely to punish when the punishee will be ignorant.

The issue of in-sourcing versus outsourcing has been accompanied by a concern about the geographical scope of the firm: whether the outsourcing of tasks and functions is close-at-hand or offshore. In this article, we begin with reference to Coase and the literature that has followed in his wake suggesting a crucial and unrecognized issue in his conceptualization is the problematic question of who has authority to make decisions (governance). We suggest a way of conceptualizing the tasks and functions of firms which rely upon firm-specific strategic assets including human capital, governance and decision-making procedures, and the information systems that underpin decision making. The objects of our analysis are financial institutions such as mutual funds, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and investment management companies. To the extent that the cost of services is important, these types of financial institutions have sought to discount costs by outsourcing, even off-shoring. At issue is the viable geographical reach of this type of institution noting the various ways contemporary institutions (small and large) have sought to deal with this issue. Our analysis is conceptual and theoretical rather than empirical and is based on a set of case studies and fieldwork and the implications to be drawn thereof.","[Clark, Gordon L.] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Clark, Gordon L.] Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Caulfield, Vic 3142, Australia; [Monk, Ashby H.

The method presented in this paper, which we refer to as the monotone preserving r(t)t method, stems from the work done in the field of shape preserving cubic Hermite interpolation, by authors such as Akima (1970), de Boor and Swartz (1977), and Fritsch and Carlson (1980).

The explanatory variables considered were price, pulp exports, and salvage timber. The latter variable was used as a proxy for forest fires. The problems related to spurious regression were addressed by applying the bounds testing approach to cointegration, and confidence intervals were constructed using the bootstrap technique. The results indicate that pulp exports have a positive effect on the harvested timber volume. Moreover, we find that salvage timber positively affects the timber supply. This result indicates that there is no substitution between salvage timber and non-damaged timber. It also suggests that the natural expansion of the eucalyptus in Galicia compensates for the destruction caused by forest fires, avoiding supply shortages. On the other hand, and according to the economic law of supply, the timber price shows a positive effect. (C) 2012 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the socio-economic institutions that have facilitated the rise of coastal tourism, and on the basis of this to gauge the scope for incremental change, or plasticity, within the prevailing development path. The paper can be seen as an explorative study of the micro-dynamics of path plasticity, adopting a case-study-based approach, exploring two coastal-rural destinations in North Jutland, Denmark. First a review of the literature on destination development and innovation is undertaken in order to identify key issues concerning continuity and change in tourism as a spatially embedded socio-economic activity. Then a conceptual framework for the analysis is outlined, inspired by traditions within institutionalism. Thirdly, the empirical analysis begins by identifying the key institutions supporting the rise of North Jutland as a successful international tourist destination in the 1980s and 1990s, and finally we discuss the extent to which scope for path plasticity can be found within this framework in the current climate of crisis, focusing especially on the role of combinatorial knowledge and policy agency. It is concluded that coastal tourism despite resemblances of an institutional 'iron triangle' actually is a more flexible structure which allows for a considerable degree of incremental change, provided that the actors involved are willing to engage in innovative development activities within the existing institutional framework.",,,,,,"Therkelsen, Anette/0000-0002-1183-5981; Halkier, Henrik/0000-0002-9810-9922",,,,,75,31,33,3,29,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Thus was born the Equator Principles to urge financial institutions to implement environmental responsibility, financial institutions' environmental responsibility has also been generally concerned about around the world. This article analyzes the theoretical basis and legal nature of the Equator Principles, the compact of the Equator Principles on financial institutions' environmental responsibility, the differences of China's current green credit and the Equator Principles from a legal point of view, proposing Chinese financial institutions' specific strategies to accept the constraints of the Equator Principles. The equator principles (The Equator Principles, referred to as EPs), by the International Finance Corporation and the Bank of Holland in 2002 held in London in October of the international commercial bank meeting proposed a business loan guidelines. From the Equator Principle Content perspective, it emphasizes the financial institutions lending review before a liability, the assessment of the proposed lending programs on environmental and social impact assessment of possible, to unqualified project loans. From the equator principles of nature, it is not the official general binding principles, but unofficial voluntary principle, in the international financial environment and social policy in the background, from the world's major financial institutions to develop, and used to assess the financing process may exist in the social and environmental risk. Corporate social responsibility is the equator principles emerge as the times require the most critical factor. Financial institutions is one of the main business loans, business or project to provide financing services, when project financing potential or substantive environmental risk and social issues, project financing activity results will give financial institutions cause tremendous negative impact. The government, the public and environmentalists would put the environmental risk and social problems of the blame for financial institutions to provide financing services prior to the audit is not strict, requiring financial institutions to assume more social responsibility, strengthen the financial services oversight, avoid risk and social problems. It is in this background, in 2002 October, project financing environment and social problem seminar is held in London, after drafting a set of project financing of environmental risk and social problems of the guide to action, namely the equator principles. In 2003 June, including Citigroup, Bank of Holland, Deutsche Bank, Barclays Bank, four initiated ten banks announced its acceptance of the equator principles. In 2006 July, the equator principles were first modification. The equator principles in the international society is one of the typical cases -practice Sakhalin No. 2 oil and gas projects. in today's society has produced important influence. Located in the Far East of Russia's Sahalim Sahalim on the island of 2 oil gas project is the world's largest integrated oil and gas projects, the project total construction including oil drilling platform, natural gas exploitation platform, oil refining factory, 800 kilometers of pipeline etc. The project triggered by environmental groups concerns mainly lies in the oil exploitation platform located in the one and only endangered whale predation from the sea of Okhotsk Sea near Sahalim, fear 2 project will damage the Western gray whale numbers. The local indigenous people also worry that Sahalim 2 will undermine the survival of their environment, particularly on fishery resources and the threat to the endangered wild animal habitat destruction. At the same time the laying of the pipeline through a plurality of seismic belt and the river, which also cause environmental concerns. So the project construction initial stage by non-governmental organizations to protest strongly, and the final resort to the law. In the face of pressure from all sides, the project had to be on the environmental impact review, commissioned by the world alliance of independent assessment of project environment influence on Western gray whale. Finally, environmentalists started pointing the finger of blame for the project to provide financing services of the bank, and the financing of the project including the bank JP Morgan Chase Bank, the European bank for reconstruction and development, the Bank of Holland, Credit Suisse, Mizuho Corporate Bank and several equator banks, environmentalists criticized the bank violates the equator principles provide loans for the project and financing services. The Russian government had to stop completed 80% of 2 Sahalim road project. Then, European bank announced that it would no longer provide financing for Sahalim 2 project, a number of the banks and financial institutions have also announced its withdrawal from the project. Because the Sahalim 2 oil and gas projects negative impact on the environment and the equator banks claimed the idea of environmental protection does not match, by environmental groups and the pressure of public opinion, many financial institutions to stop Sahalim 2 project financing. The equator principles although do not have the force of law, but as a kind of industry practices and the concept of environmental protection, to financial institutions and image of the impact is bigger, forcing financial institutions in making financing decisions, have to carefully consider the environmental risk.

Governments and legal bodies across the nations introduced counter-strategies to setback the rapid growth of this parallel industry. Yet these strategies failed to gain the desired results. Previous studies found political corruption and improper implementation of anti-counterfeiting strategies and laws main reasons for this failure. This study intends to examine the influence of word of mouth, ethical and legal sensitivities on consumers' attitudes toward the non-deceptive counterfeit mobile handsets in a South Asian context. In addition, this study aims to assess the direct impact of affordability, legal sensitivity, and easy availability on consumers' intentions to purchase the non-deceptive counterfeit mobile handsets. The results show that positive word of mouth about non-deceptive counterfeits and less sensitivity to ethics positively influence consumers' attitudes toward the non-deceptive counterfeit mobile handsets. Legal sensitivity does not affect consumers' attitudes toward the non-deceptive counterfeits. Affordability of the non-deceptive counterfeit mobile handsets has a profound impact on consumers' purchase intentions. Findings of this study are useful for legal authorities and multinational companies in developing result oriented anti-counterfeiting strategies in South Asian markets.","Iqra Univ, Dept Business Management, Islamabad, Pakistan",Iqra University,"Mir, IA (通讯作者)，Iqra Univ, Dept Business Management, 5 Khayaban e Johar,H-9, Islamabad, Pakistan.",mir_fuuast@yahoo.com,,,,,,,54,6,7,0,23,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

University education is a characteristic feature of the typical entrepreneurial profile. In analysing gender-related differences in perceptions of entrepreneurship, it is therefore important to focus on the university sector. The main objective of the present study was to compare the entrepreneurial intentions of university students and their evaluation of the figure of the entrepreneur, contrasting the perceptions of men and women (using students from the University of Cordoba, Spain as the case). A questionnaire was applied to a sample of 1,400 students in classes taken from a population of 15,660 students in the whole university. Statistical treatment will contrast this study with those carried out in diverse universities and countries. Over the next few years, it is foreseeable that women (at least those who attend university) are less likely than men to create businesses. Currently, only one in every five university women contemplates the possibility of starting a business.

There has not been extensive exploration of the possibility that an appropriate amount of overtime could have a positive impact. Based on the literature review, we show that working overtime can have a significantly positive impact on knowledge sharing among employees, but significant differences are reflected in the effect of knowledge sharing due to varying degrees of working overtime. Also, through the introduction of work stress and leisure participation as mediation and regulatory factors, working overtime can be shown to have remarkable influences on employees' knowledge sharing. It is confirmed that varying degrees of working overtime will produce different levels of work stress. Work stress indeed has a partially mediating effect on the relationship between working overtime and knowledge sharing, but the regulatory effect of leisure participation is not obvious. Finally, in the light of our research results, we recommend that similar topics be studied from the perspective of organisational culture.","Natl Kaohsiung Univ Hosp & Tourism, Grad Inst Hosp Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality & Tourism,"Wu, WC (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Hosp & Tourism, Grad Inst Hosp Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",wuchung@mail.nkuht.edu.tw,,,,,,,54,2,2,1,35,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

When migrant workers return home, the Indonesian government sets them apart from other travellers in order to protect the migrants from extortion in the airport environment, and assist them during their return to their home villages. We investigate how this separate passage results in a mobility regime that produces differences between regular travellers and migrant worker travellers, and between male and female migrant workers. We also examine how the mobility regime results in particular forms of control over and safety of migrant workers' mobility. In doing so, we argue that the politics of mobility not only can be studied at the scale of global circuits, or at nodes such as the workplace, but also in relation to the actual journeys that migrant workers make.","[Kloppenburg, Sanneke] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Peters, Peter] Maastricht Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Maastricht University,"Kloppenburg, S (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",S.Kloppenburg@uva.nl; P.Peters@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Kloppenburg, Sanneke/CAF-1811-2022","Kloppenburg, Sanneke/0000-0002-2209-3370",,,,,34,11,13,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Should they award damages that were rationally foreseeable at the ex ante stage (ex ante expected damages)? Or should they award damages at the ex post level, incorporating new information revealed after contracting (ex post actual damages)? In practice courts have varied between the two approaches, awarding damages equal to the lower, or the higher, of the two measures of damages. This article shows that ex ante expectation damages are more efficient than ex post actual damages through a simple model of costly litigation for contract breach, where there are either costs of verifying the breach victim's ex post damages, or general litigation costs such as attorneys' fees. Courts should award foreseeable flat damages, rather than seeking ex post accuracy and awarding actual damages, because actual damages lead to distortions in breach incentives once we take parties' litigation decisions as endogenous. With costly litigation, ex post expectation damages may cause over-performance or under-performance depending on whether the American or the English rule applies and on the size of the litigation cost. We find that regardless of the direction of the distortion, actual damages induce inefficiency. Ex ante damages are more efficient because of the insensitivity of parties' litigation decisions to their ex post private information under fixed damages. Our results are robust when accounting for renegotiation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Providing such an analysis contributes to gaining greater understanding of the persistence of relatively high union premiums in the for-hire sector following federal legislation promoting interstate competition. For-hire trucking still faced intrastate rate and entry regulation following interstate deregulation within this trucking sector. Hence, intrastate service could still generate rent to be shared with drivers. The passage of the Airport Improvement Act (AIA) of 1995 created a business environment that placed additional competitive pressure on rates by eliminating intrastate regulation.

Indeed, previous research indicates that incumbent political parties are held accountable for the state of the economy. In this article we investigate a 'hard case' for the assumptions of election forecasting models. Belgium is a multiparty system with perennial coalition governments. Furthermore, it has two completely segregated party systems (Dutch and French language). Since the prime minister during the period 1974-2011 has always been a Dutch language politician, French language voters could not even vote for the prime minister, so this cognitive shortcut to establishing political accountability is not available. The results of an analysis for the French speaking parties (1981-2010) show that retrospective economic voting occurs even in these conditions of opaque accountability, as election results respond to indicators with regard to GDP and unemployment levels. Party membership figures can be used to model the popularity function in election forecasting. (C) 2012 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The conventional economic response focuses on the potential to exercise market power, resulting in the economic harm known as deadweight loss. But this conventional view does a poor job of explaining the observed actions of regulators and the concerns of airport users. In this paper, I argue that the primary rationale for regulation of airports is not the minimisation of deadweight loss, but the protection and promotion of sunk complementary investments by airport users. This approach explains the key patterns of airport regulation that we observe in practice.","Australian Competit & Consumer Commiss, Regulatory Dev Branch, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",,"Biggar, D (通讯作者)，Australian Competit & Consumer Commiss, Regulatory Dev Branch, GPO Box 520, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",darryl.biggar@stanfordalumni.org,"Biggar, Darryl R/O-2473-2018",,,,,,42,12,15,0,10,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Drawing on path dependency theory this article argues that maternity policies in Ireland were locked in between 1951 and 2001 in the wake of the Mother and Child controversy, an infamous milestone which led policy to develop along a very specific path and institutionalised the medical model of childbirth which has since endured. During the subsequent fifty years, the size of maternity units increased as did rates of medical interventions. Numbers of women giving birth at home declined from over a third in 1950 to less than one per cent today. This locked in policy for over half a century until it was challenged at the next critical juncture in 2001 when the withdrawal of insurance from two maternity units in the North East of Ireland led to their sudden closure in a region which was the area of greatest population growth in Western Europe. This led to a major shift in the hard to move elephant of maternity provision with potential to change policy on a national level in Ireland.","Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Kennedy, P (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",Patricia.Kennedy@ucd.ie,,"Kennedy, Patricia/0000-0002-0333-8387",,,,,55,10,12,0,8,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Of these changes, the most notable was the shift away from public tariffs and publicly available contract rates to confidential rates using individually negotiated service contracts. The number of individual member service contracts has risen dramatically since OSRA went into effect in 1999. These statistics from reports of the European Commission support the argument that OSRA was able to instill more competition into the industry. However, the empirical evidence on the Act's success in improving the performance of the containerized liner industry serving the Trans-Atlantic trade route is not so compelling. This paper applies the theory of joint product to assess the impact of OSRA on the structure and competition of shipping market after 1999. Trans-Atlantic eastbound and westbound routes were regarded as joint products. A simple statistical equation is derived to reinterpret Smith's condition of joint product. Empirical results obtained confirm the competitive market structure of the Trans-Atlantic trade route. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that the fuel based carbon tax reduces CO2 emissions by 1.75-3.82%. The higher band of this reduction range depends on users considering only immediate costs when making trip decisions, and the presence of a strong substitution capacity between public and private transport. Carbon related vehicle registration tax (VRT) and motor (annual road) taxation, however, exhibit little impact on carbon emissions alone and principally support a shift in fleet structure toward diesel and more fuel efficient cars. Over the longer term this shift results in a mild increase in NOx and PM emissions. Overall the study finds that the fuel based carbon tax is better than VRT and motor tax in terms of tax revenue, carbon emission reductions and social welfare, but worse than the latter in terms of household utility and production costs. The greatest CO2 reductions are achieved through a combined policy package of fuel tax and VRT and motor tax changes. The combined impacts of VRT, motor tax and fuel tax on the reduction of CO2 emissions is estimated as 4.29% in 2030, and 4.58% if the elasticities of substitution are improved. The positive combined effects of these policies, in terms of social welfare, can be significantly improved by double-dividend effects, where policymakers replace labour taxes with these new environmental taxes.

Prior literature on contract remedies does not formally account for the nonbreaching party's option to not sue for damages upon breach, when her expected payoff from suing is negative, given the contractual terms and her private information about her post-breach loss. With this option incorporated into the analysis, we show that: First, courts should commit to awarding fixed damages, because awarding flexible damages based on ex post information will distort the incentives to breach. This result is not driven by the information-forcing effect of basing damages on ex ante expectations, a la Hadley vs. Baxendale, rather it is driven by the endogenous decision to litigate breach. Second, the option of acquiescing to the breach expands the breach set under specific performance, which can be more efficient than other remedies. Third, the efficiency advantage of ex ante expectation damages over ex post actual damages is further enhanced when we account for the possibility of renegotiation.","[Avraham, Ronen] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, Austin, TX 78705 USA; [Liu, Zhiyong] Indiana State Univ, Scott Coll Business, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Indiana State University,"Avraham, R (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, 727 E Dean Keeton St, Austin, TX 78705 USA.",ravraham@law.utexas.edu; John.Liu@indstate.edu,"Liu, Zhiyong/CAF-2366-2022","Liu, Zhiyong/0000-0001-6473-348X; Avraham, Ronen/0000-0003-4426-5652; Liu, Zhiyong/0000-0001-6800-1569",,,,,30,6,6,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

This article proposes several linear equations for estimating the parameters that relate changes in the unemployment rate to percentage changes in product, following Okun's original proposal. The equations are estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. For this period of study, evidence of an inverse relation between both variables is found, as the theory states; nevertheless, the coefficients are low, which could suggest that the dynamic of unemployment in Venezuela is determined by factors additional to output fluctuations.","LUZ Maracaibo, Maracaibo, Venezuela",,"Oliva, LEM (通讯作者)，LUZ Maracaibo, Maracaibo, Venezuela.",lmolerooliva@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,5,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

We use cluster analysis to identify three broad skill types-analytical, social intelligence and physical skills from 87 occupational skills. We examine how each skill contributes to regional wages and how they are related to regional size, using data from 1999 and 2008. We find that analytical and social intelligence skills have a significant positive effect on regional wages, while physical skills have a negative effect. Analytical skills are also somewhat more closely associated with regional wages than social intelligence skills, after controlling for education, industry, immigration and regional size. Furthermore, wage return to analytical and social intelligence skills has increased over time, and the return to physical skills has declined significantly. We also show that larger cities reward analytical and social intelligence skills to a higher degree, whereas smaller cities rely more on physical skills.","[Mellander, Charlotta] Jonkoping Int Business Sch Econ, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Ross, Adrienne] Inst Competitiveness & Prosper, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Florida, Richard; Stolarick, Kevin] Rotman Sch Management, Martin Prosper Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Mellander, C (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch Econ, Box 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",charlotta.mellander@ihh.hj.se,"Florida, Richard/AAD-7585-2020",,,,,,38,60,74,0,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Furthermore, due to the nature of advance contracting between creator and producer, the standard approach to use sales as a success measure can be misleading from the producer's perspective. This article presents a novel approach to empirically identify producer success by incorporating the standard terms of contract between creator and producer into a parsimonious model of information diffusion (word-of-mouth) about new products. The model is applied to weekly sales data for a representative sample of novels.

To accomplish this desideratum, the management of retailers will have to ensure that consumers enjoy a positive experience in the retail unit, that is, a minimal degree of satisfaction is achieved Regardless of the means used-good prices, excellent service or a rich and diverse assortment-the retail brand will have to make remarkable and ongoing efforts to cope with the customers' dynamic and fickle behaviour in order to create in their mind a positive image and gain their loyalty, for that matter. To help accomplish this desideratum, in addition to the above mentioned elements one may also resort to ambience/atmosphere or in-store management as well as communication. In order to become operational, these measures must be directed with high precision towards the target customers. The research conducted by the authors on about 2000 Romanian consumers reveals that while the in-store design and decoration has a major contribution to generating satisfaction with and loyalty toward the retail unit, communication rather exerts an indirect, negative impact on consumers.

The granting of suffrage to American women in 1919 is one of those events in which we seek answers. I focus here on the diversity of women's economic provisioning functions, arguing that, because of that diversity, the granting of suffrage had more political benefits to the men in power and less political risks. The social provisioning status-quo, which had been threatened by the feminist voices of the 19th century, must have seemed to be back under the control of the men in power.

I will also be insisting on the importance of ideology and the way it has evolved over time. This theoretical framework is then used to tell the story of the two countries. While France's historical and ideological backgrounds have forced it to adopt a universalist view and fight against communautarisme, the Dutch position was quite different as it does not deny the ethnic minorities cultural and religious freedom.

In international business, franchising has granted easy and fast access to entrepreneurs helping them to start their own business, with guidance from professionals. For a franchise system to be successful many aspects play a role. However, one fact stays the same: There will always be at least two parties involved. Even before the parties are legally bound, power relationships evolve and form the stage for short, medium or long-term agreement, which can or cannot be mutually benefitting. Emotions resulting from power distributions, pressure and possible may lead to unsatisfied business exits and can happen due to non-equilibrated partnerships. In most cases it is the franchisor that is in the position of giving out the rules. The spirit of individualism and creativity is held to a minimum, since franchising roots in a branded concept, nationally as well as internationally. In today's global world, cultural differences at the work place can be the source of many problems but also the key to success. The paper examines the power distribution, locus of control in the context of franchisee/franchisor relationships. Within this focus, the research looks at Hofstede's factors of cultural dimensions and hopes to find out patterns to enhance successful international expansions and improved franchise partnerships.","[Gaul, Christiane] Univ Appl Sci, FH Kufstein Tirol, A-6330 Kufstein, Austria",,,golfgaul@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,201,214,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100020,0

The obtained results do not unambiguously confirm that those countries in relatively good macroeconomic shape will experience less favourable dynamics, which in turn might imply a decrease in disparities within the zone. However, systematic conformance of member countries should be expected in terms of nominal values of basic macroeconomic categories and decreases in disparities in GDP p.c. levels, implying sigma convergence.

This environment should be of interest to researchers since the majority of perceived value studies have been implemented in developed economies, especially the U.S and even in these countries with an exception of U.S.A. only few researches have dealt with more complex models, with perceived value of banking services as a central concept. However, thus far, no such studies are yet implemented in former socialist economies of Europe. The study also extends extant research by incorporating reputation as an antecedent to perceived value and as an important resource of company competitive sustainable advantage. Content validity of the instrument was assessed by conducting interviews with experts in the field, and face validity was assessed by means of pre-tests with members of the target population (focus groups). In addition, viewpoints related to construct validity convergent validity, discriminant validity and nomological validity were assessed with exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). Data for empirical research is collected from 700 retail banking customers in Slovenia. A structural model with four reflective constructs is evaluated to test the hypothesized relationships. Results indicate the importance of perceived value as a mediating variable in the quality satisfaction relationship. However, our results show that reputation influences perceived value, only indirectly, via perceived service quality.","[Korda, Aleksandra Pisnik; Snoj, Boris] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Mkt, Maribor, Slovenia; [Zabkar, Vesna] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Ljubljana,"Korda, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Mkt, Maribor, Slovenia.",aleksandra.pisnik@uni-mb.si; boris.snoj@guest.arnes.si; vesna.zabkar@ef.uni-lj.si,"Zabkar, Vesna/H-7030-2018; Selinšek, Aleksandra/S-8808-2018","Zabkar, Vesna/0000-0002-9331-9090;",,,,,54,7,7,1,22,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Empirical studies of the role of ICT as one of the main determinants of productivity growth, for developing countries have produced disagreement. To help clear up the subject, this paper employs a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) through a dynamic panel data approach on the sample of 25 European developed and developing countries over the period of 2001-2010. The results indicate a positive and significant impact of ICT on labor productivity growth in developed and developing countries, but the terms of impact in developing countries rely on human capital, a contribution of a higher educational level, advanced research qualifications and development activity. Comparing to developed countries, the growth accounting approach indicate that developing countries have similar relative ICT contribution to labor productivity growth, but their average growth rate of labor productivity is 6.8 times higher.

This is 'uncomfortable knowledge'. The paper describes four implicit strategies which institutions use to keep uncomfortable knowledge at bay: denial, dismissal, diversion and displacement. It concludes by suggesting that 'clumsy' arrangements may need to be constructed to ensure that uncomfortable knowledge is not excluded from policy debates, especially when dealing with 'wicked problems' where the accepted version excludes knowledge that is crucial for making sense of and addressing the problem.","Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Oxford OX2 6PV, England",,"Rayner, S (通讯作者)，Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, 64 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6PV, England.",Steve.Rayner@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,"rayner, steve/0000-0001-6779-9345",,,,,39,261,284,2,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The DEA CCR multiple input-oriented model is applied in order to analyse the efficiency of the use of three inputs (capital stock, labour and energy consumption) in producing GDP as the output. In order to obtain the dynamics of data as to avoid the use of only a single year in calculating energy efficiency the extended DEA method - window analysis - is adopted. The empirical results confirm that the traditional one-factor energy efficiency indicator is too simplifying and could be misleading. The findings on total-factor energy efficiency scores reflect the possibility of substitution among factors in a medium run and changes in the composition of energy use. Projection values of inputs on efficiency frontier identify the amounts of relative inefficiency and, in that context, suggest improvements for all inefficient countries. The results reveal that all inefficient countries could improve their efficiency by reducing some of the inputs.","[Vlahinic-Dizdarevic, Nela; Segota, Alemka] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Vlahinic-Dizdarevic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipov 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",nela@efri.hr; alemka.segota@efri.hr,"Lenz, Nela Vlahinić/P-9560-2018","Lenz, Nela Vlahinić/0000-0002-2317-0446",,,,,25,20,20,0,14,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

This is approximately true in the very long run since the emissions from burning wood fuels are compensated by the uptake from new trees. But it is not true in the short- and the medium term due to a number of factors. This problem is analyzed in detail in this paper, where the net carbon (dioxide) effect of using wood residues in Sweden 1980-2100 is calculated. Two important implications of the program for using wood fuels are considered: (i) the decrease of carbon stored in logging residues due to a faster transformation to carbon dioxide and (ii) delayed growth of new forest generations when logging residues are removed from the forest and used as fuel. The effects of both these factors are calculated (and projected) for the period 1980-2100. The main result is that wood fuels (in the form of wood residues) emits about 60% of the carbon dioxide that would have been emitted if the corresponding amount of energy would, have been produced by oil. One policy implication of this is that emissions from wood fuels should not, as is now the practice, be ignored and by definition equaled to zero, in national and international statistics of green house gas emissions.

Using household surveys of giving and volunteering in the United States conducted from 1992 to 2001, which contain questions on whether the respondent was personally asked to give or volunteer, this paper investigates the factors associated with the probability of receiving a charitable solicitation and presents substantial evidence that race and gender differences play key roles in the selection of potential donors. In particular, males, blacks, and Hispanics are less likely to be solicited compared with females and whites. Using non-linear decomposition techniques, I find that differences in observable characteristics of individuals explain most of the racial gap in the probability of being solicited for charitable causes, but they fail to explain the gender gap in the probability of being asked to volunteer. Furthermore, these results are robust to alternative specifications. I also discuss related policy implications and argue that the economic impact of selecting potential donors based on gender and race can be considerable.","SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Yörük, BK (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, SUNY 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",byoruk@albany.edu,,,,,,,30,7,12,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

So far, public transport appears to be on the losing side in terms of market shares. The aim if this paper is to investigate if a different policy could result in higher public transport usage and improved social welfare. In order to achieve this, a model, explaining public transport usage, public transport supply and costs, is estimated. The model is then used in order to simulate the outcome of an alternative policy of social welfare maximization. It is found that the current policy of the Swedish transport is not efficient in terms of maximizing welfare. In 2011, public transport fares should have been lower in 20 of 21 counties and the supply of vehicle kilometres should have been higher in 17 of 21 counties. Implementing a welfare maximizing policy would have increased the number of trips per capita by 17.2% in 2011 and by an average of 6.7% for the period 1986-2011. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Today's heritage management looks not only at the monument itself, but at its spatial context. The Belvedere Memorandum in 1999 has played a key role in getting the heritage onto the spatial planning agenda. Linking heritage to the spatial challenges of cities and regions was also the primary goal of the Modernisation of Monuments Care' in 2009, resulting in a revision of the heritage preservation act. However, now that heritage values will be accounted for at the planning stage, spatial planning finds itself in disarray. Area and property development are at a standstill, there is less money, and more and more empty buildings. The heritage community will therefore need all its creativity to maintain the quality of heritage preservation and renewal.","Wageningen Univ, Environm Sci Grp, Dept Land Use Planning, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Janssen, J (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Environm Sci Grp, Dept Land Use Planning, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",joks.janssen@wur.nl,,,,,,,24,1,1,2,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In the early stages, the entrepreneur is better informed regarding the project, and when the project matures, the venture capitalist has an informational advantage over the entrepreneur. Within this framework, we examine how the venture capitalist's relative bargaining power affects cash flow rights and investment. When the bargaining advantage lies with the entrepreneur, the project may not be screened, and the venture capitalist may acquiesce to excessive initial investment but subsequently terminate the project. Increased venture capitalist bargaining power encourages project screening, attenuates the incentive to overinvest, and reduces the incidence of project termination subsequent to the initial investment. The payoff sensitivity of venture capitalist's financing contract also increases as his bargaining power improves.","[Koskinen, Yrjoe] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rebello, Michael J.] Univ Texas Dallas, Naveen Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Wang, Jun] CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, New York, NY 10010 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Koskinen, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",yrjo@wharton.upenn.edu; mrebello@utdallas.edu; Jun_Wang@baruch.cuny.edu,"Koskinen, Yrjo/J-6077-2017","Koskinen, Yrjo/0000-0001-5977-1801",,,,,41,8,12,3,47,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Based on the theory of planned behavior, we developed a web-based questionnaire for revealed preferences data collection. The survey was administered among young people in Copenhagen and Lisbon to explore the transit perceptions and use under different economic and transit provision conditions. The survey yielded 499 questionnaires, analyzed by means of structural equation models. Results show that higher perceived fairness relates positively to higher perceived quality of transit service and higher perceived ease of paying for transit use. Higher perceived spatial equity in service provision is associated with higher perceived service quality. Higher perceived service quality relates to higher perceived ease of payment, which links to higher frequency of transit use. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Demand is expressed as a function of operational and macroeconomic factors and is analyzed using a time-series cointegration and error correction approach. This allows for treating non-stationary data, for determining short and long term elasticities and at the same time estimating the speed of convergence from the short to the long run. As expected, short run elasticities appear lower than the long run ones, possibly because in the short run changes in explanatory factors are smaller and because behavior is governed by resistance to change.

It then discusses the particular issues which make rail appraisals complex, including the long life of assets, the complexity of the range of options available, the many dimensions of quality of service, network effects, externalities, the importance of the impacts on other modes and the issue of wider economic impacts. Finally it illustrates these issues with reference to the history of the appraisal of high speed rail in Britain, where key arguments have concerned the robustness of demand forecasts over such long time periods, the valuation of business time savings, the adequacy of the appraisal of alternatives and the extent of wider economic impacts.

Manufacturers bid on the right to be an agency's sole supplier by offering a rebate on formula sold through WIC. Agencies frequently join together in buyer alliances. An empirical estimation shows that bids are lower to alliances and that lower prices result because alliances are heterogeneous. Results suggest that when heterogeneity is not controlled, bids decline with alliance size, which has policy implications because Congress recently limited alliance size.","S Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA",South Dakota State University,"Davis, DE (通讯作者)，S Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, 120 Scobey Hall, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",David.davis@sdstate.edu,"Davis, David/K-7680-2015","Davis, David/0000-0003-2418-5356",,,,,29,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

However, TODs are not always as easy to implement at every location. In high-density city centres a TOD is relatively easy to implement, since density and diversity are already high and most residents have a positive stance toward car alternatives due to self-selection processes. In more low-density suburbs, however, the situation is more difficult. There is not only the problem of adapting the built environment, but also the problem that most initial residents have a preference for car use, since they chose their neighbourhood based on the physical characteristics of the initial neighbourhood. In this viewpoint we will look at how travel-related attitudes and residential self-selection can affect the success rate of TODs in three different situations. It seems that taking into account attitudes is especially important for the realization of TODs in low-density neighbourhoods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, in each country the actual law and the cultural biases of the population respond to the cost of legal diversity, the cost of the divergence between the actual law and both the culturally ideal law and the technological efficiency of regulation. We show that international legal convergence is possible without any coordination between countries. This happens when either there are no efficient legal rules, or when the technologically efficient rule is unique across countries. In that case, legal uniformity is realized in the long run.

Previous literature typically treats revenues and investments as homogeneous, but we add to the literature by differentiating between investment types and revenue sources. This is important because investment in talent leads to winning, which is a zero-sum game for the league and therefore owners have an incentive to limit talent investment. However, other investments, such as stadiums, are not a zero-sum game, and therefore the implications of revenue sharing are different for the league. We provide sufficient conditions under which it is more efficient to share media revenue compared to stadium revenue. We conclude by providing applications of this model.","[Salaga, Steven] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Hlth & Kinesiol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ostfield, Alan] Live Nation North Atlantic, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Winfree, Jason A.] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Salaga, S (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Hlth & Kinesiol, 4342 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",ssalaga@hlkn.tamu.edu; alanostfield@livenation.com; jwinfree@uidaho.edu,"Winfree, Jason/ABI-6664-2020","Salaga, Steven/0000-0002-7329-9256",,,,,32,10,10,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

We find that potential entrants are more innovative than incumbents in both process and product innovations, which supports the patent race model. Furthermore, we find that uncertainty plays a crucial role in hindering an incumbent's incentive for product innovation, but has little impact on the innovation activities of both incumbents and entrants with respect to process innovation. The results suggest that a higher uncertainty in product innovation can raise the incentive for incumbent firms to seek for cooperation with new entrants.","[Chun, Hyunbae] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea; [Mun, Sung-Bae] Kookmin Univ, Dept Commerce & Finance, Seoul 136702, South Korea",Sogang University; Kookmin University,"Mun, SB (通讯作者)，Kookmin Univ, Dept Commerce & Finance, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 136702, South Korea.",smun@kookmin.ac.kr,,,,,,,41,4,4,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Here we quantify the impact of aircraft landing and takeoff emissions on air quality and public health across the contiguous United States. While the approach of using a detailed chemistry-transport model is feasible for specific policy assessments, computational requirements preclude the assessment of a wide range of policy options, quantification of uncertainty, sensitivity studies, or a timely response to policy questions. We therefore develop two surrogate modeling approaches to enable rapid assessment of the impact of aviation emissions scenarios on public health. First, we adapt an existing linearized source-receptor matrix. Second, we perform 25 Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulations to populate the emissions scenario space using a design of experiments approach, from which a response surface model is developed and validated. Using a 2005 aircraft emissions inventory and the response surface model developed from CMAQ model simulations, coupled with census data and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration-response functions, we estimate that 210 deaths per year are attributable to aircraft emissions (90% confidence interval: 130-340), with total monetized value across mortality and morbidity of $1.4 billion per year in year 2000 U.S. dollars (90% confidence interval: $550 million-$2.8 billion). Finally, we demonstrate the application of the CMAQ-derived surrogate model in a policy context by assessing the health impacts of (i) a possible low sulfur fuel standard, and (ii) a NOx stringency regulatory intervention. Our findings demonstrate the viability of surrogate modeling approaches for health impact assessments in the aviation sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We find a large negative effect of unfavorable entry conditions on starting wages and a sizable negative long-run effect. Our preferred estimates imply a decrease in starting wages by about 0.9 % and a lifetime loss in wages of about 1.3 % for an increase in the initial local unemployment rate by one percentage point. We show that poor entry conditions are associated with lower quality of a worker's first employer and that the quality of workers' first employer explains as much as three-quarters of the observed long-run wage effects resulting from poor entry conditions. Moreover, wage effects are much more persistent for blue-collar workers because some of them appear to be permanently locked in into low-paying jobs/tasks.","[Brunner, Beatrice] ZHAW Zurich Univ Appl Sci, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland; [Kuhn, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Vocat Educ & Training, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland",Zurich University of Applied Sciences,"Kuhn, A (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Vocat Educ & Training, Kirchlindachstr 79, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland.",andreas.kuhn@econ.uzh.ch,,"Brunner, Beatrice/0000-0002-6010-5184",,,,,43,45,53,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Besides theory-based restrictions, the timeliness of data is an important issue. Since DSGE models are based on quarterly data, they suffer from the publication lag of quarterly national accounts. In this paper we present a framework for the short-term forecasting of GDP based on a medium-scale DSGE model for a small open economy within a currency area. We utilize the information available in monthly indicators based on the approach proposed by Giannone et al. (2009). Using Austrian data, we find that the forecasting performance of the DSGE model can be improved considerably by incorporating monthly indicators, while still maintaining the story-telling capability of the model.

When the quality of services depends on non-contractible efforts made by the operators during the execution of the contract, our results show that (1) the operators have higher incentives to make non-contractible efforts when there is no allotment, and that (2) allotment does not maximize the joint payoffs of the public and private parties (i.e. the total surplus), but mainly benefits public authorities representing the users of the service.","[de Brux, Julie] Univ Paris 01, IAE, F-75005 Paris, France; [Desrieux, Claudine] Univ Paris 02, ERMES, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75005 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Desrieux, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 02, ERMES, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75005 Paris, France.",julie.de-brux@univ-paris1.fr; claudine.desrieux@u-paris2.fr,"Desrieux, Claudine/HGT-8290-2022","Desrieux, Claudine/0000-0003-1272-0841",,,,,43,8,9,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

J,"Doornik, K",,,,"Doornik, Katherine",,,A rationale for mediation and its optimal use,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mediation; Litigation; Bargaining; Asymmetric information,INFORMATION; SETTLEMENT; LITIGATION; DISCOVERY,"We propose a novel explanation for how pre-trial mediation might increase the likelihood of settlement. The mediator verifies the plaintiff's private information about the court's judgement and communicates this to the defendant, without disclosing confidential details that would disadvantage the plaintiff in court. This increases the plaintiff's incentives to reveal information and increases settlement rates. We then compare total dispute resolution costs without mediation, with compulsory mediation, and with mediation on request by the plaintiff. If the cost of mediation can be allocated optimally among the parties, then compulsory mediation is never optimal, but prohibition may be. However, compulsory mediation can be optimal when the allocation of costs is fixed. A regime of mediation on the request of either party is an equally efficient alternative to compulsory mediation. In contrast, mediation by mutual consent can be less efficient than prohibited mediation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We show that asymmetric equilibria exist in which one insurer contracts one hospital whereas the other insurer contracts both hospitals, even if all players are equally efficient in their production. Asymmetric equilibria arise if hospitals are sufficiently differentiated. In these cases, total industry profits increase and consumer welfare decreases in comparison to the case in which both insurers have contracts with both hospitals.

The present paper aims at investigating whether, in the Italian context, this distinction characterizes the market both at the supply as well as at the demand level. Port regionalization has been encountered in many international situations such as the expansion phase of ports towards the hinterland with the creation of satellite structures closely connecting them. However, in many cases in Italy the birth of inland infrastructures for independent road-rail intermodality has been witnessed, albeit enjoying poor connections with ports. Investigation has been made into the capacity of Italian ports to compete in the Ro-Ro market through an evaluation model of the competitiveness of Italian ports specialized in Ro-Ro traffic, based on the principle components analysis (PCA) for determining a specific index. In order to assess the statistical significance of the variables considered for this index of competitiveness a linear regression has been carried out. A further opportunity for Italian terminals may be the possibility of carrying out intermodal sea-rail transport services directly within the port ambience and in particular Ro-Ro-Rail services or the transport of road-transported semi-trailers with Roll/ on Roll/ off ships directed at a later stage by rail from the ports for inland forwarding, and vice versa. In Italy this kind of opportunity has hardly ever been explored, if not completely ignored, whereas it might represent a significant market quota for north-south goods traffic, which is less and less frequently carried by rail and by intermodal road-rail transport.","[Forte, Ennio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Stat Sci, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Siviero, Lucio] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, I-95129 Catania, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Catania,"Forte, E (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Stat Sci, Via Cintia, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",forte@unina.it; lsiviero@unict.it,,"SIVIERO, Lucio/0000-0002-8832-7790",,,,,34,4,4,0,27,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

After GH, this theory has been enriched by the introduction of control considerations and investor protection issues.

In this essay, I discuss some new directions that the literature has taken since. As a central challenge, I identify the need to provide a formal theory of the firm in which managerial direction and bureaucratic decision-making play a key role. Merging a number of existing incomplete contracting models, I propose two approaches with very different contracting assumptions. As in transaction cost economics, a central element in those theories is the presence of a central office that directs and coordinates the actions of subordinates. More novel, I highlight the superior ability of nonintegrated firms to adapt to a changing environment.

As residual claimants on their properties' profits, franchisees have stronger incentives to monitor employees than managers in company-managed hotels. Exploiting this variation and using rich, longitudinal data on the hotel industry, we estimate differences in wages and human resource practices across company-managed and franchised hotels within chains as well as within individual hotels as they change organizational form.

The recent upsurge in web enabled and pervasive technologies offer the opportunity of a new route for dynamic information flow that captures the views, needs and experiences of the travelling public in a timely and direct fashion through social media text posts. To date there is little published research, however, on how to realize this opportunity for the sector by capturing and analysing the text data. This paper provides an overview of the different categories of social media, the characteristics of its content and how these characteristics are reflected in transport-related posts. The research described in this paper includes a formulation of the goals for harvesting transport-related information from social media, the hypotheses to be tested to demonstrate that such information can provide valuable input to transport policy development or delivery and the challenges this involves. A hierarchical approach for categorizing transport-related information harvested from social media is presented. An explanatory study was designed, based on the understanding of the nature of social media content, the goals in harvesting it for transport planning and management purposes and existing text mining techniques. An exploratory case study is used to illustrate the process based on Twitter posts associated with particular UK sporting fixtures (i.e. football matches). The results demonstrate both the volume and pertinence of the information obtained. Whilst text-mining techniques have been applied in a number of other sectors (notably entertainment, business and the political arena), the use of information in the transport sector has some unique features that stem from both day-to-day operational practices and the longer term decision making processes surrounding the transport system - hence the significance and novelty of the results reported here. Many challenges in refining the methodology and techniques remain for future research, however the outcomes presented here are of relevance to a wide range of stakeholders in the transport and text mining fields.

This paper brings a global perspective on short and long term links between employment growth, inflation and output growth using panel cointegration framework with non-stationary heterogeneous panel (119 countries over 1970-2010). The empirical results (on global and national level) strongly support the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between output growth, employment growth and inflation. A central finding is that possible trade-off effects between growth, employment and prices varies significantly among economies. Therefore, universal answers to questions Is inflation good for growth or Is there a trade-off between employment and growth are not straightforward for general macroeconomic theory. Each country must design own economic policy (targeting) taking into account the quantitative relationships between growth, employment and prices. This has important policy implications also for price setting policies, cost management, market strategy and risk management through productivity-demand disturbances effects on the business environment.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, Ctr Empir Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Skare, Marinko] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia",Brunel University; University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",guglielmo-maria.caporale@brunel.ac.uk; mskare@efpu.hr,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692",,,,,59,1,1,1,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

A major research program has been initiated by the World Bank aimed at mapping patterns of financial literacy in developed and developing economies. In this article, I explain the conceptual foundations of the literacy project, develop a critique of its testing procedures, and suggest that, at the limit, it is an impossible project. At every turn, standard tests of financial literacy dissolve into spatially and temporally specific phenomena that undercut the possibility of shared interpretations of notionally common problems. Nonetheless, the literacy mapping project is important for what it reveals about the geographic and sociodemographic patterns of financial knowledge. My research on financial decision making has been based, in part, on a concern for the nature and scope of financial knowledge and understanding in the context of risk and uncertainty. Thus, the trick is to anchor financial literacy programs in ways that are relevant to everyday life. These arguments are illustrated with reference to the relevant literature, published and unpublished research on financial literacy among German residents, and an innovative financial literacy program that is fine-tuned to people's circumstances.","[Clark, Gordon L.] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Clark, Gordon L.] Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Caulfield, Vic 3142, Australia",University of Oxford; Monash University,"Clark, GL (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Hinshelwood Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",gordon.clark@smithschool.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,102,20,25,1,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The need for a transition to more sustainable consumption and production patterns is undeniable and sustainable economic growth must be placed at the heart of future development for all citizens. The South African private sector is under enormous pressure to remain globally competitive while balancing the interests of society, the environment and its shareholders. It has been suggested that there are discrepancies between what companies say and what they actually do, as they are challenged to move from policy to action. This paper evaluates the extent to which the private sector in South Africa adheres to voluntary climate change mitigation mechanisms and identifies potential market barriers impeding the large-scale uptake of such mechanisms. The research findings suggest that the private sector in South Africa has adopted a take position, wait and see approach which places them in a position to take advantage of and influence the opportunities and risks associated with climate change without having a negative impact on the bottom line. The primary barrier to voluntary climate change action is the vagueness of local and international policy frameworks. The different rules and resultant uncertainty around local and international frameworks appear to impede consistent and meaningful action. Although this uncertainty does not prevent the private sector from taking voluntary action, it does appear to negatively affect the overall scale and type of climate change mitigation efforts. While companies are continually improving the quality of sustainability reporting and public disclosure, the challenge still lies in translating these strategies into daily operations and sustainable practice that goes beyond ad hoc mitigation actions.","[de Jongh, Derick; Moellmann, Carmen M.] Univ Pretoria, Albert Luthuli Ctr Responsible Leadership, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"de Jongh, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Albert Luthuli Ctr Responsible Leadership, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"de Jongh, Derick/0000-0002-7265-368X",,,,,40,4,4,1,21,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The collected data allows highly interesting conclusions, comparing innovative companies with non-innovative companies. The most distinctive hindrances for innovation in SMEs are identified and discussed.

Therefore, when forecasting economic development of a country, it is important to scrutinize and evaluate the direct and indirect influence of a transport system and its particular branches on social and economic sectors of a country or region. This article analyzes the methodological aspects of evaluating the social and economic influences of a passenger transport system. Passenger transport by railway is regarded not only as a business but also as a social function. In order to evaluate the relations of passenger transport by railway and the macroeconomic processes of a country or region, the macroeconomic social turnover indicators, that characterize the passenger transport activity, are chosen, the methods of economic statistical analysis are used. The interconnection of passenger railway transport's indicators and Lithuania's macroeconomic indicators are measured by calculation. The topic of interoperability installation in the Lithuanian railways is presented as well, and the benefits and costs of activities of the main stakeholders in railway transportation are projected.

The processes of the creation and further development of integral cultural space in Europe in the context of the enlargement of the European Union are defined as an especially important transformation. Some new non-traditional ideas and models of possible development in general, as well as of the cultural changes, are discussed. The main attention is given to the transition processes in the Central and Eastern Europe, as well as to the processes of integration of the society of the Central and Eastern European countries into the general European cultural space. It is shown that provision of equal rights could be defined as the highest priority in the process of creating the integral cultural space in Europe. It is shown that the special attention should be paid to the problems and priorities of the ecology of culture, especially-in the context of the contemporary processes of the European integration in general. The definition of the ecology of culture is described. The needs and priorities of the provision of equal rights and of the solutions of the problems of ecology of culture, especially in the Central and Eastern European countries, are characterized. These needs and priorities are identified in the context of the processes of creation and further development of integral cultural space in Europe, as well as considering to the main challenges for the further transition and modernization processes in the conditions of globalization, European integration and creation of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy. New theoretical concept oriented to the creation, development and further modernization of integral cultural space in Europe in the context of the enlargement of the European Union is described.

Results showed that: 1) economic factors affect the migration flow of teachers significantly; 2) the level of earnings is the key determinant of variations in the number of migrant teachers at the tertiary level in Europe, and 3) earnings and the effect of personal income tax determine the number of migrant teachers at the tertiary level in a country and 4) the unemployment also affects migrant teachers migration in the opposite way, i.e. the higher the unemployment, the lower the number of migrant teachers is.

Scenarios, as opposed to usual prediction methods, are focused on the identification of discontinuities in the development and help the organization cope with sudden changes and noticeably contribute to its survival. Contemporary methods of scenarios construction work on need to ensure flexibility of the strategic plan and get the firm ready for a quick reaction when set trigger points specifying the corresponding scenario come to pass. Processing of business environment information, known as Business Intelligence, becomes necessity. Based on the methodological platform, it describes in detail the stepwise process of scenario construction. The very process of scenario elaboration goes through six basic steps, Identification of risk factors and determination of their importance; Selection of key risks which, according to the company's opinion, fundamentally influence fulfilment of strategic goals; Formulation of basic scenarios and testing their consistency; Determination of probability of scenarios occurrence and Performing a gap analysis for the sake of determining the extent of strategic goals fulfilment. There are various types of scenarios which might be respected due to the development of entrepreneurial environment introduced and discussed. Respecting the indicated risk factors and their influence on key risks of the financial plan, the spread of scenarios is being drafted. It is typical of business practice to work with 3-4 scenarios. Besides determining the impact of a risk on the firm's performance (the rate of fulfilling set strategic goals), the probability assessment of each scenario is also necessary. Outputs from constructed scenarios are to be worked up into a particular strategic option, which may be used as a qualified base for the strategic decision-making process. The practical application shows how the methodology used raises flexibility in strategic planning of the firm.","[Vacik, Emil] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Fotr, Jiri; Spacek, Miroslav] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Soucek, Ivan] Inst Chem Technol, Fac Chem Engn, Dept Econ & Management Chem & Food Ind ICT Prague, CR-16628 Prague, Czech Republic","University of West Bohemia Pilsen; Prague University of Economics & Business; University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague","Vacík, E (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Plzen, Czech Republic.",vacik@kpm.zcu.cz; fotr@vse.cz; Miroslav.spacek@vse.cz; isoucek@email.cz,"Špaček, Miroslav/K-6516-2015; Vacik, Emil/O-5277-2015","Špaček, Miroslav/0000-0001-6042-3249; Fotr, Jiri/0000-0003-3698-7516; Vacik, Emil/0000-0002-8729-4894",,,,,31,6,7,1,34,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Therefore, in view of antitrust legislation regulation in the network economy of our country, we need in the context of transitional economic reality, to clear the goal of anti-monopoly law regulation goal and elaborate the corresponding institutional system, in order to provide effective system supply.","[Zheng, Jingfang] Minjiang Univ, Dept Law, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian, Peoples R China",Minjiang University,,jingfang531@163.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-154-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,260,264,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA7DK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337485500040,0

However, although it is assumed that internal and external sources of innovation have distinct relationships with firm capabilities, it is not clear how various innovation sources affect such capabilities, or how or to what extent such relationships affect product competitiveness. This paper examines the effect of diverse sources of innovation on a firm's technological innovation capabilities and the extent to which such capabilities mediate the improvement of product competitiveness. Based on a survey of 200 manufacturing firms in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta region, we identify internal departments as a major source of innovation for improving a range of firm capabilities. Acquiring disembodied technology improves learning, resource allocation and organizing capabilities, whereas acquiring embodied technology enhances learning and manufacturing capabilities. We use a hierarchical regression analysis to demonstrate that some sources of innovation, such as internal departments, can lead directly to superior product competitiveness, whereas innovations acquired through conferences and competitors contribute to competitiveness through the mediation effects of resource allocation, marketing and organizing capabilities.","[Lau, Antonio K.

Based upon a literature review, resources and activities (such as organizational slack, knowledge reconstruction, and exploration) were identified as contributing to reinforce the dynamic capabilities of firms. Data were obtained from survey results collected from 241 Korean SMEs. Empirical results show that knowledge reconstruction activities that discard existing and established technological assets influence dynamic capabilities; however, organizational slack exhibits no significant relationship with dynamic capabilities. Exploration activities such as building network, exploration of external information, and academic activities show a negative influence on dynamic capabilities.

However, a dense knowledge network increases technological capabilities only when an SME uses an exploitative technology strategy, and a thin knowledge network increases technological capabilities only when an SME uses an explorative technology strategy. (2) The effects of knowledge networks on two different technological capabilities - search and application - are different due to technology strategies. An SME's explorative technology strategy focuses on strengthening its technological search capability, and its exploitative technology strategy helps it to acquire a balanced development of the two technological capabilities.

Although several studies exist on the roles of intermediaries, most focus on developed countries. In developing countries, the extent of market and systemic failures is much greater. The role of intermediaries in mitigating these market and systemic failures may differ between developing and developed countries. This special issue aims to address this theoretical shortcoming by examining the roles and evolution of selected intermediaries in China and Thailand. Both countries are rapidly growing Asian economies and feature different types of intermediaries that perform different functions. The key findings of this study are as follows. Intermediaries play different roles at different stages of a firm's innovation processes and help to increase a firm's innovation performance by strengthening their organizational learning. These intermediaries require different capabilities to perform their roles effectively. Different industrial sectors require different types of intermediaries.

However, management and leadership, employee satisfaction, and employee loyalty also influence company growth and profit. This study applied a theoretical model and findings from related literature to investigate the constructs and observed indices for measuring operations performance in the highspeed railway (HSR) from the passenger perspective. Cause and effect relationships between constructs and operations performance were quantified, and structural equation modeling was used to verify the hypothetical relationships proposed in this study in order to identify constructs, to measure the effects of indices on the constructs, and to measure mediating and moderating effects between constructs. The analytical results showed that leadership and employee cognition have a greater influence on long-term profitability compared to service quality, customer recognition, and corporate image. Notably, employee cognition mediates the effect of leadership on service quality. Further, mediating and moderating effects of corporate image and customer recognition significantly affect operations performance. By using the confirmatory findings of this study as a policy making reference and for clarifying resource use, the HSR can enhance passenger perceptions. Improving the identified evaluation indicators can increase passenger loyalty and improve operating performance in the high-speed rail service. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated changes since deregulation in the spatial patterns of charter departure airports and traffic volume to major destinations. Furthermore, this study analyzed the effects of new entrant airlines on charter network evolution. For the purposes of this paper, charter supply data has been analyzed and case studies of a short-haul route from Japan to Korea, a medium-haul route to Pacific resorts, and a long-haul route to Europe have been conducted. The results suggest that deregulation has resulted in a concentration of charter departures at airports located in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and has had a variety of effects on charter traffic to major destinations. In particular, during the process of deregulation, the role of airlines has been shifted from carriers offering charter services under the requirement of tour operators to a market leader which controls the charter flows.

This is the case for many contractual relationships, but also for damages on capital markets which are usually calculated as the difference between share prices paid and share prices after the adverse information becomes public. In a model with errors in court, we show that tighter negligence standards may even reduce care levels chosen by potential injurers under reasonable circumstances.

This bargaining phase may either result from a choice of disputants to negotiate or be imposed by laws or legal contracts. The aim of this paper is to analyze the differences in terms of parties' bargaining behavior, depending upon the fact that bargaining has been imposed to them or comes from their own will. We conduct an experimental analysis and find out that, under some conditions, a procedure in which parties are forced to bargain leads to more agreements than when parties are free whether to do so.

In networked MNCs, the parent can still offer valuable knowledge to subsidiaries. The parent's and a subsidiary's knowledge becomes complementary if an MNC appropriately adopts a global strategy at the parent level and a regional strategy at the subsidiary level. An analysis of the world's largest firms in the Electrical Equipment industry shows that, in general, a global strategy improves the innovative performance of the MNC. Meanwhile, only the combination of a global strategy at the parent level and a regional strategy at the subsidiary level is positively associated with the innovative performance of the MNC. This study contributes to the literature on networked MNCs and the debate of globalization and regionalization.

Widespread car dependence also entrenches lifestyles that require unsustainable levels of energy use. Most transport policies explicitly include goals for public health and sustainability. Transport interventions can therefore be seen as complex public health programmes, and assessing their outcomes against health and sustainability goals is vital. Using organisational travel plans (OTPs) as an example, we demonstrate how best practice epidemiological systematic reviews can be used to assess the existing evidence to inform transport policy. Such a synthesis of the evidence for OTPs has not been undertaken previously. Methods: We undertook a rigorous systematic review in accordance with a peer reviewed protocol to assess the effects of OTPs on individual and population health. We defined OTPs as travel behaviour change programmes conducted in a workplace or education setting. We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials and controlled before and after studies, where the measured outcomes included change in travel mode or health. Results: 17 studies were included. One study directly measured health outcomes, and all studies measured change in travel mode. The overall methodological validity of studies was poor. The highest quality studies reported mixed effects on travel mode in the school setting. An isolated randomised controlled trial in a workplace suggests that reductions in car use are possible by people already contemplating or preparing for change to active travel. Conclusions: Despite widespread implementation, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of organisational travel plans for improving health or changing travel mode. Given the current lack of evidence, new OTP programmes should be implemented in the context of robustly-designed research studies, accounting for potential adverse effects such as child pedestrian injury. Cochrane systematic review methods used in partnerships between public health and transport planners can help achieve transport policy goals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead, we argue that ownership contains two facets-access and veto-that can be used specifically, and sometimes independently, to foster investment. Whereas prior studies in the literature have reported the effect of these mechanisms separately on incentives and welfare, we cast them within a single framework. Access is closer to efficiency than ownership when assets are complements at the margin; veto is sometimes closer to efficiency when assets are substitutes at the margin. Access increases the incentives of the beneficiary agent, whereas veto increases the incentives of the constrained agent. By defining control over an asset as access with no outside veto, we provide a rationale for the optimality of intriguing organizational structures, such as open access, hybrid organizations, outside ownership, joint ownership, partnerships, and employment contracts.

Permanent childlessness, in developed countries, can concern up to 30 % of the women in a cohort. Childlessness rates can be positively related to average fertility for some cohorts of women. This paper provides an explanation for this using an endogenous fertility model where individuals have different preferences for children. The main mechanism considered goes through the intergenerational evolution of preferences: I show that a reduction in the gender wage gap, or an increase in the fixed cost of becoming a parent, has a negative effect on both fertility and childlessness. The reduction of childlessness is due to a composition effect: small families shrink more than larger families, and this reduces childlessness.","Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Gobbi, PE (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Pl Montesquieu 3, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",paula.gobbi@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,42,24,33,2,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The findings indicate that perceived market uncertainty is influential in decentralizing management and in the proactive innovation of frontline employees. Consistent with management perception, employees consider resource commitment from hubs and environmental scanning to be effective practices to facilitate proactive innovation. Frontline employees do not strongly consider tolerance in task conflict as a means to achieve proactive innovation, whereas their managers regard it as a method to encourage the free expression of ideas.

First, we provide a broader theory of cluster connectivity that has hitherto focused on organization-based pipelines and MNE subsidiaries, by including linkages in the form of personal relationships. Second, we use the lens of social network theory to derive a number of testable propositions. We propose that global linkages with decentralized network structures have the highest potential for local spillovers. In the emerging economy context, our theory implies that clusters linked to the global economy by decentralized pipelines have potential for in-depth catch-up, focused in industry and technology scope. In contrast, clusters linked through decentralized personal relationships have potential for in-breadth catch-up over a range of related industries and technologies. We illustrate our theoretical propositions by contrasting two emerging economy case studies: Bollywood, the Indian filmed entertainment cluster in Mumbai and the Indian software cluster in Bangalore.","[Lorenzen, Mark] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Mudambi, Ram] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Copenhagen Business School; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Mudambi, R (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Alter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",ram.mudambi@temple.edu,"Mudambi, Ram/A-8580-2008; Mudambi, Ram/N-1145-2019","Mudambi, Ram/0000-0002-5396-5602",,,,,147,251,280,10,223,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Also in the Netherlands, social housing in deprived neighbourhoods is demolished and replaced by more expensive dwellings. The idea is that these new dwellings attract higher-income groups to urban restructuring neighbourhoods. At the same time, however large numbers of relatively expensive dwellings have been built on greenfield locations. This leads to a dilemma: will higher-income households choose housing in deprived neighbourhoods, while attractive new housing on greenfield locations is available? This study shows that urban restructuring attracts higher-income households to mixed tenure developments in deprived neighbourhoods, even when competing with greenfield development. Nevertheless, another process is also taking place: especially in urban regions with extensive greenfield development; there is a significant outflow of higher-income households from deprived neighbourhoods. The net result is an increasing concentration of low-income households in deprived neighbourhoods.","[Boschman, Sanne] Delft Univ Technol, OTB Res Inst, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Bolt, Gideon; Van Kempen, Ronald] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Boschman, Sanne; Van Dam, Frank] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Utrecht University,"Boschman, S (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, OTB Res Inst, POB 5030, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",s.e.boschman@tudelft.nl; G.Bolt@uu.nl; R.vanKempen@uu.nl; frank.vandam@pbl.nl,"Boschman, Sanne/JZE-3712-2024","Boschman, Sanne/0000-0002-2806-751X",,,,,19,8,9,1,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In this article, we assess the impact of this endorsement using, as measures of Winfrey's influence, subscriptions to her magazine and sales of books she recommends. We find that her endorsement increased Obama's votes and financial contributions, and also increased overall voter turnout. No connection is found between the measures of Oprah's influence and previous elections, nor with underlying political preferences.

The robust forecast is based on the median of the point VaR forecasts of a set of conditional volatility models. Such a risk management strategy is robust to the GFC in the sense that, while maintaining the same risk management strategy before, during and after a financial crisis, it will lead to comparatively low daily capital charges and violation penalties for the entire period. This paper presents evidence to support the claim that the median point forecast of VaR is generally GFC robust. We investigate the performance of a variety of single and combined VaR forecasts in terms of daily capital requirements and violation penalties under the Basel II Accord, as well as other criteria. In the empirical analysis we choose several major indexes, namely French CAC, German DAX, US Dow Jones, UK FTSE100, Hong Kong Hang Seng, Spanish Ibex 35, Japanese Nikkei, Swiss SMI and US S&P 500. The GARCH, EGARCH, GJR and RiskMetrics models as well as several other strategies, are used in the comparison. Backtesting is performed on each of these indexes using the Basel II Accord regulations for 200810 to examine the performance of the median strategy in terms of the number of violations and daily capital charges, among other criteria. The median is shown to be a profitable and safe strategy for risk management, both in calm and turbulent periods, as it provides a reasonable number of violations and daily capital charges. The median also performs well when both total losses and the asymmetric linear tick loss function are considered Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[McAleer, Michael; Perez-Amaral, Teodosio] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [McAleer, Michael; Jimenez-Martin, Juan-Angel; Perez-Amaral, Teodosio] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Kyoto University; Complutense University of Madrid,"Pérez-Amaral, T (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",teodosio@ccee.ucm.es,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; Pérez-Amaral, Teodosio/E-6773-2017; MARTIN, JUAN ANGEL JIMENEZ/H-7230-2015; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008","MARTIN, JUAN ANGEL JIMENEZ/0000-0001-5608-3288;",,,,,36,17,17,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

The analysis mobilizes the notions of territorial embeddedness and strategic localization to unpack how Samsung-Tesco has secured sustained growth through progressively deepening its connections with the host economy and society in different ways. In broader theoretical terms, the study provides rich illustration of transnational corporation post-entry dynamics in host retail markets, demonstrating that strategic localization is not a static phenomenon, but a dynamic set of processes that evolve through time and in relation to the changing competitive conditions in the host market concerned.","[Coe, Neil M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Lee, Yong-Sook] Korea Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Seoul 136701, South Korea",National University of Singapore; Korea University,"Coe, NM (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",geonmc@nus.edu.sg,"Coe, Neil/AAN-8902-2020","Coe, Neil/0000-0001-7720-5061",,,,,101,51,55,3,154,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Given that the capital markets underwent unusual vicissitudes in the period leading up to the passage of SOX, we subdivide the pre-SOX period into four sub-periods: (1) the pre-technology bubble (1992-1997); (2) the technology bubble (1998-3/2000); (3) the bubble collapse (4/2000-9/2001); and (4) the pre-SOX scandal period (10/2001-7/2002). We document that abnormal accruals moved from significantly positive to significantly negative during the period of the major corporate scandals immediately preceding SOX, and remained negative in the post-SOX period. However, abnormal accruals in the post-SOX period were significantly less negative than during the scandals. Thus, a reduction (increase) in abnormal accruals (earnings quality) seems to have occurred concomitantly with the scandals, not as a result of the passage of SOX. We also document that investors' awareness of earnings manipulation by sellers consistently grew after the bursting of the technology bubble, as reflected in an increase in the discount applied to transaction prices throughout the sub-periods. Hence, concomitantly with the decrease (increase) in the levels of abnormal accruals (earnings quality) occurring during the scandals, the discount to transaction price due to suspected earnings manipulation also increased. Furthermore, the higher discount applied after SOX, relative to that immediately prior to SOX, implies that investors do not rely on SOX to prevent management from manipulating their earnings prior to a sale transaction. We conclude that changes in earnings quality prior to M&A transactions cannot be attributed to SOX. Rather, other events such as the bursting of the technology bubble and revelations of major accounting scandals seem to have affected managers' propensity to manipulate earnings. It seems that market response has a greater effect on managers' behavior than government regulation.

The system design and organisational arrangements drew heavily on precedents from South America, especially insofar as BRT is used as an instrument for securing the transformation and formalisation of a fragmented and problematic informal public transport industry. Despite the inevitable transition problems, the formalisation scheme appears to be generally successful - an outcome that surprised many analysts as it follows a long history of mistrust, resistance, and unsuccessful interventions between government and the minibus taxi industry. The paper offers an analysis of the reasons for the successful transformation of participating taxi operators, by using a life-cycle analogy. We argue that the minibus-taxi industry in South Africa has reached a state of stasis and maturity, with limited opportunities for further growth in its present form. BRT, as it is implemented locally, offers opportunities for re-invention - for moving onto new a potential growth trajectory - by overcoming the binding constraints of informality and by opening up new markets to operators. The life-cycle analysis also offers some insights into critical success factors that, if not met in the long run, could jeopardise the longevity and scalability of the formalisation project. The paper concludes with insights regarding the planning and management of BRT systems to maximise their potential for leveraging the formalisation of informal operators, both in South Africa and in other developing countries.

Scholars have explored this phenomenon extensively, formulating and testing models of delegation and insulation. But existing models have conflicting and nuanced empirical implications. I contend that the general and coherent implications of delegation and insulation theories can be realized by focusing on the politics of particular issue areas and by reconsidering a recent formalization of Terry Moe's theory of policy insulation. I examine this argument empirically using augmented versions of prominent data sets on statutory delegation and agency design in the United States. The analysis yields results consistent with the proposition that issue-specific political uncertainty leads to policy insulation. The explanatory power of measures of issue-specific policy volatility and conflict (proxies for political uncertainty) rivals that of the interbranch conflict measures that existing research tends to emphasize.

This paper summarises the country's digital divides in the early twenty first century. First it notes major market and policy forces that have led to the growth in internet access. Second, it addresses the changing social and spatial patterns of internet access between 1995 and 2010. Although penetration rates grew among all socio-demographic categories, significant differences by age, income, ethnicity and educational level persist but not gender. Third, it points to the roles of public schools and libraries as mechanisms to alleviate the divide. Fourth, it examines differentials in broadband access as the most recent manifestation of internet inequality. Fifth, it comments on the mobile internet and urban hotspots. The conclusion points to public policy measures that could diminish discrepancies in access.","Univ Kansas, Dept Geog, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Warf, B (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Geog, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",bwarf@ku.edu,"Ozdemir, Yasal/P-7486-2014",,,,,,68,40,66,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The organizations are now more complex in terms of their structure and geographical dispersion. Daily, great amounts of information are produced and, to surpass these problems, organizations have invested in Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERP). The same trends can be detected within the public sector. The interest generated by the ERP phenomenon is growing and the particularities of the public sector make specific studies necessary. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to examine the adoption process of ERP systems by public and private organizations. Which ERP modules are mostly adopted? Which reasons legitimate ERP adoption? Using a survey research methodology, this study reveals that the need to increase the demand for real-time information, to obtain information for decision-making and the integration of applications appear as main reasons to implement an ERP system. Although the reasons given are the same for public and private organizations, the results of this study also show that the modules implemented are slightly different; the importance or dominance of each module may differ; and the deployment time is shorter in the public sector. Since comparative studies are relatively scarce, our work helps to reduce this knowledge gap.","[Alves, Maria do Ceu] Univ Beira Interior, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal; [Amaral Matos, Sergio Ivo] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior; Universidade do Minho,"Alves, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, Estr Sineiro, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal.",mceu@ubi.pt; serg.ivomatos@gmail.com,"Alves, Maria do Céu Gaspar/F-9759-2015","Alves, Maria do Céu Gaspar/0000-0003-1608-1872",,,,,48,6,15,0,37,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This paper examines adaptive management decision-making with stochastic dynamic programming under risk of timber price. Under the assumption of risk neutral preferences of the investors, the results suggest that the reservation price strategy remains optimal for the harvesting decision of agro-forests: when the timber price is higher than the reservation price, poplar trees should be harvested to end agro-forestry; otherwise, the trees should be retained.

The two different academic opinions on fortune or opportunity existing in the BOP markets are also contrasted. The research philosophy is based on realism and the research methodology selected is inductive. The data have been collected through secondary sources using case study strategy to present four cases of innovations by social or corporate enterprises at the BOP. The case studies have been chosen from a variable range in terms of BOP countries, social enterprises and multinational companies, for-profit or not-for-profit organisations, and product or business model innovations. Success criteria identified from case studies in the light of academic literature include going beyond selling to the poor, considering BOP groups as producers and BOP engagement. A conceptual framework has been developed from identified criteria and further recommendations for empirically testing the framework to turn it into a model have been provided.","[Pervez, Taimoor; Maritz, Alex; de Waal, Anton] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Enterprise, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology,"Maritz, A (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Enterprise, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",amaritz@swin.edu.au,"de Waal, Gerrit Anton/M-7422-2018","de Waal, Gerrit Anton/0000-0002-6884-1362; Maritz, Alex/0000-0003-2175-7734",,,,,35,29,34,0,119,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Agent-based simulations are used nowadays as an alternative to the traditional models, based on predetermined equilibrium state theory. Agent technology brings some kind of local intelligence and rational expectations to the decision support system of financial market participants. Agents follow technical and fundamental trading rules to determine their speculative investment positions. We consider direct interactions between speculators and they may decide to change their trading behaviour. If a technical trader meets a fundamental trader and they realize that fundamental trading has been more profitable than technical trading in recent past, the probability that the technical trader switches to the fundamental trading rules is relatively high. In particular the influence of transaction costs is studied in this paper. Transaction costs can be increased by the off-market regulation (for example in the form of taxes) on financial market stability, by overall volume of trade and other market characteristics. The paper shows a positive impact of suitable transaction costs on the financial market stability in the long run.","[Sperka, Roman; Spisak, Marek] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Informat, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Sperka, R (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Informat, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",sperka@opf.slu.cz; spisak@opf.slu.cz,"Sperka, Roman/D-8689-2015","Sperka, Roman/0000-0003-2371-6450",,,,,29,19,19,1,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In the project Re-reading time-geography from a feminist perspective, labour force mobility is an important way of analysing women's time-space use and identifying the constraints experienced when organising everyday life. We claim that time-geography provides a useful set of analytical tools that successfully collaborate with social science theory such as gender studies. Time-geography has been questioned by feminists as well as others. However, we argue that time-geography could provide gender studies with a close, empathic and micro-levelled interventional approach that makes obstacles and constraints due to spatio-temporal conditions visible and thereby changeable. In this paper we use results from previous research to prove that time-geography is an approach with several sets of useful concepts that describe and analyse women's everyday struggles and possibilities in an era in which mobility and transport have become undisputed factors of everyday life. In order to do this, time-geography needs to be read from a gendered standpoint. Although we are still in the formative stages of this re-reading of original texts and the formation of additional sets of concepts, the indications are that this work is worth pursuing and expanding.","[Scholten, Christina] Malmo Univ, Ctr Work Life Studies, Malmo, Sweden; [Friberg, Tora; Sanden, Annika] Linkoping Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Dept Studies Social Change & Culture, Dept Culture Studies, Linkoping, Sweden",Malmo University; Linkoping University,"Scholten, C (通讯作者)，Malmo Univ, Ctr Work Life Studies, Malmo, Sweden.",christina.scholten@mah.se; tora.friberg@liu.se; annika.sanden@liu.se,,,,,,,79,39,42,1,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Especially in rural villages, inhabitants fear for the closure of their local primary school, which is perceived as a very negative development for local village life. This paper shows that the relatively sharp decline of the number of pupils in the next decade can be explained by a wavelike pattern in the past and projected number of pupils, resulting from the baby bust of the 1960s and 1970s. The relative decrease in pupils will almost be as strong in future depopulating (Anticipeer) regions as in present day declining (Topkrimp) regions. However, municipalities in the Topkrimp regions have many smaller primary schools which implies that they will have to deal with school mergers and closures in the near future.

The General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994 exempted manufacturers of small aircraft from product liability claims when their aircraft reached 18 years of age. We use the exemption at age 18 to estimate the impact of tort liability on accidents as well as on a wide variety of behaviors and safety investments by pilots and owners. The results are consistent with moral hazard. When an aircraft is exempted from tort liability, the probability that the aircraft will be involved in an accident declines.

We employ two popular methods, proposed by Hansen (1999) and So and Shin (1999). Our Monte Carlo simulations show that these methods do not necessarily achieve better forecasting performances than the bias-uncorrected least squares (LS) method, because bias correction increases the variance of the estimator. Both the bias and the relative variance tend to decrease as the sample size (T) increases, meaning that larger numbers of observations do not always imply gains from bias-correction. As the degree of persistence increases, the bias becomes greater while the relative variance becomes smaller, which implies a greater gain from correcting for bias for highly persistent data.

Conventional models do not incorporate parameters that explicitly take into account the size of the population, or, equivalently, the size of the potential market. As a consequence, the models often fail to provide accurate forecasts, especially when the diffusion process is in the take-off stage. Furthermore, since diffusion is not a strictly deterministic process, forecasts should provide a measure of the underlying uncertainty of the process by incorporating a stochastic process into the formulation of the models. The aim of the present work is to fill this gap by proposing an aggregate diffusion model, the population diffusion model (PDM), which incorporates the potentially varying market size as a function of the corresponding population. This model realization provides more accurate estimations and future forecasts of the diffusion process, especially when compared to the conventional aggregate diffusion models.

This has resulted in the development of many polycentric urban regions, which consist of historic core centres, other historic centres as well as new urban centres (NUCs). Focusing on NUCs in Dutch city regions, this paper presents the results of a research project analysing the number and spatial structure of NUCs, examines their functional composition and explains the different types of centres that exist. The paper also analyses the level of centrality of the NUCs. The main finding is that functional composition is related to the type of area in which NUCs are built: district centres, villages, new towns, transition areas or university areas. With a character that is much narrower than that of core centres, the NUCs house a lower diversity of functions, fewer facilities serving an area larger than central districts, and a limited number of public transport modes.","Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Van der Heijde, P (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",pvdh@stedplan.nl,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Our analysis shows that routes that benefit from price discounts that were granted by the government to island residents enjoy higher demand than the rest of the country's domestic routes. However, the lower elasticity of demand of these routes allows airlines to set higher prices. We also find that airlines that operate inter-island routes on which their services are regulated by price caps and frequency floors charge lower prices and schedule higher flight frequencies than is the case on unregulated routes. Overall, our analysis suggests that price discounts for island residents help guarantee the profitability of routes that are regulated by public service obligations.","[Calzada, Joan; Fageda, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Calzada, Joan; Fageda, Xavier] IREA GiM, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Fageda, X (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",calzada@ub.edu; xfageda@ub.edu,"Calzada, Joan/R-8242-2018; Fageda, Xavier/F-6635-2018","Calzada, Joan/0000-0002-2976-1677; Fageda, Xavier/0000-0001-8526-8169",,,,,36,36,38,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Within this framework we show that patent settlements between the incumbent firms can be mutually beneficial even when the cost of trial is zero and the settlement agreement takes the form of a simple fixed license fee. For patents of intermediate strength, settlements are a tool for entry deterrence. The two parties agree on a high settlement amount which sends a credible signal to outsiders that the patent is not weak and therefore entry will not be profitable. This provides a novel explanation for the role of settlements and to the recent observation of high license fees negotiated in settlement agreements. It suggests that firms should disclose the settlement amount if they want to keep out further entrants. We also show that even nonreverse settlements that entail only a fixed fee can be anticompetitive because they are used to block entry.","[Duchene, Anne; Serfes, Konstantinos] Drexel Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Bennett S LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Duchêne, A (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Bennett S LeBow Coll Business, Matheson Hall,32nd & Market Str, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ad493@drexel.edu; ks346@drexel.edu,,,,,,,22,6,6,1,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Because Cheonggyecheon street is an important link and major arterial connector of Central Seoul and the Eastern part of Seoul, many people thought that changes made to this major road would result in congestion problems. We performed this study to analyze the impacts of the reduction in vehicular capacity of a major street in a large city on commuters' travel patterns and behavior. We monitored traffic volume and travel speed to determine the impacts of the reductions using travel behavior surveys and by analyzing modal shift changes. We performed both short-term monitoring after the restoration work and then continued monitoring over a period of several years to determine the long-term impacts of the restoration project. Whereas travel speed declined and traffic volume increased immediately after the construction work, the number of subway passengers increased and the number of road trips decreased simultaneously. This implies that travelers change their behavior patterns and are self-compliant, even in response to major travel disturbances. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The research is documentary and non-experimental. For epistemological support, various texts of Machiavelli, Foucault and articles from diverse journals were used that approach the theme under study and focus on power in its various configurations and dimensions. These range from political power, conceived by Machiavelli from the strictly political angle, to Foucault, who generalizes the concept of power and goes beyond the simple use of state apparatus as a mechanism for repression, authority and power or for the heavy hand of princes, kings and tyrants, to study what he calls power meshes, their molecular homes. The main conclusion is that the Foucaultian barracks scheme is found in hospitals, convents, asylums, prisons and schools, which Foucault rightly calls the spatial fit for hierarchized surveillance. In favor of Machiavelli, the study affirms without any doubt, that he was the forerunner of modem political science.","[Avila-Fuenmayor, Francisco] Univ Rafael Belloso Chacin URBE, Maracaibo, Venezuela; [Avila Montano, Claudia] Hosp Pons, Maracaibo, Venezuela",,"Avila-Fuenmayor, F (通讯作者)，Univ Rafael Belloso Chacin URBE, Maracaibo, Venezuela.",favilaf@msn.com; cuibella@hotmail.com,,,,,,,18,2,2,2,11,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Our results show that these forecasting approaches consistently deliver sizable reductions in mean squared forecast error (MSFE) relative to an autoregressive (AR) benchmark model across the 50 US states. On the basis of forecast encompassing test results, we also consider amalgamating these approaches and find that this strategy yields additional forecasting improvements. These improvements are particularly evident during national business-cycle recessions, where the amalgamation approach outperforms the AR benchmark for nearly all states and leads to a 40% reduction in MSFE on average across states relative to the AR benchmark.

Some agents are sophisticated they know they will make inconsistent intertemporal choices while other agents are naive. The consequent public policy problem is complex. The state should facilitate consumer borrowing to help agents' smooth consumption and cushion the effect of shocks, but should also facilitate precommitment, to help agents control excessive present-biased preferences. We show that in many simple settings, naive and sophisticated agents make similar consumption/savings choices, which simplifies the policy problem. We also show that all agents borrow when they experience consumption shocks and that agents with relatively strong present-biased preferences who face relatively mild consumption shocks will borrow to finance excessive current consumption. Other agents save appropriately. Legal constraints that severely restrict agents' access to credit thus would be over-inclusive. Offering agents access to both a liquid and an illiquid savings vehicle appears to be welfare improving relative to either allowing agents complete freedom to borrow or strongly restricting their access to the credit market. Creating and regulating such vehicles are public goods that the market will not supply.

Returns to both education and work experience declined considerably in the earlier period, while the increase in lower earnings relative to the median was associated with the introduction of the minimum wage in 2000, anchoring the bottom of the distribution subsequently.

Because an agreeable second opinion serves as a signaling mechanism, when such opinions are credible, policies mandating the use of experts are unnecessary as managers will choose to seek out second opinions on their own. Mandates can be counterproductive, however, if they unduly elevate the status of costly second opinions that always agree with management recommendations. In the absence of incentives for truthful disclosure of information to experts, it is better for boards to forego efforts to and require management and experts to present their recommendations as one.

Traditionally, the health care system in the United States has been dominated by general NFP (NFP) voluntary hospitals. With the number of for-profit general hospitals, physician-owned specialty hospitals, and ambulatory surgical centers increasing, a question arises: Why is the general NFP community hospital the dominant model? In order to address this question, this paper reexamines the history of the hospital industry.

Do firms react by adjusting their business models incrementally, through iterative steps? Or do such innovations lead, instead, to a big bang of new innovative business models that are all adopted and experimented with by the industry? To answer these questions, we analyze the impact of digitization-a radical innovation-on business models in the recorded music industry. Using an economic analysis of the effects of digitization, we begin by building five potential digital business models for the music industry. Then, using data from a survey on a sample of French record companies, we map these record labels on our digital business models. Our analysis suggests that digitization has led to a big bang of business models in the music industry, rather than to incremental adjustments of the existing business model.","[Bourreau, Marc; Gensollen, Michel] Telecom ParisTech, Dept Econ & Social Sci, F-75013 Paris, France; [Moreau, Francois] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, ICI, F-29269 Brest, France",IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale,"Bourreau, M (通讯作者)，Telecom ParisTech, Dept Econ & Social Sci, 46 Rue Barrault, F-75013 Paris, France.",marc.bourreau@telecom-paristech.fr,"yongquan, hu/G-7450-2011","Bourreau, Marc/0000-0003-3913-3014; Moreau, Francois/0000-0002-5818-5680",,,,,33,36,41,3,129,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Estimating a multistate duration model that addresses the endogeneity of age at first birth, we find a catch-up effect in countries where the career effect is large and a postponement effect in countries where the opportunity cost of childbearing is relatively high due to the lack of family friendly institutions and cultural influences, which may discourage late childbearing.","[Tatsiramos, Konstantinos] Inst Study Labor IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Bratti, Massimiliano] Univ Milan, DEAS, I-20122 Milan, Italy",IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Milan,"Tatsiramos, K (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",massimiliano.bratti@unimi.it; tatsiramos@iza.org,"; Bratti, Massimiliano/J-6811-2012","Tatsiramos, Konstantinos/0000-0003-0220-9644; Bratti, Massimiliano/0000-0002-4565-6260",,,,,42,27,27,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Derivatives trading not only make banks easier to diversify their credit risk exposure, but also alter their lending behaviors. As an example of large banks, when banks derivatives' trading is more than US$61 billion, an increase in banks assets will associate with a corresponding increase in loans to SMEs. If trading in derivatives by the banks is less than the threshold value, the banks will make loans less available to SMEs when there is an increase in banks assets. In addition, when banks are less aggressive in derivatives trading, debt ratio, pre-tax earnings and the SME credit guarantee balance all have significantly positive associations with loans to SMEs.","[Chiou, Jer-Shiou; Huang, Bor-Yi; Wu, Pei-Shan; Tsai, Chun-Ni] Ching Yun Univ, Shih Chien Univ, Taipei 104, Taiwan",Shih Chien University; Chien Hsin University of Science & Technology,"Chiou, JS (通讯作者)，Ching Yun Univ, Shih Chien Univ, 70 Ta Chih St, Taipei 104, Taiwan.",jschiou@mail.usc.edu.tw; hby-1688@mail.usc.edu.tw; pasun@cyu.edu.tw; chunhsin2003@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,23,2,2,1,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Volunteer leaders are responsible, accountable for the performance of a nonprofit-organization, they represent legally their organization. The role of a voluntary board is crucial to the success of a nonprofit-organization and therefore a lot of considerations are to take in: terms of board members, frequency and organization of board meetings, size and composition of the voluntary board, education of board members, the representation of stakeholders: A stakeholder is any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives. Stakeholders could be: members, customers, volunteers, employees, board, interest groups or the government. The question is which stakeholders are to be considered as important for the nonprofit-organization. Speckbacher specifies the presented definition and provides an answer to this question: A stakeholder of an organization is a party, a group that contributes specific resources that create value for the organization. Consequently there are at least two groups of stakeholders: primary and ordinary stakeholders. Nonprofit-organizations have founders but no owners. Legally they are juridical persons but the important difference to for-profit organizations is that they have no owners as natural or legal person who could be entitled to a part of the organization's profit. Stakeholders play an important role for these organizations. They replace the missing owner. And it is the board members who should be representatives of different stakeholders of the organization. Nonprofit-organizations face the challenge of being multiple-stakeholder organizations. Stakeholders judge the organization's effectiveness, i.e. performance on their point of view. The contribution of this paper is to answer the question how a board can fulfill its leadership role as governing body having members representing different stakeholders.","[Eller, Helene] Univ Latvia, Austrian Alpine Club, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",,,helene.eller@alpenverein.at,,,,,,,40,0,0,1,7,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,148,158,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100015,0

Results showed that the dropouts' families have some clear characteristics: they are numerous, monoparental and exhibit low educational levels and significant economic problems. Conclusions are that the low socioeconomic level and the existence of certain problems within the families translate into poor school performance and little parental support for their children, factors that can lead to dropout.","[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Espinoza, O (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",oespinoza@academia.cl; dcastillo@academia.cl; lgonzalez@cinda.cl; jloyola@ucinf.cl,,,,,,,32,6,9,0,16,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Most media houses air several channels, some of which are particularly valuable to advertisers. At first glance,one might expect the ad volumes to be highest for the channels that are the advertisers' favorites. However, a crucial management challenge for media houses is to ensure that viewers go where the potential for raising advertising revenue is greatest. Because viewers dislike ads, we show that this implies that advertising volumes will be relatively low (and advertising prices relatively high) in such channels. Indeed, other things equal, the ad volume in a channel is inversely related to its attractiveness to the advertising market. Only if the costs of using alternative tools to attract viewers to the advertisers' favorite channels are sufficiently small will the advertising volume in channels with high demand for ads be larger than in channels with low demand for ads.","[Foros, Oystein; Schjelderup, Guttorm] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Finance & Management Sci, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Kind, Hans Jarle] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Foros, O (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Finance & Management, Hellevn 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",oystein.foros@nhh.no,,,,,,,24,4,4,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0899-7764,,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

In the last three decades, international development agencies have argued that Latin American land reform policy should focus not on redistributing land but on creating more information about land and making it as widely accessible as possible. These proposals, which I call 'cadastral fixes' to rural underdevelopment, are understandably attractive and seem to fit well with democratic values of transparency and openness. But I argue that the use of the word 'information' to connote both democratic rights and the apparatuses devised by economists to improve the rural economy is misleading. 'Information' is productively vague, allowing development experts to change their projects in the face of failure without questioning the fundamental economic premises on which their reforms are built. As I show in this case study of Paraguayan cadastral reform, the history of these refinements shows a shift, under the rubric of open information, towards increasingly disciplinary forms of intervention in the politics of land.","Dalhousie Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Anthropol, Halifax, NS B3H 4P9, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Hetherington, K (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Anthropol, Halifax, NS B3H 4P9, Canada.",Kregg.Hetherington@Dal.ca,,,,,,,58,22,28,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The internal communication process directly influences the building of mutual relations between the company (management) and its employees. Unfortunately, the importance of internal communication is not sufficiently understood in managerial practice. Management is not aware of the most important function of effective internal communication, which is essential for knowledge management, reengineering and prosperity of the company. Without effective internal communication, the company does not take full advantage of its resources. Effective internal communication improves the work environment climate while increasing awareness among employees of company activity and plans. Management gets to hear suggestions about the company's plans and policies from its employees through effective feedback mechanisms. Thus the company is able to use fully the accumulated experience of all its employees. Effective internal communication enhances the role of the managers and gives more positive attitude to change within the company. It also allows opportunities to solve problems before they become crises. It creates and sustains employee commitment and concentrates effort on the task on hand while achieving the company's objectives. This chapter brings an overview of internal communication. It clarifies the internal communication within the context of personal, marketing and other areas of the company control process. It describes the synergy that can be created by proper utilization of managers' abilities and skills, and the use of information and communication technology tools.

This article aims to unpack the African-specific FDI issues in order to get a clearer and more substantiated understanding of the current trends, dynamics and challenges, with emphasis on the period since 2000. The research concludes that nominal flows to the continent are on the increase, with exponential increases over the past decade. The descriptive analysis indicates that flows to the continent are unevenly spread and are concentrated in the largest economies and/or in petroleum-/oil-exporting countries. The impact of FDI on growth and investment in particularly smaller economies indicates that FDI inflows are making a substantial contribution to these economies and illustrates the importance of this source of investment. The econometric analysis reveals that oil exporters and the size of the economy are powerful explanatory variables in explaining FDI flows to Africa, with trade openness a positive, but less powerful variable.","[Loots, Elsabe] North West Univ, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Kabundi, Alain] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; University of Johannesburg,"Loots, E (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",,,"Loots, Elsabe/0000-0003-4518-1688",,,,,21,5,7,0,13,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

For a potential solution to the resulting calibration problem we use respondent-reported driving costs and the stated cost of travel time, measured by willingness to pay to reduce travel time, to represent the individual trip price. On-site data from a hiking area in Finland are used. After considering visitors' perceptions of driving cost and travel time, models with individual driving costs and stated cost of travel time are compared to standard specifications based on a uniform rate of driving cost and wage-based time cost. The use of respondent-reported driving costs appears to be a working approach for calibrating the benefit measures. The stated cost of time was logically related to visitor and trip characteristics and had plausible effects on benefit estimates.

The object of this paper is Latvia's banking sector. The purpose of this research is to analyse how to maintain the benefits brought by globalisation at the same time as we are avoiding from the crisis as a last one. To achieve the purpose the following tasks were conducted: 1. Identifying the main benefits and challenges of banking sector development in the changing environment; 2. Analysing Latvia's banking sector as a part of global financial system; 3. Analysing the main preconditions of sector financial stability; 4. On the basis of the author's findings to put forward offers, how Latvia's banking sector can to benefit in the changing environment. Chapter 1 explores the key benefits of banking sector globalisation. Chapter 2 analyses the main challenges of banking sector development in the changing environment. Finally, in Chapter 3 the author looks for solutions how Latvia's banking sector can to benefit from changes brought by globalisation at the same time avoiding from the crises as the last one, by analysing capital and regulation as a most important components of financial stability. The results underline the need to recognise that markets need rules, constraints and careful monitoring so that banking failures are less frequent and less costly. And that the rules, constraints and monitoring exercises need a macroprudential approach.

Nature of insurance capital decides it pursues the match between assest and liability, especially the match between in yields and durations. Insurance capital has the characteristic of long term, large scale, high stability, high security requirements, low demand of yields. Affordable housing has public nature, and it is a long term, large demand, produce effective slowly. It is a policy project which belongs to the state investment, so the risk is low.

This article reviews the debate on possible causes, which are of two types: (1) the higher mortgage rates reflect higher funding costs, and (2) softer competition has allowed higher price-cost margins for mortgage providers. Detailed margin calculations based on an established cost formula reveal that, while funding costs have risen substantially since the financial crisis, they do not fully explain the high mortgage rates relative to very low base rates. Instead, there have been competition concerns in Dutch mortgage banking since the financial crisis, particularly a high market concentration of established banks, exit of several foreign challengers, a remarkable restriction of competition through price-leadership bans imposed by the European Commission on three of the four largest mortgage providers, and funding capacity constraints that in part have resulted from tightened banking regulation. We conclude that, while several of the developments discussed combined to create market conditions rife for margin increases through coordination, the European Commission's price leadership bans appear to have acted as a nucleus for the crystallization of high mortgage rates in the spring of 2009.","[Dijkstra, Mark A.; Randag, Fleur; Schinkel, Maarten Pieter] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Dijkstra, Mark A.; Schinkel, Maarten Pieter] Amsterdam Ctr Law & Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Dijkstra, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.a.dijkstra@uva.nl; fleur_randag@hotmail.com; m.p.schinkel@uva.nl,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The Dutch housing market is characterized by a very large social housing sector, as well as a relatively large share of owner-occupied housing. The private rental sector is underdeveloped. As a result, Dutch residents buy their first house at a relatively young age, with low personal savings and a mortgage loan that has a high loan-to-value ratio. Banks in The Netherlands rely heavily on international capital markets for funding, and the financial crisis has had a strong impact on funding costs. In our view, the increase in funding costs is the main cause of the increase in mortgage interest rates and the exit of several foreign lenders after the start of the financial crisis. We also discuss the investigation into mortgage interest rates that was carried out by the Netherlands Competition Authority.","[Treur, Leontine; Boonstra, Wim] Rabobank Nederland, Econ Res Dept, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Boonstra, Wim] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Treur, L (通讯作者)，Rabobank Nederland, Econ Res Dept, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",l.treur@rn.rabobank.nl; w.w.boonstra@rn.rabobank.nl,,,,,,,0,2,2,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Initially limited to Great Britain outside London (1986), a watered down version was implemented in Sweden in 2012, while the 2013 German public transport law allows increasing the role of 'commercial' market initiative. Long-distance coach markets was already based on deregulated regimes in Britain, Norway, Sweden and various Central and Eastern European countries, while Germany deregulated this market in 2013 and Italy soon opens up its market as well. Finally, open access competition on the tracks exists in Germany, Sweden, Austria, Italy and the Czech republic, with spectacular results in at least Italy, while the European Commission is pushing for more. This paper reviews these developments, while comparing some of the regulatory features implemented. It confirms a movement away from dogmatism in some countries but it also finds that insufficient attention is being paid to developing adequate regulation for the functioning of market initiative regimes (the 'rules of the game'), especially concerning the issue of fare integration, hampering the potential success of the reforms.

We extend our analysis to include AT&T, the other exceptionally large firm with defensive-disclosure activity, and show that their patenting propensity declined under increased antitrust enforcement relative to other firms in the industry. Overall, we show how these firms used defensive disclosure as a strategy to balance the benefits of patenting with the costs of uncertain antitrust enforcement.

The long-term impacts of moving people closer to transit require the coupling of behavioral forecasting with environmental assessment. Using new light rail and bus rapid transit in Los Angeles, California as a case study, a life-cycle environmental and economic assessment is developed to assess the potential range of impacts resulting from mixed-use infill development. An integrated transportation and land use life-cycle assessment framework is developed to estimate energy consumption, air emissions, and economic (public, developer, and user) costs. Residential and commercial buildings, automobile travel, and transit operation changes are included and a 60-year forecast is developed that compares transit-oriented growth against growth in areas without close access to high-capacity transit service. The results show that commercial developments create the greatest potential for impact reductions followed by residential commute shifts to transit, both of which may be effected by access to high-capacity transit, reduced parking requirements, and developer incentives. Greenhouse gas emission reductions up to 470 Gg CO2-equivalents per year can be achieved with potential costs savings for TOD users. The potential for respiratory impacts (PM-m-equivalents) and smog formation can be reduced by 28-35%. The shift from business-as-usual growth to transit-oriented development can decrease user costs by $3100 per household per year over the building lifetime, despite higher rental costs within the mixed-use development.

This paper uses recent data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) to evaluate how the pension system has performed for the current retiree cohort. The levels and compositions of retirees' incomes, supplementary pension coverage and retirement income replacement rates are examined and compared against Irish government targets. The determinants of supplementary pension coverage and retirement income replacement rates are also examined in a multivariate framework. Flat-rated State welfare pensions imply a high degree of progressivity in the Irish pension system: retirement income replacement rates are inversely related to pre-retirement earnings, particularly for former private sector employees. Supplementary pensions add an earnings-related component which insulates post-retirement incomes of middle-and high-earners to some degree.","[Nivakoski, Sanna] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Nivakoski, S (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland.",nivakoss@tcd.ie,,,,,,,2,7,9,0,18,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We analyze the central prohibitions of the act and explore their competitive implications.

When the firm bears litigation costs, this benchmark creates a feedback effect that exacerbates the price reaction to news that contradicts managers' earlier reports. Litigation insurance provides value in this setting by reducing the need for investors to price the effects of anticipated litigation. Insurance also affects how changes in the litigation environment impact the firm, with some changes having opposite effects on the frequency of lawsuits against uninsured and insured firms. The pricing behavior of rational investors eliminates the valuation impact of the portion of settlements paid to the investors, similar to dividends. The valuation impact of litigation arises from transaction costs, such as attorney fees, which the firm can mitigate by constraining misreporting and by purchasing insurance.","Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Caskey, J (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, 1 Univ Stn,B6400, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",judson.caskey@mccombs.utexas.edu,"Caskey, Judson/AAX-1105-2021","Caskey, Judson/0000-0001-6257-4868",,,,,64,12,13,2,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In relation to the reasons of institutional default, the paper cast light on three broadly interrelating elements: First, the conceptual issue that the EU has been operating as a community without democracy, which was clearly illustrated in the case of the economic crisis (Sect. 2.1). Second, the structural issue that EU democracy, where applicable, was deprived of politics, in the sense that founding ideology has been completely superseded by the inflexible dominance of free market (Sect. 2.2). And, third, the technical issue that EU politics, where applicable, especially after the Euro-zone launching, lacked principles that could keep the community intact (Sect. 2.3). In relation to the implications of economic default, the paper reveals three salient features. First, the political impact, namely that Europe seems to be puzzled by a sharp division between stability/cohesion and growth/monetarism, which mutates the essential mainstays of a Community (Sect. 3.1). Second, the social impact, i.e. increase of discrepancies within the EU, mostly as a result of diminution of labour rights and the correlating destruction of cohesion (Sect. 3.2). And, third, the psychological impact, which revolves around two antithetical poles, namely stereotyping and nationalism (Sect. 3.3). The epilogue reflects the view that the current depression is both a disaster and an opportunity for Europe, therefore the old messianic deal of the European integration needs an afresh look within the frame of democratic legitimacy and accountability and with an essential preservation of social state.","Univ Athens, Sch Law, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Gerapetritis, G (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Sch Law, Athens, Greece.",gerapetritis@ag-law.gr,,,,,,,53,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

As neighbourhood business owners have both individual and professional local stakes, they may take responsibility for a place and its immediate surroundings. Using a dataset of 895 residents and 385 entrepreneurs nested within 161 residential neighbourhoods, we show that local business owners are more willing to intervene in disorderly situations than unemployed residents. The findings suggest that this is caused by them having both higher expectations about intervention by others and greater belief in their own problem-solving capabilities. We speculate that although entrepreneurs only report higher willingness than unemployed residents but not employed residents, their presence may nevertheless influence neighbourhood order because they spend much time locally and thus have many opportunities to turn their willingness into action on behalf of the neighbourhood.","[Steenbeek, Wouter] Netherlands Inst Study Crime & Law Enforcement NS, NL-1008 BH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schutjens, Veronique] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Schutjens, Veronique] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Utrecht University; University of Amsterdam,"Steenbeek, W (通讯作者)，Netherlands Inst Study Crime & Law Enforcement NS, POB 71304, NL-1008 BH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",wsteenbeek@nscr.nl; v.a.j.m.schutjens@uu.nl,,"Steenbeek, Wouter/0000-0003-0529-3175",,,,,35,4,5,1,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

These include promoting competition, ensuring affordable energy prices and security of supply, as well as contributing to the European environmental and climate goals. Although the legislator has high expectations of energy consumers, empirical research into their behavior has shown that, in practice, they fulfill their role as drivers of competition only partially, if at all. There are also indications that energy consumers do little to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and make hardly if any use of existing opportunities to save energy. This article analyzes what insights from behavioral economics can mean for the legislator's assumptions on the role of energy consumers, as well as for shaping and regulating the energy sector. It also examines the implications of these insights for the practices of energy supervisory authorities entrusted with applying the European energy directives. The possibilities and limitations of the use of behavioral economics' insights in the regulation of the energy sector will be reflected upon.","Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Lavrijssen, SACM (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.a.c.m.lavrijssen@uva.nl,,,,,,,110,8,8,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

This is primarily attributed to the slump in the global economy. The fortunes of the container shipping sector (and hence ports) coincide almost directly with global trade developments. Empirical studies aiming to interpret the relationship of container ports throughput, macro economic and, shipping developments remain quite limited. The present study builds on the well-established theory of business cycle synchronicity, which takes into account the macroeconomic co-movements of the contemporary globalized economic environment. This study strives to generate knowledge on the extent that major macroeconomic (such as GDP, industrial production, bilateral trade and financial openness) and shipping (fleet development and transportation cost) variables, affect container ports throughput. In addition the study employs a panel data analysis and uses dynamic Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) techniques to reach meaningful conclusions.

The determinants of entrepreneurship, nevertheless, are not entirely understood. A recent literature has linked entrepreneurship to the development of the justice system. This paper contributes to this literature by evaluating the role of access to justice in determining the incidence of entrepreneurship. We explore the creation of special civil tribunals in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo during the 1990s. Special civil tribunals increased the geographic presence of the justice system, simplified judicial procedures, and increased the speed of adjudication of disputes. Using census data and an instrumental variables strategy, we find that implementation of special civil tribunals led to increased entrepreneurship among individuals with higher levels of education.

However, increased cycling can mean more collisions, injuries and even fatalities. This paper discusses the role of safety in cycling policy in the particular case of Ireland, which is one of the countries that has a government-endorsed policy to increase cycling. It examines available information on cycling, including police-reported accident data over the last fifteen years and more recent hospital accident data. Comparisons are made for injuries between the two sources and data matching and capture-recapture methods used to estimate injuries. The deficiencies in data are analysed and suggestions for improvements made. It is argued that gaps in available data have led to accident risks being poorly understood.

The seeming discordance between Fama and French (1998) and Griffin (2002) regarding the multi-factor model in the international stock markets motivates us to study the international relationship among local factors. With the individual stock data from the six major developed countries in the international stock market, we compose daily returns to the Fama-French three factors (i.e. market, size, and value) and the momentum factor over the period from January 2000 to June 2010. We investigate the international linkages among local stock market factors, focusing on their equilibrium relationship in the integrated world financial market. The cointegration analysis indicates that local factor indices, constructed from the cumulative factor returns, are cointegrated for each of the four factor classes. Thus, we conclude that local factors are globally bound to each other through a long-run equilibrium relationship and that although stock market factors may be local, rather than global, individual stock returns are driven by common global stochastic trends.","Ewha Womans Univ, Ewha Sch Business, Fac Finance, Seoul 120750, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Choi, HS (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Ewha Sch Business, Fac Finance, Ewhaweodae Gil 52,Ewha Shinsaegyae Bldg 505, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",hyungsuk.choi@ewha.ac.kr,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,8,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Capability theorists have argued that their theories do not have much of these paternalist implications, since promoting capabilities will be the rule, promoting functionings the exception. This paper critically surveys that claim. From a close investigation of Nussbaum's statements about these exceptions, it derives a framework of five categories of functionings promotion that are more or less unavoidable in a capability theory. It argues that some of these categories may have an expansionary dynamic; they may give rise to widespread functionings promotion, which would defeat the capabilitarian promise that paternalist interventions will be exceptions to the rule of a focus on capabilities. Finally, the paper discusses three further theoretical issues that will be decisive in holding this paternalist tendency in check: how high one sets threshold levels of capability protection, how lengthy one's list of basic capabilities is, and how one deals with individual responsibility for choices resulting in a loss of one's capabilities.","Univ Utrecht, Dept Philosophy, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Claassen, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Philosophy, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",R.J.G.Claassen@uu.nl,,,,,,,31,24,27,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

We employ new methodology that identifies new key topics in biotech on the basis of frequent use of title worlds in major biotech journals as an indication of new cognitive developments within this scientific field. Our analyses show that biotech is subject to a path- and place-dependent process of knowledge production. We observed a high degree of re-occurrences of similar key topics in biotech in consecutive years. Furthermore, slow growth cities in biotech are characterized by topics that are less technologically related to other topics, while high growth cities in biotech contribute to topics that are more related to the entire set of existing topics. Slow growth and stable growth cities in biotech introduced more new topics, while fast growth cities in biotech introduced more promising topics. Slow growth cities also showed low levels of research collaboration, as compared with stable and high growth cities.","[Heimeriks, Gaston] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst, Dept Innovat Studies, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Boschma, Ron] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Lund University; Utrecht University,"Heimeriks, G (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst, Dept Innovat Studies, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",gheimeriks@gmail.com,"Heimeriks, Gaston/G-1057-2012","Heimeriks, Gaston/0000-0002-0577-6938",,,,,69,53,65,5,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We address this question by exploring the effect of increases in fiscal capacity on the establishment of well-enforced, formal, legal standards in a preindustrial economy. Between 1550 and 1700, there were over 2,000 witch trials in France. Prosecuting a witch required local judges to significantly deviate from formal rules of evidence. Hence, we exploit the significant variation across time and space in witch trials and fiscal capacity across French regions between 1550 and 1700 to show that increases in fiscal capacity were associated with increased adherence to the formal rule of law. As fiscal capacity increased, local judges increasingly upheld de jure rules, and the frequency of witch trials declined. Prolonged witch hunting is as good a barometer as any for measuring weakness in a state.

Retailers/Distributors satisfaction is the buzzword of late 1990s, keeping in mind the importance of service as a major marketing tool, the decisions resulting retailers/distributors enjoying a healthy share in any company's strategic decisions. Such decisions retrieve further importance because of non-predictability and uncertainty in working environment. In this paper researchers propose a model based on American Customer Satisfaction Index, ACSI, to evaluate the satisfaction level of Retailers/Distributors. Data has been collected from 3 Distributors and 180 Retailers working with Nestle India Limited. One of the most important concepts of marketing is satisfaction and for the past few decades has been attracting interests for retailers as well. The model proposed for Nestle Retailer Satisfaction Index viewed as a cause and model based on process, retailer service and information and measured by multiple dimensions. This study utilizes the data for 180 retailers only which makes it difficult to generalize the results on the bigger level. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to cover more retailers' further. Retailers need to be well informed about various products/services and they should be guided well in advance about the new launches so that they can pass out this information to customers. Retailer satisfaction index highlights certain areas for managers to work upon. Managerial implications in implementing activities and certain schemes like sales promotion, gifts, exchange offers may provide good future prospects. (c) 2014 The Authors.

This crisis has caused fluctuations in the markets across all industries, triggering uncertainty in nearly every businessperson in the Czech Republic. By their nature, tourist services are non-essential products, used by customers to satisfy their needs only Thus, in those times of uncertainty, customers tend to cut down on these services to a certain minimum level. This fact manifested itseff during the crisis in 2007-2012. The article presents the impact of the global crisis on the tourism industry, in particular, on accommodation providers in the Olomouc region. The aim of the article was to explore the impact of this crisis on management of group accommodation facilities. The introductory chapter discusses the theoretical aspect of the economic crisis and its relations with company management, as well as the impact of the crisis on provision of accommodation services in the reference period across the nation. Following this, hypotheses are established, to be subsequently assessed by means of the primary research run as the questionnaire poll in the Olomouc region. The article focuses essentially on a change of managers in accommodation facilities, other measures taken by managers during the crisis, and the consequences of these measures.","[Antonova, Barbora; Zapletalova, Sarka] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Management & Business, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Antonová, B (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Management & Business, Opava, Czech Republic.",antonova@opf.slu.cz; zapletalova@opf.slu.cz,,"Zapletalova, Sarka/0000-0003-0589-3867",,,,,19,5,5,0,20,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Two methods of aggregation, which are equal and value weighted, are considered. A Monte Carlo simulation is carried out with different settings to investigate possible source of changes that could affect the number of regimes in aggregate time series. The results show that the number of regimes in aggregate time series is a function of individual time series, regardless of the aggregation method. For example, if aggregate time series has two individual series (e.g., one series has two regimes, while another time series has three regimes), the number of regimes in aggregate time series would be two.

The CAPM is one the underlying building blocks of Modern Portfolio Theory and as such is constructed on a number of strong theoretical assumptions concerning the behaviour of financial markets and of investors. In consequence, this model establishes a linear relationship of risky assets returns excess of the riskless rate to market portfolio returns excess of the riskless rate. Its conclusions are weighty and its functional relationship can be deemed as restrictive. On many a ground, the CAPM is thus challenged from the perspective of both a theorist and a practitioner.

Operational accuracy (but not metaphysical accuracy!) focuses on how a statement fits an explicit or implicit standard set by participants involved in a shared project. While truth can remain a thin semantic property of propositions, operational accuracy, as a quality of an outcome of inquiry and typically attached to a statement, a model, a diagram or a representation is an evaluation based on the non-epistemic goals set by the goal of inquiry (which every inquiry has), and a substantial evaluative notion. The goals, often made explicit by relevant questions in a context of inquiry, act as a filter, with truths a reliable epistemic method has access to functioning as input, and accurate representations as its output.

The regression was calculated in clustered data, where the discrepancy between expressed expectations of industrial firms and their immediate acting through the new orders in manufacturing is taken as a criterion to detect the lying or true statistic periods.

Emerging research is beginning to explore the structural and demographic explanations for these trends. However little research explains how attitudes may be shaping the decisions young people make about cars and driving. Popular hypotheses are the (i) changing social status of the car, (ii) role of electronic communications and (iii) environmental awareness, but little academic research has directly explored these issues. This paper uses innovative online research tools to explore these issues with young people. Three discussion forums were run with participants from across the state of Victoria, Australia. 33 People aged 17-23 contributed across the course of one week's discussion. Discussions suggest that among young Australians the car itself may not be a symbol of status and luxury, but instead a symbol of adulthood and maturity. Electronic communications were seen as a supplement to face-to-face contact, not a replacement for car travel. Not one person in the sample spontaneously mentioned that environmental concerns shaped their travel choices; even when prompted these concerns were far removed from travel decisions. The paper follows with a commentary on the use of discussion forums for qualitative research. It closes with a discussion of the new hypotheses that these findings generate and uncovers many areas for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors will conduct the study of the literature on the innovation of economies and enterprises. They will refer to a number of indicators and rankings to assess the innovation level of Polish economy and compare it with other EU Member States. Furthermore, the innovation level of Polish enterprises will also be subject to discussion and analysis. Having in mind globalization processes and consolidation of European market, special emphasis will be placed on actions taken by entrepreneurs to establish cooperation with other entities. The authors will also discuss a correlation between economy innovation and the innovation of enterprises operating in this economy. Theoretical discussion presented in the article allows to conclude that despite a substantial increase in the majority of indicators under analysis, Poland still belongs to the group of countries referred to as modest innovators. The main reason behind such a state of affairs is that innovation output indicators for Poland are below the EU average. Furthermore, it will be proven that the low innovation level of Polish economy translates directly into the low innovation level of Polish enterprises.","[Duda, Joanna] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, PL-30067 Krakow, Poland; [Gasior, Aleksandra] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ Management, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",AGH University of Krakow; University of Szczecin,"Duda, J (通讯作者)，AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, Str Gramatyka 10, PL-30067 Krakow, Poland.",aduda@zarz.agh.edu.pl; olag@wneiz.pl,"Gąsior, Aleksandra/HTQ-3948-2023","Gąsior, Aleksandra/0000-0003-3959-6094",,,,,38,4,4,1,9,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The authors argue that family controlling shareholders (or family owners) do not share common interests with other shareholders. Drawing on 141 family firms in the manufacturing sector that were listed on Bursa Malaysia (the Malaysian stock exchange) from 2003 to 2006, the article finds an inverted U-shaped relationship between excess control rights and a firm's market performance. The findings also show that both the cash flow rights (i. e. claims on cash payouts) of family controlling shareholders and the presence of non-dominant large shareholders with the ability to contest control of the firm have a positive relationship with market performance. This study contributes to the literature by indicating that family owners are unlikely to collude with other large shareholders to expropriate minority shareholders. Furthermore, low levels of excess family-owner control rights are beneficial for market performance because firms may benefit from group affiliations and receive patronage from wealthy owners. However, high levels of excess control rights are understood to be an economic incentive for family owners to expropriate minority shareholders during non-crisis periods.","[Goh, Chin Fei; Rasli, Amran; Khan, Saif-Ur-Rehman] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Johor Baharu, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Goh, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Johor Baharu, Malaysia.",,"Goh, Chin Fei/J-1193-2016","Goh, Chin Fei/0000-0003-3193-7122",,,,,52,2,2,1,27,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This research explored a set of woody biomass harvesting combinations of different sources and wood types using a cost minimizing linear programming model populated with disaggregated regional inventory, yield, and cost data, and projected future conventional wood demand of the United States. The model pre-satisfied conventional wood demand before harvesting roundwood as woody biomass. Findings suggest that collecting forest residue and non-merchantable (small sized) timber may provide the largest initial contribution in woody biomass supply. Regional estimations imply that not all regions have the capacity to develop bioenergy plants without using merchantable (medium sized) wood. Within a reasonable range of harvesting costs, demand for roundwood is expected to increase with higher energy production targets. Harvesting merchantable natural softwood as woody biomass has a relatively small impact on marginal supply costs. This will result in little or no disturbance to merchantable natural softwood timber management and operations if demand for woody biomass increased.

We find support for a structural level break at the end of WW2 and that non-stationarity can be rejected. We show that this is a robust conclusion.

In particular, they will impact tree growth, which in turn affects reproduction and mortality and consequently, forest planning. This study integrates different climate change scenarios of future biogeochemical processes and an economic model into a forest management model to determine the optimal selective-logging regime of Scots pine stands. It analyzes the economic implications of the management changes in comparison with the business as usual strategy. Adaption to new climatic conditions shows that it is optimal to increase the number of standing trees and to reduce the age of the logged trees. The results suggest that the failure to adapt the management regime has clear implications on the profitability of forests. Moreover, they show that higher mortality is likely to have a significant impact on the optimal forest management regime.

This paper aims to investigate the association between the regulated wholesale prices of medicinal products and the public expenditures for medicinal products, and to estimate regression model for public expenditures for medicinal products in the non hospital consumption. In the empirical research are included 758 regulated prices for medicinal products prescribed by the outpatients' department on a prescription (Rp) during the years 2003-2010, which are financed from public expenditures. The correlation and regression analyses are used in order to establish the association between the regulated wholesale prices for medicinal products and the public expenditures for medicinal products. The correlation analysis confirmed a strong positive correlation of the public expenditures for medicinal products with the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, a weak correlation with the wholesale prices for medicinal products and with the classification lists of medicinal products. The multiple regression analysis confirmed a positive significant impact of the wholesale price of medicinal products and the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, on the public expenditures for medicinal products. The research has confirmed the association of the public expenditures for medicinal products with the regulated wholesale prices for medicinal products. It has underlined the importance of the rational prescription and use of medicinal products. The explanatory variables included in the regression model for the public expenditures for medicinal products explained up to 94% of variability in the public expenditures for medicinal products.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia",University of Primorska,,romana.kajdiz@jazmp.si; stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si,"Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372",,,,,18,6,6,0,5,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The topic of disagreement and more specifically the problem of how to respond to disagreement, is relevant in many areas in life where the same information is available to different people that come to hold different beliefs in regard to what that information means. The topic also bears on questions relating to epistemic warrant, namely to what extent one's beliefs can be justified by evidence, to first-person conviction, epistemic humility, normative epistemology, and self-servicing beliefs. In this chapter I approach this topic differently to how it has been approached in the recent literature. I believe that there is a difference between addressing the disagreement problem hypothetically, or in theory, as an abstraction of a case of disagreement, and regarding this same problem when it is considered from a practical point of view, in consideration of features that characterize actual cases of disagreement. I believe that the core difference between these two cases relates to judgments relating to the relevance of second-order evidence (roughly, evidence about the viability of inferences made from what we regularly treat as evidence). In actual cases of disagreement, as opposed to hypothetical abstractions of such cases, what is or isn't relevant depends on how uncertain the situation is seen to be by the person in question. And this depends on the level of confidence as perceived by that person's subjective first-person judgment. In what follows I show that subjective confidence about first-order judgments can swamp second-order evidence - against a plausible view that it shouldn't. And I believe that this is a significant problem in practical rationality that is brought into focus by disagreement problems. I focus on the problem of relevancy judgments and how they relate to the calibration of first-person judgments with statistical data, and I demonstrate how this impinges on disagreements when these are considered from the first-person perspective.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Study Rational & Interact Decis Theory, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Konigsberg, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Study Rational & Interact Decis Theory, Jerusalem, Israel.",amirkonigsberg@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-08551-7; 978-3-319-08550-0,ETHICAL ECON,,,2014,50.0,,,,,,95,114,,10.1007/978-3-319-08551-7_5,0.0,,,20,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358528600005,0

The study compares the members of the Dachmarke Rhein with a random sample, both consisting of small rural enterprises in the economic sectors of tourism and food processing. Based on face-to-face interviews with 99 managers, a comparison of the two groups regarding their integration into regional value chains is elaborated: the two groups mainly coincide with regard to the reasons for choosing local suppliers. However, members of the Dachmarke Rhon are putting more emphasis on regional buying and the relationship to their suppliers. The share of total value added within the enterprises is higher in the random sample. This on the other hand explains higher expenses for supplies and a lower direct regional economic impact within the group of enterprises of the Dachmarke Rhon. Nevertheless the analysis shows, that the expenses for buying goods stay to a greater proportion within the region and facilitate a more diverse economic structure. Thus indirect regional economic effects are maximized fostering multifunctionality at the same time. The Dachmarke Rhon therefore can be seen as a market-based tool for fostering sustainable economic development, although the need for improvement regarding logistics and education for sustainable development exists.","[Kraus, Felix; Merlin, Cornelius; Job, Hubert] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Kraus, F (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",felix.kraus@uni-wuerzburg.de; hubert.job@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,,54,22,23,1,37,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

We address both the short run and long run relationship between commodity prices and exchange rates. We find that while the levels of the series of both assets are difference stationary, they are not cointegrated. Further, we find the two variables are negatively related, with strong and significant causality running from commodity prices to the exchange rate and not vice versa, implying exogeneity in the determination of commodity prices with respect to the nominal exchange rate. The strength of the relationship is significantly weaker than other OECD commodity currencies. We surmise that the relationship is dynamic over time owing to the portfolio-rebalance argument and the Commodity Terms of Trade (CTT) effect and, in the absence of an error correction mechanism, this disconnect may be prolonged. For commodity and currency market participants, this implies that while futures and forward commodity prices may be useful leading indicators of future currency movements, the price risk management strategies may need to be recalibrated over time.","[Schaling, Eric; Ndlovu, Xolani; Alagidede, Paul] Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Schaling, E (通讯作者)，Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa.",,"Alagidede, Prof Imhotep Paul/JDD-3340-2023","Alagidede, Prof Imhotep Paul/0000-0003-1571-0227",,,,,73,7,9,0,14,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Empirical results show that scheduled communications have prominent effect on the implied volatility index that surround the report days. The impact of RBI policy statement on expected volatility surround one day report release found to be more responsive. In compliance with the literature, study shows that implied volatility rises before the scheduled communication and goes normal on the day of news release. In addition, news on GDP (gross domestic product) and WPI (wholesale/producers price index) has significant impact on VIX surround the report days. The implication of the study is in twofold: it is helpful in the volatility forecasting and options pricing. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the article I argue that economists' solutions to these riddles are, despite their sophistication, of limited scientific value as they describe mechanisms that are never both new and correct: they may be empirically correct but not new as these mechanisms have been practiced (hence known) by some people before; or they are genuinely new (previously unknown to anybody), but empirically wrong as they fail to account for the real reasons of observed behavior. I further show that the hypothesized solutions to the riddles could be easily tested by consulting the people whose behavior is examined, and point to the strange lack of economists' efforts to do so. Finally I present results of a micro survey relating to one such rational riddle: ticket underpricing (why prices of tickets for various events do not adjust to eliminate the excess demand). By interviewing managers of theatres known to sell tickets at prices that create lines, I present some evidence showing that it is much easier to explain the observed behavior in terms of plain ignorance of some elementary economic principles or facts rather than in terms of some economic sophistication on the part of the managers. No interviewees, for example, explicitly related the existence of lines to ticket underpricing, and some actually denied any link there even if prompted. I conclude by pointing to the real cost to the economic profession stemming from its decision to ignore the possibility of irrationality in economists' research program.","Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"St'astny, D (通讯作者)，Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",Daniel.Stastny@ujep.cz,"Stastny, Dan/HTM-1443-2023",,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The main components of this model are the business environment quality, innovation potential of companies and use of human resources, interpreted using relevant factors or indicators. The model has been applied to the evaluation of Czech regions - 205 administrative districts (microregional level) and 14 NUTS 3 regions (mesoregional level). Information capacity of the model has been proved by the confirmation of the hypotheses assuming strong relationships among business environment quality and regional GDP and population size of regions. A synthesis allowed us to define the main regularities, evaluate the competitive positions of regions and create the spatial model of the economic development of the Czech Republic. Special attention has been given to the unique method for the identification of territorial systems of poles and axes of development and further to the hierarchy of integration processes (using the profile interaction method). Subsequently, we conceptualized the results from the perspective of regional policy creation using the method of development scenarios. This allows for a flexible optimization of the main priorities and tools of a regional policy (regions are defined and territorially specified by means of flexible sets of relevant measures). From a theoretical perspective, we extend the knowledge about the processes of polarization and integration as key manifestations of the principles of developmental and hierarchical differentiation of society in the conditions of increasing globalisation.","Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Viturka, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",viturka@econ.munic.cz,,,,,,,29,22,22,0,15,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Based on three representative manufacturing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China's Zhejiang province, this study explores the evolution of the SMEs' unique organizational forms in response to such external collaboration. In particular, these organizational forms begin with a functional-level technology department' that subsequently evolves into a strategic-level research centre' that acts as a quasi-intermediary organization' within an existing organizational boundary and eventually becomes an independent professional technology company'. Although, in general, the collaboration with universities and research institutes facilitates both exploratory and exploitative types of innovation capability building, this study further finds that such collaboration via a technology department' is the least effective. Furthermore, collaboration via a research centre' strengthens (weakens) the effect on the exploratory (exploitative) type of innovation capability building. Meanwhile, the collaboration via a wholly owned technology company' strengthens (weakens) the effects on the exploitative (exploratory) type of innovation capability building. Importantly, the collaboration via a joint-venture technology company' with universities and research institutes facilitates the ambidextrous exploratory and exploitative type of innovation capability building.","[Kittilaksanawong, Wiboon] Nagoya Univ Commerce & Business, Fac Management, Nisshin, Aichi 4700193, Japan; [Ren, Zongqiang] Shandong Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Business, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China",Nagoya University of Commerce & Business; Shandong University of Political Science and Law,"Ren, ZQ (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Business, 63 East Jiefang Rd, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China.",renzq@sdupsl.edu.cn,,,,,,,26,9,9,1,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Therefore, the internal mechanical solution of a Ratio System, producing dimensionless numbers, is preferred to weights, which are most of the time used to compare the different units. In addition, the ratio system creates the opportunity to use a second approach: a non-subjective Reference Point Theory. Therefore, the Reference Point Theory uses the ratios found in the ratio system as co-ordinates for the alternative solutions, which are then compared to a Maximal Objective Reference Point. The two approaches form a control on each other. This overall theory is called MOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis). The results are still more convincing if a Full Multiplicative Form is added, three methods assembled under the name of MULTIMOORA. At that moment, the control by three different approaches forms a guaranty for a solution being as non-subjective as possible. As to calculate the sum of three obtained ranks is not allowed, a theory of Ordinal Dominance is developed in order to remain in the ordinal sphere. MULTIMOORA is used to decide upon an investment in Belgian shares on basis of a ranking in the BEL20 Index.","[Brauers, Willem K.

We ask a number of questions about various characteristics of the differences between the initial estimates, available one month after the end of the quarter, and the estimates available three months after the end of the quarter. Do the first estimates have the same directional signs as the later numbers? Are the original numbers unbiased estimates of the later figures? Are any observed biases related to the state of the economy? Finally, we determine whether there is a significant difference between the vector of the 30-day estimates of the 10 major components and the vector of the 90-day estimates of the same components. We conclude that, under most circumstances, despite the existence of some bias, an analyst could use the early data to obtain a realistic picture of what had happened in the economy in the previous quarter.

However, modelling LGD poses substantial challenges. One of the key problems in building regression models for estimating the loan-level LGD in retail portfolios such as mortgage loans relates to the difficulty of modelling their distributions, as they typically contain extensive numbers of zeroes. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed where a mixed discrete-continuous model for the total loss amount incurred on a defaulted loan is developed. The model accommodates the probability of a zero loss and the loss amount given that a loss occurs simultaneously. The approach is applied to a large dataset of defaulted home mortgages from a UK bank and compared to two well-known industry approaches. Our zero-adjusted gamma model is shown to present an alternative and competitive approach to LGD modelling. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Mainstream economics literature proposes that in the absence of an intermediating government, the bargaining power of large customers in procuring infrastructure will be weak. Drawing on a spatial, temporal and relational framework, this article critiques this proposition through a case study of a large manufacturing firm, ThyssenKrupp (TK) AG, which recently invested euro7 billion in steel processing facilities in Brazil and USA. I find that prior to making durable and immobile investments large firms-like TK-can exert symmetric bargaining power against sellers of infrastructure, provided the firm has competitive alternatives available in making a location decision. TK exerted strong bargaining power by doing extensive analysis; keeping its commitment to any given location alternative low; inducing a 'relational auction' among alternatives it found desirable and by demanding tailored infrastructure services, rather than off-the-shelf commodities. Public sector infrastructure megaprojects, built without active co-development with lead users, are likely to be wasteful investments.","Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, BT Ctr Major Programme Management, Oxford OX1 1HP, England",University of Oxford,"Ansar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, BT Ctr Major Programme Management, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",atif.ansar@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,125,11,12,3,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In contrast, competitive sellers may lose money on sophisticated customers, and be willing to sacrifice them in order to exploit the unsophisticated.

Recent literature on legislative timing rules considers the effect of temporary legislation to stop at the moment of expiration. When the law expires, so does its regulatory effect. This article extends that literature by examining the effect of temporary legislation beyond its expiration. We show that in addition to affecting compliance behavior which depends on statutory enforcement, temporary legislation also affects compliance behavior which does not depend on statutory enforcement, and more generally, organizational behavior after a sunset. When temporary legislation expires therefore, it can continue to administer regulatory and other effects. We specify the conditions for this process and give the optimal legislative response.","[Fagan, Frank] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Fagan, Frank] Erasmus Univ, Sch Law, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Bologna; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Fagan, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",frankjames.fagan@unibo.it,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This paper explores how and why the movement has spread in recent years. Analysing beyond theories explaining insurgent action in terms of coercion, greed or grievance, the article draws on long-term ethnographic research in a Maoist guerrilla zone to explore an important aspect of mobilization that has been underplayed to date in the literature: the relations of intimacy which develop between the mobilizing forces and the people in the area of struggle. The paper shows how bonds of family and kinship, exchange and its expectations, caste and its manifestations are crucial for understanding the social dynamics of revolutionary mobilization. Moreover, it suggests that the relationship between ideology and political organization is significant in shaping the kinds of relations of intimacy developed, and that in turn this can explain the reach of the organization. In the Indian case, the paper thus compares the spread of the Maoists with competing political organizations in their guerrilla zones - the Indian State and the Hindu right. Just as relations of intimacy may help explain why people support and join radical movements, the paper suggests that their conflictual relationship with revolutionary subjectivity may also become the Achilles' heel of such movements, explaining why people distance themselves from, leave and betray them, leading in part to their decline.","[Shah, Alpa] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Shah, A (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.m.shah@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,66,46,50,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This paper addresses the question of how to measure the accuracy of such adjustments. We show that many existing error measures are generally not suited to the task, due to specific features of the demand data. Alongside the well-known weaknesses of existing measures, a number of additional effects are demonstrated that complicate the interpretation of measurement results and can even lead to false conclusions being drawn. In order to ensure an interpretable and unambiguous evaluation, we recommend the use of a metric based on aggregating performance ratios across time series using the weighted geometric mean. We illustrate that this measure has the advantage of treating over- and under-forecasting even-handedly, has a more symmetric distribution, and is robust. Empirical analysis using the recommended metric showed that, on average, adjustments yielded improvements under symmetric linear loss, while harming accuracy in terms of some traditional measures. This provides further support to the critical importance of selecting appropriate error measures when evaluating the forecasting accuracy. (C) 2012 International Institute of Forecasters.

In other circumstances, this study also demonstrates a positive relationship between female wage rates and the fertility outcomes.

A significant rationale for the proposed reform was the claim that JLC regulations unduly added to the cost of labour regarding overtime rates and particularly premiums for Sunday working. Using the 2007 National Employment Survey this paper examines the structure of earnings of workers likely to be covered by the JLC system and the extent to which low pay workers benefit from overtime earnings, shift allowances and bonuses in the private sector. The evidence does not support the argument that overtime payments including Sunday premiums in sectors covered by JLCs represent a major cost to employers in general. Few workers actually benefit from the JLC overtime rates. We argue that the removal of a floor on conditions of employment provided by the JLCs may not always be in the interests of the employer but may create a race to the bottom in low pay sectors of the economy.","[Turner, Thomas; O'Sullivan, Michelle] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Turner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.",tom.turner@ul.ie; michelle.osullivan@ul.ie,"O'Sullivan, Michelle/J-9954-2016",,,,,,45,9,9,0,9,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

This is likely because they live with relatively flat incomes and high medical expenses, and their retirement and housing assets are typically exempt from bankruptcy filings. In addition, nine states adopted higher asset exemptions specifically for the elderly. Using the Health and Retirement Study and recent state-by-time variation in homestead exemptions, we are the first to test whether the benefits of partial wealth insurance or the cost of supply-side credit constraints are predominant for the elderly. Using pooled cross-sectional analysis, we find that an increase in a state's homestead exemption increases the elderly's home equity and business ownership; however, the credit constraint is dominant in unlimited-exemption states, which decreases home and business ownership. Panel analysis reveals that an increase in the homestead exemption positively affects home ownership rates and home equity.","[Greenhalgh-Stanley, Nadia; Rohlin, Shawn] Kent State Univ, Kent, OH USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent,"Greenhalgh-Stanley, N (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Kent, OH USA.",,,"Rohlin, Shawn/0000-0002-6956-1012",,,,,17,3,3,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The current toll mechanism cannot differentiate the actual distances travelled by freeway users. To fulfil the purpose of fairness and equity; distance-based toll collection will be put into practice in 2013. It is, therefore, interesting to study the effects of toll rates on passenger car drivers' travel choice behaviour, including departure time and route. Samples are further segmented by trip lengths into short, medium and long distances, respectively. Mixed logit models, which take individual heterogeneity into account, are estimated and the results find that travel time is an important variable influencing the choice of travel behaviour in the long distance model. Other significant variables include choice inertia, frequency of freeway use, time of freeway use, trip purpose, whether drivers pass toll plaza, toll rate, etc. The signs of the estimated parameters all fit prior knowledge and are statistically significant. The results also show the toll revenue for different scenario is less than the toll fee in the original per-entry-based toll collection system, indicating that these results are in line with the government's commitment. In the future, if the distance-based system results in differential pricing, this study's findings may serve as a reference. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of several corporate governance features-particularly, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)-on the decision of developing an ethics code, among Spanish companies. Our main findings point out the lack of influence of the CEO's characteristics (except for CEO reputation) on the likelihood of having a corporate code, indicating that this decision has to do with a choice made by the company overall, perhaps because of regulatory reasons or stakeholders' expectations. Also, we have checked how other variables, such as the extent of a firm's participation in defence or other government contracts or multiple listings of the company in different financial markets, can influence the decision of developing an ethics code.","[Garcia-Sanchez, Isabel-Maria; Rodriguez-Dominguez, Luis; Gallego-Alvarez, Isabel] Univ Salamanca, Fac Econ & Empresa, Salamanca 37007, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Gallego-Alvarez, I (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Fac Econ & Empresa, Campus Miguel de Unamuno,Edificio FES, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",igallego@usal.es,"García-Sánchez, Isabel-María/F-4271-2016; Gallego-Alvarez, Isabel/D-5305-2014; Rodriguez-Dominguez, Luis/A-7539-2017","García-Sánchez, Isabel-María/0000-0003-4711-8631; Gallego-Alvarez, Isabel/0000-0001-5122-6104; Rodriguez-Dominguez, Luis/0000-0001-9607-5274",,,,,67,9,12,2,68,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Forecasts from competing methods were used in binary decision rules to forecast exceptionally large declines in demand. Using the partial area under the ROC curve (PAUC) criterion as a forecast accuracy measure and paired-comparison testing via bootstrapping, we find that complex univariate methods (including Flores-Pearce 2, ForecastPRO, Automat ANN, Theta, and SmartFCS) perform best for this purpose. The Kendall tau test of dependency for PAUC and a judgmental index of forecast method complexity provide further confirming evidence. We also found that decision-rule combination forecasts using three top methods generally perform better than the component methods, although not statistically so. The top methods for forecasting large declines match the top methods for conventional forecast accuracy in the M3-Competition's micro monthly time series, and therefore, evidence from the M3-Competition suggests that practitioners should use complex univariate forecast methods for operations-level forecasting, for both ordinary and large-change forecasts.

In view of the strong prospective growth of developing-country cities with large transport needs, and the rise in the emerging economies of potential new sources of private capital, it is important to see how effective PPP has so far been in this area. The experience is analyzed principally by thorough comparative review of what has actually happened for some of the main users to date: Bogota, Santiago, Sao Paulo, Seoul, and several cities in both China and India. Despite delays and mistakes that have been made in development of most of the projects, the overall results, already delivered and in prospect, are very positive and urban public transport is benefiting substantially, with significant side effects on poorer people's access to work and to services, air pollution levels and road accident rates. The widest and most important advantage of the PPP arrangements, as compared with more conventional short-term contracting, is found to be the innovations, technical and managerial, developed, and, in particular, the mutual capacity building of the countries' private and public sectors and their more effective interaction. The experience in the six countries covered suggests that other developing-country cities may be best assisted to develop sound urban transport PPPs more rapidly through provision of help on chosen items among 7 elements that have proved particularly crucial but sometimes weak in the projects reviewed: Civic consultation systems, Land-use/Transport strategic planning, Land/property market management, Monitoring systems, Progressive policies, Economic regulation, and Public institutional framework for PPPs.

Arrangements among component providers sometimes limit consumers' ability to mix-and-match components, and such exclusive arrangements have been highly controversial. We examine the competitive and welfare effects of exclusive arrangements among system components in a model of relatively differentiated applications that run on relatively undifferentiated platforms. We show that there is no One-Market-Power-Rent Theorem. Specifically, exclusive deals with providers of differentiated applications can raise platforms' margins without reducing applications' margins, so that overall industry profits rise. Hence, for a given set of components and prices, exclusive arrangements can reduce consumer welfare by limiting consumer choice and raising equilibrium prices. In some cases, however, exclusivity can raise consumer welfare by increasing the equilibrium number of platforms, which leads to lower prices relative to the monopoly outcome that would prevail absent exclusivity.","[Hermalin, Benjamin E.; Katz, Michael L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hermalin, Benjamin E.; Katz, Michael L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hermalin, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley 1900, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",hermalin@berkeley.edu; katz@hass.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,22,7,8,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

This paper reports systematic research on these issues, particularly relating to where an urban transit system seeks to attract discretionary car users. A model has been developed to compare the implementation, operational costs and environmental impacts of a comparable tram and high quality guided BRT system. This models a UK situation, but draws upon information from elsewhere in Europe and North America. The design of the BRT system delivers equivalent performance to trams in capacity and passenger experience. This 'equivalence' model shows that the capital costs of the high-spec BRT system are two-thirds those of tram. This is less of a cost saving than is often claimed, suggesting that, in practice, BRT is built to a lower specification that tram systems. Operational costs do not significantly differ. Using hybrid-engine BRT vehicles, CO2 emissions are similar, BRT has lower PM10 emissions, but NOx from BRT remains higher than for trams. Although the cost differences for equivalent systems are less than is often claimed, there are substantial benefits in the flexible development of BRT, with it less vulnerable to variations from forecast ridership numbers, and development can be split into fundable stages, growing the business case for incremental upgrading. High-spec BRT can to be the new tram, but the 'value for money' case for BRT should not be at the expense of quality and transport planning impact. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Third, the evolution of track access regulation in Europe during the last decades is analyzed, differentiating between the period of negotiated third-party access after 1991, the introduction of ex ante regulation by the first railroad infrastructure package in 2001, and the danger of over-regulation posed by the recent Draft Directive of July 2012, establishing a single European railway area.

The behavioral antitrust literature introduces irrationality into the analysis of the reasons and effects of firms' behavior. Behavioral scholars claim that several antitrust issues may be better understood by taking account of heuristics and cognitive biases in the firms' decision making processes. Generally, by arguing that welfare losses may be caused by irrational behavior of firms, the behavioral antitrust literature tends towards more interventionism. This article questions the view that irrationality of firms would be a better assumption for explaining and predicting market behavior and designing competition rules. Moreover, the usefulness of a behavioral approach is restricted by the ambiguous results of the theoretical analysis. Rather than adopting an anti-Chicago profile, behavioral scholars should explore potential synergies with the mainstream Post-Chicago literature. Information economics, the theory of the firm and game theory have created scope for bounded rationality and information problems in the analysis of firms and markets. Behavioral antitrust can enrich but may not replace mainstream antitrust economics. Currently, behavioral antitrust certainly does not require a change of the competition rules or antitrust methodology. Behavioral antitrust is a side act and not (yet) ready for the main stage.","Erasmus Univ, RILE, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"van den Bergh, R (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, RILE, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",r.vandenbergh@law.eur.nl,,,,,,,69,7,7,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

It studies income polarization in Mexico and how it has evolved during the period 1984 to 2010, based on the methodological proposal of Esteban, et al (2007). This methodology consists of dividing the society according to income groups or classes. Results show that there was a noticeable increase in polarization; in Mexico, the middle class has persistently declined. Furthermore, the polarization level is higher in Mexico than in other countries, indicating that the Mexican middle class is systematically weaker. The large difference in average income for the social groups analyzed explains this result. The article also presents non-ad hoc definitions for upper, middle and lower classes and shows that households with a monthly per capita family income over $2,536 dollars ($30,432 annually) belonged to upper class in 2010.","Inst Politecn Nacl Mexico, Escuela Super Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico,"Gutiérrez, GA (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Nacl Mexico, Escuela Super Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",,,,,,,,10,1,2,0,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Although, most studies have examined franchising from the single-unit typology, multiple-unit franchising is found to be a popular and pervasive retailing strategy throughout the world. Despite this, there is a paucity of prior research examining the factors influencing the achievement of the four franchising imperatives. This represents an important gap in the organizational choice literature. Therefore, this study empirically examines the impact of the four franchising imperatives (i.e. unit growth, system uniformity, local responsiveness and system wide adaptation) (Bradach 1995) upon franchise system operational performance across the four key governance structures (i.e. master franchising, area development franchising, area representative franchising and incremental franchising). Based on a sample of 347 Australian franchisors, the findings indicate that there are significant differences in the way in which three of the four imperatives (i.e. unit growth, system uniformity and system-wide adaptation) impact on performance across different governance structures.

For this purpose, the return series of representative national stock indices are modelled as ARFIMA processes and then tested via the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) (1992) test, the Geweke and Porter-Hudak (GPM test, and the wavelet ordinary least squares method (WOLS) of Jensen (1999). To study the stability of fractional integration parameters of return time series and whether the financial crises in the period from 1998-2010 had an effect on the fractal structure of a return series, the time-varying estimates of a long range dependence are calculated with a rolling window approach. The main findings of this paper can be summarized as: i) the Slovenian aggregated stock market returns (Le. the returns of the stock market index) exhibit long memory, while the Czech and Hungarian stock market returns are stationary; ii) based on the results of long memory tests, the weak-form efficiency hypothesis is rejected for the Slovenian stock market, but not for the Hungarian and Czech stock market; Estimates of a fractal structure for the investigated stock market return series are not stable, but vary with time; iv) We find that the Hungarian and Czech stock market returns exhibit a similar fractal structure, whereas the fractal structure of Slovenian stock market returns is more idiosyncratic and more volatile; v) No evidence of a systematic effect of the major financial crises during the period from 1998-2010 on the fractal structure of stock market returns was found.","[Dajcnan, Silvo] Univ Maribor, Dept Finance, Sch Business & Econ, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; [Kavkler, Alenka] Univ Maribo, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ Anal, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Festic, Mejra] Bank Slovenia, Ljubljana 1505, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Dajcnan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Dept Finance, Sch Business & Econ, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si; alanka.kavkler@uni-mb.si; mejra.festic@bsi.si,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,5,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In the absence of econometric developments specific to road safety modeling, the research future must rely on pre-existing statistical procedures of econometrics applied to discrete/count and to aggregate data. In terms of contents, growing interest in the heterogeneity of road accident outcomes by category of victims could lead to treatments of this issue across research streams, say by top-down and bottom-up developments, but this speculation does not rest on extant adequate formulations of the issue of road user class and victim analysis. But understanding the time profile of aggregate national performance indicators is quite another matter. Concerning forecasting, a key question in countries where the absolute maximum of fatalities is still to come is that of its occurrence, but the answer requires a yet missing explanation of the mystery of 1972-1973. here hypothesized to result from the passing demographic wave (see Part 1). This ignorance affects the corresponding answer, in countries for which the maximum is long past, as to whether current performance is heading toward a minimum or toward a constant level: such a forecast can hardly be made if the maximum remains unexplained. In addition, it matters whether any envisaged asymptotic limit amounts to a natural rate combined with a random component, or includes more. It is conjectured that a regression component that would include speed, traffic density and vehicle occupancy rates could explain both the peak of 1972-1973 and the current evolution, notably of fatalities. In the absence of a certain explanation of the Meadow/Matterhorn/Cervin peak profile of the past maximum, forecasts can only combine random terms and known explanatory factors in the notion of Conditional Expected Safety Performance, which includes that of (Conditional) Expected Maximum Insecurity (EMI) and seems preferable to Vision Zero or to alternatives based on analogs of the natural rate of unemployment. Conditional expectations do not skirt the issue of the level of the tide by assuming the presence of an unexplained trend level and manually changing it by shifts due to well understood specific safety measures. Forecasts of explanatory variables require views on the political market (notably on the identity of the future median voter), on the workings of individual risk compensation, on the role of economic activity and on the chances of decoupling growth from transport demand, a weak prospect where communications appear more as gross complements than substitutes.

The research objective is based on the analysis of influencing factors related to the participation of women and men in the labour market to assess of quantitative parameters of gender participation in the labour market. The following objectives have been set out: 1. Having summarized various complex indexes assessing gender equality, to define influencing factors of gender participation in the labour market. 2. To define the main components of index for evaluation of woman and men participation in the labour market on the basis on the list of the main indicators representing gender inequalities in labour market participation. 3. To apply the developed index for assessment of inequalities in labour market participation between man and woman in Lithuania and compare obtained results with the assessment of situation in other EU member states. Consequently there was completed a complex index (I-LDDR) for the gender participation in the labour market. It assesses differences between women's and men's status in the labour market in Lithuania and reveals not only the division of economic possibilities between women and men, and the influencing social factors related to women's and men's status in the labour market, but assesses environmental impact of a cultural and institutional country.","[Kiausiene, Ilona; Streimikiene, Dalia] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Kiausiene, I (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ilona.kiausiene@khf.vu.lt; dalia@mail.lei.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912",,,,,33,3,3,0,13,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The Companies Act No. 71 of 2008, by introducing a definition of 'reportable irregularities' different from that in the Auditing Profession Act No. 26 of 2005 (APA); excluding 'independent reviews' from the scope of APA; and effectively exempting the majority of South African companies from the requirement either to be audited or reviewed, may materially undermine whistle-blowing by auditors in South Africa.

There are still many constraints to develop a transparent and integrated decision-making about land use, first of all the restriction of the economic analysis on direct losses and physical damage. The attention is generally paid more to the rapid recovery of the status quo after a harmful event than to reducing land vulnerability in the future by planned activities. Given to that premise, the objective of this paper is to discuss an innovative damage assessment model based on the measurement of the changes in the utility levels with reference to the notions of ecosystem and ecosystem services and to apply it to a remarkable rural/agricultural area in the Province of Lecco, Italy. This area has been selected for the availability of geo-referenced data provided by the Territorial Plan of the Province and for the special attention paid to the issue of conservation and development of rural and agricultural land. Since the difficult to take into account various types of information, linking nongeographic attributes with graphic map in order to enhance comparisons between different conditions for a variety of factors over time, the paper suggests to support the assessment process by the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).","[Mattia, Sergio] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Architettura & Pianificaz, Milan, Italy; [Oppio, Alessandra] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Ambiente Costruito, Milan, Italy; [Di Marino, Mina] Aalto Univ, Sch Arts Design & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Helsinki, Finland",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan; Aalto University,,sergio.mattia@polimi.it,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,7,MEDIMOND S R L,40128 BOLOGNA,"VIA MASERATI 5, 40128 BOLOGNA, 00000, ITALY",,,978-88-7587-690-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,139,148,,,,,,10,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BA8IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338155900013,0

In this article, we develop a formal model to investigate when global pipelines contribute to an increase in local knowledge, depending on various characteristics of clusters such as size, knowledge endowment, and the ease of transmission of internal knowledge. This model is an extension of Cowan and Jonard's () model in which we introduce the concept of cluster and a role for spatial proximity in the diffusion of knowledge. Our results reveal that there is a natural tendency of actors within global pipelines to act as external stars, rather than gatekeepers of knowledge. Global pipelines are beneficial for the accumulation of knowledge only if the cluster is either characterized by a high-quality local buzz or is small and weakly endowed in terms of knowledge.","[Morrison, Andrea] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, URU Sect Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Morrison, Andrea; Zirulia, Lorenzo] Bocconi Univ, KITeS, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Rabellotti, Roberta] Univ Pavia, Dept Polit & Social Sci, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Zirulia, Lorenzo] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Zirulia, Lorenzo] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, I-47900 Rimini, Italy",Utrecht University; Bocconi University; University of Pavia; University of Bologna,"Morrison, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, URU Sect Econ Geog, Heidelberglaan 2,POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.morrison@geo.uu.nl; roberta.rabellotti@unipv.it; lorenzo.zirulia@unibo.it,"Rabellotti, Roberta/AAX-1086-2020; Zirulia, Lorenzo/AFN-4014-2022","Rabellotti, Roberta/0000-0001-7637-3645; Zirulia, Lorenzo/0000-0002-2876-2037; Morrison, Andrea/0000-0002-1878-6780",,,,,67,114,137,7,135,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Impact studies of the big events are frequently used for evaluation of its economy efficiency or social acceptability. In the first part of the paper theoretical issues of evaluation of big events are presented. Different methodological elements in the literature are brought together to establish an analytical framework. There is provided an overview of the economics of sports mega-events as well as review of the existing literature in the field. The aim of impact analyses is to quantify additional incomes of big events on local economy, using traditional impact measuring methods. The result of these analyses is estimation of number and structure of visitors of event and also of theirs average and total expenditures. This estimation allows quantifying gross direct, indirect and induced impacts of the event. The level of economic impact could easily have been overestimated if a carefully structured working methodology had not been used. In the second part of the of the paper we use described methodology in the case study of Weld Ice Hockey Championship, which took place in Kosice 2011. The aim of the research was to evaluate gross direct economic effects of the Ice Hockey World Championship based on increased demand in the city caused by the tourists and theirs expenditures in the tourism sector.

However, in the last period, all economies started to be confronted with the same problems. They are still recovering from the economic and financial crisis, what continues to influence the public and private sector resources and has a significant impact on further development. It is widely recognized, through a growing number of studies and research papers that the economic recovery largely depends on the improvement of the SME sector and research and development. Technology and innovation play a. significant role in social and economic development. As resource of economic competitiveness, the SME sector and innovation have become a priority issue. Innovation means activities that create value through knowledge and produce growth. Innovation is driven by entrepreneurs who take risks, accept challenges and change things. In this respect, it is essential to promote policies that support innovation and technological transfer to the SME sector. Furthermore, these policies should support entrepreneurial competitiveness at regional level; in industrial branches it is important to impplement measures to attract investors having a significant role in the regional sustainable development. The paper presents a short review of the literature on the relevance and the role of innovation in growth. It focuses on the innovation capacities and performances of the transition economies emphasizing the innovative force of enterprises. This study intends to analyze the barriers and challenges for CEE and South European countries in comparison with developed economies and in compliance with Europe 2020 strategies. Moreover, it identifies weak points and local, particular strengths of innovation in the (post)crises period and it identifies the targets for the next period. All the flagship initiatives: innovation, education, information society, climate, competitiveness, labour market present challenges for the analysed countries and require short and long term strategies. The scientific approach in this respect is a necessity because it can process the data in publicly available databases and assess the progress of these countries, which is at the time being slow; some of them are situated in the last places in EU27 concerning the innovation. The goal is to improve this situation.","[Szabo, Zsuzsanna K.; Herman, Emilia] Petru Maior Univ, Fac Econ Law & Adm Sci, Dept Management, Targu Mures, Romania; [Soltes, Michal] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Kosice, Slovakia","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures; Technical University Kosice","Szabo, ZK (通讯作者)，Petru Maior Univ, Fac Econ Law & Adm Sci, Dept Management, Targu Mures, Romania.",szabo.zs.katalin@gmail.com; michal.soltes@tuke.sk; emilia_herman@yahoo.com,"Herman, Emilia/K-7284-2014; Szabo, Zsuzsanna/U-6989-2019; Šoltés, Michal/AAA-5822-2020; Herman, Emilia/GQB-3206-2022; Herman, Emilia/S-8210-2019","Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585; Šoltés, Michal/0000-0002-1421-7177; Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585; Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585",,,,,52,53,54,1,69,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

As a result, there is a high incentive for organizing cartels (where the price elasticity of demand is zero below the base price) that are quite stable because there are no lasting benefits for cheaters. In such circumstances, leniency programs are unlikely to help discovering cartels. Since all public procurement cartels operate through some form of bid rotation, public procurement officials have all the information necessary to discover them (although they have to collect evidence on a number of bids), contrary to what happens in normal markets where customers are not aware of the existence of a cartel. However, in order to promote reporting, the structure of incentives has to change. For example, the money saved from a cartel should at least, in part, remain with the administration that helped discover it and the reporting official should reap a career benefit. In any case, competition authorities should create a channel of communication with public purchasers so that the public purchasers would know that informing the competition authority on any suspicion at bid rigging is easy and does not require them to provide full proof.","Sch Publ Adm, Rome, Italy",,"Heimler, A (通讯作者)，Sch Publ Adm, Rome, Italy.",A.Heimler@sspa.it,,,,,,,8,14,14,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In efforts to test the relationship further, forecasting models based on economic and political variables have been constructed for many democracies, most notably for France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This work has produced an effective body of theory and empirical research on predicting election outcomes in advance. However, for certain other democracies, such as Norway, little or no election forecasting has been undertaken. This paper draws on established relationships from the economic voting literature and tests for their presence in Norwegian politics. We find that the vote share of the left bloc is sensitive to unemployment and whether or not they are in government. In line with the clientele hypothesis, the vote for the left has a positive relationship with unemployment figures. In addition, we find that being in office leads to a general depreciation of their vote share. The vote forecasting models constructed using these predictors are compared with and outperform an AR(1) benchmark model for sequentially updated ex post predictions of Norwegian elections over the last twenty years.

The foundation for any new framework of economic thought must embody a structure that allows for a sustainable future, not only for individuals but also for whole societies and economic units, and the assurance of minimal standards of living for the entire world's people. The Georgist position is that all the natural resources of the earth and sky should require payment back to society for the privilege of their use. Hence the recovery of rent is the proper source of finance for government services, restoring what is otherwise an imbalance between the public and the private realms of society. The Georgist philosophy offers economic justice and clarity of vision, restoration of and protection for the commons, and protection for the environment of the earth in a deft and gentle way that is within the capacity of governments to implement.","Cent Res Grp Inc, Albany, NY USA",,"Batt, HW (通讯作者)，Cent Res Grp Inc, Albany, NY USA.",,,,,,,,108,0,1,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This article presents a detailed account of the sector's changing global organization from 1974 to 2004 by applying network analysis methods to the evolution of international trade and scientific collaboration networks. We argue that there is a strong mutual interdependence of trade and scientific knowledge production, as a result of which we expect the geographic configuration of global knowledge and trade networks to coevolve. Our results show that, over time, only a few New World wine producers developed trade and scientific collaboration networks that resemble those of traditional Old World producers. They also show that structures of trade and scientific collaboration networks are more alike for Old World than for New World producers, which suggests that, contrary to our expectations, it is particularly Old World producers who may have mainly benefited from participation in international scientific collaboration.","[Cassi, Lorenzo] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75013 Paris, France; [Cassi, Lorenzo] OST, F-75015 Paris, France; [Morrison, Andrea] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, URU Sect Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Morrison, Andrea] KITES Univ Bocconi, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Ter Wal, Anne L.

Identification of such segments would allow policy makers to better tailor their future actions and thereby increase the chance for a successful implementation of the measures they propose. A set of 33 persons, selected in function of age, gender and car ownership evaluated the acceptability of a total number of 42 demand-restricting policy measures. Special care was taken that the final set of statements covered the four classically distinguished demand-restricting strategies, i.e., improved transport options, incentives for the use of alternative transport modes, parking and land-use management, and institutional policy revision. In addition, a balance between both 'hard' and 'soft' and 'push' and 'pull' measures was strived for. The results indicate that four different segments in terms of social acceptance of demand-restricting policy measures can be distinguished, i.e., travelers in favor of traffic calming, travelers against hard push measures, travelers in favor of demand restriction, and travelers against policy innovations. Besides the differences and similarities between these segments, the practical implications for policy makers are discussed, together with a series of specific recommendations and suggestions for future research.

However, the bulk of work in labour geography fails to examine worker agency beyond a narrow focus on the trade union movement, largely divorces workers' activities from the sphere of social reproduction, and rarely looks beyond the 'core' capitalist economies of the Global North. In response, this article presents findings from a regional labour mobility survey of 439 call centre workers in India's National Capital Region (May 2007). Here, previous work has heavily criticized the 'dead-end' nature of call centre jobs offshored to India from the Global North, yet has done so based on an intra-firm focus of analysis. By taking an alternative cross-firm worker agency approach, our analysis documents for the first time some Indian call centre agents' abilities to circumvent a lack of internal job ladders and achieve career progression through lateral 'career staircases', as they job hop between firms in pursuit of better pay, improved working conditions and more complex job roles. In the absence of widespread unionization within this sector, the article also discusses the productive and social reproductive factors that underpin these patterns of Indian call centre worker agency, and their mediation by a complex nexus of labour market intermediaries beyond the firm. In so doing, the article 'theorizes back' (Yeung, 2007) on 'mainstream' (Western) theories of the limits to call centre worker agency and career advancement.","[James, Al] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, London E1 4NS, England; [Vira, Bhaskar] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Cambridge,"James, A (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, London E1 4NS, England.",a.james@qmul.ac.uk,,"James, Al/0000-0001-5697-5331",,,,,113,23,25,0,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We show how judge-made law can steadily evolve and tend to increase efficiency even in the absence of new information. Judges' opinions must argue that their decisions are consistent with precedent: this is the more costly, the greater the innovation they are introducing. As a result, each judge effects a cautious marginal change in the law. Alternative models in which precedents are either strictly obeyed or totally discarded would instead predict abrupt large swings in legal rules. Thus, we find that the evolution of case law is grounded not in binary logic fixing judges' constraints, but in costly rhetoric shaping their incentives. We apply this finding to an assessment of the role of analogical reasoning in shaping the joint development of different areas of law.

By informing consumers about a product or service, disclosures can help consumers understand product features and shop among products and providers to find the combination of features and price that best meets their needs. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA, 15 U.S.C. 6801-6809) provides for disclosures of information-sharing practices of financial institutions and, in some cases, requires that these institutions offer consumers the opportunity to limit some of this sharing. Using these disclosures as a case study, this paper explores how research can help policymakers shift from a perspective of developing disclosures that are in technical compliance with the law to one of developing disclosures that consumers pay attention to, understand and use in their decision making.","[Garrison, Loretta] Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC USA; [Hastak, Manoj] American Univ, Kogod Sch Business, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Hogarth, Jeanne M.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA; [Levy, Alan S.] US FDA, Rockville, MD 20857 USA",American University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; US Food & Drug Administration (FDA),,lorettagarrison@mac.com; mhastak@american.edu; jeanne.m.hogarth@frb.gov; skleimann@kleimann.com; alan.levy@cfsan.fda.gov,,,,,,,67,19,19,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The quantity and the quality of data collected through on-board surveys are very critical and often are a major concern for transit systems because survey results are used for current or future route planning, modeling, etc. Thus, applying appropriate survey techniques for on-board surveys is crucial to collecting the required amount of data to fulfill the transit system's current and future needs without survey cost and time overruns. This study tested three different on-board survey techniques to quantitatively evaluate the effects of each technique on the overall response rate and unit cost. These three tests are (a) length of questionnaire, (b) incentives, and (c) surveyors. The tests were conducted on selected routes of the Tulsa Transit System. The test results indicate that different combinations of techniques will result in different response rates and unit costs. Thus, good planning and piloting tests for the different on-board survey techniques, and appropriate interpretations of the pilot test results, are crucial to acquiring the expected performance of the main survey while staying within budget.
