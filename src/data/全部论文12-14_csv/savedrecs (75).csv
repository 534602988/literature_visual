This paper aims to examine the core hindrances to female entrepreneurship in Nigeria. Secondary data was primarily used for the study. The data were mainly sourced from Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) and Annabel & Mairo (2007) on the variables affecting the growth of female entrepreneurship in Nigeria, particularly in the northern region of Nigeria. Sources of fuel wood, child marriage and educational exposure of Nigerian women were the three main variables used in analyzing the available data and how these combine to cause feminization of poverty and few female entrepreneurs in the country, particularly in the north. Inferences made from the data were analysed using mainly descriptive statistics from where we made our own submissions on female entrepreneurship in Nigeria. The study recommends that use gas as source of fuel rather than firewood, ignore child marriage and complete at least secondary education must be popularized in order to increase women entrepreneurship and reduce poverty among the population studied.","[Adekola, Paul Oluwatomipe; Olawole-Isaac, Adebanke] Covenant Univ, Ota, Nigeria",Covenant University,,paul.adekola@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; adebanke.olawole-isaac@covenantuniversity.edu.org,"Adekola, Paul O./P-3087-2018","Olawole-Isaac, Adebanke/0000-0001-8115-4738",,,,,19,1,1,0,11,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,3196,3207,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308101072,0

The driving force for intra-industry trade is non-homothetic preferences of consumers. We utilized a vertical differentiation framework, in which consumers have the same tastes for quality but different income levels determining their non-homogeneous choices. All firms in all countries have access to the same production technology, and there are no differences in factor endowments. Intra-industry trade arises as a result of each firm specializing on a certain segment of the market in all countries. We solved the model numerically for a two-country two-firm setup. In this setup, firms choose their product quality level and their price by maximizing their profits in a two-stage optimization problem. They also decide whether to export to the foreign market or to concentrate only on the domestic market in a standard two-by-two game. With introduction of non-zero transportation costs, trade volumes in both directions decrease. Transportation costs are shared between consumers and firms according to the marginal demand in the domestic versus in the foreign country. This model supports Krugman's home market effect: In case of non-zero transportation costs, firms want to locate their production site in the country where there is higher marginal demand for their product.","[Gencer, E.

We address two obstacles to local implementation of optimal regional control of a bio-invasion that damages public and private resources across jurisdictions: lack of local funds to protect the public resource and lack of access to protect the private resource. To evaluate these obstacles, we develop a spatial-dynamic model of the optimal control of emerald ash borer (EAB) in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota, USA. We focus on managing valuable host trees with preventative insecticide treatment or pre-emptive removal to slow EAB spread. The model includes spatial variation in the ownership and benefits of host trees, the costs of management, and the budgets of municipal jurisdictions. We develop and evaluate centralized strategies for 17 jurisdictions surrounding the infestation. The central planner determines the quantities of trees in public ownership to treat and remove over time, to maximize benefits of surviving trees net costs of management across public and private ownerships, subject to constraints on municipal budgets, management activities, and access to private trees. The results suggest that centralizing the budget across jurisdictions rather than increasing any one municipal budget does more to increase total net benefits. Strategies with insecticide treatment are superior to ones with pre-emptive removal because they reduce the quantity of susceptible trees at lower cost and protect the benefits of healthy trees. Increasing the accessibility of private trees to public management substantially slows EAB spread and improves total net benefit. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The source of random noise may be errors of measurement and errors of rounding made during data analysis. Methods of forecasting time series derived from the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems are sensitive to the presence of random noise. Accordingly, the first stage of the time series prediction should be the data filtration. One of the methods of random noise reduction used for this purpose is the nearest neighbors method. To assess the level of noise reduction in the filtered time series, an indicator of noise reduction level (NRL) or its modified version can be used. Both of these measures allow to select a series which is characterized by the lowest level of noise after the noise reduction. The question arises whether the most accurate forecast is obtained for the time series of the lowest level of noise.

It focuses on the skewness to examine the asymmetry by estimating the gamma distribution at the plant level. By linking the estimated shape parameters with economic geography variables, it is found that the productivity distribution tends to be significantly left skewed, especially in cores, regions with diversified industrial compositions, regions with weak market potential and in agglomerated industries. These findings suggest that agglomeration economies are likely to accommodate heterogeneous plants with wide ranges of productivities.","[Okubo, Toshihiro] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; [Tomiura, Eiichi] Yokohama Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Hodogaya Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan",Keio University; Yokohama National University,"Okubo, T (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",okubo@econ.keio.ac.jp; tomiura@ynu.ac.jp,"Tomiura, Eichi/AAT-8223-2021","Tomiura, Eiichi/0000-0002-7409-6741","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25285080, 22530218, 21243021, 22243023] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,30,8,8,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The goal of this paper is to capture the dynamics of the labour market in a small open economy. For our estimation we chose a specific DSGE model and applied it to the Hungarian economy. This model contains search and matching mechanisms, while the wages and the worked hours are the result of the Nash bargaining problem. The wage and price rigidities are modelled according to the approach developed by Rotemberg. This method somewhat differs from the widely used Calvo price setting. The model is able to capture the great degree of openness of the Hungarian economy and the relatively high levels of frictions. Furthermore the model confirms the weakness of the trade unions. Surprisingly, the results show quite low influence of the labour market on the dynamics of the rest of the economy.","[Papai, Adam; Nemec, Daniel] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Ecol, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Pápai, A (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Ecol, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",papai@mail.muni.cz; nemecd@econ.muni.cz,"Němec, Daniel/H-2909-2013","Němec, Daniel/0000-0003-3065-8287",,,,,13,2,2,0,3,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,748,753,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900129,0

Regression based market timing models (e.g.: Treynor-Mazuy (1966), Henriksson-Merton (1981) and Connor-Korajczyk (1991)) are used to assess market timing and stock selection abilities of fund managers. The main purpose of the article is to compare different methods of evaluating fund abilities in the area of market timing and security selection. Estimated parameters of the models used in the research are statistically significant and the models are well fitted to data. However, it is often impossible to find evidence of any market timing ability in the selected group of funds. The results show that Polish mutual funds exhibit selectivity ability more often than timing ability. Most of them have negative timing.

This thesis elaborates SLA theory, analyzes the interaction between English teaching method and SLA theory and proposes the countermeasure that SLA theory is used to advance English teaching. English teaching has had over 2,000 years' history and development of modern English teaching has owned more than 100 years' history. Both generation and application of English teaching method in different periods depend on social demands and teaching ideas appreciated by advocators. At the same time, the foregoing opinions reflect social development situations at that time and English teaching tracks to different degree. In the process of English teaching, the second language acquisition (SLA) theory such a new subject was born between the 1960s and the 1970s. Over more than 40 years, Research on SLA in the whole world has had significant development and brought new reform to global English teaching. However, there is little research on interaction between SLA theory and English teaching method. Thus, the author carries out profound research on this problem, hoping to have instructional effect on practice of English teaching in China.","[Zhao, Zhimei] Dalian Jiaotong Univ, AIEN Int Inst, Dalian 116021, Peoples R China",Dalian Jiaotong University,,,,,,,,,6,0,0,1,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-62520-34-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2014,13.0,,,,,,118,121,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC0SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349486900027,0

The renewable power generation options considered are solar photovoltaic and wind power, with battery storage or fossil fuel generator backup. New local coal-fired power, as well as extension of the grid from an existing centralized power system, are considered to compare the impacts of scale and traditional approaches to power generation. A case study for a rural area in Northwestern China demonstrates the complexity of energy decision-making when faced with low peak demands and non-ideal renewable resource availability.

With a focus on the executive and legislative branches, this paper investigates two possible political obstacles to achieve this policy goal. The first question it asks is whether or not the two branches have been defining energy security in the same way. As the concept itself has no universal definition, it is possible that the branches have been focusing on different aspects of the term. Results from a content analysis of presidential speeches and congressional hearings suggest that no such division has occurred. The subsequent question asks whether or not the two branches, in tandem, are providing the foundation for sound policy. Results suggest that Congress and presidents have defined and discussed energy security in a generally balanced, comprehensive and internally non-conflictual way. What policy emerges from these discussions should be the subject of future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The model minimises the combined costs of the gas and electricity network, these include gas supplies, gas storage operation and electricity generation. The Monte Carlo model calculates reliability indices such as loss of load probability and expected energy unserved for the combined gas and electricity network. The intention of this tool is to facilitate reliability analysis of integrated energy systems. Applications of this tool are demonstrated through a case study that quantifies the impact on the reliability of the GB gas and electricity network given uncertainties such as wind variability, gas supply availability and outages to energy infrastructure assets. Analysis is performed over a typical midwinter week on a hypothesised GB gas and electricity network in 2020 that meets European renewable energy targets. The efficacy of doubling GB gas storage capacity on the reliability of the energy system is assessed. The results highlight the value of greater gas storage facilities in enhancing the reliability of the GB energy system given various energy uncertainties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Putting this industrial waste heat to productive use can reduce fossil fuel usage as well as CO2 emissions and water dissipation. The purpose of this paper is to propose a holistic approach to the integrated and efficient utilization of low-grade industrial waste heat. Recovering industrial waste heat for use in district heating (DH) can increase the efficiency of the industrial sector and the DH system, in a cost-efficient way defined by the index of investment vs. carbon reduction (ICR). Furthermore, low temperature DH network greatly benefits the recovery rate of industrial waste heat. Based on data analysis and in-situ investigations, this paper discusses the potential for the implementation of such an approach in northern China, where conventional heat sources for DH are insufficient. The universal design approach to industrial-waste-heat based DH is proposed. Through a demonstration project, this approach is introduced in detail. This study finds three advantages to this approach: (1) improvement of the thermal energy efficiency of industrial factories; (2) more cost-efficient than the traditional heating mode; and (3) CO2 and pollutant emission reduction as well as water conservation.

This strategy might not sufficiently take into account region-specific economic structures. Whether active labour market programmes might asymmetrically affect labour markets at the regional level is evaluated. The results for Italy suggest that while in the South employment is mainly driven by social and economic context variables, in the North the employment dynamics are significantly explained by policy interventions. Two policy implications are suggested. First, the success of active policies depends on the regional labour market conditions. Second, policy-makers should adjust labour policy strategy to regional economic structures.","[Altavilla, Carlo] Univ Naples Parthenope, CESifo, I-80133 Naples, Italy; [Altavilla, Carlo] Univ Naples Parthenope, CSEF, I-80133 Naples, Italy; [Caroleo, Floro Ernesto] Univ Naples Parthenope, I-80133 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; Parthenope University Naples; Parthenope University Naples,"Altavilla, C (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, CESifo, Via Medina 40, I-80133 Naples, Italy.",Altavilla@uniparthenope.it; caroleo@uniparthenope.it,,,,,,,50,11,11,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Instead, this work maintains the comparability among cities and demonstrates that urban specificities in functions performed, quality of life, industrial diversity and social conflicts shift up and down the benefits and costs linked to pure physical size, leading to different equilibrium sizes for cities. In order to achieve this result, a model of equilibrium urban size is set up, based on urban costs and urban benefits, merging elements suggested both by the traditional urban economics literature as well as by updated approaches considering also environmental quality, urban form and inter-urban cooperation networks. The model is then estimated on a sample of 59 European cities with data at FUA level. Empirical results allow the identification of city-specific equilibrium sizes. The error term, that is, the difference between actual urban population and the equilibrium one predicted by the model can be explained, beyond a measure of our ignorance, by good or bad governance, thereby suggesting future strategies for more efficient urban planning.","[Camagni, Roberto; Capello, Roberta; Caragliu, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Architecture Bldg Environm & Construct Engn Dept, I-20133 Milan, MI, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Caragliu, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Architecture Bldg Environm & Construct Engn Dept, Piazza Leonardo 32, I-20133 Milan, MI, Italy.",andrea.caragliu@polimi.it,"Caragliu, Andrea/AAI-2320-2020","Capello, Roberta/0000-0003-0438-6900; Caragliu, Andrea/0000-0003-0865-3404; Camagni, Roberto/0000-0002-9627-7156",,,,,104,54,63,1,82,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Using Russian customs data, we document that regional destination-specific export spillovers exist for developing countries, extending a result that was only known for developed countries. This result suggests behavior responding to a destination barrier. To account for this fact, we build on a monopolistic competition model of trade by postulating an externality in the international transaction of goods. We test the model's prediction on region-level exports using Russian data and find improvement over gravity-type models without agglomeration. This finding has important development implications in that export policy that considers current trade partners may be more effective than policy that focuses only on the exporting country's industries.

While there has been much research into producing fuel from algae, a commercial-scale facility has not yet been built. We examine two case studies of energy technology innovation in the United States, first generation biodiesel and solar photovoltaics (PV), using the technological innovation system (TIS) framework to provide lessons and inform the path forward for commercializing algal biofuel. We identify five event types that have been the most influential to these innovation processes: changing expectations, technology development, demonstration projects, policy targets, and government subsidies. Some algal biofuel demonstration projects have occurred, but despite falling under the mandates set forth in the RFS (a policy target), algal biofuels do not currently receive production subsidies. The main finding from the case study analysis is that government interventions have significantly influenced the innovation processes of first generation biodiesel and solar PV and will likely be key factors in the commercialization of algal biofuel.

The cost-effectiveness of these projects is generally predicted using engineering estimates pre-implementation, often with little ex post analysis of project success. In this paper, for a suite of energy efficiency projects, we directly compare ex ante engineering estimates of energy savings to ex post econometric estimates that use 15-mM interval, building-level energy consumption data. In contrast to most prior literature, our econometric results confirm the engineering estimates, even suggesting the engineering estimates were too modest. Further, we find heterogeneous efficiency impacts by time of day, suggesting select efficiency projects can be useful in reducing peak load. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Patent rights can provide incentives for green technology research and development. Expedited patent examination for green inventions has emerged as a policy instrument to provide such incentives. Developing countries were never opposed to patents for green technologies. China and Brazil have led the way by offering expedited examinations for green patent applications. More developing countries are expected to follow. Expedited examination for green technologies is consistent with the intellectual property system objectives and is justified by the clear social benefit from green technologies. Introducing such expedited programs in developing countries has sufficient advantages. Existing models of expedited programs for green technologies are analyzed to generalize key issues and to discern suitable policy choices for developing countries. When introducing such programs, a balanced definition for green technology is preferred; a special classification requirement is premature and is not recommended; a pre-examination search requirement is generally recommended to balance patent office workloads, and a green patent database is recommended.

The model was applied to analyse private dwellings in Townsville, Australia's largest tropical city. For the financial year (FY) 2010-11 the predicted results agreed with the actual electricity consumption with an error less than 10% for cooling thermostat settings at the standard setting temperature of 26.5 degrees C and at 1.0 degrees C higher than the standard setting. The greatest difference in monthly electricity consumption in the summer season between the model and the actual data decreased from 21% to 2% when the thermostat setting was changed from 26.5 degrees C to 27.5 degrees C. Our findings also showed that installation of solar panels in Townville houses could reduce electricity demand from the grid and would have a minor impact on the yearly peak demand. A key new feature of the model is that it can be used to predict probability distribution of energy demand considering (a) that appliances may be used randomly and (b) the way people use thermostats. The peak demand for the FY estimated from the probability distribution tracked the actual peak demand at 97% confidence level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As all goods and service are assumed to satisfy the need of people, we estimated the individual energy consumption based on the demand of goods, which is explained by a utility maximization problem constrained by income. 52.84 GJ of energy is estimated for one person one year in Kumamoto metropolitan area. 19.57% of energy is used for mobility goods. A spatial regression was performed to analyze the relationship between energy efficiency and urban form characteristics in terms of density, diversity, and accessibility. The results of regression analysis show that employment density, ratio of employee in retail department, transit fare, and distance to city center are the most influential factors of energy efficiency. Findings suggest compact development and integrated policies for increasing employment density, especially, employment proportion of local residents are suggested. Moreover, measures to improve the attractiveness of mass transit should be encouraged to increase energy efficiency in Kumamoto. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Addressing these challenges will require changes in how power generation is planned, priced, and dispatched in China. This is especially true for natural gas generation, which is likely to play an important role in power systems worldwide as a flexible generation resource. Although natural gas is commonly perceived to be economically uncompetitive with coal in China, these perceptions are based on analysis that fails to account. for the different roles that natural gas generation plays in power systems-baseload, load following, and peaking generation. Our analysis shows that natural gas generation is already cost-effective for meeting peak demand in China, resulting in improved capacity factors and heat rates for coal-fired generators and lower system costs.

We find that driving conditions affect economic and environmental benefits of electrified vehicles substantially: Under the urban NYC driving cycle, hybrid and plug-in vehicles can cut life cycle emissions by 60% and reduce costs up to 20% relative to conventional vehicles (CVs). In contrast, under highway test conditions (HWFET) electrified vehicles offer marginal emissions reductions at higher costs. NYC conditions with frequent stops triple life cycle emissions and increase costs of conventional vehicles by 30%, while aggressive driving (US06) reduces the all-electric range of plug-in vehicles by up to 45% compared to milder test cycles (like HWFET). Vehicle window stickers, fuel economy standards, and life cycle studies using average lab-test vehicle efficiency estimates are therefore incomplete: (1) driver heterogeneity matters, and efforts to encourage adoption of hybrid and plug-in vehicles will have greater impact if targeted to urban drivers vs. highway drivers; and (2) electrified vehicles perform better on some drive cycles than others, so non-representative tests can bias consumer perception and regulation of alternative technologies.

The empirical analysis deals with two possible sources of misspecification: the endogeneity of migration and the omission of relevant job characteristics. It also controls for area and personal characteristics. Results show that commuting is positively correlated with the quality of the education-job match. However, analysis does not support the conventional wisdom that migration unambiguously reduces over-education. It seems fair to conclude that the link between migration and over-education remains unclear and that further research is needed in order to better ground policy prescriptions.","Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Devillanova, C (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",carlo.devillanova@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,56,21,22,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Four types of CSP plants with parabolic troughs were simulated at two sites, Bom Jesus da Lapa and Campo Grande, and PV plants were simulated at two other sites, Recife and Rio de Janeiro. The main parameters obtained for each plant were expanded to other suitable sites in the country (totaling 17.2 GW in 2040), as inputs in an optimization model for evaluating the impacts of the introduction of centralized solar power on the expansion of the electricity grid up to 2040. This scenario would be about USD$ 185 billion more expensive than a business as usual scenario, where expansion solely relies on least-cost options. Hence, for the country to incentivize the expansion of centralized solar power, specific auctions for solar energy should be adopted, as well as complementary policies to promote investments in R&D and the use of hybrid systems based on solar and fuels in CSP plants.

While conventional energy policy suggests that these strategies may be implemented alongside each other, the paper identifies significant technological and socio-economic conflicts of interest between the two. The article identifies differences between a domestic strategy for the integration of intermittent renewables, vis-a-vis the SmartGrid, and a cross-system strategy, vis-a-vis the SuperGrid. Policy makers and transmission system operators must understand the need for both strategies to evolve in parallel, but in different territories, or with strategic integration, avoiding for one strategy to undermine the feasibility of the other. A strategic zoning strategy is introduced from which attentive societies as well as the global community stand to benefit. The analysis includes a paradigmatic case study from West Denmark which supports the hypothesis that these strategies are mutually exclusive. The case study shows that increasing cross-system transmission capacity jeopardizes the feasibility of SmartGrid technology investments. A political effort is required for establishing dedicated SmartGrid innovation zones, while also redefining infrastructure to avoid the narrow focus on grids and cables. SmartGrid Investment Trusts could be supported from reallocation of planned transmission grid investments to provide for the equitable development of SmartGrid strategies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification is based on a monotonicity assumption in the treatment choice equation and is achieved without any functional form restriction. We propose a weighting estimator that is extremely simple to implement. This estimator is root n consistent, asymptotically normally distributed, and its variance attains the semiparametric efficiency bound. We also show that including covariates in the estimation is not only necessary for consistency when the IV is itself confounded but also for efficiency when the instrument is valid unconditionally. An application of the suggested methods to the effects of fertility on the family income distribution illustrates their usefulness.

However, it is therefore of interest to investigate how different member states address these goals. Countries like Sweden and Germany have developed different strategies for energy conservation within the building sector. A longitudinal comparison between implemented energy conservation key policy instruments in Sweden and Germany and a survey regarding the management of energy requirements in the building process Shows that: - No evidence is found that energy consumption is of great importance for producing competitive offers, either for Swedish or German clients. - The Swedish market-driven policy has not been as successful as the German regulation policy in decreasing the energy consumption of new buildings. - Building standards and regulations regarding energy performance affects how professionals are educated and the way energy requirements and demands are managed throughout the building process. In conclusion, the client's demand will govern the development of energy efficient buildings. Therefore, in order to use market-driven policies, the desired parameters must be of concern for the customer to influence the majority of building projects to be more energy efficient than is specified in national standards and regulations.

Several studies show that current regulation of natural monopolies does not offer sufficient incentives for network operators (and network users) to participate in this process. Taking Italy as a case study, this paper analyses how energy regulation can change to support the current transformation. We describe the recent regulatory interventions in the domain of smart grids, smart metering and electromobility, with a specific emphasis on the provisions aimed at fostering innovation-an issue that until recently has received almost no attention in the literature nor in the practice of regulation. The progress we observe is considerable in all new areas of concern, and, above all, in the regulator's commitment to provide the right incentives for investments in demonstration projects: the acquisition of experience is regarded as essential to move to more sophisticated regulatory instruments. Finally, regulation is also increasingly concerned with network users, both traditional and new, with the objective to stimulate more active behaviours. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The realization of energy saving and emission reduction within China's power industry is therefore crucial in order to achieve CO2 emissions reduction in this country. This paper applies the autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) co-integration model to study the major factors which have influenced CO2 emissions within China's power industry from 1980 to 2010. Results have shown that CO2 emissions from China's power industry have been increasing rapidly. From 1980 to 2010, the average annual growth rate was 8.5%, and the average growth rate since 2002 has amounted to 10.5%. Secondly, the equipment utilization hour (as an indicator of the power demand) has the greatest influence on CO2 emissions within China's power industry. In addition, the impact of the industrial added value of the power sector on CO2 emissions is also positive from a short-term perspective. Thirdly, the Granger causality results imply that one of the important motivators behind China's technological progress, within the power industry, originates from the pressures created by a desire for CO2 emissions reduction. Finally, this paper provides policy recommendations for energy saving and emission reduction for China's power industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A case study was conducted in Changchun, Jilin, where eight HEIs of various types were examined. An analysis of government policies was also performed. The findings indicate that the HEIs have implemented comprehensive non-technical initiatives to conserve electricity, including electricity restrictions and extensions of winter breaks, as well as certain technical initiatives. The HEIs are less enthusiastic in conserving thermal energy due to a lack of financial incentives and resources. Differences between the HEIs are also noted. This paper discusses the role of key players, including administrators, government agencies, networks, students and non-government organizations (NGOs). Challenges to energy conservation are also identified, such as the lack of investment by schools, lack of government funding, quality problems in energy conservation products, inadequate heat metering reform, underperformance of energy service companies (ESCOs), and conflicts between energy conservation and student welfare. Policy recommendations are offered based on the analysis results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The third is a discussion of managing public-facing energy messaging in an age of public access to online information. Two multi-day, online focus groups or dialogue boards were held, one in Poland and one in Spain, with participants drawn from regions with active CCS development potential. The nature of the groups led to participants being subject to wider social influence through discussion of the topic off-line. They were also able to research and present evidence on the topic to the group, deepening debate and allowing the emergence of 'experts'.

Using a dynamic recursive general equilibrium model, IMACLIM-R, we demonstrate that these overarching targets do not dominate the interim transportation targets when the carbon policy triggering compliance with the mitigation objectives boils down to the theoretical least-cost option of uniform carbon pricing. Ground transportation is confirmed as quite insensitive to high carbon prices, even when such prices are applied over a long term. It is tempting to conclude that pursuing the mitigation objectives specific to transportation will impose unnecessary costs. However, because of the second best conditions prevailing in actual economies, and of the risk of lock-in in carbon intensive trajectories, we conclude with the urgent need for some ambitious transport-specific policy design research agenda.

The program - known formally as the Eco-living Program - was funded by the district government and implemented in the Hong Kah North Residential Council in the south western part of Singapore. The research objectives are three-fold: (1) compare the effectiveness of different intervention methods, based on self-reported behavior scores and actual electricity reduction; (2) investigate how behavior and electricity consumption are influenced by values, situational and psychological factors; (3) assess the effectiveness of different methods of intervention and provide recommendations for improvement. It was found that a combined use of leaflets and stickers resulted in highest (that is, 15.8%) reduction in average consumption. Ease of practicing the recommended energy conservation actions is a strong motivators to change energy consumption behavior. This program exemplifies the important role that community-initiated bottom-up programs can play in promoting sustainable consumption with the financial support from the local (district) government.

To assess the potential for low carbon development we first estimate the overall CO2 emissions of rural households, followed by a more in depth description and characterization of the different energy use practices within the households. Space heating turns out to be the largest emission source among domestic energy practices in north China. We present lifestyle and context related factors that help to explain existing differences in domestic energy use practices of households. The potential for low carbon development is discussed both at the demand side and the supply side. At the demand side, the use of more efficient technologies and cleaner energy sources for space heating seems to be a high potential measure for achieving low carbon households. At the supply side the reduction of rural domestic CO2 emissions could be effectively supported by making available to householders renewable and cleaner energy sources and technologies. In order to be effective, such low carbon energy options should take into account the (income) characteristics and lifestyles of rural householders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This raises issues for the valuation of transmission rights, particularly in the European context of market harmonisation, and the use of transmission rights with increasing levels of wind penetration. We examine the price differentials between the Irish and British electricity markets, where explicit transmission capacity auctions have been persistently undersubscribed and transmission rights acquired but not fully utilised. We find significant empirical indications that auction prices for transmission rights are undervalued against both arbitrage and spread option valuations. We also find significant power flows against the efficient price spread direction. A survey of a group of experts with an interest in trading power between Ireland and Britain inform a number of possible explanations for the apparent inefficiencies. These include ex-post pricing in the Irish market, intermittent wind and strategic behaviour by dominant firms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact on carbon dioxide emissions of the shift to diesels in Europe through 2009,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Automobile fuel efficiency; Automobile CO2 emissions; Diesel automobiles,DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS; CO2 EMISSIONS; FUEL-ECONOMY; ENERGY,"This paper identifies trends in new gasoline and diesel passenger car characteristics in the European Union between 1995 and 2009. By 2009 diesels had captured over 55% of the new vehicle market. While the diesel version of a given car model may have as much as 35% lower fuel use/km and 25% lower CO2 emissions than its gasoline equivalent, diesel buyers have chosen increasingly large and more powerful cars than the gasoline market. As a result, new diesels bought in 2009 had only 2% lower average CO2 emissions than new gasoline cars, a smaller advantage than in 1995. A Laspeyres decomposition investigates which factors were important contributors to the observed emission reductions and which factors offset savings in other areas. More than 95% of the reduction in CO2 emissions per km from new vehicles arose because both diesel and gasoline new vehicle emissions/km fell, and only 5% arose because of the shift from gasoline to diesel technology. Increases in vehicle mass and power for both gasoline and diesel absorbed much of the technological efficiency improvements offered by both technologies. We also observe changes in the gasoline and diesel fleets in eight EU countries and find changes in fuel and emissions intensities consistent with the changes in new vehicles reported. While diesel cars continue to be driven far farther than gasoline cars, we attribute only some of this difference to a rebound effect. We conclude that while diesel technology has permitted significant fuel savings, the switch from gasoline to diesel in the new vehicle market contributed little itself to the observed reductions in CO2 emissions from new vehicles.

The work was carried out under a collaborative research project between the Italian Ministry of the Environment and Politecnico di Milano. For the assessment of the national NOx emissions due to residential heating, an inventory of the domestic boilers stock operating in Italy from 1999 to 2010 was made. As from a technological point of view, the precise data about the real composition of national domestic boilers stock were incomplete and not updated, a methodological procedure was developed in order to reconstruct the national domestic boilers stock based on the available technologies and thermal power.

By using a large dataset of in-match data in the English Premier League, we show that white referees award significantly more yellow cards against non-white players of oppositional identity. We argue that this is the result of implicit discrimination by showing that this discriminatory behaviour: (i) increases in how rushed the referee is before making a decision, and (ii) it increases in the level of ambiguity of the decision. The variation in (i) and (ii) cannot be explained by any form of conscious discrimination such as taste-based or statistical discrimination. Moreover, we show that oppositional identity players do not differ in their behaviour from other players along several dimensions related to aggressiveness and style of play providing further evidence that this is not statistical discrimination.","[Gallo, Edoardo] Univ Cambridge, Dept Econ, Cambridge CB3 9ET, England; [Gallo, Edoardo] Queens Coll, Cambridge CB3 9ET, England; [Grund, Thomas] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Dept Sociol, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Reade, J.

It is found that the wage returns to migration are nil for the most highly skilled workers, leading one to consider that these workers conduct their job search on a national scale.

The RED introduces sustainability criteria for transportation biofuels and other bioliquids in order to ensure that their increasing production does not cause serious environmental and social problems. Bio-oil production through fast pyrolysis is one technology under development. The aim of this paper is to explore whether bio-oil derived from logging residues in Finland meets the GHG performance criteria set by the EU. The pyrolysis reactor is assumed to be integrated with a combined heat and power production plant (CHP). Special attention is paid to uncertainty analysis. An emission reduction target of 60% as compared to the reference fuel is exceeded if the pyrolysis reactor and the CHP plant are considered as separate units, and changes in soil carbon balances are ignored. On the contrary, the particular target is not met using a 20-year time frame for changes in soil carbon balances. The results depend in large measure on the selection of parameters set and the interpretation of the definitions provided in the RED to set the system boundary for the pyrolysis reactor and the CHP plant.

This paper analyzes the technology development/consumer amenities trade-off for new cars sold in Sweden between 1975 and 2010. We combine lessons learned from the policies in place and interviews with key actors in the car-purchasing process with statistical modeling of trends in vehicle attributes and technological development. Until 2007, consumer amenities were continuously enhanced, offsetting most of the efficiency gains of technological development; there was no strong policy push toward energy efficiency. In recent years, two major shifts have occurred. First, there has been a shift in the majority of new cars sold, from gasoline-powered engines to diesel engines. Flex-fuel vehicles have also contributed to a decline in the sales-share of pure gasoline engines. The observed shift of fuels, especially to flex-fuels, has been encouraged by policies. Second, after 2007 there have been major technological improvements, while attributes related to consumer amenities have remained flat, reversing the trends so that 77% of the technological development resulted in actual reduction of specific fuel consumption. EU targets, tax reforms, and consumer awareness have contributed to this trend change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Improving energy efficiency and fuel switching are two measures to reduce CO2 emissions in the industrial sector, with natural gas and low-carbon electricity as the most feasible options in the short term. In this work, a linear programming optimization model has been developed to study the potential of energy efficiency improvement and fuel substitution for CO2 emissions reduction, at national level in the non-ferrous metals industry. The energy resource/end-use device allocation problem in secondary metal production and semi-fabrication has been modeled. Using this model, the particular case of Colombia, where low-carbon electricity is available, has been studied. By improving energy efficiency, energy use and CO2 emissions can be reduced significantly, 73% and 72%, respectively, at negative costs. Further CO2 emissions reductions, up to 88%, are possible with fuel switching to low-carbon electricity, increasing the costs for the energy system; however, cost reductions caused by energy efficiency improvement outweigh cost increments of fuel switching. Benefits achieved with fuel substitution using low-carbon electricity can be lost if hydropower is not available; in such a case, efficient natural gas-fired end-use devices are preferable.

The country has been challenged with power shortages in the short-term and faces complex energy security decisions in the long-term. Japan has a long history of implementing energy conservation policies, such as the Top Runner Program, which covers 23 products including appliances and industrial equipment. However, Japan's efficiency policy for polyphase electric motors is considered below international standards. Polyphase electric motors accounted for about 55% of the nation's total power consumption in 2008. The aim of this study is to estimate potential energy savings and reduction in CO2 emissions (2014-2043) by examining scenarios involving adopting two different polyphase motor efficiency standards and comparing them to a base case and concludes by suggesting pathways for further policy development using the results obtained. The study finds that if level IE2 of the international efficiency standard IEC 60034-30 were implemented, it would save 8.3 TWh (or 0.03 quads) per year, which is equivalent to about 0.8% of Japan's total electric power consumption in 2010. If level IE3 of the IEC 60034-30 were implemented instead, it would save about 13.3 TWh (or 0.05 quads) per year.

An international technology transfer mechanism has been proposed under the UNFCCC: however, it remains unclear how this international mechanism would translate into local level technology implementation. This study uses biogas technology in South Africa to obtain empirical data inductively related to technology transfer. Observations and activities specific to the biogas sector in South Africa are put forward based on site visits and stakeholder discussions in South Africa, the UK. Germany and Sweden. This paper presents empirical findings on technology transfer in the biogas sector in South Africa and analyses the role of an international technology mechanism in supporting the uptake of biogas. Many of the barriers to biogas technology in South Africa are national level constraints such as lack of supportive policy environment, financial incentives and information sharing. This case study supports the argument that it will be unrealistic for international technology mechanisms to capture the necessary specificities of individual technologies at a country level. Therefore, as demonstrated through the example of biogas technology in South Africa, there is a need for both effective national and international engagement to support technology implementation.

The increase of peak-load and intermittent renewable power requires significant resources of regulation facilities. Comprehensively utilizing large-scale cascade hydropower plants (CHPPs), which are being rapidly developed in China, as renewable regulating facilities would be a strategic decision, considering the flexibility of hydropower. jointly modeling a set of CHPP in the upstream Yangtze River indicated that the CHPP can regulate peak-load up to 30-40 W and intermittent renewables to scales of nearly 15 GW from wind and solar sources with the help of +/- 800 KV ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) transmissions. The present study shows that the hydraulic stability of the concerned river reaches can be preserved easily and the comprehensive efficiency of regulation and transmission by CHPPs is much higher than that of pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) stations. As increasingly more giant CHPPs emerge in west China, using them primarily as regulating facilities can enhance the structure of power grids, promote the development of renewables, save energy and reduce emissions. Thus we propose to shift the CHPPs that were originally projected mainly for electricity to facility primarily for power improvement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Although shipping is an energy efficient transport mode, its emissions continue to grow. Compounding this, the sector's complexity, exclusion from emission inventories and slow progress towards a mitigation strategy, limit drivers towards meaningful change. Whilst there remains a preference within the industry for global mitigation policies, the urgency of required emission cuts necessitates exploration of complimentary sub-global measures. The debate surrounding such measures tends to focus on apportioning global shipping emissions to nations. To explore the policy implications of apportionment, the UK is used in this paper to illustrate how available apportionment regimes produce a wide range of emission estimates. Moreover, in the absence of transparent fuel consumption and freight data, they have limited sensitivity, rendering them currently obsolete for monitoring purposes. Nations, regions and organisations influence shipping, particularly in relation to operations, yet debate surrounding apportionment has arguably delayed consideration of sub-global polices and indicators. This paper makes a case for putting the apportionment debate aside in the short-term to open out the full span of options, consider influence over aspects of the shipping system, and how to monitor success.

From 1996 to 2010, China's industrial energy consumption increased by 134%, even as the industrial economic energy intensity decreased by 46%. Decomposition analysis shows that the production effect was the dominant cause of the rapid growth in industrial energy consumption, while the efficiency effect was the major factor slowing the growth of industrial energy consumption. The structural effect had a relatively small and fluctuating influence. Analysis shows the strong association of industrial energy consumption with the growth of China's economy and changing energy policies. An assessment of the Top-1000 Enterprises Energy-Saving Program and the Ten Key Energy-Saving Projects indicates that the economic energy intensity of major energy-intensive industrial sub-sectors, as well as the physical energy intensity of major energy-intensive industrial products, decreased significantly during China's 11th Five Year Plan (FYP) period (2006-2010).

This study was conceived as a snapshot of the ESCO industry prior to the economic slowdown and the introduction of federal stimulus funding mandated by enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). This study utilizes two parallel analytic approaches to characterize ESCO industry and market trends in the U.S.: (1) a top-down approach involving a survey of individual ESCOs to estimate aggregate industry activity and (2) a bottom-up analysis of a database of similar to 3250 projects (representing over $8B in project investment) that reports market trends including installed EE retrofit strategies, project installation costs and savings, project payback times, and benefit-cost ratios over time. Despite the onset of a severe economic recession, the U.S. ESCO industry managed to grow at about 7% per year between 2006 and 2008. ESCO industry revenues were about $4.1 billion in 2008 and ESCOs anticipate accelerated growth through 2011 (25% per year). We found that 2484 ESCO projects in our database generated similar to$4.0 billion ($2009) in net, direct economic benefits to their customers. We estimate that the ESCO project database includes about 20% of all U.S. ESCO market activity from 1990-2008. Assuming the net benefits per project are comparable for ESCO projects that are not included in the LBNL database, this would suggest that the ESCO industry has generated similar to$23 billion in net direct economic benefits for customers at projects installed between 1990 and 2008. There is empirical evidence confirming that the industry is evolving by installing more comprehensive and complex measures-including onsite generation and measures to address deferred maintenance-but this evolution has significant implications for customer project economics, especially at K-12 schools.

The negative case,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Renewable energy; Limits to growth; Energy supply,GREENHOUSE; ELECTRICITY; EMISSIONS,The current discussion of climate change and energy problems is generally based on the assumption that technical solutions are possible and that the task is essentially to determine the most effective ways. This view relies heavily on the expectation that renewable energy sources can be substituted for fossil fuels. Australia is more favourably situated regarding renewable sources than almost any other country. This discussion attempts to estimate the investment cost that would be involved in deriving Australia's total energy supply from renewable sources. When provision is made for intermittency and plant redundancy it is concluded that the total investment cost is likely to be unaffordable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Before 2009, US and UK gas prices had a long-term equilibrium with crude prices to which gas prices always reverted after exogenous shocks. Both US and UK gas prices adjusted to the crude oil price individually, and departure from the equilibrium gas price on one continent resulted in a similar departure on the other. After an exogenous shock, the adjustment between US and UK gas prices took approximately 20 weeks on average, and the convergence was mediated mainly by crude oil with a necessary condition that arbitrage across the Atlantic was possible. After 2009, however, the UK gas price has remained integrated with oil price, but the US gas price decoupled from crude oil price and the European gas price, as the Atlantic arbitrage has halted. The oversupply from shale gas production has not been mitigated by North American export, as there has been no liquefying and export capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The research analyzes up to 10 years of electricity reliability information collected from 155 U.S. electric utilities, which together account for roughly 50% of total U.S. electricity sales. We find that reported annual average duration and annual average frequency of power interruptions have been increasing over time at a rate of approximately 2% annually. We find that, independent of this trend, installation or upgrade of an automated outage management system is correlated with an increase in the reported annual average duration of power interruptions. We also find that reliance on IEEE Standard 1366-2003 is correlated with higher reported reliability compared to reported reliability not using the IEEE standard. However, we caution that we cannot attribute reliance on the IEEE standard as having caused or led to higher reported reliability because we could not separate the effect of reliance on the IEEE standard from other utility-specific factors that may be correlated with reliance on the IEEE standard.

Two hundred and fifty-nine cases from monthly panel data covering June 2005 to June 2008 were analyzed. Natural and sociological characteristics in each city were included as control variables. The Chinese Air Pollution Index was also considered based on previous studies demonstrating that air quality in Korea is adversely affected by transboundary pollution from China. The relationship between five air pollutants (SO2, NO2, O-3, CO, and PM10) and the CNG bus ratio was analyzed by panel data analysis. The key findings are as follows. CO and PM10 significantly decrease with an increase in the CNG bus ratio. On the other hand, SO2 and NO2 demonstrate no statistically significant relationship with CNG bus ratio, while O-3 appears to have a slightly positive relationship. In addition, the results indicate that air pollution from China contributes to the increase in PM10 and O-3 in Korea approximately at the threshold of 100 in Chinese Air Pollution Index. Even though introducing CNG buses can reduce the level of PM10, it might be also increased due to the pollutants from China.","[Park, Soon-Ae; Tak, Hyunwoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Adm, Seoul 151742, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Park, SA (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Adm, 599 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",psoonae@snu.ac.kr; taku00@snu.ac.kr,"tak, hyunwoo/ABC-3216-2020",,,,,,52,12,12,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

In this study, we evaluate the financial implications of two elements of sustainability - energy efficiency and accessibility - in the market for commercial real estate. An empirical analysis of some 1100 leasing transactions in the Netherlands over the 2005-2010 period shows that buildings designated as inefficient (with an EU energy performance certificate D or worse) command rental levels that are some 6.5 percent lower as compared to energy efficient, but otherwise similar buildings (labeled A, B or C). Furthermore, this study shows that office buildings in multi-functional areas, with access to public transport and facilities, achieve rental premiums over mono-functional office districts. For policymakers, the results documented in this paper provide an indication on the effectiveness of the EU energy performance certificate as a market signal in the commercial property sector. The findings documented here are also relevant for investors in European office markets, as the importance of energy efficiency and locational diversification is bound to increase following stricter environmental regulation and changing tenant preferences.

Much of the country's effort is focused on improving the energy efficiency of the industrial sector, which consumes about two-thirds of China's primary energy. Industrial energy audits are an important part of China's efforts to improve its energy intensity. Such audits are employed to help enterprises identify energy-efficiency improvement opportunities and serve as a means to collect critical energy-consuming information. Information about energy audit practices in China is, however, little known to the outside world. This study combines a review of China's national policies and programs on energy auditing with information collected from surveying a variety of Chinese institutions involved in energy audits. A key goal of the study is to conduct a gap analysis to identify how current practices in China related to energy auditing differ from energy auditing practices found around the world.

Despite having a huge amount and variety of energy resources, modern energy access in the continent is abysmal, especially Sub-Saharan Africa. Only about 31% of the Sub-Saharan African population have access to electricity while traditional biomass energy accounts for over 80% of energy consumption in many Sub-Saharan African countries. With energy use per capita among the lowest in the world, there is no doubt that Africa will need to increase its energy consumption to drive economic growth and human development. Africa also faces a severe threat from global climate change with vulnerabilities in several key areas or sectors in the continent including agriculture, water supply, energy, etc. Low carbon development provides opportunities for African countries to improve and expand access to modern energy services while also building low-emission and climate-resilient economies. However, access to finance from different sources will be critical in achieving these objectives.

The major emergy indices, Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR), Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR), Emergy Investment Ratio (EIR), Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI), Environmental Impacts Ratio (EVR) and system transformity (Tr), are analyzed to assess the production processes. The results show that (1) petroleum fuel production presents higher ELR, EIR, EVR and lower EYR, ESI, Tr than rice-to-ethanol production, indicating rice-to-ethanol production makes sense for reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG); (2) scenario (a) performs similarly on major indicators (EYR, ESI, ELR, EIR and EVR) to scenario (b), yet the system efficiency indicator (Tr) of scenario (a, 7.572 x 10(5) semj/J) is much higher than (b, 4.573 x 10(5) semj/J), and therefore (b) is a better alternative for policy decisions; (3) both petroleum fuel production and rice-to-ethanol processes are mainly driven by purchased resources and are unsustainable and nonrenewable in the long run.

This study applies the multivariate threshold model to investigate the effects of various international energy price shocks on Taiwan's macroeconomic activity. By separating energy price changes into the so-called decrease and increase regimes, we can realize different impacts of energy price changes and their shocks on economic output. The results confirm that there is an asymmetric threshold effect for the energy-output nexus. The optimal threshold levels are exactly where the oil price change is at 2.48%, the natural gas price change is at 0.66%, and the coal price.:hange is at 0.25%. The impulse response analysis suggests that oil price and natural gas shocks have a delayed negative impact on macroeconomic activities.

These incentives may provide financial opportunities for those with capital to spend but for the record numbers with low incomes in 'fuel poverty', these benefits may seem out of reach. This paper shows that with appropriate financial intermediaries it is possible for renewable energy incentives to be used to alleviate fuel poverty. Simple financial analysis demonstrates the theoretical potential of FiTs to help those in fuel poverty. Two case studies of renewable energy projects in low income areas investigate how the incentives may be used in practice, what barriers exist and what success factors are evident. The analysis shows that local energy organisations (LEOS) are key if the poor are to access benefits from premium tariff schemes. Low interest finance mechanisms, good information sharing and community involvement are found as key success factors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Saunders, R. W.; Gross, R. J.

This study explores a range of plausible development trajectories for the system in terms of carbon emissions, fuel mix and prices with the currently employed policies and market setup. An agent-based simulation model is used in order to explore the dynamics of the system under eight different scenarios. The simulation experiments indicate the continuation of fossil fuel dominance as the energy source, and a shift from natural gas to coal seems likely in the base case. Even with CCS investments, such a development is demonstrated to cause a significant increase in carbon emissions beyond 2030, following two decades of almost-constant emission levels. In general, experiments indicate a very strong internal inertia in the system that is hard to overcome just by policies focusing on a single aspect of the system (e.g. demand, supply, or technology). It is also observed that significant reductions in carbon emissions can be attained as a joint outcome of increased green electricity demand, especially among large-scale end-users, and high carbon costs.

Recent demonstration of diesel parallel hybrids in a delivery fleet led to fuel economy improvements, and hybrid bus demonstrations exhibited twice the fuel economy of the conventional bus. Fleet ownership may include management of a fleet of vehicles as small as 10 units and as large as hundreds or thousands. In addition to fuel savings, the newer extended range electric vehicles (EREVs) and pure EVs permit vehicle to grid (V2G) opportunities. These V2G opportunities may present additional revenue for fleets by providing ancillary services to local grid independent system operators (ISOs), provided that the burden of driving and V2G services do not accelerate the degradation of the battery systems in these vehicles. The subject of this study is to determine the financial risks associated with accelerated battery degradation in a V2G-enabled EREV fleet expected to perform ancillary service duty while charging in addition to the normal loads of drive cycle duty. We determine that battery cycle life during V2G duty is a critical parameter, which can determine whether or not the business model is viable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents two scenarios and evaluates the development potential for low carbon energy and its various sources. Based on the evaluation, we analyze how low carbon energy contributes to achieving China's national target of carbon intensity reduction. We draw several conclusions from the analysis. First, low carbon energy will contribute 9.74% (minimum) to 24.42% (maximum) toward the 2020 carbon intensity target under three economic development schemes. Second, the contribution will decrease when the GDP growth rate increases. Third, to maintain the same contribution with high GDP growth rates, China should not only strengthen its investment and policy stimulation for low carbon energy but also simultaneously optimize economic structures and improve carbon productivity.

The paper examines the demand, availability and usage of spatial information in the process of maritime spatial planning. It is based the on author's own experience of preparing such plans in Poland. The paper analyses the demand for information in relation to planning cycles tested under different pilot projects. Several information gaps are defined. The behaviour and consciousness of maritime stakeholders is also examined to provide a better insight into the nature and dynamics of the gaps detected. The paper ends with some recommendations for the development of an information system in support of maritime spatial planning.","[Zaucha, Jacek] Univ Gdansk, PL-80830 Gdansk, Poland; [Zaucha, Jacek] Maritime Inst Gdansk, PL-80830 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; Maritime Institute in Gdansk,"Zaucha, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Dlugi Targ 41-42, PL-80830 Gdansk, Poland.",Jacek.zaucha@im.gda.pl,,"Zaucha, Jacek/0000-0002-3280-3241",,,,,54,16,16,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

The increasing number of prosumers (consumers that both produce and consume electricity) with solar photovoltaic (PV) generation combined with net-metering results in reduced incomes for many network utilities worldwide. Consequently, this pushes utilities to increase charges per kW h in order to recover costs. For nonPV owners, this could result into inequality issues due to the fact that also non-PV owners have to pay higher chargers for their electricity consumed to make up for netted costs of PV-owners. In order to provide insight in those inequality issues caused by net-metering, this study presents the effects on cross-subsidies, cost recovery and policy objectives evolving from different applied netmetering and tariff designs for a residential consumer. Eventually this paper provides recommendations regarding tariffs and metering that will result in more explicit incentives for PV, instead of the current implicit incentives which are present to PV owners due to net-metering.

This paper analyses the efficiency of the two largest schemes in Australia, the NSW Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme and the Mandatory Renewable Energy Trading Scheme, through their effect on the electricity prices from 2004 to 2010. We use a long run structural modelling technique for the first time on this market. It provides a practical long-run approach to structural relationships which enable the determination of the effectiveness of the theoretical expectations of these schemes. The generalised forecast error variance decomposition analysis finds that both schemes' emissions prices have little effect on electricity prices. Generalised impulse response function analysis support this finding indicating that when shocks are applied to electricity by the two schemes it returns to equilibrium very quickly. This indicates that these schemes are not having the effect anticipated in their legislation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to uncover China's transport CO2 emission patterns at the regional and provincial level. We first present the CO2 emission features from transport sector in 30 Chinese provinces, including per capita emissions, emission intensities, and historical evolution of annual CO2 emission. We then quantify the related driving forces by adopting both period-wise and time-series LMDI analysis. Results indicate that significant regional CO2 emission disparities exist in China's transport sector. The eastern region had higher total CO2 emissions and per capita CO2 emissions, but lower CO2 emission intensities in its transport sector. The western region had higher CO2 emission intensities and experienced a rapid CO2 emission increase. The CO2 emission increments in the eastern provinces were mainly contributed by both economic activity effect and population effect, while energy intensity partially offset the emission growth and energy structure had a marginal effect. However, in the central and western provinces, both economic activity effect and energy intensity effect induced the CO2 emission increases, while the effects from population and energy structure change were limited.

For stationary innovations, break point estimation is commonly performed by minimizing the sum of squared residuals across all candidate break points, using a regression of the levels of the series on the assumed deterministic components. For unit root processes, the obvious modification is to use a first differenced version of the regression, while a further alternative in a stationary autoregressive setting is to consider a GLS-type quasi-differenced regression. Given uncertainty over which of these approaches to adopt in practice, we develop a hybrid break fraction estimator that selects from the levels-based estimator, the first-difference-based estimator, and a range of quasi-difference-based estimators, according to which achieves the global minimum sum of squared residuals. We establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators considered, and compare their performance in practically relevant sample sizes using simulation. We find that the new hybrid estimator has desirable asymptotic properties and performs very well in finite samples, providing a reliable approach to break date estimation without requiring decisions to be made regarding the autocorrelation properties of the data.","[Harvey, David I.; Leybourne, Stephen J.] Univ Nottingham, Granger Ctr Time Series Econometr, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Harvey, David I.; Leybourne, Stephen J.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Harvey, DI (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Granger Ctr Time Series Econometr, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",dave.harvey@nottingham.ac.uk; steve.leybourne@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Harvey, David/0000-0002-7504-6885",,,,,17,4,7,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Generation adequacy and security of supply in power systems running under competition are currently topics of high concern for consumers, regulators and governments. In a market setting, generation investments and adequacy can only be achieved by an appropriate regulatory framework that sets efficient remuneration to power capacity. Theoretically, energy-only electricity markets are efficient and no additional mechanism is needed. Nonetheless, the energy-only market design suffers from serious drawbacks. Therefore, jointly with the evolution of electricity markets, many remunerating mechanisms for generation capacity have been proposed. Explicit capacity payment was the first remunerating approach implemented and perhaps still the most applied. However, this price-based regulation has been applied no without severe difficulties and criticism. In this paper, a new reliability payment mechanism is envisioned. Capacity of each generating unit is paid according to its effective contribution to overall system reliability. The proposed scheme has many attractive features and preserves the theoretical efficiency properties of energy-only markets. Fairness, incentive compatibility, market power mitigation and settlement rules are investigated in this work. The article also examines the requirements for system data and models in order to implement the proposed capacity mechanism. A numerical example on a real hydrothermal system serves for illustrating the practicability of the proposed approach and the resulting reliability payments to the generation units.

Based on the IPAT equation and Brookes' explanation of the rebound effect, this paper develops an alternative estimation model of the rebound effect. By using the estimation model and latent variable approach, which is achieved through a time-varying coefficient state space model, we estimate China's economy-wide energy rebound effect over 1954-2010. The results show that the rebound effect evidently exists in China as a result of the annual average of 39.73% over 1954-2010. Before and after the implementation of China's reform and opening-up policy in 1978, the rebound effects are 47.24% and 37.32%, with a strong fluctuation and a circuitously downward trend, respectively, indicating that a stable political environment and the development of market economy system facilitate the effectiveness of energy-saving policy. Although the energy-saving effect of improving energy efficiency has been partly realised, there remains a large energy-saving potential in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a non-parametric local-linear regression estimator and a non-parametric variable relevance test to conduct a rigorous and systematic search for significance of mean years of schooling by examining five of the most comprehensive schooling databases. Contrary to a few recent articles that have identified significant nonlinearities between education and growth, our results suggest that mean years of schooling is not a statistically relevant variable in growth regressions. However, we do find evidence (within a cross-sectional framework), that educational achievement, measured by mean test scores, may provide a more reliable measure of human capital than mean years of schooling.","[Delgado, Michael S.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Henderson, Daniel J.] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Parmeter, Christopher F.] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Miami,"Delgado, MS (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",delgado2@purdue.edu; djhender@cba.ua.edu; cparmeter@bus.miami.edu,"Henderson, Daniel J/D-1822-2014","Henderson, Daniel J/0000-0002-4940-9689",,,,,56,67,72,3,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

To select effective refurbishment measures and to quantify the energy saving potentials of the existent building stock, the analysis should be performed on reference buildings. This article presents a methodology for the identification of reference buildings, according to the IEE-TABULA project (2009-12) aimed at creating a harmonised structure for European Building Typologies. Among the possible applications of the building typology, this work focuses on the potentialities of energy savings and CO2 emission reductions for the European residential building stock. In particular, the Italian approach to model the energy balance of a subset of the national building stock is described; the results show the enormous potentialities of energy savings even with basic energy retrofit actions. Cost analyses were not in the scope of the project, but the results of this study are the basis for further investigations aimed at assessing the cost effectiveness of sets of measures. In this regard, the TABULA building-types are being applied by the Italian government for calculating cost-optimal levels of energy performance, complying with the Directive 2010/31/EU objectives.

This technology developed since the 1980s in three periods, but failed to break through. We try to explain this by studying the technological development from a quasi-evolutionary perspective, drawing upon the concepts of technological paradigms and technological trajectories. We show that the socio-economic context was most important, as it both offered windows of opportunity as well as provided direction to developments. Changes in this context resulted in paradigm shifts, characterized by a change in considered end-products and technologies, as well as a change in companies involved. Other influences on the technological trajectory were firm specific differences, like the focus on a specific feedstock, scale and more recently biofuels to be produced. These were strengthened by the national focus of supporting policies, as well as specific attention for multiple technologies in policies of the USA and European Commission. Over each period we see strong variation that likely benefitted the long term development of the technology. Despite policy efforts that included variation and institutionalization, our case shows that the large changes in socio-economic context and the technological challenges were hard to overcome.

The results show that for the 30 studied provinces, the weighted average impact of the real estate-construction sector accounts for 21 % of total output and for approximately 14 % of all jobs in 2002. For 2007, these figures are 23 and 22 %, respectively. The impact of the real estate-construction sector on total output and employment varies across regions. In 2007, the direct and indirect output and employment of real estate-construction sector accounted for around 15 % of total regional output and employment in Shandong and Henan, and for 40 % in Tianjin, Jilin, Shaanxi, Ningxia and Xinjiang.

The analysis is carried out for 10 different socio-economic regions of the world, taking into account existing building stock and energy intensities in each region and projected changes in population and income, which in most parts of the world will drive large increases in building floor area. A stock turnover model is applied to project changes in heating, cooling, service hot water (SHW) and non-thermal electricity demand with various rates of improvement in standards for new and renovated buildings, and various rates of renovation and demolition of existing buildings. For a scenario in which population peaks at about 9 billion and global average per capita GDP increases to twice the 2010 value by 2100, the global fuel demand could be reduced by a factor of four while limiting maximum annual electricity demand to twice the 2010 value.

The objectives considered are minimizing the influence of energy use on climate change, minimizing the financial risk from the investment, maximizing the security of energy supply, minimizing investment costs, minimizing the impacts of building new power plants and transmission infrastructures, and maximizing the local air quality. These were identified through literature review and interaction with real decision makers. A database of measures is established, from which millions of potential EE plans can be built by combining measures and their respective degree of implementation. Finally, a hybrid multi-objective and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model is proposed to search and select the EE plans that best match the decision makers' preferences. An illustration of the working mode and the type of results obtained from this novel hybrid model is provided through an application to Portugal.

Experiences from onshore renewable energy tell us that social acceptability is equally critical to project success. However, the specific nature of the marine environment, patterns of resource distribution and governance means experiences from onshore may not be directly applicable to MRE and the marine environment. This paper sets out an agenda for social studies research linked to MRE, identifying key topics for future research: (i) economic impacts; (ii) wealth distribution and community benefits; (iii) communication and knowledge flow; (iv) consultation processes; (v) dealing with uncertainty; (vi) public attitudes; and (vii) planning processes. This agenda is based on the findings of the first workshop of ISSMER, an international research network of social scientists with interests in marine renewable energy. Importantly, this research agenda has been informed by the experiences of developers, regulators and community groups in Orkney. The Orkney archipelago, off the north coast of Scotland, is home to the most intense cluster of MRE research, development and deployment activity in the world today. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This research aimed to provide such knowledge to enable international comparison of the energy efficiency practices of road freight hauliers. This was achieved by replicating the Finnish haulier survey in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Energy efficiency index was developed to provide a simple metric for international comparison. The EEL covers various aspects of energy efficiency to provide a comprehensive outlook into the issue. The monitoring practices are fairly similar in all four countries, with typical monitoring done manually when filling the tank and data kept on a computer. Tonne-kilometre data is rarely monitored, but some other performance measures may be used. Current level of implementation of various energy efficiency actions is rather similar between the four countries. The simple and inexpensive actions, like choosing the lorry according to the cargo and idling avoidance, are most widely implemented. The energy efficiency index developed in this research proved to be a very useful tool for comparing the hauliers in the four countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

(2010), often referred to as the 'Uppsala critique'. The major argument of Aleklett et al. is that the rates of depletion, the ratio of annual production to remaining resources or reserves, assumed by the IEA in certain categories of fields are unreasonable. In this paper, we call into question the reductions in future global oil production that Aleklett et al. argue are necessary: they have incorrectly applied a depletion rate for all fields within a region to different subsets of fields within a region. The more minor reductions to future global oil production that Aleklett et al. argue are needed because of the IEA modelling of the production of bitumen and natural gas liquids are also examined briefly.

During these 40 years or so, the UK Government has changed the type of governance it uses to manage its petroleum resources. This paper introduces the theoretical background to two models of mineral resource governance: proprietorial and non-proprietorial regimes. It investigates how adoption any of these two models by the UK Government has historically affected the achievement of the objectives of the UK petroleum fiscal regime. The analysis tracks the changes in the governance of the UK petroleum resources using changes in the average petroleum tax rate, and how this last influenced the achievement of the objectives of the UK petroleum Regime. The findings remain significant for their policy implications. The study concludes that the UK Government adopted a proprietorial type of mineral governance during the period 1975-1982, before changing to a non-proprietorial regime in the period 1983-2000. Since 2000 it has begun to move back towards a proprietorial style of governance. The excessive use of one type of these modes of governance leads to the objectives of the UK petroleum fiscal regime being not met. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

First, a short review on the STS in the UK is provided. Then, a detailed description of the RHI is discussed. A financial analysis is presented afterwards, analysing the impact of the RHI scheme on the applicants, in terms of the net present value and the internal rate of return. From the financial analysis it has been found that the RHI scheme for domestic installations is only attractive if a longer period of RHI payment, i.e. 17 years, or a higher RH! rate i.e. 0.32 pound per kW h is implemented. The current proposal from the UK government is not financially viable, and as a result, it may hinder the penetration of domestic solar thermal systems in the residential sector in the UK.

The model is based on Hotelling models of resource use that do not take the natural and technical features of oil production into account. Natural features include the decline of production through time according to a decline curve. Technical features include the requirement to sink investment in productive capacity.

Four residential energy efficiency programs were delivered consecutively in the Region of Waterloo, Canada, between 1999 and 2011, and each offered a unique combination of information, financial reward structure, and price. A natural quasi-experimental intervention design was employed to assess differences in outcomes across these program structures. Participation at the initial (evaluation by an energy advisor) and follow-up (verification of retrofit) stages, and the material characteristics (e.g., energy performance) were measured and compared between the groups of houses included in each program at each stage. The programs appealed to people with different types of material concerns; each phase of the program was associated with houses with a different mix of material characteristics and depths of recommended and achieved changes. While a performance-based reward attracted fewer houses at each stage than a larger list-based reward, older houses with poorer energy performance were included at each stage. The findings support experimentation with program designs to target sub-populations of housing stock; future program designs should experiment more carefully and with larger performance-based rewards and test parallels with potential carbon market structures.

As the economic and environmental benefits of CHP in urban centers gain recognition, regulations and policies have evolved to encourage their deployment. However, the question remains whether these policies are sufficient in helping to achieve the larger sustainability goals, such as the New York City-specific goal of incorporating 800 MW of distributed generation. In this paper, the current regulatory and policy environment for CHP is discussed. Then, an engineering analysis estimating the potential for CHP in NYC at the individual building and microgrid scale, considered a city block, is performed. This analysis indicates that over 800 MW of individual building CHP systems would qualify for the current incentives but many systems would need to undergo more cumbersome air permitting processes reducing the viable capacity to 360 MW. In addition microgrid CHP systems with multiple owners could contribute to meeting the goal even after considering air permits; however, these systems may incorporate many residential customers. The regulatory framework for microgrids with multiple owners and especially residential customers is particularly uncertain therefore additional policies would be needed to facilitate their development.

As applied to the explanation of the past economic growth (since 1900) in US, UK and Japan, the new results demonstrate quite conclusively the non-linear relationships between capital, labour and useful energy with economic growth. They also indicate that output elasticities of capital, labour and useful energy are extremely variable over time. We suggest that these results confirm the economic intuition that growth since the industrial revolution has been driven largely by declining energy costs due to the discovery and exploitation of relatively inexpensive fossil fuel resources. Implications for the 21st century, which are also discussed briefly by exploring the implications of an ACEGES-based scenario of oil production, are as follows: (a) the provision of adequate and affordable quantities of useful energy as a pre-condition for economic growth and (b) the design of energy systems as 'technology incubators' for a prosperous 21st century.

Although the use of starter cultures has improved the reproducibility of wine quality, the main drawback to this practice is the lack of the typical traits of wines produced by spontaneous fermentation. These findings have stimulated wine-researchers and wine-makers towards the selection of autochthonous strains as starter cultures. The objective of this study was to investigate the biodiversity of 167 S. cerevisiae yeasts, isolated from spontaneous fermentation of grapes. The genetic variability of isolates was evaluated by PCR amplification of inter-delta region with primer pair delta 2/delta 12. The same isolates were investigated for characteristics of oenological interest, such as resistance to sulphur dioxide, ethanol and copper and hydrogen sulphide production. On the basis of technological and molecular results, 20 strains were chosen and tested into inoculated fermentations at laboratory scale. The experimental wines were analyzed for the content of some by-products correlated to wine aroma, such as higher alcohols, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate and acetic acid. One selected strain was used as starter culture to perform fermentation at cellar level. The selection program followed during this research project represents an optimal combination between two different trends in modern winemaking: the use of S. cerevisiae as starter cultures and the starter culture selection for specific fermentations.","[Capece, Angela; Romaniello, Rossana; Pietrafesa, Rocchina; Romano, Patrizia] Univ Basilicata, Scuola Sci Agr Forestali Alimentari & Ambientali, I-85100 Potenza, Italy",University of Basilicata,"Capece, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basilicata, Scuola Sci Agr Forestali Alimentari & Ambientali, I-85100 Potenza, Italy.",,"Romano, Patrizia/AAV-4170-2021","CAPECE, Angela/0000-0002-2347-5880",,,,,17,11,12,0,18,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2014,3.0,,1.0,,,,,,,10.1051/bioconf/20140302003,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BB8BQ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346256100019,0

I have found out that around 95 % companies using MS Excel have never used the Visual Basic for Applications internal programming language (or VBA), an internal tool within the MS Office package. The main reason why such a high percentage of employees do not use the VBA programming language is simple: they have not been informed about its possibilities by their provider (employer). It is quite understandable that someone who has no experience with programming or algorithmization will be reluctant to create their own user functions. Paradoxically, however, I have found the same situation in companies which have their own IT departments responsible for software development. Therefore, one of the aims of this article is to show how VBA can be used in bulk data processing, and in particular to create matrix functions simulating database functionality.

That is occurring as a result of rising trade and investment flows, greater labour mobility, and rapid transfers of technology. As economic integration increases, individuals and businesses gain greater freedom to take advantage of foreign economic opportunities. That, in turn, increases the sensitivity of investment and location decisions to taxation. Taxation provides governments with the funds needed to invest in development, relieve poverty and deliver public services. It offers an antidote to aid dependence in developing countries and provides fiscal reliance and sustainability that is needed to promote growth. Taxation is integral to strengthening the effective functioning of the state and to the social contract between governments and citizens. By encouraging dialogue between states and their citizens, the taxation process is central to more effective and accountable states. As globalization eviscerates national borders, governments in both developed and developing countries are discovering that their tax base is eroding, especially their ability to tax the proceeds and profits from corporate investment. International tax competition is increasing as capital and labour mobility rises. Most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have pursued tax reforms to ensure that their economies remain attractive for investment. Having limited economic options the countries in the region have made tax competition a central part of their development strategy to attract and retain the companies in their countries.

Noncooperative approaches are used for analyzing strategic effects of local interaction for a coordination game with agents exogenously located on network nodes. The assumptions of basic concepts can be extended to get more realistic models of coordination problems. The approaches for analyzing the coordination problems can be modified also. Possible extensions of basic models given by indirect links, system dynamics, costs and benefits, and imperfect reliability are studied in the paper.

Perspectives for large offshore pre-salt fields are particularly good. However, challenges are also huge. On one hand, pre-salt resources development will draw vast amounts of economic and human resources and pose significant macroeconomic risks. On the other hand, the petroleum industry can generate multiplicative effects into the country's economy and, even more importantly, generate rents that can be diverted towards the promotion of renewable energy sources. This paper simulates the rent generation of Brazil's petroleum development up to 2030 according to: the country's current fiscal regime, projections of petroleum supply and a probability analysis of Brent price evolution, and assesses how these economic resources, if properly allocated, can pave the way for an increased use of renewables in Brazil. Findings show that an ambitious energy innovation program based on a target-oriented agency plus a program for solar development would cost less than half the minimum average annual petroleum rent free for investing in renewables between 2013 and 2030. The remaining budget could improve the security of ethanol fuel supply, by avoiding the negative impacts of sugar prices spikes on Brazil's ethanol production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover concentrated musts usually contain a small presence of ethanol from micro-fermentations. At laboratory scale it was verified an excellent state of preservation of alcoholizated must, and all the alcohol used was recovered by distillation. The proposed system achieved a high reduction of production costs which is demonstrated by simulation process software, where it can show the energy savings compared to the conventional process for the same volume and concentration of product obtained.

During the period of Ming and Qing Dynasties, Southern Shaanxi became a place of residence of main immigrants from Hubei, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Anhui and Jiangxi. Ideas about folk culture of Southern Shaanxi are also affected by this and form unique features. For kindergarten-based course, construction of art courses about folk culture of Southern Shaanxi complies with requirements of the era for construction essence and can highlight characteristic system of kindergarten-based education fundamentally. As the saying 'the more national features things have, the more acceptable they are for the world' goes, it is just reflected that kindergarten-based course need be developed and constructed towards personality and kindergarten-based direction. This is a process of dynamic construction. Therefore, as kindergarten teachers, they should not only require themselves strictly but also learn much folk culture of Southern Shaanxi and accept and choose useful content from lots of folk culture of Southern Shaanxi.

Real life decision making problems in social science can be translated into the language of classification. In mathematical classifier design theory various measures of classifier performance have been designed. As far as we know, none of these reflects directly the quality (reliability) of the data. On the example of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) introduced in signal detection theory we show, how data quality can be incorporated into performance assessment of classifiers.

Management of risky capital or, in general, risk management in the complex is a real and current topic of contemporary logistics. The risk management of risky capitals consists of solving dual optimization problems associated with profit maximization of a given risk and risk minimization at a given profit. Optimization is based on the analytical methods which is emphasized by the analysis of combinatory Call and Put options. Analysis of options is based on mathematical models of nonlinear time-varying rates and profits, hence requiring in practice the use of computer programs. The main essence of Call and Put options is the identification of static characteristics as well as the price and borderline course of these options.

The experimental test has been developed for the period 2007-2011 in the Appellation of Origin Cigales, in Valladolid (Spain). The reduction of vine distance has favored the vegetative growth, through the shoot weight, while the grape yield has been slightly higher in the intermediate vine distance, 1.40 m, through the cluster weight. Ravaz index showed some increase with the increasing of vine distance, derived from the decrease of pruning wood. In qualitative terms, the variation of the vine distance did not significantly modify the basic composition of the grape.

Although research on the relationship between energy consumption, emissions and economic growth is not new in South Africa, no study specifically addresses the role that South Africa's foreign trade plays in this context. A surprising fact given trade is one of the most important factors that can explain the environmental Kuznets curve. This study employs recent South African trade and energy data and modern econometric techniques to investigate this. The main finding of interest in this paper is the existence of a long run relationship between environmental quality, levels of per capita energy use and foreign trade in South Africa. As anticipated per capita energy use has a significant long run effect in raising the country's CO2 emission levels, yet surprisingly higher levels of trade for the country act to reduce these emissions. Granger causality tests confirm the existence of a positive bidirectional relationship between per capita energy use and CO2 emissions. Whilst the study also finds positive bidirectional causality between trade and income per capita and between trade and per capita energy use, it appears however that trade liberalisation in South Africa has not contributed to a long run growth in pollution-intensive activities nor higher emission levels.

As a result of her unique position in the UNFCCC, some offsetting projects in Turkey have benefitted only voluntary emission trading for the reduction of GHG emissions. Due to on-going climate change negotiation under the UNFCCC, it seems that Turkey will not use the current regulatory carbon markets. Thus, Turkey should promote the use of and participation in voluntary carbon markets.

Energy is supplied by a price-leading oil cartel and a competitive fringe of farmers producing biofuel. Biofuel production shares a finite land resource with food production. A positive relationship results between energy and food prices. We establish that the equilibrium price of food will be growing as long as the oil stock is being depleted, and beyond if demand is growing. An analysis of the effects of the productivity of land use in either the food or the biofuel sectors is carried out. It is shown that, with a highly inelastic demand for food, an increase in the productivity of land in agriculture will decrease the price of food in the short-run, only to increase it in the long-run as the stock, of fossil fuel is depleted.

To this aim it develops a dynamic modeling framework and takes the next step of testing it for cointegration. French data spanning fifty years up to 2009 are employed. It is found that when facing an increase of dwellings' real price, fuel demand remains stable in the short term whereas it increases significantly in the long term. Our results reflect the role of spatial organization in the formation of energy demand through the trade-off between housing prices and commuting costs. The modeling framework is then extended to assess the potential interest of combining housing policies aiming to drive down housing prices with carbon taxes so as to achieve a wide range of fuel demand reduction targets. It is shown that the relative contribution of housing policies increases with the degree of ambition of fuel consumption reduction targets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, when the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is low, when capital is not mobile internationally, and when the labor intensity of renewable generation is high relative to conventional generation, renewable electricity support policies may reduce the rate of equilibrium unemployment. The model is parameterized to represent the US economy, such that the magnitudes of quantities can be observed. Although there is some variation in the results depending on parameters, the findings suggest in general that reducing electricity sector emissions by 10% through renewable electricity support policies is likely to increase the equilibrium unemployment rate by about 0.1-0.3 percentage points.

Using Oregon community-level data and applying the threshold estimation method of Hansen (Econometrica 68(3):575-603, 2000), we are able to identify population thresholds that distinguish small communities from their larger counterparts based on significant structural differences in factors affecting net migration. Our results suggest that smaller communities are more at risk of population decline than larger ones. After controlling for spatial spillovers from neighboring communities, the average net migration rate is 3 % in the larger communities (roughly above 5,000 population), 2 % in the mid-sized communities (roughly between 1,250 and 5,000) and % in the smallest communities (roughly less than 1,250).

This article addresses the question how such subsidy should be designed. It is shown that the widely-used approach of a revenue-neutral fixed feed-in tariff can yield an optimal outcome under restrictive conditions only. It has to be adapted continuously as the electricity price changes. Moreover, funding the tariff by a surcharge on the electricity price has important implications for the design of the emission tax. The optimal tax rate has to be below the Pigovian level, differentiated across fossil fuels and adapted over time as the patterns of technological development change. These requirements may pose a formidable challenge for practical decision-making. However, it is important to point out that the eventual choices made with respect to the design and funding of a feed-in tariff have to be based on a careful and more comprehensive policy assessment, including, inter alia, economic effects beyond the electricity sector and existing institutional constraints.

This has implications for time-sensitive mitigation policies, in particular when considering relative impact of short-lifetime gases. CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from a coal-fired power plant in Brazil are used to estimate and compare the CO2-equivalent emissions based on standard practice global warming potentials GWP-100 with the less common GWP-50 and variable GWP for impact target years 2050 and 2100. Emission reductions appear lower for the variable metric, when the choice of target year is critical: 73% in 2100 and 60% in 2050. Reductions appear more favorable using a metric with a fixed time horizon, where the choice of time horizon is important: 77% for GWP-100 and 71% for GWP-50. Since CH4 emissions from mining have a larger contribution in the total emission of a plant with capture compared to one without, different perspectives on the impact of CH4 are analyzed. Use of variable GWP implies that CH4 emissions appear 39% greater in 2100 than with use of fixed GWP and 91% greater in 2050. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This new model is developed with a high time resolution among others to be able to analyse intermittent power production. Model results indicate that the RES target can be achieved with a diversity of options including investments in hydropower, wind power, high-voltage power lines for export, various heat pump technologies, energy efficiency measures and increased use of biodiesel in the transportation sector.

We use energy system optimisation results from the regionally disaggregated TIAM-ECN model as input to our study. This integrated assessment model is utilised to inspect the energy technology requirements for meeting a stringent global climate policy that achieves a stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere with a maximum additional radiative forcing of 2.9 W/m(2). This climate control target implies a massive deployment of renewable energy in the Middle East, with wind and solar power accounting for approximately 60% of total electricity supply in 2050: 900 TWh of an overall level of 1525 TWh would be generated from 210 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by the middle of the century. For this pervasive renewables diffusion scenario for the Middle East we estimate a total required local work force of ultimately about 155,000 direct and 115,000 indirect jobs, based on assumptions regarding which components of the respective wind and solar energy technologies can be manufactured in the region itself. All jobs generated through installation and O&M activities are assumed to be domestic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Aspirations to improve energy access and electrification rates in developing countries, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions, can be seriously hindered by the availability of low-cost capital for the necessary investments. We first provide a brief description of the theoretical foundations for financing constraints in the energy sector. Then, using a broad range of alternate assumptions we introduce capital supply curves to an energy system model for Sub-Saharan Africa, with a specific focus on the power sector. Our results portray the effect of capital cost on technology selection in electricity generation, specifically how limited capital supply decreases investments to capital-intensive zero-emission technologies. As a direct consequence, the emission price required to meet given emission targets is considerably increased when compared to case that disregards the capital constraints. Finally, we discuss possible policy instruments for resolving the constraints. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite its many advantages, growing penetrations of this highly variable and somewhat unpredictable energy source pose new challenges for electricity industry operation. One issue receiving growing attention is the so-called 'merit order effect' of wind generation in wholesale electricity markets. Wind has very low operating costs and therefore tends to displace higher cost conventional generation from market dispatch, reducing both wholesale prices and conventional plant outputs. This paper extends the current literature on this effect through an empirical study employing a range of econometric techniques to quantify the impacts of growing wind penetrations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The results suggest that wind is having a marked impact on spot market prices and, while wind is primarily offsetting higher operating cost gas generation, it is now also significantly reducing dispatch of emissions intensive brown coal generation. Great care needs to be taken in extrapolating these results to longer-term implications, however, the study does propose a methodology for assessing this effect, highlights the impacts that wind is already having on NEM outcomes and suggests promising directions for future research.

Proposals for one common form of renewable energy, commercial wind farms, are frequently met with forceful local opposition. Dissatisfied with simplistic explanations for this opposition (i.e., NIMBY), social scientists have urged a more nuanced understanding of public attitudes towards wind energy and other renewables. Based on a survey of residents of coastal Michigan, this article explores the foie of general values and beliefs in shaping attitudes towards the potential development of commercial wind energy projects in or near respondents' communities. Structural equation modeling reveals that support of commercial wind energy depends largely on a belief that wind farms will provide economic benefits to the community. Underlying values have substantial and important indirect effects on beliefs regarding the likely economic outcomes of wind farm development. Altruistic values buoy wind energy attitudes, while values of traditionalism diminish wind energy support. The pivotal role of values in attitudes towards renewables lends support for more participatory development processes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Their deployment strategies differ based on the extent to which deregulation of the gas and electricity market has been successful. A broad debate has been held on the various assumptions justifying the cost-benefit analyses and the permutations of these assumptions. What has been paid less attention is to what end is a smart meter being employed towards. A corollary research question is whether the deployment plan is targeting the correct sector. If the purpose is to introduce automated meter reading across the housing sector then a better strategy would be to legislate for accurate monthly bills, as in Sweden. Allowing suppliers to have greater flexibility will likely reward rather than stifle the design of competition. If the purpose is to manage demand then it may be that it's working with complex tariffs and not the meter per se that counts. The high consuming end-use categories and profile classes would be better placed for that exercise. Innovation theory also supports the targeting of new innovations to larger consumers, allowing metering innovations to proceed along historical trajectories. (C) 2043 Elsevier Ltd.

CPA strategies are examined in connection to two policy instruments the EU emission-trading scheme and the Swedish electricity certificate scheme. These instruments are the main drivers of climate-related investments in the sector. The study treats CPA as a form of institutional work and examines reasons for companies to seek to maintain/disrupt institutions. The study finds that CPA is driven primarily by the need to manage external resource dependencies and that where risks are more acute, companies are more likely to seek to disrupt regulative institutions. However, the study also shows that respondents' appraisals of policy instruments are based on a convergent set of shared values (cognitive institutions) that form the basis of CPA and which actors do not seek to disrupt despite resource-based risks. CPA is thus characterised as a means to transmute cognitively held values and beliefs into regulative institutions. The study concludes with implications for policymakers and theory.

Optimization of energy planning is therefore, key to achieving the overall planning goals. The hierarchical multi-objective policy optimization is a policy-centric multi-level bottom-up iterative approach, designed from a developing country perspective, utilizing the optimality principle of dynamic programming. It is applied to the Indian power sector by grouping the strategies into three portfolios, namely, power generation mix, demand side efficiency group and supply side efficiency group. Each portfolio is optimized taking into account the objectives of cost minimization and comprehensive risk and barrier reduction. The portfolios are further combined and optimized at a higher level with respect to higher level objectives, namely, economic growth, energy equity, energy security and climate sustainability. This paper focuses on the second level optimization utilizing data envelopment analysis (DEA). Both the deterministic and stochastic variations have been analysed and the results compared in respect of unrestricted as well as restricted weight models. The analysis shows that weight-restricted stochastic DEA model is most appropriate for efficiency optimization of power sector strategies. The methodology can be effectively used for energy planning in developing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, the impact of changes in future residential use on the electricity distribution grids is assessed by using a scenario-based methodology to model residential loads. It illustrates that scenarios resulting from varied economic and demographic developments, but also driven by the focus of energy policies, can have considerable consequences on the loading and the resulting required network capacities of electricity distribution grids. A strategy for network operators to cope with these changes and optimise the utilisation of their grids is to use the possibilities to control flexible loads to reduce peak loads and shift demands. This article shows that if these loads can be managed in such way, the electricity profiles can be flattened significantly. For the case of the Netherlands, the peak demands in residential areas can be reduced with 35-67% in various scenarios. Load-flow analyses of medium voltage networks show that a load management strategy to reduce peak demands can realise a reduction of 21-40% for required capacity of cables and transformers. This makes a reduction 45-72% in investment costs possible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Veldman, Else; Slootweg, Han (J.

The elite sets income tax rates to maximize its own welfare by extracting rents, thereby influencing the spatial structure of the economy and changing the available range of consumption goods. We show that either unskilled labour mobility, or rent-seeking behaviour, or both, are likely to favour the occurence of agglomeration and of urban primacy. In equilibrium, the elite may tax the unskilled workers but does not tax the skilled workers, and there are rural-urban transfers towards the agglomeration. The size of the elite and the magnitude of the tax burden that falls on the unskilled decrease with product differentiation and with the expenditure share for manufacturing goods. All these results are broadly in line with observed patterns of urban primacy and economic development in Sub-Saharan African countries.","[Behrens, Kristian] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Canada Res Chair, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bala, Alain Pholo] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Johannesburg,"Behrens, K (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Canada Res Chair, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",behrens.kristian@uqam.ca; apholo@uj.ac.za,,"PHOLO BALA, Alain/0000-0001-5541-5316",,,,,50,10,11,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

It suggests that tensions between the horns of the trilemma, in large part, explain Indonesia's current, profoundly suboptimal, energy policy. While these tensions are not inherently incapable of resolution, such resolution would require good governance at both state and global levels.

In addition to offering improved performance, this preference was notably due to a much cheaper cost of use, in line with the taxation on both fuel types. But the advantage of diesel technology does not clearly seem to extend to energy and CO2 savings. In this paper, French trends over the last 15 years and latest annual available statistics about both diesel car ownership and use are analysed, on the basis of the ParcAuto panel data source. The results notably show that, from the moment the gap between fuel prices was reduced, the annual mileage amounts of diesel cars have fallen faster than those of petrol cars. A specific section summarizes the results of our work on the behaviour of French households who chose to replace their petrol car with a diesel. Detailed examination of these switching behaviours, involving a complex set of variables, confirms that there are increases in driving associated with new diesel motorists. The final section of this paper briefly discusses recent evolutions of fuel expenditures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These factors decisively affect the quality of life (public health and safety) as well as local and global environmental protection. Comparing various lifecycle assessments, this paper will suggest that a shift from coal to shale gas would benefit public health, the safety of workers, local environmental protection, water consumption, and the land surface. Most likely, shale gas also comes with a smaller GHG footprint than coal. However, shale gas extraction can affect water safety. This paper also discusses related aspects that exemplify how shale gas can be more beneficial in the short and long term. First, there are technical solutions readily available to fix the most crucial problems of shale gas extraction, such as methane leakages and other geo-hazards. Second, shale gas is best equipped to smoothen the transition to an age of renewable energy. Finally, this paper will recommend hybrid policy regulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

An instrumental variable random-effect model for the location of non-renewals and a hazard model for the timing of non-renewals indicate that counties with high property tax rates have 0.8% lower odds of a non-renewal, transition slower to a rapid state of non-renewals by 4%, and transition faster to the slow state by 6%. This suggests differential assessment programs provide benefits to tax payers by preserving agricultural land and reducing how quickly development pressure causes non-renewals, and ultimately development, in farm communities. Counties at higher elevations transition faster to a rapid state of non-renewals by 4% and transition slower to the slow state by 2%.

This paper argues that uncertainty can be better understood, and the strategic and policy effectiveness of scenarios or pathways thereby improved, through a systematic categorisation of the different kinds of certain and uncertain elements of which the future is comprised. To achieve this, this paper makes two novel methodological contributions. First it proposes a system conceptualisation which is based on a detailed description of the dynamics of the actors and institutions relevant to the system under study, iteratively linked to a detailed representation of the technological system. Second, it argues that as a result of developing this actor-based low carbon scenarios approach it is possible to characterise future elements of the system as either predetermined, actor contingent or non-actor contingent. An outline scenario approach is presented, based on these two contributions. It emerges that the different categories of future element are associated with different types of uncertainty and each prompt different strategic policy responses. This categorisation of future elements therefore clarifies the relationship of scenario content to specific types of policy response, and thus improves the policy tractability of resulting scenarios.

Chinese solar PV cell and module makers quickly dominated global sales in that industry, while the country's wind turbine producers became poised for significant exports after capturing their rapidly growing home market. In countries like the US, Chinese RE technology strength has been met with claims of excessive governmental support of exports. This study examines to what extent Chinese firms' solar PV and wind technology successes have been enabled by policy supports, and whether those policies appear to have been driven by broader goals versus RE export promotion per se. The evidence suggests that governmental policy toward both wind and solar originated in a push for export-competitive Chinese companies. But the specifics differed substantially due to the particular requirements of building technological capabilities in each: export readiness necessitated substantial support for domestic installation of wind but not solar PV power. The findings also suggest that as the decade of the 2000s progressed, environmental goals played an increasing role alongside export promotion in motivating and shaping Chinese RE technology policies.

First conservation potentials in space heating for two different scenarios with different levels of investment in energy efficiency are quantified. This was done relying on statistical data and future projections of the development of the building stock. Then economic modeling was used to estimate the effects on energy sector and the economy at large. The results show that a rather modest increase resulting in a few percent rise in annual construction and renovation investments can decrease total primary energy consumption 3.8-5.3% by 2020 and 4.7-6.8% by 2050 compared to a baseline scenario. On the short term a slight decrease in the level of GDP and employment is expected. On the medium to long term, however, the effects on both would be positive. Furthermore, a significant drop in harmful emissions and hence external costs is anticipated. Overall, a clear net benefit is expected from improving energy efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This article, based on data and statistics available up to 2008, studies features of China's RE technology innovation and problems thereof. It finds that national science and technology programs are the main aspect of China's RE technology innovation, and most of R&D funds for the RE technology come from China's three main national programs. Besides, the overall expenditures on RE technology innovation constitute only a small proportion of China's total domestic R&D funding and seem not enough. This paper also finds that, compared with research and development stages of RE technology, the demonstration and diffusion of RE technology in China are given less attention and thus are relatively less sufficient. Furthermore, influenced by China's traditional scientific research system, there appears lack of sufficient incentives and opportunities for private sectors to fully participate in RE technology innovation because most national programs are undertaken by universities or research institutes.

In order to resolve problems arising from combining the national and local renewable energy development plan, a total target and period target decomposition model of renewable energy is proposed which considers the resource distribution and energy consumption of different provinces as well as the development characteristics of various renewable energy industries. In the model, the total proposed target is comprised of three shares: basic share, fixed share and floating share target. The target distributed for each province is then determined by the preference relation. That is, when total renewable energy target is distributed, the central government is more concerned about resources potential or energy consumption. Additionally, the growth models for various renewable energy industries are presented, and the period targets of renewable energy in various provinces are proposed in line with regional economic development targets. In order to verify whether the energy target can be achieved, only wind power, solar power, and hydropower are considered in this study. To convenient to assess the performance of local government, the two year period is chosen as an evaluation cycle in the paper. The renewable energy targets per two-year period for each province are calculated based on the overall national renewable energy target, energy requirements and resources distribution. Setting provincial period targets will help policy makers to better implement and supervise the overall renewable energy plan. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

National and State policies aimed at reducing dependence on imported fuels and energy can increase local production of fuels and energy, impacting demand on local water resources. This article details the development of a model-based assessment on water consumption and withdrawal pertaining to the use-phase of conventional and alternative transportation modes based on regional energy and fuel production. An extensive literature review details water consumption from fuel extraction, processing, and distribution as well as power plant operations. Using Model-Based Systems Engineering principles and the Systems Modeling Language, a multi-level, multi-modal framework was developed and applied to the Metro Atlanta transportation system consisting of conventional and alternative vehicles across varying conditions. According to the analysis, vehicles powered by locally produced biofuels and electricity (assuming average local grid mix for charging) consume more water than locally refined gasoline and CNG-powered vehicles. Improvements in power plant technologies, electricity generation (e.g., use of solar and wind versus hydro power) and vehicle efficiencies can reduce such water consumption significantly. Total water withdrawal for each vehicle and fuel is significantly greater than water consumption. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Insights and challenges from past technological and economic transformations,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy transition; Climate change; Industrial Revolution,ENERGY; GROWTH; POLICY,"Recent efforts to promote a transition to a low carbon economy have been influenced by suggestions that a low carbon transition offers challenges and might yield economic benefits comparable to those of the previous industrial revolutions. This paper examines these arguments and the challenges facing a low carbon transition, by drawing on recent thinking on the technological, economic and institutional factors that enabled and sustained the first (British) industrial revolution, and the role of 'general purpose technologies' in stimulating and sustaining this and subsequent industrial transformation processes that have contributed to significant macroeconomic gains. These revolutions involved profound, long drawn-out changes in economy, technology and society; and although their energy transitions led to long-run economic benefits, they took many decades to develop. To reap significant long-run economic benefits from a low carbon transition sooner rather than later would require systemic efforts and incentives for low carbon innovation and substitution of high-carbon technologies. We conclude that while achieving a low carbon transition may require societal changes on a scale comparable with those of previous industrial revolutions, this transition does not yet resemble previous industrial revolutions. A successful low carbon transition would, however, amount to a different kind of industrial revolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Pearson, Peter J.

However, in the African continent, between 1960 and 2007 Kenya and Zimbabwe were among countries with the highest PV dissemination, while Ghana was among countries with the least disseminations. Analysing empirical data through the lens of the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) theory, the article aims to uncover the drivers underpinning the disparate dissemination trends of PV in the three countries within the stated period and to tease out lessons apropos replicating the successes within Kenya and Zimbabwe in Ghana. SCOT theory is chosen because it provides an excellent framework for analysing the social shaping of PV's development and diffusion processes in these countries. This theory posits that the shape and meanings of a technology do not reside in it, but are acquired through the heterogeneity of social interactions.

Estimation of these models is complicated both by the difficulty of estimating models with possibly thousands of coefficients and also by the incidental parameters problem; that is, noisy estimates of the fixed effects when the time dimension is short contaminate the estimates of the common parameters due to the nonlinearity of the problem. We propose a simple variation of existing bias-corrected estimators, which can exploit the additivity of the effects for numerical optimization.

The focus of this viewpoint is on how incentives for improving energy efficiency are affected by pricing principles in two specific areas: housing rents and district heating fees. Many countries have regulations that affect how housing rent is determined. It has been shown that cost-based rents reduce incentives for energy efficiency. The same may occur if rent is related to qualities of the apartment, if these qualities do not include the indoor climate. There have been concerns that district heating companies might respond to lower sales by increasing prices, thus reducing any incentive to reduce energy consumption. It is argued that this will not happen if fixed and variable fees correctly reflect the cost structure. Empirical studies show that it is common to have a variable fee that is higher than the marginal cost, partly because of monopoly elements in the market. This type of pricing will actually strengthen the incentives for energy efficiency investments compared to theoretically correct pricing principles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand the performance of a distribution network in the face of supply disruptions, it would be helpful for policy makers to quantitatively evaluate the robustness of the network, i.e., its ability of maintaining a supply-demand balance on individual nodes. In this paper, we first define a notion of network entropy to macroscopically characterize distribution robustness with respect to the dynamics of energy flows. Further, we look into how microscopic evaluation based on a failure spreading model helps us determine the extent to which disruptions on one node may affect the others. We take the natural gas distribution network in the USA as an example to demonstrate the introduced concepts and methods. Specifically, the proposed macroscopic and microscopic evaluations provide us a means of precisely identifying transmission bottlenecks in the U.S. interstate pipeline network, ranking the effects of supply disruptions on individual nodes, and planning geographically advantageous locations for natural gas storage. These findings can offer policy makers, planners, and network managers with further insights into emergency planning as well as possible design improvement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The existing research is extensively concerned with the relationships between urbanization, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in recent years, but little attention has been paid to the regional differences. This paper is an analysis of the impact of urbanization on energy consumption and CO2 emissions at the national and regional levels using the STIRPAT model and provincial panel data from 1995 to 2010 in China. The results showed that urbanization increases energy consumption and CO2 emissions in China. The effects of urbanization on energy consumption vary across regions and decline continuously from the western region to the central and eastern regions. The impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions in the central region is greater than that in the eastern region. The impact of urbanization on energy consumption is greater than the impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region. And some evidences support the argument of compact city theory. These results not only contribute to advancing the existing literature, but also merit particular attention from policy makers and urban planners in China. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the fast depletion and high cost of fossil fuel, this is now a threat to sustainable growth. Attention is now focused on renewable energies as an alternative. In Malaysia, renewable energy was included in the 8th Malaysia Plan (2000-2005) with a target of 500 MW out of the 20,000 MW total generation capacity. However, for the first 10 years (2000-2010) only 41.5 MW planting up has been achieved. This paper recommends strategies, implementation mechanism, and financial framework to ensure success of the initiatives. Some of the recommendations were currently being implemented such as the Green Technology Fund and the Fit-In-Tariff. In addition, this paper proposes the incorporation of a Malaysian Renewable Energy Development Board with wide legislative and executive powers, that would be a strong champion of the RE initiatives. Its primary function would be, inter alia, cross-ministry coordination, tariff fixation, regulating utilization of renewable biomass waste, institute fiscal incentives such as investment incentives, tax holidays, removal of barriers, and initiate government funded Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) initiatives.

This growth has largely been driven by socio-economic and political imperatives to improve rural livelihood and by technological innovation. Based on a content analysis of 232 scholarly articles, the literature is categorized into four focal lenses: technology, institutional, viability and user-centric. We find that the first two dominate the RE debate. The viability lens has been used less frequently, whilst the user-centric lens began to engage scholars as late as 2007. We provide an overview of the technological, institutional and viability lenses, and elaborate upon the user-centric lens in greater detail. For energy policy and practice, we combine the four lenses to develop a business model framework that policy makers, practitioners and investors could use to assess RE projects or to design future rural electrification strategies.

This paper examines the causal relationship between energy consumption and agricultural value added, controlling for trade openness, in Tunisia from 19130 to 2007. The relationship is investigated at aggregated as well as disaggregated components of energy consumption, including oil and electricity. Using Granger's technique, it is shown that various results are obtained regarding the direction of causality between competing variables. Nevertheless, the most common finding suggest that trade openness and both aggregated and disaggregated energy consumption Granger causes agricultural value added. Therefore, the energy-led growth and trade-led growth hypotheses are supported in the Tunisian agriculture sector. An important policy implication resulting from this study is that energy can be considered as a limiting factor to agriculture value added and, therefore, shocks to energy supply would have a negative impact onto agriculture performance. Furthermore, trade liberalization seems to be a stimulus factor to the Tunisian agriculture development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Taylor, S",,,,"Taylor, Simon",,,The ranking of negative-cost emissions reduction measures,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Emissions; Abatement; Cost-effectiveness,CURVES; ENERGY,"A flaw has been identified in the calculation of the cost-effectiveness in marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs). The problem affects negative-cost emissions reduction measures-those that produce a return on investment. The resulting ranking sometimes favours measures that produce low emissions savings and is therefore unreliable. The issue is important because incorrect ranking means a potential failure to achieve the best-value outcome. A simple mathematical analysis shows that not only is the standard cost-effectiveness calculation inadequate for ranking negative-cost measures, but there is no possible replacement that satisfies reasonable requirements. Furthermore, the concept of negative cost-effectiveness is found to be unsound and its use should be avoided. Among other things, this means that MACCs are unsuitable for ranking negative-cost measures. As a result, MACCs produced by a range of organizations including UK government departments may need to be revised. An alternative partial ranking method has been devised by making use of Pareto optimization. The outcome can be presented as a stacked bar chart that indicates both the preferred ordering and the total emissions saving available for each measure without specifying a cost-effectiveness.

The results demonstrate that the rise of the residential consumption level played a dominant role in the growth of residential indirect emissions. The persistent decline of the carbon emission intensity of industrial sectors presented a significant negative effect on the emissions. The change in the intermediate demand of industrial sectors resulted in an overall positive effect, except in the initial years. The increase in population prompted the indirect emissions to a certain extent; however, population size is no longer the main reason for the growth of the emissions. The change in the consumption structure showed a weak positive effect, demonstrating the importance for China to control and slow down the increase in the emissions while in the process of optimizing the residential consumption structure. The results imply that the means for restructuring the economy and improving efficiency, rather than for lowering the consumption scale, should be adopted by China to achieve the targets of energy conservation and emission reduction.

We proposed five Plans for grouping buildings in the complex and estimated the annual 8760-hourly demands for electricity, cooling, heating, and hot water. For each Plan, we built about ten Scenarios for system construction. Then, we simulated the operation of the system to find the fuel consumption, electricity purchase, and heat recovery. Applying the local rates to the amounts of fuel and electricity, we estimated the operating costs. Combining the operating cost with the initial cost associated with the purchase and construction of the system, we calculated the payback periods for the scenarios. We found that the payback period can be as short as two years for smartly grouped buildings with a generator capacity of around 50% of the peak electricity demand.

Using a biophysical biomass-balance model, we analyze how these factors affect global primary bioenergy potentials in 2050. The model calculates biomass supply and demand balances for eleven world regions, eleven food categories, seven food crop types and two livestock categories, integrating agricultural forecasts and scenarios with a consistent global land use and NPP database. The TREND scenario results in a global primary bioenergy potential of 77 EJ/yr, alternative assumptions on food-system changes result in a range of 26-141 EJ/yr. Exclusion of areas for biodiversity conservation and inaccessible land in failed states reduces the bioenergy potential by up to 45%. Optimistic assumptions on future energy crop yields increase the potential by up to 48%, while pessimistic assumptions lower the potential by 26%. We conclude that the design of sustainable bioenergy crop production policies needs to resolve difficult trade-offs such as food vs. energy supply, renewable energy vs. biodiversity conservation or yield growth vs. reduction of environmental problems of intensive agriculture.

Eight scenarios of Aggregation Groupings over the U.S. were formed to estimate overall system cost. Transmission costs outweighed cost savings due to aggregation for all scenarios and nearly all Aggregation Groupings. East-west transmission layouts had the highest overall cost, and interconnecting ERCOT to adjacent FERC Regions resulted in increased costs, both due to limited existing transmission capacity. This study found little economic benefit of aggregating electric load alone (e.g., without aggregating renewable generators simultaneously), except in the West and Northwest U.S. If aggregation of load alone is desired, small, regional consolidations yield the lowest overall cost. This study neither examines nor precludes benefits of interconnecting geographically-dispersed renewable generators with load.

It analyzes the economic impact resulting from the participation of North African and European companies during construction and operation of CSP plants. The assessment is based on a self-developed solar technologies market development model (STMD) that includes economic and technical requirements and constraints for the creation of a local CSP market. In-depth interviews with industry stakeholders provide specific input, validate the calculations and complement the quantitative model results and conclusions. Long-term potential for locally generated revenues from CSP plant construction are modeled and lead to a share of local revenues of up to 60%. Potential market size of solar power plants in North Africa could reach total revenues of 120 Billion euros and thus demand for components and services contribute to national gross domestic products significantly. Recommendations are given for regional industry cooperation and policy actions for the support of local and international CSP industry in North Africa in order to improve the investment environment and growth of renewable energies in the region.

The results demonstrate that states offering cash incentives such as rebates and grants experienced more extensive and rapid deployment of grid-tied PV technology than states without cash incentives over the study period.

In the future, more flexible nuclear systems could enable wind to achieve a 50% share of the renewable contribution to the energy mix. Small and medium-sized reactors (SMRs) could provide firming power generation to back-up the supply from renewable resources and follow-load. This study involves the hypothetical combination of an off-shore wind farm and a SMR, operated together as a virtual power plant (VPP). Results using wind data from the North Sea indicate that the combination results in 80% less wind power variation to the grid, effectively creating a virtual baseload power plant. This gain comes at the loss of 30% SMR capacity utilization. The research identified that the reduction of 1000 MW off-shore wind farm variability was best achieved with 700 MW SMRs using 100 MW modules. In demand-following mode the VPP could maneuver output to improve synchronization with demand by 60-70% over a wind-only system. Power variability was indifferent to the SMR module size. The VPP could not reduce 100% of the wind variation, as additional balancing measures (e.g., smart grid, storage, and hybrid-nuclear systems) are still needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Microalgal biodiesel, one type of advanced biofuel, has the qualities and potential to meet the RFS's requirement. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of four microalgal biodiesel production conditions was investigated using a process LCA model with Monte Carlo simulation to assess global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication, ozone depletion and ecotoxicity potentials. The four conditions represent minimum and maximum production efficiencies and different sources of carbon dioxide and nutrient resources, i.e. synthetic and waste resources. The GWP results of the four CO2 microalgal biodiesel production conditions showed that none of the assumed production conditions meet the RFS's GHG requirement. The GWP results are sensitive to energy consumption in harvesting process. Other impacts such as eutrophication, ozone depletion and ecotoxicity potentials, are sensitive to percent lipid content of microalgae, service lifetime of PBRs and quantity of hexane in extraction process, respectively. Net energy ratio and other emissions should be included in future RFS for a more sustainable fuel. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Economics data and regulatory parameters are also included. The wind energy potential of the state of Iowa has been estimated: the resulting average AEP of Iowa is 914 TWh and the potential total installed capacity is 302 GW. A sensitivity analysis of the influence of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) shows that a PPA of 6.5 c$/kWh would enable to exploit the 85% of the buildable land with an IRR greater than 15%.

Three cement output projections are developed based on analyses of historical production and physical and macroeconomic drivers. For each of these three production projections, energy savings and CO2 emission reduction potentials are estimated in a best practice scenario and two continuous improvement scenarios relative to a frozen scenario. The results reveal the potential for cumulative final energy savings of 27.1 to 37.5 exajoules and energy-related direct emission reductions of 3.2 to 4.4 gigatonnes in 2011-2030 under the best practice scenarios. The continuous improvement scenarios produce cumulative final energy savings of 6.0 to 18.9 exajoules and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.0 to 2.4 gigatonnes. This analysis highlights that increasing energy efficiency is the most important policy measure for reducing the cement industry's energy and emissions intensity, given the current state of the industry and the unlikelihood of significant carbon capture and storage before 2030. In addition, policies to reduce total cement production offer the most direct way of reducing total energy consumption and CO2 emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These data are presented as a case study in the development of an 'efficiency technology database' which can be expanded and published as a resource to other researchers and policy makers seeking scenarios that optimize efficiency policies and forecast their likely impacts on energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. The use of this data to evaluate cost-effectiveness according to a variety of metrics is demonstrated using the example of one refrigerator-freezer product class. Cost-effectiveness is then evaluated in terms of cost of conserved energy for refrigerators, room air conditioners, water heaters, cooking equipment, central air conditioners and gas furnaces. The resulting potential of cost-effective improvement ranges from 1% to 53% of energy savings, with a typical potential of 15-20%.

The United States and Venezuela have already begun to implement shifts in national behavior and policy, suggesting that they are expecting this transition within the next couple of years. Although nothing is guaranteed until after the Venezuelan presidential election of 2012, if President Chavez retains his grip on power past that point, expect CITGO to be sold by the year 2014, if not shortly thereafter. If the US Congress decides to impose CISADA sanctions on Venezuela or declare it a state sponsor of terrorism. CITGO could be sold significantly sooner. However, such legislative action seems unlikely. A move to sell CITGO would have far-reaching ramifications for both countries' energy and foreign policies. This restructuring of energy geopolitics could potentially lead to more conflicts in the international arena. With significantly less economic leverage on each other, the United States and Venezuela would be free to harden their rhetoric and policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper addresses that gap by presenting a scenario exercise using an integrated suite of sectoral and whole systems models to explore potential energy pathways in the UK transport sector. Techno-economic driven scenarios are contrasted with one in which social change is strongly influenced by concerns about energy use, the environment and well-being. The 'what if' Lifestyle scenario reveals a future in which distance travelled by car is reduced by 74% by 2050 and final energy demand from transport is halved compared to the reference case. Despite the more rapid uptake of electric vehicles and the larger share of electricity in final energy demand, it shows a future where electricity decarbonisation could be delayed. The paper illustrates the key trade-off between the more aggressive pursuit of purely technological fixes and demand reduction in the transport sector and concludes there are strong arguments for pursuing both demand and supply side solutions in the pursuit of emissions reduction and energy security.

These are expected to substitute for oil, complementing first generation biofuels. While the long-term substitution potential is uncertain, it may amount to a quarter of current fuel consumption in the EU. Various design approaches for gasifying biomass have been under development for decades but the current EU focus is on nine smaller scale demonstration plants, involving three technological trajectories. The purpose of this paper is to identify policy challenges and discuss options for moving to a larger scale diffusion of gasified biomass in the EU. Such a move requires that technical and market uncertainties are handled by policy. Substantial demonstration and other risk absorption schemes will have to be developed to shift technical risks to society at large. Market uncertainties need to be reduced by a regulatory framework that ensures that markets are formed. A range of instruments for forming markets is assessed. It is argued that in order for the policy to be effective, markets for all three trajectories should be created in parallel. This leads us to suggest either dedicated quotas or a feed-in-law. Yet, both these instruments have drawbacks and a 'bridging policy' is probably necessary. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As such, the conventional approach to aggregating growth across countries suffers from sensitivity to exchange rates, as well as from the possibility of aggregate growth rates not being convex combinations of individual growth rates. This article introduces a new methodology in aggregating per capita growth rates that does not suffer from the drawbacks of the conventional approach. Using a welfare-based approach, it is shown that the proposed methodology is robust w.r.t. exchange rates and generates weights that always add up to unity, thus avoiding the anomalies that are inherent in the conventional approach. The methodology proposed in the article is applied to calculate aggregate growth rates of 33 developing member countries as well as five regional groupings, and the results are compared with those arising from the conventional approach. A number of insights arise that were previously hidden or inaccessible.","Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Son, HH (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines.",hhson@adb.org,,,,,,,2,2,3,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0305-9049,,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

There are multiple equilibrium outcomes, and any player may take advantage in this game due to the indifference problem of the players. However, if we utilize the validated equilibrium refinement, then the results present that the later the players enter a directional market, the greater the benefits they receive. If a player's preference relation is lexicographic ordering, then we obtain results identical to the validated equilibrium outcomes.

It uses four social capital measures and a detailed urbanization variable. Association membership, social trust, and institutional trust were found to be equally high in rural and urban areas. Voluntary work in associations, however, was found to be significantly higher in rural areas than in city areas. Thus, the high level of voluntary associational work provides some indication of higher social capital in rural areas.","[Sorensen, Jens F.

Desalination is a feasible option that can solve the problem of water scarcity in some areas, but it is a very energy intensive technology. Moreover, the rising cost of fossil fuel, its uncertain availability and associated environmental concerns have led to a need for future desalination plants to use other energy sources, such as renewables and nuclear. Nuclear desalination has thus the potential to be an important option for safe, economic and reliable supply of large amounts of fresh water to meet the ever-increasing worldwide water demand. Different approaches to use nuclear power for seawater desalination have been considered including utilisation of the waste heat from nuclear reactors to further reduce the cost of nuclear desalination. Various options to implement nuclear desalination relay mainly on policy making based on socio-economic and environmental impacts of available technologies. This paper examines nuclear desalination costs and proposes a methodology for exploring interactions between critical parameters. (C) 2014 International Atomic Energy Agency.

The politics of resource expropriation,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nationalization; National oil companies; Resource nationalism; Bayesian statistics,COMPANIES; DEMOCRACY,"Why do leaders nationalize the oil industry? In line with a general utility-maximizing theory, I argue that leaders nationalize to maximize state revenues while minimizing costs. The latter includes international retaliation and domestic political constraints. Using a novel longitudinal dataset on the establishment of national oil companies (NOCs), the empirical evidence presented in this paper lends support to four primary findings. States are most likely to establish NOCs (1) in periods of high oil prices, when the risks of expropriation are outweighed by the financial benefits; (2) in non-democratic systems, where executive constraints are limited; (3) in waves, that is, after other countries have nationalized, reflecting reduced likelihood of international retaliation; and, though with weaker empirical support, (4) in political settings marked by resource nationalism. This last factor is proxied by OPEC membership in large-N analysis and, in a two-case comparison, by the difference in retained profits between the host and foreign governments. The theory and empirics presented here offer some clues for policy makers and multinational companies alike as to when to expect leaders to opt for nationalization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Cumulative Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions per kWh electricity produced are shown in order to provide the basis for comparison with existing literature. Minimising negative impacts on human health is one of the key elements of policy making towards sustainable development: besides their direct impacts on quality of life, HHI also trigger other impacts, e.g. external costs in the health care system. These HHI are measured using the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods ReCiPe with its three different perspectives and IMPACT2002+. Total HHI as well as the shares of the contributing damage categories vary largely between these perspectives and methods. Impacts due to climate change, human toxicity, and particulate matter formation are the main contributors to total HHI. Independently of the perspective chosen, the overall impacts on human health from nuclear power and renewables are substantially lower than those caused by coal power, while natural gas can have lower HHI than nuclear and some renewables. Fossil fuel combustion as well as coal, uranium and metal mining are the life cycle stages generating the highest HHI. (C) 2014 International Atomic Energy Agency. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper gives an overview of the latest progress of the SH-ETS and sheds some light on the features of key design components, such as the threshold for inclusion, sector coverage, cap setting, allowance allocation and the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system. Based on a concern that manipulative principles and economic dynamics may lead to uncertainties and ultimately influence the emission reduction effect of the scheme, this paper conducts an evaluation of potential uncertainties, such as those caused by changes in patterns of economic growth, strategic trading activities related to the bankable allowances, carbon leakage risks and insufficient MRV capabilities. To advance the experiment to reality, this paper suggests some changes are made to the pilot, which include adjusting the allowance allocation principles to facilitate change in the domestic energy structure, improving the disclosure of emission data to guarantee information symmetry, gauging the carbon leakage risks to strengthen compliance, and introducing risk management for non-regulated players and derivatives products.

We then establish multi-index and multi-indicator constitutive (MIMIC) equation to measure the ratio of hidden carbon emissions to total emissions, which is further considered the basis of the measurement model. Results of regression analysis carried out on labor income share show that hidden carbon emissions do have a positive effect on labor income share.

EVaR has an advantage over the conventional quantile-based VaR (QVaR) of being more sensitive to the magnitude of extreme losses. EVaR can also be used for calculating QVaR and expected shortfall (ES) by exploiting the one-to-one mapping from expectiles to quantiles, and the relationship between VaR and ES. Previous studies on conditional EVaR estimation only considered parametric autoregressive model set-ups, which account for the stochastic dynamics of asset returns but ignore other exogenous economic and investment related factors. Our approach overcomes this drawback and allows expectiles to be modeled directly using covariates that may be exogenous or lagged dependent in a flexible way. Risk factors associated with profits and losses can then be identified via the expectile regression at different levels of prudentiality. We develop a local linear smoothing technique for estimating the coefficient functions within an asymmetric least squares minimization set-up, and establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resultant estimator. To save computing time, we propose to use a one-step weighted local least squares procedure to compute the estimates. Our simulation results show that the computing advantage afforded by this one-step procedure over full iteration is not compromised by a deterioration in estimation accuracy. Real data examples are used to illustrate our method.

Thus, this paper deals with a broad literature review on innovation drivers and barriers, and an analysis of the knowledge induced by public research and development expenditures (R&D) and patents in the energy sector. The cumulative knowledge stock induced by public R&D expenditures in 14 investigated lEA-countries is 1023 bn EUR in 2013. Nuclear energy has the largest share of 43.9 bn EUR, followed by energy efficiency accounting for 14.9 bn EUR, fossil fuels with 13.5 bn EUR, and renewable energy with 12.1 bn EUR. A regression analysis indicates a linear relation between the GDP and the cumulative knowledge, with each billion EUR of GDP leading to an additional knowledge of 3.1 mil EUR. However, linearity is not given for single energy technologies. Further, the results show that appropriate public R&D funding for research and development associated with a subsequent promotion of the market diffusion of a niche technology may lead to a breakthrough of the respective technology.

We develop a drivetrain choice model with economical, technical and social constraints on the current vehicle registrations and inventory. It estimates the demand for electric vehicles until 2030 for private and commercially registered cars as well as light commercial vehicles. The results show a replacement potential of almost one third of the total German annual mileage for these vehicles. The result has a high granularity to allow for detailed emission calculation along different spatial areas as well as vehicle and engine types. Besides a baseline forecast, our method allows for calculating different scenarios regarding policy actions or the future development of important parameters such as energy prices.

In the frame of a dynamic fundamental model, we show that there has been a continuous electricity price adaption process to market fundamentals. Furthermore, the fundamental drivers of prices differ among hours with different load profiles. Our results imply that renewable energies decrease market spot prices and have implications on the traditional fuel mix for electricity production. However, the prices for the final consumers increased overall because they must pay in addition the feed-in tariffs for the promotion of renewable energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The link between the CGE model and the microlevel is top-down, feeding changes in commodity prices, factor returns and employment by sector into a microsimulation model. The results suggest that policymakers face an equity-efficiency trade-off driven by the choice of revenue recycling options. When the additional revenue is used to raise welfare transfers to households, the reform is beneficial for lower income groups, but output levels decrease in all regions. However, when the energy tax revenue is used to lower distortionary labour taxes, the tax shift is slightly regressive. In this case, national GDP is hardly affected but regional production levels diverge. The impact of the environmental tax reform on income distribution depends strongly on changes in factor prices and welfare payments, whereas sector composition is an important determinant for regional impact variation.

This paper considers distributional implications of the RET for different energy users. Using time-series regression, we show that the increasing amount of wind energy has placed considerable downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices through the so-called merit order effect. On the other hand, RET costs are passed on to consumers in the form of retail electricity price premiums. Our findings highlight likely significant redistributive transfers between different energy user classes under current RET arrangements. In particular, some energy-intensive industries are benefiting from lower wholesale electricity prices whilst being largely exempted from contributing to the costs of the scheme. By contrast, many households are paying significant RET pass through costs whilst not necessarily benefiting from lower wholesale prices. A more equitable distribution of RET costs and benefits could be achieved by reviewing the scope and extent of industry exemptions and ensuring that methodologies to estimate wholesale price components in regulated electricity tariffs reflect more closely actual market conditions. More generally, these findings support the growing international appreciation that policy makers need to integrate distributional assessments into policy design and implementation.

Yet several political economy factors can severely constrain the implementation of these carbon pricing policies, including opposition of industrial sectors with a concentration of assets that would lose considerable value under such policies; the collective action nature of climate mitigation efforts; principal agent failures; and a low willingness-to-pay for climate mitigation by citizens. Real-world implementations of carbon pricing policies can thus fall short of the economically optimal outcomes envisioned in theory. Consistent with the general theory of the second-best, the presence of binding political economy constraints opens a significant opportunity space for the design of creative climate policy instruments with superior political feasibility, economic efficiency, and environmental efficacy relative to the constrained implementation of carbon pricing policies. This paper presents theoretical political economy frameworks relevant to climate policy design and provides corroborating evidence from the United States context. It concludes with a series of implications for climate policy making and argues for the creative pursuit of a mix of second-best policy instruments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

M., Lai K. P. Y. and Wojcik D. Integrating finance into global production networks, Regional Studies. While successful in its aim of globalizing' regional development, the global production network (GPN) approach has thus far paid less attention to the role of finance in the dynamics of the global economy and regional development. This lacuna is significant as finance is arguably even more globalized and networked than production. To address this gap the paper distils the concept of the global financial network (GFN) from financial geography and related scholarship, with advanced business services, world cities and offshore jurisdictions at the core. Interactions between the GPN and the GFN are discussed, focusing on the financing and financializing of GPNs and the co-evolution of globalization and financialization. Integrating finance into GPN research entails more than a simple extension of the approach; it would also enrich it conceptually, and enable it methodologically and empirically.","[Coe, Neil M.; Lai, Karen P.

It is when the damage and/or the initial stock of pollution are relatively large and when the natural rate of decay of pollution is relatively small that this rebound effect of clean technologies is strongest.

We examine the ways in which micro-hydro is engaged by people and organisations as a means of contributing to the UK's policy ambition for renewable energy. We bring to the fore the way in which expertise is used and contested. A web based review of micro-hydro schemes in the UK was undertaken and a detailed evaluation of two schemes in the North of England was conducted to determine how expertise and contestation figures in community schemes. Results demonstrate a rapid expansion of micro-hydro in the UK. Ownership/control is highly 'community based'. Until now research around micro-hydro has been dominated by technical approaches with schemes defined in terms of hardware. We propose a third dimension to Walker and Cass's (2007) classification of renewable energy developments: the environmental dimension. We suggest this dimension of micro-hydro is critical, both in terms of the extent to which resources can be realised but also the ways in which it might attract controversy, in particular around how expertise is used and valued.

Securitization of solar assets provides a potential solution to this,problem. This paper assesses the viability of solar asset-backed securities (ABS) as a lower cost financing mechanism and identifies policies that could facilitate implementation of securitization. First, traditional solar financing is examined to provide a baseline for cost comparisons. Next, the securitization process is modeled. The model enables identification of several junctures at which risk and uncertainty influence costs. Next, parameter values are assigned and used to generate cost estimates. Results show that, under reasonable assumptions, securitization of solar power purchase agreements (PPA) can significantly reduce project financing costs, suggesting that securitization is a viable mechanism for improving the financing of PV projects. The clear impediment to the successful launch of a solar ABS is measuring and understanding the riskiness of underlying assets. This study identifies three classes of policy intervention that lower the cost of ABS by reducing risk or by improving the measurement of risk: (i) standardization of contracts and the contracting process, (ii) improved access to contract and equipment performance data, and (iii) geographic diversification.

Firm level data from Swedish manufacturing spanning over the period 1990-2004 is used for the analysis. Results show that EP has improved in all the sectors and there is an evidence of decoupling of output production growth and CO2 emissions.

In the paper, the components generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (CGARCH) model is utilized to decompose conditional oil volatility into permanent oil volatility and transitory oil volatility Respectively reflecting fundamental-driven and random shifts in oil volatility, they are expected to exert differential effects on aggregate investment. Adopting a vector autoregression (VAR) framework to allow feedback effects between aggregate investment and its determinants, the paper documents evidence supporting the adverse effects of conditional oil volatility, permanent oil volatility and transitory oil volatility on aggregate investment and real output. Interestingly, contrary to the findings for the developed markets (US and OECD), the real effects of permanent oil volatility tend to be stronger. These findings are reasonably robust to variable specification and measurements in the VAR system. Hence, there is an indication that heightened oil volatility accounts for the slumps in Malaysia's aggregate investment after the Asian financial crisis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

With regard to behavior, persons with lower discount rates are expected to accept additional costs upfront more readily than those with higher discount rates. Based on a representative nation-wide study, the Swiss Environmental Survey 2007, and a follow-up survey, our analyses reveal that on average subjective discount rates are well above market interest rates and moderately stable over a time interval of four years. Income and education are negatively correlated with discount rates. Contrary to expectations, we did not find convincing support for an impact of discount rates on energy saving behavior.

Predictions from the 2006 time-frame expected retail grid parity for solar in the 2016 to 2020 era, but due to rapid downward pricing changes, more recent calculations have forced dramatic reductions in time scale, and the suggestion that solar has already reached grid parity in a wide variety of locations. This study presents aspects of achieving grid parity in insular energy systems, based on a case study applied in Cyprus. The analysis presents the variation of the manufacturing cost, the selling price of the produced energy, and the performance of the solar panels to examine the conditions of accomplishing grid parity event.

However, these interventions may also have a detrimental effect on health. For example, the materials used or lower ventilation rates could result in poorer indoor air quality. The present research sought to systematically quantify the impact of household energy efficiency measures on health and wellbeing. Thirty-six studies, involving more than 33,000 participants were meta-analysed. Effect sizes (d) ranged from -0.43 (a negative impact on health) to 1.41 (a substantial positive impact on health), with an overall sample-weighted average effect size (d(+)) of 0.08. On average, therefore, household energy efficiency interventions led to a small but significant improvement in the health of residents. The findings are discussed in the context of the health improvements experienced by different groups of participants and the study design factors that influence health outcomes. The need for future studies to investigate the long term health benefits of interventions designed to promote household energy efficiency is identified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Such business models often function at the intersection of various industries, with global views, and the resulting systems have distinct social, political, environmental, economic, technological, and business dimensions. Such holistic systems are not only difficult to develop but also require support from a broad range of actors with effective regulations and policies in place, such that the firm functions within a framework that integrates various factors. This study substantiates such a framework by detailing the nascent algae-based bio-fuel industry that caters to the aviation sector while arguing that businesses in the energy industry can emerge as a next-practice platform that drive a sixth wave of innovation. The framework begins with three basic enablers, innovation, flexibility, and sustainability, and explains how value from renewable energy technologies can be created and captured sustainably and innovatively with new market mechanisms implemented by firms with green business models.

Characteristics of land categories inform potential land use change impacts as well as switchgrass profitability. Variable yields within and across land categories are translated into distributions of switchgrass net revenue. Breakeven curves are generated for a range of switchgrass prices. These curves provide upper bounds for further analysis of actual switchgrass adoption in context of broader economic forces and possible policy mechanisms to minimize environmental impacts. A farm-gate price of $55 Mg-1 is estimated for half of marginal and pasturelands to break even with switchgrass. At this price, only 20% of land in hay and a small fraction of row crop hectares break even. Half of hay and row crops hectares break even at approximately $90 Mg-1 and $100 Mg-1, respectively. At $60 Mg-1, sufficient land area can profitably produce switchgrass for ethanol to displace approximately 10% of gasoline consumed in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina; however, this price only indicates breakeven capacity implying that higher prices may be necessary to realize 10% displacement.

It is argued that Yunnan's multi-scalar regionalization should not be perceived as a process of inevitable diffusion from the established centres, but as a dynamic process of place-making that entails an assemblage of state institutions and enterprises at various scales.

This assessment of the UK retail deposit market between 1992 and 2008 indicates that regional banks set deposit interest rates in a manner distinct to nationally branching banks. Changes in the market interest rate to retail rates are characterized by a non-linear mean-reverting process. Deposit interest rates offered by regional banks are lower, slower to respond to wholesale interest rate increases, and swiftly respond to wholesale interest rate falls, relative to national banks. This evidence is consistent with distinct monetary conditions existing in UK regions.","[Ashton, John K.] Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor LL57 2DG, Gwynedd, Wales; [Gregoriou, Andros] Univ Hull, Hull Univ Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",Bangor University; University of Hull,"Ashton, JK (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor LL57 2DG, Gwynedd, Wales.",j.ashton@bangor.ac.uk; a.gregoriou@hull.ac.uk,"; Ashton, john/W-7178-2018","Gregoriou, Andros/0000-0002-7221-0598; Ashton, john/0000-0002-1132-0857",,,,,94,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The assessment of causal links between prices of corn, crude oil and ethanol is carried out with the use of rolling regression applied to augmented-VAR framework proposed by Toda and Yamamoto [22]. The application of the rolling regression procedures into the modified Wald (MWALD) causality test allows for the investigation of the persistence of stability in causal relations between analysed prices. The results obtained indicate that the linkages between energy prices and agricultural commodity prices change in the period analysed. The results of Granger causality tests reveal that in the analysed period the price of corn influences the price of energy (crude oil and ethanol). Also crude oil prices influence corn prices and ethanol prices. However, the influence of ethanol prices on crude oil prices and corn prices has not been observed.","Cracow Univ Econ, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Papiez, M (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",papiezm@uek.krakow.pl,"Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080",,,,,27,1,1,0,7,PALACKY UNIV OLOMOUC,OLOMOUC,"KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,754,759,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900130,0

In both cases the decision on intensities of product innovation is made in the first period and interaction in setting prices of outputs follows in the infinite horizon. The first mode of interaction is characterized by Cournot duopoly in the market for final goods and Bertrand duopoly for market of inputs with differentiated product. Demand functions for inputs are derived from Cournot equilibrium in the market for final goods in which prices of inputs are parameters that producers of final goods cannot affect. In the second mode, all four firms cooperate with the aim to maximize the sum of profits. This applies to choosing intensities of product innovation in the first period as well as to subsequent setting of outputs in infinite horizon. The results indicate that cooperation between firms on both sides of the market has positive impact on intensity of product innovation of inputs.

However, the Nigerian construction industry have been challenged to improve its performance because of reports of performance problems in terms of cost over runs, time over runs, poor quality of work, low productivity among other problems. The aim of the study was to establish the measures used by construction SMEs for evaluating performance. The study employed a case study research design. Five construction SMEs in Lagos, Nigeria were selected as case studies. The findings revealed that construction SMEs do not use any of the established performance measurement frameworks for evaluating performance. The main performance measures used by construction SMEs are cost, time, quality, customer satisfaction, profitability of the project, labour productivity, safety and team work. It was also established from the study that construction SMEs do not use supply chain management and employee satisfaction.

Although research into the materials and the application of these materials is paramount to the growth of this promising industry, to enable it to be forecasted, monitored, and controlled, there must also be research into the feasibility and management of the industry. However, measuring the potential impact of a technology is basically a Collingridge dilemma a double-bind problem: the impact of a technology cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and adopted, whilst the control or change of a technology is very difficult once it has been extensively developed and adopted. In order to address these issues, a technique called technology assessment (TA) has been developed to assist in evaluating these emerging technologies. Data were collected using a qualitative method performed on respondents actively involved in the development of new nanotechnology applications, related to Nano-Biosensors. Using convenience sampling, identified respondents located in a research institute of a local university, located in the Northern part of Malaysia, we selected as respondents. Several issues were uncovered and presented in the results of this paper. The persistence of Nano-Biosensor in the broader context of nanotechnology development in Malaysia is paramount, since it is an enabling technology with potential industry-wide impact on other sectors not only in Malaysia, but also the rest of the world.","[Zulhumadi, Faisal; Udin, Zulkifli Mohamed; Abdullah, Che Sobry] Univ Utara Malaysia, STML, Kedah, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,,faisal@uum.edu.my; zulkifli@uum.edu.my; sobry@uum.edu.my,"Udin, Zulkifli Mohamed/AAY-4983-2021; Zulhumadi, Faisal/F-5059-2010","Udin, Zulkifli Mohamed/0000-0003-2211-0326; Zulhumadi, Faisal/0000-0002-2545-7002",,,,,16,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,653,659,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100072,0

Higher temperatures as a result of climate change will give rise to lower ratings, and thus a reduction in current-carrying capacity across the electricity network. Coupled with demand growth and installation of renewable generation on weaker sections of the network, this could necessitate costly reinforcements and upgrades. Previous UK-based work applying a subset of data from the UK Climate Projections model (UKCP09) has indeed indicated likely reductions in the steady-state OHL ratings under worst-case temperature increases. In the present work, time series data from the full UKCP09 probabilistic climate change modelling framework, including an additional algorithm to incorporate hourly wind conditions, is applied to OHL ratings. Rather than focus purely on worst-case conditions, the potential for an increased risk of exceeding nominal ratings values on thermally constrained OHL is analysed. It is shown that whilst there is a small increase in risk under future climate change scenarios, the overall risk remains low. The model further demonstrates that widespread use of real-time dynamic rating systems are likely to represent the most cost-efficient adaptation method for lines which are frequently thermally constrained.

The paper employs bounds test approach to level relationship over the period of 1972-007. We find evidence of bidirectional positive relationship between natural gas consumption and economic growth in short-run and long-run, based on the production model. The findings also suggest that real GDP growth and natural gas have positive and negative impacts on gross fixed capital formation, respectively. Employment, however, was found to have negative but insignificant impact on gross fixed capital formation. Moreover, the estimation results of demand side model suggest that natural gas price has negative and significant impact on natural gas consumption only in the long-run, though there is insignificant impact on economic growth. These results imply that the Iranian government's decision for natural gas price liberalization has the adverse effects on economic growth and policy makers should be cautious in doing this policy..

New methods of targeting are necessary to improve fuel poverty policy. This paper uses Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to evaluate the targeting of a home energy efficiency scheme small area level in Northern Ireland, based on the level of need. The concept of need is modelled using an area-based, multi-dimensional fuel poverty risk index. The characteristics and spatial distribution of household retrofits are explored. Policy activity and expenditure are compared with the level of need in an area. Results indicate that policy activity is only weakly associated with the level of need in an area, although policy appears to be well targeted in a few areas. Contrary to existing evidence, rural areas appear to be well served by policy, receiving above average numbers of retrofits and expenditure. There are typically two types of retrofit (major and minor). Most retrofits are minor and may not reduce fuel poverty. These results evidence the limitations of the current targeting system and suggest that there may be scope for improved policy implemented via a more proactive, area-based approach.

A special emphasis has been put on the modelling of the Canadian road transport, by considering a variety of vehicles for passenger and freight transportation. Besides a business-as-usual (baseline) scenario, we have analysed an energy policy scenario imposing targets for electric vehicle penetration and a climate policy scenario imposing targets for greenhouse gas emission reduction. Our analysis shows on the one hand that electric vehicles penetrate notably the passenger vehicle market after 2040 in the baseline scenario and after 2030 in the energy policy scenario (following the assumed penetration targets). On the other hand, the assumed climate policy forces a stronger penetration of electric vehicles for passenger transportation, with a progressive phasing out of internal combustion engine vehicles, whereas the latter vehicles remain dominant for freight transportation but with a shift away of fossil fuels and in favour of biofuels. A sensitivity analysis on the (assumed) evolution of electric vehicles over time confirms these general trends. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting boost in biogas output went along with a significant increase in production of green maize, the dominant feedstock. Existing studies of the EEG have analysed its impacts on German agriculture without considering market feedback. We thus expand existing quantitative analysis by also considering impacts on European and global agricultural markets, land use and the environment by combining a detailed location model for biogas plants, the Regionalised Location Information System-Maize (ReSi-M2012), with a global Partial Equilibrium model for agriculture, the Common Agricultural Policy Regional Impact (CAPRI) model. Our results indicate that the German biogas production is large enough to have sizeable impacts on global agricultural markets in prices and quantities, causing significant land use change outside of Germany. While profits in the agricultural sector increase, food consumer face higher prices, and subsidies for biogas production are passed on to electricity consumers. The German biogas program, as long as it is almost entirely based on non-waste feedstocks, is probably not a promising avenue towards a GHG-saving renewable energy production, but a rather expensive one.

A number of residential households have an economic incentive to install rooftop PV systems and reduce their purchases of electricity from the grid. A significant portion of the costs incurred by utility companies are fixed costs which must be recovered even as consumption falls. Electricity rates must increase in order for utility companies to recover fixed costs from shrinking sales bases. Increasing rates will, in turn, result in even more economic incentives for customers to adopt rooftop PV. In this paper, we model this feedback between PV adoption and electricity rates and study its impact on future PV penetration and net-metering costs. We find that the most important parameter that determines whether this feedback has an effect is the fraction of customers who adopt PV in any year based solely on the money saved by doing so in that year, independent of the uncertainties of future years. These uncertainties include possible changes in rate structures such as the introduction of connection charges, the possibility of PV prices dropping significantly in the future, possible changes in tax incentives, and confidence in the reliability and maintainability of PV.

The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (NSM) in India is an example; besides targeting an installation of 20 GW of grid-tied solar power capacity, it includes a domestic content requirement (DCR) to strengthen a solar photovoltaic manufacturing base. We ask whether the DCR of the NSM will be effective in ensuring the global competitiveness of the beneficiary sector. Our analysis reveals three observations that indicate this outcome is unlikely: (1) the manufacturing base has become less competitive over time, (2) developers may be favoring thin-film technology, thereby bypassing the DCR, which applies specifically to crystalline silicon cells and modules and (3) gaps in the Indian innovation system are likely to prevent a return to competitiveness by solar photovoltaic manufacturers. In particular, a comparison with the Chinese innovation system indicates shortcomings in the Indian innovation system of R&D capabilities, coordination of resource provision and complementary industrial strengths. Given these observations, we suggest that policymakers remove the solar photovoltaic DCR from the NSM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

K.",,,Marginal land for energy crops: Exploring definitions and embedded assumptions,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Biomass; Marginal; Land,BIOFUELS; EMISSIONS; BIOENERGY; UK,"The idea of using less productive or marginal land for energy crops is promoted as a way to overcome the previous land use controversies faced by biofuels. It is argued that marginal land use would not compete with food production, is widely available and would incur fewer environmental impacts. This term is notoriously vague however, as are the details of how marginal land use for energy crops would work in practice. This paper explores definitions of the term marginal land in academic, consultancy, NGO, government and industry documents in the UK. It identifies three separate definitions of the term: land unsuitable for food production; ambiguous lower quality land; and economically marginal land. It probes these definitions further by exploring the technical, normative and political assumptions embedded within them. It finds that the first two definitions are normatively motivated: this land should be used to overcome controversies and the latter definition is predictive: this land is likely to be used. It is important that the different advantages, disadvantages and implications of the definitions are spelled out so definitions are not conflated to create unrealistic expectations about the role of marginal land in overcoming biofuels land use controversies.

The study builds on a broad and practical conceptual framework that embraces three types of energy-saving behavior and four dimensions of influencing factors, including socio-demographics, energy-saving awareness, behavioral ability, and situational factors. The empirical results are based on an Internet survey that was sent out to 638 households. The results indicate that socio-demographic characteristics, including age, gender, income level, household structure, and educational background, are all important factors influencing energy-saving behavior. At present, respondents adopt the usage-reduction type of behavior more often than the other two types, which require a greater capacity to pay for energy-efficient products and a higher level of energy-saving awareness. Situational factors have significant positive moderating effects when the variables of behavioral ability and energy-saving awareness act on energy-saving behavior. In addition, the results also show that spatial differences exist among the three regions of Jiangsu Province. Finally, some implications of these results for the design of future incentive policies and measures to encourage energy-saving behavior are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, energy conservation will become a major strategy for China in a transition to low-carbon economy. China's transport industry is of high energy consumption. In 2010, oil consumption in transport industry takes up 38.2% of the country's total oil demand, of which 23.6% is taken up by road transport sector. As a result, oil saving in China's road transport sector is vital to the whole nation. The co-integration method is developed to find a long-run relationship between oil consumption and affecting factors such as GDP, road condition, labor productivity and oil price, to estimate oil demand and to predict future oil saving potential in China's transport sector under different oil-saving scenarios. Monte Carlo simulation is further used for risk analysis. Results show that under BAU condition, oil demand of China's road transport sector will reach 278.5 million ton of oil equivalents (MTOE) in 2020. Oil saving potential will be 86 MTOE and 131 MTOE under moderate oil-saving scenario and advanced oil-saving scenario, respectively. This paper provides a reference to establishing oil saving policy for China's road transport sector. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Projects analysed are those included in the catalogue annexed in the JRC Report Smart Grid projects in Europe: lessons learned and current developments. The analysis suggests an increase in the interest in consumer engagement projects at European level and a strong focus on the residential sector, and emphasises the key importance of public funding to support these projects. The study also reveals that projects involving consumers are characterised by the pursuit of two main objectives: gaining deeper knowledge of consumer behaviour (observing and understanding the consumer) and motivating and empowering consumers to become active energy customers (engaging the consumer). The paper reviews the main activities undertaken to obtain these objectives and highlights trends and developments in the field. Finally, the paper discusses obstacles to consumer engagement and the strategies adopted by the projects surveyed to tackle them, highlighting the need to build consumer trust and to design targeted campaigns taking into consideration different consumer segments.

Thereby, required economic benefits for consumers' participation, the realistic load shifting potential at household level and the estimation of essential intelligent infrastructure costs are discussed. The core of this paper builds a case-study applying spot market-oriented load shifting from the supplier's point of view by using Austrian electricity market data, household load profiles as well as a heat pump and e-car charging load profile. It is demonstrated which cost savings for suppliers can be derived from such load shifting procedure at household level. Furthermore, upper cost limits for intelligent infrastructure in order to break-even are derived. Results suggest to take a critical look at European discussions on DR implementation on household level, showing that at Central European market conditions the potential for DR at household level is restricted to significant loads and hence, the applied load shifting strategy is only beneficial with application to heat pumps. In contrast, the frequently discussed shifting of conventional household devices' loads (such as washing machines) economically does not add up. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In general, regulators may be uncomfortable initiating a reverse auction at a higher-than-expected final price, fearing that participants may sell their energy at an excess profitability. Nevertheless, evidence from electricity procurement auctions conducted in Brazil supports the findings that these types of auctions have the opposite effect. By attracting a larger number of agents, these auctions can trigger stronger competition and lead to lower settlement pricing. Accordingly, the Brazilian cases examined in this article present significant evidence to support this directional theory. In fact, there are some cases of electricity procurement auctions that show that inadequate auction reserve pricing leads to inefficient outcomes and may also cause the auction to fail. On the other hand, auctions with adequate price caps have led to lower final clearing prices, thus contributing to reasonable final energy pricing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, the paper aspires to help create a deeper understanding of the system in order to guide the implementation of similar models in other districts, creating more sustainable cities. The method has been to quantify the local mass and energy flows of the model, using the secondary energy generated within Hammarby Sjostad as basis when creating the system boundaries of the calculations. The findings demonstrate that the Hammarby Model reduces the metabolic flows of Hammarby Sjostad but that the district is far from self-sufficient in terms of secondary energy. The conclusions of the paper are that the development of integrated infrastructural systems is one way to help create more sustainable cities. However, in order to reduce metabolic flows even further, the efficiency of the system must be improved by integrating more renewable energy sources. At the same time less energy has to be used in the households. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The raw data came from 9773 Canadian households, and comprised annual electricity and natural gas use, and responses to >600 questions on dwelling and occupant characteristics, appliances, heating and cooling equipment, and associated behaviours. Replacing an old (>10 years) refrigerator with a new one was estimated to save 100 kW h/year; replacing an incandescent lamp with a CFL/LED lamp was estimated to save 20 kW h/year; and upgrading an old central heating system with a new one was estimated to save 2000 kW h/year. This latter effect was similar to that of reducing the number of walls exposed to the outside. Reducing the winter thermostat setpoint during occupied, waking hours was estimated to lower annual energy use by 200 kW h/degrees C-reduction, and lowering the thermostat setting overnight in winter relative to the setting during waking hours (night-time setback) was estimated to have a similar effect.

This paper discusses the impacts of electrification on educational outcomes, gender and power relations, income generation, feelings of inclusion and exclusion and health in the village of Tsilitwa in the rural Eastern Cape, South Africa. It is based on an ethnographic grounded theory study conducted in 2009. The paper shows that the impacts of electricity may not match the benefits cited in the literature, and are not experienced in the same way by everyone in the community. The study uncovers the weakness of ignoring individual and group agency, and the complexity of social settings when advocating interventions to improve quality of life. The paper recommends that researchers and policymakers consider using ethnographic methods to complement other methods and reveal context and its implications on the energy-development nexus that other methods may not capture.

The geographies of access to enterprise finance: the case of the West Midlands, UK, Regional Studies. Whilst there is a long history of credit rationing to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK, the financial crisis has seen banks retreat further from lending to viable SMEs due to a reassessment of risk and lack of available capital. In so doing, the credit crunch is thought to be creating new geographies of financial exclusion. This paper explores the financial inclusion of enterprise through community development finance institutions (CDFIs) which provide loan finance to firms at the commercial margins in the West Midlands, UK. The paper concludes that CDFIs could partially address the financial exclusion of enterprise as an additional, alternative source of finance to that of mainstream banks.","Univ Birmingham, CHASM, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Appleyard, L (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, CHASM, Muirhead Tower,8th Floor, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",l.j.appleyard@bham.ac.uk,,"appleyard, lindsey/0000-0003-1087-8450",,,,,74,17,21,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, the offsetting effect of energy rebound would greatly reduce its real energy-saving potentials. We set up a Linear Approximation of the Almost Ideal Demand System Model (LA-AIDS model) to estimate the rebound effect for passenger transportation in China. Real energy conservation effect of improving energy efficiency can also be obtained in the process. The result shows that the rebound effect is approximately 107.2%. This figure signifies the existence of 'backfire effect', indicating that efficiency improvement in practice does not always lead to energy-saving. We conclude that one important factor leading to the rebound effect, is the refined oil pricing mechanism. China's refined oil pricing mechanism has been subjected to criticism in recent years. The results of simulation analysis show that the rebound could be reduced to approximately 90.7% if the refined oil pricing mechanism is reformed. In this regard, we suggest further reforms in the current refined oil pricing mechanism. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We do this by employing an economic land evaluation approach; first, we estimate the physical land suitability and the necessary inputs to reach certain amounts of yields. Subsequently, we estimate costs and benefits. for different input-output levels. Finally, to incorporate the increased awareness of sustainability in the export sector, we introduce also certification criteria. Using data from an experimental farm in Kilosa, we find that high yields are crucial for the economic feasibility and that they can only be obtained on good soils at high input rates. Costs of compliance with certification criteria depend on site specific characteristics such as land suitability and precipitation. In general, both domestic production and (certified) exports are too expensive to be able to compete with conventional diesel/rapeseed oil from the EU. Even though the crop may have potential for large scale production as a niche product, there is still a lot of risk involved and more experimental research is needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these metrics are susceptible to inadvertent or meaningful mathematical manipulation, whereby the same dataset can be used to compute dramatically different values of energy return on investment (EROI). In this study, previously published life cycle assessment (LCA) data for algal biofuels, corn ethanol, and switchgrass ethanol are used to demonstrate how seven seemingly reasonable EROI formulations give rise to a wide range of output values. It is then demonstrated that production of bioelectricity, and to a lesser extent, other co-products, significantly increases EROI ambiguity. Overall, the EROI results are used to illustrate how EROI ambiguity makes it difficult to properly assess the energetic favorability of a particular energy system or to make accurate comparisons among multiple systems. It is then recommended that all future biofuels studies restrict themselves to usage of EROI1, which documents all input and outputs as explicit terms, to mitigate EROI ambiguity and improve policy decision-making.

On regional innovation efficiency: evidence from panel data of China's different provinces, Regional Studies. The main goals of this paper were to estimate the regional innovation efficiency in China and to investigate major factors affecting efficiency scores. Stochastic frontier methods with a translog production function were applied. The samples were composed of the panel data of China's thirty provinces for the period between 1998 and 2007. The empirical results show that innovation efficiency in China remained at a lower level and had much room for improvement. The impact of major factors and their interplay with innovation efficiency was negative. This indicated that internal construction of the regional innovation system was far from perfect. The innovation efficiency in the eastern regions was higher than that in the central and western regions.","Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Normal University,"Bai, JH (通讯作者)，Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",sdustnuaa@yahoo.com.cn,"peng, cong/G-6526-2015","peng, cong/0009-0009-4345-4890",,,,,81,64,70,8,160,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

To shed light on these problems, we examine the case of gasoline subsidies using data on gasoline prices in 137 countries for the years 2002-2009. It is useful to study gasoline pricing because gasoline is the most important transportation fuel, and there are data for many countries for the time period of investigation. We find that major oil producers subsidize gasoline consumption by artificially reducing prices; countries with weak institutional capacity also seem to subsidize gasoline, but the effects are weaker. These results suggest that policy interventions to improve institutional capacity could help developing countries in particular reduce their fossil fuel subsidies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The Japanese government has thus been considering four possible future energy mixes, including a nuclear-free pathway, and three others with 10%-35% nuclear supply coupled with a larger proportion of renewable energy and fossil fuels to replace nuclear. Here we use multi-criteria decision-making analysis (MCDMA) to assess the potential negative economic (levelised cost of electricity, and energy security), environmental (greenhouse-gas emissions, land transformation, water consumption, heated water discharge, air pollution, radioactive waste, and solid waste) and social (safety issues) impacts of the four proposed pathways to determine which scenario most holistically minimises adverse future outcomes. The nuclear-free pathway has the highest overall potential for adverse outcomes (score=2.49 out of 3), and the 35% nuclear power supply option yielding the lowest negative impact score (0.74) without weightings. Despite some sensitivity to the choice of criterion weights, our analyses demonstrate clearly that from an empirical perspective, a nuclear-free pathway for Japan is the worst option to pursue. We recommend that MCDMA methodology we used for Japan can be applied to other countries to evaluate future electricity generation scenarios. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Different mechanisms have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, such as the pollution displacement hypothesis, foreign direct investment, international trade, and strategic response of countries to transboundary pollution flows. This paper develops a new mechanism in the sense that environmental quality of countries spreads spatially to their neighbors through the spillover of the institutional quality of countries. To test this hypothesis, a panel data model is constructed that estimates the impact of the institutional quality of countries and their neighbors on their CO2 emission intensity of energy use using data for 129 countries over the period 1980-2007. The findings prove the existence of this mechanism at the global and regional levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Michael",,,Addressing uncertainty in life-cycle carbon intensity in a national low-carbon fuel standard,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Uncertainty; Life-cycle analysis; Environmental policy analysis,EMISSIONS,"Policies formulated to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as a low-carbon fuel standard, frequently rely on life-cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate emissions, but LCA results are often highly uncertain. This study develops life-cycle models that quantitatively and qualitatively describe the uncertainty and variability in GHG emissions for both fossil fuels and ethanol and examines mechanisms to reduce those uncertainties in the policy process. Uncertainty regarding emissions from gasoline is non-negligible, with an estimated 90% confidence interval ranging from 84 to 100 g CO(2)e/MJ. Emissions from biofuels have greater uncertainty. The widths of the 90% confidence intervals for corn and switchgrass ethanol are estimated to be on the order of 100 g CO(2)e/MJ, and removing emissions from indirect land use change still leaves significant remaining uncertainty. Though an opt-in policy mechanism can reduce some uncertainty by incentivizing producers to self-report fuel production parameters, some important parameters, such as land use change emissions and nitrogen volatilization, cannot be accurately measured and self-reported. Low-carbon fuel policies should explicitly acknowledge, quantify, and incorporate uncertainty in life cycle emissions in order to more effectively achieve emissions reductions. Two complementary ways to incorporate this uncertainty in low carbon fuel policy design are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Kocoloski, Matt; Griffin, W.

The influences of individual-level and country-level variables on the progression through these stages are analysed. Data from twenty-seven European countries and the United States are used (2007 Flash Eurobarometer Survey on Entrepreneurship). Findings show that in the United States many people think about setting up a business, whereas Europeans are better at achieving higher levels of engagement. Country differences can be explained mainly by levels of risk tolerance and economic development. A country's level of administrative complexity does not play a role, but individual perceptions of this complexity are a hindering factor.","[Van der Zwan, Peter; Thurik, Roy] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Ctr Adv Small Business Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Van der Zwan, Peter; Thurik, Roy] EIM Business & Policy Res, NL-2701 AA Zoetermeer, Netherlands; [Verheul, Ingrid] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Dept Strateg Management & Entrepreneurship, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Grilo, Isabel] Commiss European Communities, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Grilo, Isabel] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Thurik, Roy] Montpellier Business Sch, GSCM, Montpellier, France",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Universite Catholique Louvain; Montpellier Business School,"Van der Zwan, P (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Ctr Adv Small Business Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",vanderzwan@ese.eur.nl; iverheul@rsm.nl; thurik@ese.eur.nl; isabel.grilo@ec.europa.eu,"Thurik, Roy/A-9386-2012","Thurik, Roy/0000-0002-0242-6908; van der Zwan, Peter/0000-0003-2654-4367",,,,,162,33,41,0,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The conditioning variables become insignificant after removing spatial dependence. This suggests that the statistical significance of the growth determinants is intrinsically linked to geographical location and indicates the importance of space to regional growth in Brazil.

Climate change concerns and highly volatile oil prices have attracted governments' interest and support to sustain investments in renewable energy capacity, and different support policies have been implemented in many countries around the world. This paper analyzes the effects of investors' risk aversion on the performance of support schemes. The analysis compares two policy. options, a feed-in tariff mechanism with a certificate market system. Results show that while a tariff mechanism could obtain better results than a certificate market, its performance is strictly dependent on regulator choices. A certificate market instead, permits to obtain the desired level of renewable energy market share with good cost-efficiency as long as investors' risk aversion is moderate. Moreover, discounting future cash flows with higher social discount rates further benefits a certificate system making it preferable to feed-in tariffs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The response of the national market was immediate in less than 2 years' time. Two subsequent laws formed an even more attractive investment and licensing context both for field and building installations, by introducing additional guarantees and improved grid-connection procedures. However, the unexpectedly large amount of applications submitted until 2011, with aggregate PV capacities which exceeded the national target for 2020 caused continuously tremendous delays in grid-connection processes. Undoubtedly, the effectiveness of this legislative framework cannot be judged solely by the response of prospective investors. In that sense, main objectives of this paper are to present and discuss about the effective provisions as well as the major weaknesses of the FiT legislation in Greece since 2006, associated mainly with its attractiveness to investors and its cost-effectiveness towards preserving and supporting the Greek PV market. The paper concludes with a technoeconomic assessment, which evaluates PV projects' viability, especially those ones whose provision of grid-connection offer was postponed several times.

It shows that both raw growth rates and the deviations from a HodrickPrescott trend reflect noise in the series as well as any cycle, but that both can be manipulated so as to reveal their cyclical components. It is found that growth rate models are dominated by noise, whereas the HodrickPrescott filter allows identification of the cyclical features of interest. The extent of co-movements in cyclical fluctuations in employment amongst the regions can be explained by regional industry structure and size of region.","[Dixon, Robert] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Shepherd, David] Westminster Business Sch, London NW1 5LS, England",University of Melbourne; University of Westminster,"Dixon, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",r.dixon@unimelb.edu.au; D.Shepherd1@wmin.ac.uk,"Dixon, Robert/P-1619-2015","Dixon, Robert/0000-0003-1836-4198",,,,,49,8,8,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This article however argues that the building code mechanism is heavily influenced by path dependent regime structuration processes, and that the mechanism constitutes a barrier to more radical developments within low energy housing. Few and poorly organized frontrunner activities within low energy housing have accordingly taken place in a Danish context during the past decades. Finally it is proposed that the current development within the energy system provides opportunities for cultivating an improved transitional awareness and for carrying out experimental activities that may challenge the path dependencies of prevailing regime structuration processes.

However, like cap-and-trade policies with price uncertainty, they suffer from significant uncertainty in abatement costs. This article examines whether an indicator could be established to complement CO2 mitigation goals and help reduce cost uncertainty with a particular focus on China. Performance indicators on CO2 emissions per unit of energy consumption could satisfy three criteria: compared with the mitigation goals, (i) they are more closely associated with active mitigation efforts and (ii) their baselines have more stable projections from historical trajectories. (iii) Their abatement costs are generally higher than other mitigation methods, particularly energy efficiency and conservation. Performance indicators could be used in the following way: if a CO2 goal on absolute emissions or intensity is attained, the performance indicator should still reach a lower threshold as a cost floor. If the goal cannot be attained, an upper performance threshold should be achieved as a cost ceiling. The narrower cost uncertainty may encourage wider and greater mitigation efforts.

The shift away from fossil fuels through the electrification of demand is discussed, particularly through the uptake of heat pumps and electric vehicles in the domestic and passenger transport sectors. Developments in the way people and institutions may use energy along each of the pathways are also considered and provide a rationale for the quantification of future annual electricity demands in various broad sectors. The paper then presents detailed modelling of hourly balancing of these demands in the context of potential low carbon generation mixes associated with the three pathways. In all cases, hourly balancing is shown to be a significant challenge. To minimise the need for conventional generation to operate with very low capacity factors, a variety of demand side participation measures are modelled and shown to provide significant benefits. Lastly, projections of operational greenhouse gas emissions from the UK and the imports of fossil fuels to the UK for each of the three pathways are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We describe developments in electric vehicles before and after 2005. The central thesis of the paper is that electric mobility has crossed a critical threshold and is benefitting from various developments whose influence can be expected to grow in importance: high oil prices, carbon constraints, and rise of organised car sharing and intermodality. We find that the development of vehicle engine technology depends on changes in (fueling) infrastructure, changes in mobility, changes in the global car market, evolution of energy prices, climate policy, and changes in the electricity sector. Special attention is given to interaction of technological alternatives: how these work out for the future of battery electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

Almost all the 2010 sub-targets have been met and even surpassed except non-grain fuel ethanol. There is debate surrounding the questions of whether and how the country will be able to meet the 2020 biofuels target. This paper provides the assessment of potential technology pathways to achieve the 2020 target regarding their respective resource potential and supply cost. Barriers and policy options are identified based on broad literatures review. And an overview of biofuels projections is presented to provide insight into the comparison of various policy scenarios. The study shows that China can potentially satisfy non-grain fuel ethanol target by 2020 from technology perspective. But she will probably fall far short of this target if current situations continue. Additional policy efforts are needed. Meanwhile, the target of biodiesel production has high probability to be achieved. However, if given support policies, it will develop better. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy service companies (ESCOs) provide a crucial instrument for delivering improved energy efficiency and potentially contributing to substantial energy savings in the public and private sectors. This paper investigates empirically the effect of ESCO activities on energy use. Based on a dynamic IPAT model, using a panel data of 94 countries over the period 1981 to 2007, we provide significant evidence that ESCOs reduce energy use. This finding proves robust to different dates of the first ESCO. The negative ESCO effect increases over time. The dynamic adjustment process produces small effects in the short run, but large effects in the long run. Moreover, the long-run ESCO effect differs across the stages of development. That is, for the high- and low-income countries, the short-run ESCO effect remains negative, but the long-run effects differ, remaining negative in high-income countries, but becoming positive in low-income countries. Finally, we discuss energy policy implications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To better reflect causality, employment is incorporated as additional variable. The study demonstrates evidence of distinct bidirectional Granger causality between energy consumption and economic growth. Additionally, the results show that employment in Liberia Granger causes economic growth and apply irrespective of the short-run or long-run. Evidence from a Monte Carlo experiment reveals that the asymptotic Granger causality test suffers size distortion problem for Liberian data, suggesting that the bootstrap technique employed in this study is more appropriate. Given the empirical results, implications are that energy expansion policies like energy subsidy or low energy tariff for instance, would be necessary to cope with demand exerted as a result of economic growth in Liberia. Furthermore, Liberia might have the performance of its employment generation on the economy partly determined by adequate energy. Therefore, it seems fully justified that a quick shift towards energy production based on clean energy sources may significantly slow down economic growth in Liberia. Hence, the government's target to implement a long-term strategy to make Liberia a carbon neutral country, and eventually less carbon dependent by 2050 is understandable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, composite energy efficiency indicators, calculated using physical output, are used to give a more accurate view of energy efficiency progress. Both approaches are commonly presented in one study but often with a different mathematical basis for each. This may lead to inconsistent results. We demonstrate using practical case studies that when all physical and economic output data are available for industry sub-sectors, these can be combined in a single decomposition analysis that provides an energy efficiency indicator based on physical production and an indicator of the influence of structural change based on value added. Using the same methodology for both results ensures that the results are consistent and provides insights into the effects of changing prices of goods on aggregate energy intensity. In the case studies examined, falling unit values of industrial goods produced over time tend to increase the energy intensity of industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We first characterize the optimal energy mix, emphasizing the availability of the intermittent source as a major parameter for the optimal investment in capacity. We then analyze decentralization through competitive market mechanisms. We show that decentralizing the efficient energy mix requires electricity to be priced contingently on the availability of the intermittent source. By contrast. traditional meters impose uniform pricing, which distorts the optimal mix of energy sources. Decentralizing the efficient energy mix with uniform prices requires either cross-subsidies from the intermittent source to the reliable source of energy or structural integration of the two types of technology.

Better Place and battery electric cars in Denmark,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Business models; Electric cars; Better Place,,"This paper explores the geographical and policy context for an emergent business model from Better Place to deliver battery electric car mobility in Denmark. It argues that the combination of radically different technologies and a highly complex multi-agency operating environment theoretically provide the conditions and requirements for such an emergent business model. While focused on battery electric cars, renewable energy generation and smart grids, the paper has wider applicability to an understanding of the interplay between place, innovation and sustainability which suggests that diverse solutions are likely to be the characteristic solution rather than ubiquity and standardization. The paper argues, however, that the innovative business model, the deployment of electric vehicles, and the use of renewable energy systems, in this case largely based on wind power, while mutually supportive and contributing to wider policy aims with respect to the reduction of carbon emissions, may still fail in the face of entrenched practices. At the theoretical level it is concluded that theorization of business models needs a broader perspective beyond the typical 'value creation, value capture' rubric to better understand the wider role such models have in meeting societal goals, and to understand the structural impediments to organizational and technical innovation.

Such a grid clearly requires some conventional generating capacity to be available in order to serve as backup at times when the PV-storage combination alone fails to meet the demand. In the present continuation of that study, we evaluate the largest conventional capacity that would have been required during the one year of data employed for our simulations. For that year, 2006, the required backup capacity for a grid with flexibility ff=0.8 and ff=1 would have been 7.5 GW and 6.6 GW, respectively. This is significantly less than the 10.5 GW of generating capacity that the Israel Electric Corporation operated that year. Our finding emphasizes the fact that a full economic optimization of storage must be based primarily on the engineering-aspects of storage design and use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking this price response into account, the optimal U.S biodiesel subsidy is derived.

Both optimise the operation of the system in real time. However ISOs do not own any electricity transmission wires or gas transmission pipes (i.e. electricity and gas systems), while ITSOs do. To examine the choice we will discuss the functions, cost structure, governance and pricing of the ISO, focussing on the US, with regard to controlling the system and operating associated power markets. We outline an ideal model for an electricity system operator and examine the extent to which system operation in the US and the UK conforms to the ideal. Finally, we look at the evolving role of system operators and how their efficiency might be evaluated. We conclude that there is much to learn from ISO experience in operating existing transmission systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Making infrastructure investment decisions requires balancing different distributions of risks and benefits that are far from clear. For example, managers at permanent Army installations must incorporate Congressional legislative objectives, executive orders, Department of Defense directives, state laws and regulations, local restrictions, and multiple stakeholder concerns when undertaking new energy initiatives. Moreover, uncertainty with regard to alternative energy technologies is typically much greater than that associated with traditional technologies, both because the technologies themselves are continuously evolving and because the intermittent nature of many renewable technologies makes a certain level of uncertainty irreducible. This paper describes a novel stochastic multi-attribute analytic approach that allows users to explore different priorities or weighting schemes in combination with uncertainties related to technology performance. To illustrate the utility of this approach for understanding conflicting policy or stakeholder perspectives, prioritizing the need for more information, and making investment decisions, we apply this approach to an energy technology decision problem representative of a permanent military base.

However, a heavy dependence on imports, from Algeria, Qatar and Nigeria, respectively, creates a threat to energy security, both in terms of source and supply diversity. Accordingly, we follow an analytical approach to identify the accuracy of our assumption, considering the current economic, political and security risk. To this end, we formulate and solve a mixed integer programming model that determines the optimal sourcing strategy for Turkey's increasing LNG demand. This model demonstrates a number of alternative policy options for LNG supply. Furthermore, we consider that increasing the proportion of LNG in the overall gas supply will contribute to the aim of improving Turkey's level of energy security. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We model energy consumption and GHG emissions, the decision to invest in energy saving renovations and the dynamics of the housing stock. Particular attention is paid to household investment decisions regarding home renovation. To generate the dynamics and the structure of the housing stock through 2050, we introduce socioeconomic variables that alter the number of renovations and new constructions. This study has three major outputs. First, we estimate the energy consumption and GHG emissions of the residential sector in France through 2050.

The results suggest that a battery-electric vehicle (BEV) with 100 mi of range should meet the needs of 50% of one-vehicle households and 80% of multiple-vehicle households, when charging once a day and relying on another vehicle or mode just 4 days a year. Moreover, the average one-vehicle Seattle household uses each vehicle 23 mi per day and should be able to electrify close to 80% of its miles, while meeting all its travel needs, using a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) with 40-mile all-electric range. Households owning two or more vehicles can electrify 50 to 70% of their total household miles using a PHEV40, depending on how they assign the vehicle across drivers each day. Cost comparisons between the average single-vehicle household owning a Chevrolet Cruze versus a Volt PHEV suggest that, when gas prices are $3.50 per gallon and electricity rates are at 11.2 ct/kWh, the Volt will save the household $535 per year in operating costs. Similarly, the Toyota Prius PHEV will provide an annual savings of $538 per year over the Corolla. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J.",,,The cost of natural gas shortages in Ireland,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Security of supply; Value of lost load; Ireland,SECURITY; DEMAND,"This paper investigates the economic implications of disruptions of one to ninety days to the supply of natural gas in Ireland. We assess the impact of a hypothetical gas supply disruption in both winter and summer in 2008 (with observed market characteristics) and in 2020 (with projected market characteristics). The cost of a natural gas outage includes the cost of natural gas being unavailable for heating and other purposes in the industrial and commercial sectors, lost consumer surplus in the residential sector, the cost of lost electricity in all sectors and lost VAT on the sale of gas and electricity. Ireland generates much of its electricity from natural gas and the loss of this electricity accounts for the majority of the cost of a natural gas outage. Losing gas-fired electricity would cost 0.1-1.0 billion euro per day, depending on the time to the week, the time of year and rationing. Industry should be rationed before households to minimise economic losses, but current emergency protocols do the opposite. If gas-fired electricity is unavailable for three months, the economic loss could be up to 80 billion euro, about half of Gross Domestic Product. Losing gas for heating too would add up to approximately 8 billion euro in economic losses. We also discuss some options to increase Ireland's security of supply, and find that the cost is a small fraction of the avoided maximum damage.

This is a signal for the design of a public policy for investment in transportation infrastructure that seeks to raise the competitiveness of Colombian exports, investing not only in roads but in complementary systems such as railways too.

Some analysts believe that these countries are under stress again due to a rise in crude oil prices, to a two-and-a-half year high in March 2011, which has also been partly responsible for higher food prices in recent months. However, there is a limited body of empirical evidence available from developing countries on the impact of high oil prices on growth in general and household poverty in particular. In this study, Sri Lanka is used as a case study and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach is adopted as an analytical framework to explore the growth and poverty impacts of high oil prices. The results suggest that urban low income households are the group most adversely affected by high global oil prices, followed by low income rural households. In contrast, estate low income households are the least affected out of all low income households. The energy intensive manufacturing sector and services sector are affected most compared to the agricultural sector. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The main aim is to report the obstacles that participants in the survey felt were the most critical ones affecting competition in the European electricity markets of the future. The respondents were European electricity market specialists, and the themes of the survey ranged from transmission networks and electricity trade to demand flexibility. One of the key findings was shared concern over the adequacy of transmission network capacity in Europe. It was considered that technical issues, such as existing transmission network bottlenecks, are most likely to form obstacles to creating common European electricity markets if new capacity is not built quickly enough. It was seen by the panellists that electricity trading arrangements, whilst important, are unlikely to form a barrier to the development of an internal electricity market. It was noted that electricity trading issues have recently been the subject of development work in the EU. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

GIS analysis was undertaken to estimate the distance class matrix to apportion the biomass feedstock supply side from different forest management units. Total cost per MW h power production at a 50 MW scale ranges from CAD 61.89 to CAD 63.79. Total cost per unit of electricity production decreases significantly as plant capacity increases due to economy of scale in the production system.

The second is a transition cost, whereby once a particular relationship has progressed to sex, it is difficult to move back. We estimate significant habit persistence in teen sex, implying that the long-run effects of contraception policy may be different from their short-run counterparts, especially if the failure rate of contraception is sufficiently large.

As an objective, this paper attempts to identify the factors responsible for the historical growth trends in aggregate domestic electricity demand quantifying their effects both in the short-run and long-run periods using the ARDL Bounds cointegration approach and the sample period 1975 to 2005. In the long-run, real per capita GDP, industry efficiency, structural changes in the economy, and degree of urbanisation are identified as the main driving force behind the historical growth trend in aggregate domestic electricity demand. However, in the short-run, real per capita GDP, industry efficiency, and degree of urbanisation are the main drivers of aggregate domestic electricity demand. Industry efficiency is the only factor that drives aggregate domestic electricity demand downwards. However, the negative efficiency effect is insufficient to have outweighed the positive income, output, and demographic effects, hence the continual growth in aggregate domestic electricity demand. As a policy option, we recommend that appropriate electricity efficiency standards be implemented at the industry level. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental sustainability is one of the most important factors to support global energy consumption and to absorb the pollution generated by human activities. Because emergy can be used to measure both money and energy flows in the same units, it provides a way to measure the real wealth of both natural and economic systems and the impact of human activities on these systems. A comparison of the carrying capacity of natural resources with the consumption of these resources at regional or global scales can provide a clear image of sustainability. To assess sustainability around the world, we used the National Environmental Accounting Database data for 102 nations (2008 data) to evaluate the resource consumption by 17 mainstream countries. Our results revealed that most of the countries consumed too many resources, thereby decreasing the overall global sustainability of the natural resources that sustain human society. Our results confirm previous predictions that to ensure long-term sustainability, it will be necessary to control population increases, reduce emergy consumption, and promote emergy efficiency.

Furthermore, we find that labour market determinants explain around one quarter of the variation of spatial agglomeration across industries.","Bank Italy, Branch Rome, Econ Res Unit, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Menon, C (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Branch Rome, Econ Res Unit, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",carlo.menon@bancaditalia.it,"Menon, Carlo/AAL-3158-2020","Menon, Carlo/0000-0003-0678-0434",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,30,16,18,0,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

It evaluates the effectiveness of local-scale energy policies in three sectors: households, transport, and the public sector (PS). Since the local energy demand is affected by summer tourism, seasonal consumption by holiday homes was also studied. Three scenarios were hypothesized: Business as Usual (BAU), Exemplary Public Sector (EPS), and Exemplary Municipality (EM). The EPS scenario models the exemplary role that recent European directives attribute to the PS in setting energy efficiency and technology penetration targets for itself; the EM scenario extends these targets to the household sector. In particular, the study underscores the potential of micro-cogeneration technologies in achieving local environmental targets, even though their diffusion would involve an increase in local energy consumption due to internalization of the primary energy used to produce electricity, which would no longer be wholly imported from outside municipal boundaries. The study provides information to local decision-makers by estimating the cost of implementing a number of energy policies. Finally, the study discusses the adequacy of TIMES as a tool to analyse municipal-scale scenarios. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Setbacks are provisions in local land use policies that dictate required separation distances between wind turbines and other land uses. Results of the study indicate that planners are not using a consistent method to ascertain appropriate distances and are often constrained by a lack of experience, resources, and expertise. These findings have important implications for wind energy regulation. Setbacks are intended to reasonably protect the public from the impacts of wind turbines, while allowing for some development. Municipalities in Canada may be best placed to consider local impacts of wind power, but the challenges identified raise concerns about potential arbitrariness. Setbacks that are unjustifiably high can unnecessarily close off territory and limit the ability to reach renewable energy targets. Taking regulatory power away from municipalities, as has happened in Ontario, can facilitate achievement of provincial targets, but may also increase opposition to projects at the local level.

The two policies are highly comparable, offering similar rates for most renewable electricity technologies. Major differences between the policies include the level of differentiation found in the German policy, as well as the use of a price degression strategy for FIT rates in Germany compared to an escalation strategy in Ontario. The German renewable electricity portfolio is relatively balanced, compared to Ontario where wind power dominates the portfolio. At the federal level, Canada does not yet have a policy similar to the European Directive on Renewable Energy, and this lack may impact decisions taken by manufacturers of renewable technologies who consider establishing operations in the province. Ontario's Green Energy and Green Economy Act could be benefit from lessons in the German system, especially with regard to degression of feed-in tariff rates over time, which could significantly reduce payments to producers over the course of a contract, and in turn encourage greater competitiveness among renewable power providers in the future.

Cost-efficiency is a crucial criterion for the achievement of such targets, requiring analyses of all possible options. Enhancing the oceanic carbon sink via ocean iron fertilization (OIF) provides such an option. Our analysis reveals that the critical unit costs per net ton of CO2 sequestered by OIF range from 22 to 28 USD (price level 2000) in a post-Kyoto compliance scenario. The critical unit costs are defined as those that would make an emitter indifferent between various abatement options. With reference to hypothetical short-term large-scale Southern Ocean OIF we are able to show that seven years of OIF provide a number of credits exceeding those obtainable from global forestation projects lasting 20 years. From an economic perspective, our results indicate that OIF can be considered a potentially viable carbon-removal option. However, further research is needed, especially on adverse side-effects and their ecological and economical consequences. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The main result of our econometric analysis on the basis of unique representative data from drivers' license holders in the USA and Germany refers to the strong discrepancy between the stated and revealed knowledge of CO2 offsetting. The revealed knowledge - measured by the correct estimation of the costs for this offsetting practice - has a positive impact on the stated purchase of corresponding offsetting credits in both countries. In contrast, the effect of the stated knowledge of offsetting is not robust and in some cases even negative. Surprisingly, it cannot even be confirmed that drivers' license holders who claim that they are more than sufficiently informed estimate these costs more accurately. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The survey covers six areas: household characteristics, dwelling characteristics, kitchen and home appliances, space heating and cooling, residential transportation, and electricity billing, metering, and pricing options. The results show that a typical Chinese household in 2012 consumed 1426 kilograms standard coal equivalent, which is approximately 44 percent of the 2009 level in the United States and 38 percent of the 2008 level in the EU-27. District heating, natural gas, and electricity are three major residential energy sources, while space heating, cooking, and water heating are three major end-use activities. Moreover, the results suggest a large urban-rural gap in terms of energy sources and purpose of usage. Commercial energy is used mainly for space heating in urban areas, while biomass dominates mainly for cooking purpose in rural areas.

Treatment processes are not free of environmental impacts; consequently assessment of the environmental performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has gained interest in recent years. Unlike other methods, a direct approach is followed to estimate environmental performance indicators (EPIs) using data envelopment analysis (DEA), i.e. an index of overall performance is directly obtained. The present study represents pioneering work to integrate environmental impacts in the assessment of the efficiency of WWTP estimating pure (PEPI) and mixed (MEPI) environmental performance indices fora sample of 60 Spanish WWTPs. Both direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were considered as undesirable outputs. The best functioning WWTPs to be used as references were identified, and the potential for GHG reductions was quantified. A second-stage analysis was conducted to isolate factors affecting WWTP environmental performance. The results of this study are valuable for WWTP operators and policy makers, since the benchmark procedure allows support for environmental and managerial decision-making. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, various charging strategies can be applied to make these vehicles more profitable. In this paper, controlled charging concepts are transferred to commercial fleets operating in closed transport systems, as we found this field of application particularly well suited for the implementation of charging strategies. We analyzed data gathered in a field experiment conducted in a European port using electric vehicles in combination with a battery-swapping station to calculate the economic potentials of three charging scenarios: (1) optimizing energy procurement (2) trading load-shifting potential on control markets, and (3) a combination of the two. The findings indicate that all approaches are appropriate for reducing economic disadvantages of electric transport vehicles. Furthermore, we find that adjusting charging processes to avoid price peaks is more profitable than offering control reserve. Finally, focusing on the combination of both strategies seems to be most promising from an economic perspective. In this context, operational cost savings of more than 65% can be achieved compared to a similar dieselpowered vehicle when applying this strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of the study show that the difference between the two official EU baseline projections, PRIMES-2007 (pre-recession, pre-Climate and Energy Package) and PRIMES-2013 (post-recession, including the new policies of the Package), can be explained by the combined impact of the new policies, the economic recession and other effects such as differences in energy prices. However, the impact of the other effects remains largely unexplained in the official PRIMES-2013 report and is clouding the right interpretation of the policy effect. By providing these insights, this study could help policy-makers in better understanding scenario outcomes and the impact of their policies. If EU Member States would be able to achieve their 2020 energy savings targets, then an important step has been taken to bridge the energy savings gap. Since the economic recession plays a major role in bridging this gap and economic recovery is aimed for, further intensification of energy efficiency policies is crucial to contribute to the GHG reduction target for 2030 and beyond.

Meanwhile, it is supposed to be cost-effective to jointly reduce China's carbon emissions through some collaborative activities among regions. Then a natural question is how to allocate the quotas among regions in light of the collaboration. For this purpose, the Shapley value method is adopted and the results show that, first, the regions with higher GDP, higher carbon outflow and higher carbon reduction connection should be allocated more carbon quotas. Moreover, when the collaboration is considered, the optimal allocation of carbon quotas among regions will change significantly compared to the basic quotas by the entropy method; and the Central region is allocated the largest proportion of carbon quota among regions, which indicates its largest radiation effect. Besides, the collaboration between the Central region and Northern coast region, and that between the Central region and the Eastern region should be paid close attention. These results may provide insightful support for decision makers to promote collaborative carbon reduction and allocate carbon quotas in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the model the paper analyzes the impacts of energy prices, risk-adjusted discount rates and accidents on the ESCO's bargaining strategies. The research shows that the greater the probability of adverse circumstances is, the higher is the revenue share (of the EU), and the more disadvantageous is the ESCO's position in the game. Furthermore, we design a forecast-commitment contract between an ESCO and an EU and analyze the optimal product's energy savings commitment strategy of the ESCO to cope with uncertain energy savings and contract risk. The research illustrates that by introducing penalties and commitments, the contract can eliminate the impact of the uncertain energy savings on the contract execution to a certain extent; when the EU takes a greater commitment risk, the ESCO is willing to provide a higher commitment, thus enhancing the strategy value of the bilateral relationship and reducing the contract risk. Finally, the policy recommendations about improving shared savings contract standard, third-party energy savings measurement and verification mechanism and arbitration mechanism of EPCs are provided.

We construct a dataset consisting of participant and non-participant households in both urban and rural areas of Rizhao city. By applying a quantile regression and counterfactual analysis, this study disentangles the impact of this subsidy program and inherent household attributes on per capita residential electricity consumption. First, contrary to the mean regression, the elasticity of electricity consumption to household's income, age, education and energy-saving awareness, varies markedly across the electricity consumption distribution and shows discrepancy between urban and rural areas. Second, while inherent household attributes are identified as a primary determinant to the changes in residential electricity consumption, the effect induced by the subsidy incentive is more significant at the middle of the electricity consumption distribution than at the tails. Third, there are significant rebound effects that lead to overall increase in household electricity consumption. Our results suggest that the disparity between urban and rural regions and targeted consumer behavior changes should be taken into account to ensure the effectiveness of a future energy-efficient subsidy program.

In the last decades the need to better understand and monitor energy-related activities taking place near or within the port has become more apparent as a consequence of the growing relevance of energy trades, public environmental awareness and a bigger industry focus on energy efficiency. The uptake in the port sector of innovative technologies, such as onshore power supply, or alternative fuels, such as LNG, and the increasing development of renewable energy installations in port areas, also calls for more attention to energy matters within port management. So far, however, few port authorities have actively pursued energy management strategies. The necessity for port authorities to actively manage their energy flows stems from their efforts to plan, coordinate and facilitate the development of economic activities within the port, and as a consequence of the heavier weight that sustainability is given within the port management strategies. Through the analysis of the experiences of two European ports, Hamburg and Genoa, that have already attempted to coordinate and rationalise their energy needs, this paper will argue that for the ports of the future active energy management can offer substantial efficiency gains, can contribute to the development of new alternative revenue sources and in the end, improve the competitive position of the port.

The empirical results show that forming a cross-province integrated energy market will in general reduce the response of equilibrium user costs of energy products to their local demand and production, through cross-regional energy transfer (including both energy trade and cross-regional reallocation). In particular, reducing transportation costs and improving marketization level are identified as two important policy instruments to enhance the role of energy market integration. The findings support the argument for a more competitive cross-province energy transfer policies and calls for more developed energy connectivity and associate institutional arrangements within China.

Plant modifications to improve thermal efficiency can trigger New Source Review (NSR), a Clean Air Act requirement to adopt of state-of-the-art pollution controls. This article explores whether existing coal plants would likely face additional pollution control requirements if they undertake modifications that trigger NSR. Despite emissions controls that are or will be installed under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) and Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) or its replacement, 80% of coal units (76% of capacity) that are expected to remain in operation are not projected to meet the minimum NSR requirements for at least one pollutant: nitrogen oxides or sulfur dioxide. This is an important consideration for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state policymakers as they determine the extent to which CO2 regulation will rely on unit-by-unit thermal efficiency gains versus potential flexible compliance strategies such as averaging, trading, energy efficiency, and renewable energy.

In this work we consider a transmission project in Italy and, relying on a recently proposed methodology, we compare costs and benefits of anticipating the planning process before the connection of new power plants becomes certain. Whereas the system faces lower congestion costs if the network is reinforced immediately, anticipation constitutes a sunk cost in case generation is not built. For realistic load and generation scenarios, anticipation costs, as well as differences in investment times, our results indicate that anticipation is the most efficient choice for a relatively low connection probability.

This study develops a diffusion model that incorporates the effect of competitive interrelationships among renewable sources to forecast the growth pattern of five RETs: solar photovoltaic, wind power, and fuel cell in the electric power sector, and solar thermal and geothermal energy in the heating sector. The 2-step forecasting procedure is based on the Bayus, (1993. Manage. Sci. 39, 11, 1319-1333) price function and a diffusion model suggested by Hahn et al. (1994. Marketing Sci. 13, 3, 224-247).

We sampled a group of stakeholders involved in various energy sub-sectors to uncover perspectives on how to achieve and promote access to modern energy, energy efficiency and renewable energy in Africa, whether the perceptions could be correlated to educational or geographical background and implications such patterns could have on policies and current dialogues. We found that all stakeholders agree on the need to prioritise sustainability but had different views on how to achieve sustainable energy for all in Africa, depending on the relevance given to each energy driver. Stakeholders could be categorised into four groups: (I) preference of large-scale high-impact projects; (II) supporters of targeted sectoral solutions with preference for small-scale technology and microfinance; (III) supporters of centralised solutions with preference for grid extension, and (IV) supporters of local entrepreneurship with scepticism about centralised solutions. The results show that differences in stakeholders' perceptions can be associated with respondents' educational but not geographical background. This implies that dialogues on energy in Africa should focus on inter-disciplinary understanding while further examining the trans-continent consensus that appears to have been established.

Value chain dynamics, settlement trajectories and regional development, Regional Studies. Global value chain (GVC) analysis has little to say about the interaction between regions and global chain dynamics. However, recent calls to address broader development issues have resulted in efforts to incorporate a spatial dimension in GVC analysis. Addressing this issue, the paper argues that GVC analysis needs to be combined with the examination of livelihoods at settlement level. Livelihood diversification - or lack thereof - indicates particular settlement trajectories that constitute regional development pathways. It is also suggested that the understanding of how regions are shaped by value chain dynamics will improve by adding elements from global production network (GPN) theory to the combined methodology, namely by an examination of territorial embeddedness and value (creation, enhancement, capture, distribution) at settlement level.","[Fold, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resources Management, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Fold, N (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resources Management, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",nf@geo.ku.dk,"Fold, Niels/E-2776-2015","Fold, Niels/0000-0002-1133-6525",,,,,46,32,34,2,97,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In this paper, the main drivers increasing GHG emissions from the Chinese city of Suzhou between 2005 and 2010 were identified and quantitatively analyzed using the Kaya identity and the log-mean Divisia index method. We found that economy and population were the major drivers of GHG emissions in Suzhou, having contributed 162.20% and 109.04%, respectively, to the increase in emissions. A decline in carbon intensity, which was caused by the declining energy intensity and an adjustment to the mixture of power and industrial structures, was the major determinant and accounted for a reduction of 171.24% in GHG emissions. Slowing and maintaining healthy growth rates of economy and population could be the primary and most effective means if Suzhou tries to curb the total emissions over the short term. It may be more realistic for Suzhou to control emissions by optimizing the economic structure for low-carbon industrial development because of the city's relative high energy requirements and low potential to mitigate GHGs by adjusting the energy mixture.

Given the uncertainty in future retail rates and the inherent links between rates and the customer-economics of behind-the-meter PV, there is growing interest in understanding how potential changes in rates may impact the value of bill savings from PV. In this article, we first use a production cost and capacity expansion model to project California hourly wholesale electricity market prices under two potential electricity market scenarios, including a reference and a 33% renewables scenario. Second, based on the wholesale electricity market prices generated by the model, we develop retail rates (i.e., flat, time-of-use, and real-time pricing) for each future scenario based on standard retail rate design principles. Finally, based on these retail rates, the bill savings from PV is estimated for 226 California residential customers under two types of net metering, for each scenario. We find that high renewable penetrations can drive substantial changes in residential retail rates and that these changes, together with variations in retail rate structures and PV compensation mechanisms, interact to place substantial uncertainty on the future value of bill savings from residential PV.

This paper presents a slack-based measure approach to investigating the relationship between fossil fuel consumption and the environmental regulation of China's thermal power generation. We first calculate the total-factor energy efficiency without considering environmental constraints. An environmental performance indicator is proposed through decomposing the total-factor energy efficiency. The proposed approach is then employed to examine whether environmental regulation affects the energy efficiency of China's thermal power generation. We find that the environmental efficiency plays a significant role in affecting energy performance of China's thermal generation sector. Decreasing the discharge of major pollutants can improve both energy performance and environmental efficiency. Besides, we also have three main findings: (1) The energy efficiency and environmental efficiency were relatively low. (2) The energy and environmental efficiency scores show great variations among provinces. (3) Both energy efficiency and environmental efficiency are of obvious geographical characteristics. According to our findings, we suggest some policy implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Modelling of Australia's National Electricity Market in 2035 is undertaken using Australian Energy Market Operator assumptions for fuel costs, capital costs and demand forecasts. An electricity market simulation package (PLEXOS), which uses deterministic linear programming techniques and transmission and generating plant data, is used to optimize the power system and determine the least cost dispatch of generating resources to meet a given demand. We find that wholesale market prices increase due to the full pass through of the increased costs of gas over coal as an input fuel and the Carbon Price. In addition, we find that wholesale prices increase by more than the pass through of fuel and carbon costs because of the fact that generators can charge infra-marginal rents and engage in strategic behaviour to maximize their profits.

By means of a power plant dispatching optimisation model, the study assesses the optimal BEV charging/discharging strategies in grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) schemes. The results show that the 2% rise in power demand required to power these BEVs does not hamper system stability provided an optimal G2V scheme is applied. Moreover, such BEV deployment can contribute to further integrating wind and solar power generation. Applying a V2G scheme would increase the capacity factors of base and mid-load power plants, leading to a higher integration of intermittent renewables and resulting in a decrease in system costs. However, the evaluation of the profitability of BEVs shows that applying a V2G scheme is not a viable economic option due to the high cost of investing in batteries. Some BEV owners would make modest profits ((ss)6 a year), but a higher number would sustain losses, for reasons of scale. For BEVs to become part of the power system, further incentives are necessary to make the business model attractive to car owners. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Though the banking system benefited from financial globalisation, these benefits have been lost to the crises. It surveys the financial system to discover the areas of protection needed for the market and the need to take precautions via the use of policy instruments right away before another burst in the market. It also recommends that the banks be incentivised to lend more to the real sector since banks have suddenly become risk averse.

Machines are situated within the reach of the robotic arm whose goal is to carry out transport operations of semi-products to the subsequent manufacturing machines in accordance with the determined timescale. Heuristic algorithms are implemented to control the order making process. Minimizing the order making time remains the basic criterion.

In the past, financial accounting has been criticized for lacking rules based on a clear theoretical framework. In addition, the accounting rules developed have been criticized for being too loose, for lacking consistency and for failing to portray economic reality. For instance, failure of professional accountants and academics to recognize Human Resources Accounting (HRA) in the financial statement as an important factor in the determination of performances of banks is one of the drawbacks mentioned in the literature. The study objective presents an appraisal of human capital accounting on performance of Micro Finance Banks (MFB) in Nigeria; specifically using content analysis of the annual reports and financial statements of the sampled Micro Finance Banks. A purposive sample of Sixteen (16) Micro finance banks out of the thirty four (34) existing in Ogun state was investigated. Random sampling technique is used to select respondents in each Micro Finance Banks cutting across directors, employees and shareholders of the Micro Finance Banks. A total of 320 collected questionnaires were used for data analysis. The data were analyzed using (parametric and non-parametric techniques) appropriate descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. A total of 314 of the sample (representing 98.4% of the sample) agreed that human resources expenditure should be capitalized and treated as assets rather than write off to profit and loss accounts. The study also shows that human resources accounting has a significant effect on MFBs performance. The Study recommends that the accounting profession the world over should create a frame work in the balance sheet to recognize treatment of human resources and appropriate value be attached on the inherent qualities of human capital.","[Ikpefan, Ochei Ailemen; Taiwo, J.

The objective of this study was to understand how soil management affects soil fertility, compaction and infiltration over time. To this end, two bare soil techniques were compared, tillage (TT) and total herbicide (HT) with two cover crops; annual cereal (CT) and annual grass (AGT), established for 8 years. CT treatment showed the highest organic matter content, having the biggest amount of biomass incorporated into the soil. The annual adventitious vegetation in TT treatment (568 kg dry matter ha(-1)) that was incorporated into the soil, kept the organic matter content higher than HT levels and close to AGT level, in spite of the greater aboveground annual biomass production of this treatment (3632 kg dry matter ha(-1)) whereas only its roots were incorporated into the soil. TT presented the highest bulk density under the tractor track lines and a greatest resistance to penetration (at 0.2 m depth). AGT presented bulk density values (upper 0.4 m) lower than TT and penetration resistance in CT lower (at 0.20 m depth) than TT too. The HT decreased water infiltration due to a superficial crust generated for this treatment. These results indicate that the use of annual grass cover can be a good choice of soil management in Mediterranean climate due to soil quality improvement, with low competition and simple management.","[Linares, Ruben; de la Fuente, Mario; Junquera, Pedro; Ramon Lissarrague, Jose; Baeza, Pilar] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Prod, Grp Invest Viticultura, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Linares, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Prod, Grp Invest Viticultura, Ciudad Univ S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",,"Junquera, Pedro/JVZ-7236-2024; Lissarrague, Jose Ramon/AAR-5619-2020; Baeza, Pilar/R-4545-2019; de la Fuente, Mario/B-8875-2013","Junquera, Pedro/0009-0002-6111-9315; Baeza, Pilar/0000-0003-2891-9513; de la Fuente, Mario/0000-0003-4333-9728",,,,,35,13,13,1,29,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2014,3.0,,1.0,,,,,,,10.1051/bioconf/20140301008,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BB8BQ,,"gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346256100008,0

Yet relative distance-based disadvantages remain in respect of time-dependent applications and those hosted on distant infrastructures or requiring data sourced from distant locations. Trading off the effects of faster local access and latency on the time taken to load a Web page based on the HTTP Web protocol, we demonstrate that the increasing returns to distance rapidly overcome the effect of faster local access bandwidth as the distance the data must travel increases. We conclude that claims that investment in ultra-fast local broadband access will unconditionally facilitate a step-change in national economic performance are without foundation. In the absence of some compelling underlying competitive advantages, the 'transformational' economic benefits will be local rather than international in nature. At best, government investment in nationwide fast fibre networks is a defensive strategy that enables ongoing participation in the international economy, but at relatively higher costs than those faced by larger economies in closer proximity to end markets.","[Obren, Mark; Howell, Bronwyn] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Inst Study Competit & Regulat Inc, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Howell, B (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Inst Study Competit & Regulat Inc, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",bronwyn.howell@vuw.ac.nz,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

It is expected that this approach provides better results than using a single scorecard for all the clients in the sample. The aim of this article is to build a useful model for banking field by dividing the groups of borrowers into clusters in order to obtain a profile of the customers (debtors and good payers). We assume that a class (cluster) is appropriate if it contains members that have a high degree of similarity measured by a variance in the cluster. Techniques used in this paper are primarily based on K-means algorithm and Kohonen clustering method. K-means algorithms as an iterative technique reaching the optimum clustering are used for assignation of a set of n observations into k clusters. Results, acquired after application of K-means, are compared with results from SOM (self-organizing map) and Kohonen clustering method.

The following legislative tools are involved: emission limits, emission ceilings (caps) and emissions trading system of the EU (EU ETS). A profit optimizing stochastic model respecting mentioned constraints is designed in this paper. The designed model may be used by companies to exploit opportunities arising from legislative factors to get the competitive advantage or at least to minimize a negative influence of the factors on business. Similarly to [5] or [8], prices of emission permit and a demand for products is taken as uncertain.

Results showed enormous savings in CO2 emissions, for the most likely case, year 2025 reported savings that range from 136 up to 235 MtCO(2). Including low growth and high growth cases, these savings could range from 115 up to 468 MtCO(2) presenting such an unrivalled opportunity for Saudi Arabia.

In order to develop the adoption of RE, the cooperatives have to seek to influence the behaviour of their members so that they switch from the use of traditional fossil energy to RE. This paper examines the various barriers to adoption of RE and the way cooperatives are circumventing those obstacles in order to develop the use of RE. This study surveyed a sample of 9 cooperatives from countries where governments are subsidizing the use of RE. The paper identifies a set of specific barriers to the adoption of RE by consumers. It also reveals that cooperatives effectively contribute to the uptake of RE with community-based social marketing initiatives that are lowering those barriers successfully. Those initiatives are related to educational communication, low prices, local offers with complementary services, and cooperative distribution. The paper put forwards a framework for the assessment of how each of those initiatives contributes to the diminishing of each of the barriers to adoption of RE. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The main focuses of the analyses are the power generation mix in 2030, and particularly electricity supply shares of nuclear power. The options proposed by the government assume drastic energy efficiency improvements, increase in renewable energy, and deep CO2 emission reductions. Considerable energy savings are assumed by the government even in the baseline scenario, and these are inconsistent with historical growth trends for GDP and power demand. We modify the energy savings baseline scenario for consistency with the historical trends and historical electricity savings after the nuclear power accident. In order to provide a wider array of options, particularly those with fewer negative impacts on GDP, this paper proposes alternative options under a revised baseline. In the alternative options, we assume lower shares of renewable energy in electricity supply and lower carbon price. The economic impacts for the alternative options are much smaller than those assumed by the government. The economic analyses provided in this paper will help future policy making for energy and environment in Japan. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Within this framework, we answer the question how the potential irreversibility of pollution affects the extraction path. We investigate the conditions under which the economy will optimally adopt a reversible policy, and when it is optimal to enter the irreversible region. In the case of irreversibility it may be optimal to leave a positive amount of resource in the ground forever. As far as the optimal extraction/emission policy is concerned, several types of solutions may arise, including solutions where the economy stays at the threshold for a while. Given that different programs may satisfy the first order conditions for optimality, we further investigate when each of these is optimal. We show that it is never optimal for the economy to stay at the threshold for a while before entering the irreversible region. The optimality analysis is then illustrated by means of a calibrated example. To sum up, for any pollution level, we can identify a critical resource stock such that there exist multiple optima i.e. a reversible and an irreversible policy that yield exactly the same present value. For any resource stock below this critical value, the optimal policy is reversible whereas with large enough resources, irreversible policies outperform reversible programs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

CSP technologies have found significant space in the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) of the Indian government in which 20,000 MW grid connected solar power projects have been targeted by 2022 with 50% capacity for CSP. In this study a preliminary attempt has been made to assess the potential of CSP generation in the Northwestern (NW) regions of India; which seems a high potential area as it has the highest annual solar radiation in India, favorable meteorological conditions for CSP and large amount of waste land. The potential of CSP systems in NW India is estimated on the basis of a detailed solar radiation and land resource assessment. The energy yield exercise has been carried out for the representative locations using System Advisor Model for four commercially available CSP technologies namely Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC), Central receiver system (CRS), Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) and Parabolic Dish System (PDS). The financial viability of CSP systems at different locations in NW India is also analyzed in this study. On the basis of a detailed solar radiation and land resource assessment, the maximum theoretical potential of CSP in NW India is estimated over 2000 GW taking into accounts the viability of different CSP technologies and land suitability criteria. The technical potential is estimated over 1700 GW at an annual direct normal incidence (DNI) over 1800 kW h/m(2) and finally, the economic potential is estimated over 700 GW at an annual DNI over 2000 kW h/m(2) in NW India. It is expected that in near future locations with lower DNI values could also become financially feasible with the development of new technologies, advancement of materials, economy of scale, manufacturing capability along with the enhanced policy measures etc. With an annual DNI over 1600 kW h/m(2) it is possible to exploit over 2000 GW CSP in the NW India.

This phenomenon is known as the energy efficiency gap and has been extensively investigated in the literature. Barrier models to explain the gap are primarily oriented towards the technical aspects of energy efficiency and often disregard its social aspects. The aim of our research was to identify the social structures that play a prominent role in moving society towards greater energy efficiency, to investigate their perceptions of the levers for and brakes to greater participation in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and to provide recommendations for policy enhancement. Four groups of stakeholders were identified: public institutions, businesses, civil society organisations and the media. A survey was administered to 93 representatives of these groups in Croatia. The results indicate that to encourage the society to adopt energy efficiency improvements, it is crucial for public institutions to play a leading role with the support of strong and visible political commitment. The level of benefit recognition among all groups is weak, which together with the slow progression of dialogue between and within the analysed groups is preventing full policy uptake.

We answer this question by estimating a new-Keynesian monetary policy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for a number of economies with a variety of empirical proxies of the business cycle. The effects of two different policy shocks, an unexpected interest rate hike conditional on a constant inflation target and an unpredicted drift in the inflation target, are scrutinized. Filter-specific Bayesian impulse responses are contrasted with those obtained by combining multiple business cycle indicators.

National and regional markets are now characterized by the presence of domestic and foreign firms, both privately and publicly owned. Did foreign entry induce positive productivity spillovers to domestic firms in the electricity sector, both at the aggregate and disaggregated level, while also controlling for domestic firms' ownership? This paper examines this issue by focusing on regional foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers in the aggregated electricity sector and in the disaggregated sub-sectors of generation and distribution. The results show the importance of industry aggregation in determining the existence and sign of regional FDI spillovers for domestic firms. FDI spillovers are then calculated based on a purely geographic scale, by considering the distance between each firm's city of location and firms in neighboring cities. The importance and sign of FDI spillovers is different with respect to the analysis based on regional administrative boundaries, suggesting that spatial aggregation, along with industrial aggregation, is relevant in accounting for productivity spillover effects of foreign presence in the EU electricity sector.

We explored whether the changing flows of sales and purchases, spillovers and commuting between 1982 and 2006 suggested a dominance of spread effects or backwash effects.

Covering eight regions of the world, determinants are estimated in relative and absolute terms for the period 1971-2010. We use the unparalleled 2010 global surge in CO2 emissions as a reference and entry point for the analysis. Overall, results show that most regions have recently performed worse than their historical trends and lack of meaningful progress is identified. Whereas specific drivers for certain regions suggest some level of continuous improvement (e.g. reduced energy intensity in Asia, decarbonisation of of energy supply in OECD Europe), they are incapable of offsetting the effects of economic growth and increased energy use. With the exception of Africa, most regions appear to have missed the low-carbon economy opportunity' provided by the 20082009 global financial crisis. Results suggest a lack of serious environmental effectiveness of regional policy portfolios aiming at reducing CO2 emissions. Highly ambitious energy efficiency and renewable energy policies across all regions are immediately needed. Additionally, absolute reductions in energy use from fossil fuels and resulting CO2 emissions are urgently required in rich regions if we are to align production and consumption patterns with maintaining global warming below the 2 degrees C threshold.

While some regions are managing better than others, lessons, both political and technical, highlight challenges ahead that need to be overcome. Since the early 2000s, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru have decided to integrate their electricity markets, eventually creating an enormous Latin American electricity exchange, ranging from Mexico to Chile. This poses opportunities and threats to the region as it involves cooperation, trust, and the will to overcome difficulties that may arise. In this direction, we developed a system dynamics model, linked to an iterative algorithm, to assess the likely effects of integration on both system expansion and security of supply. The model helps us understand the logic of the long-term system behavior under different policies, assuming Market Coupling as the dispatch mechanism. Based on theoretical grounds and after analyzing simulation results under different scenarios, we conclude that the integration of electricity markets may render important opportunities regarding security of supply and efficiency; and consequently energy might be supplied at lower prices, using cleaner technologies. However, benefits largely depend on policy, regulation, and technical issues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of biofuels production on agricultural land area vary by year; from a net expansion of 0.17 ha per 1000 gallons produced (2002) to a net contraction of -0.13 ha per 1000 gallons (2018) in Case 1 of our simulation. In accordance with the general narrative about the implications of biofuel policy, agricultural land area increased in many regions of the world. However, oil-export dependent economies experienced agricultural land contraction because of reductions in their revenues. Reducing crude oil imports is a major goal of biofuel policy, but the land use change implications have received little attention in the literature. Simulations evaluating the effects of doubling supply elasticities for land and fossil resources show that these parameters can significantly influence the land use change estimates. Therefore, research that provides empirically-based and spatially-detailed agricultural land-supply curves and capability to project future fossil energy prices is critical for improving estimates of the effects of biofuel policy on land use.

These measures can be pictured by a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) which is a common way to show CO2-e abatement potential and its related costs in various fields. In this paper, we calculated the marginal CO2-e abatement cost curve for Austria for the first time to fulfill the need for country specific cost curves. One of the strengths of such curves lies in their ability to highlight that energy efficiency measures can even have negative abatement costs. The weaknesses consist of neglecting a change in energy prices, the rate of diffusion, and compatibility with existing technologies. By using a static bottom-up approach we constructed the MACC for four economic sectors (household, service, transport, energy) and found a national mitigation potential of 45.4 million tons CO2-e. The results further show that even with the measures with negative abatement costs it is possible to make the necessary CO2-e mitigation to fulfill the Kyoto Protocol. The conclusions emphasize that the curve makes a contribution to overcome one of the barriers of implementation by providing enhanced information on energy efficiency measures and its costs.

We provide evidence that such conditions are plausible for many sectors in the UK. A key implication is that the short run effects of such taxes should not be felt in final good prices, since these are determined in world markets, but in terms of underlying profitability. These changes in underlying profits provide two key incentives for producers to change to more environmentally friendly production techniques and to switch resources to production of less environmentally harmful goods. Using input output techniques we provide evidence for the UK to show how existing fossil energy and other green taxes have affected underlying profitability. The evidence shows quite strong profit incentives to shift resources from a small number of energy intensive industries to others. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The main result is that a higher degree of responsibility of consumers and/or firms may both increase and decrease the total abatement and the social welfare. In general an increment in the degree of CSR of a firm entails an increase of its total clean-up and a reduction of the aggregate abatement of its rival. When the rival firm has a high degree of CSR this second effect is stronger than the first and total abatement falls down. At the same time, when the degree of consciousness of consumers and/or firms is very high, responsible firms overprovide environmental quality: in such case a further increment in the level of social responsibility of a market actor may trigger an increase of firms' total clean-up but a reduction in social welfare.

Even though relevant polices have been issued for energy conservation, the energy consumption increased by 5% every year, which suggests that the top-down approach telling students and staff what to do does not work effectively. Based on a comprehensive method which includes the individual and social aspects related to the energy behaviour, the research analyses the promotion of individual engagement in building a low carbon campus through behaviour change based on four main aspects: (1) awareness raising and behaviour forming; (2) approaches to encourage behaviour change; (3) beyond the barriers and the constraints; and (4) systems and mechanisms for the long-term engagement. A low carbon management system is proposed for not only addressing management and technical solutions at the university level, but also based on the contributions from behaviour changes in establishing a low carbon campus at Fudan University at the individual level.

The imperfectness of the carbon price is motivated by political concerns regarding distributional effects of increased energy prices. Hence, carbon prices are considered to be temporarily or permanently absent or endogenously constrained by their effect on energy prices. We use a global general equilibrium model with an intertemporal fossil resource sector and calculate intertemporally optimal policies from a broad set of policy instruments including carbon taxes, renewable energy subsidies and feed-in-tariffs, among others. If carbon pricing is permanently missing, mitigation costs increase by a multiple (compared to the optimal carbon pricing policy) for a wide range of parameters describing extraction costs, renewable energy costs, substitution possibilities and normative attitudes. Furthermore, we show that small deviations from the second-best subsidy can lead to strong increases in emissions and consumption losses. This confirms the rising concerns about the occurrence of unintended side effects of climate policy - a new version of the green paradox. Smart combinations of carbon prices and renewable energy subsidies, however, can achieve ambitious mitigation targets at moderate additional costs without leading to high energy price increases.

In this paper, we study the mechanisms of adjustment and economic welfare consequences of various ETS regimes that Turkey considers to apply by 2020, i.e. regional ETS and international trading within the EU ETS. We conduct our analysis under the current EU 20-20-20 emission target, 20%, and also under its revised version, 30%. We find that Turkey has economic gains from linking with the EU ETS under the 20% cap, in comparison to the domestic ETSs. Despite the EU's welfare loss under linkage in comparison to the case where Turkey has domestic abatement efforts, it still prefers linking as it increases economic well being compared to the case where Turkey does not abate. Under 30% cutback, Turkey has critical output loss under linkage due to high abatement burden on the EU, while the EU is better off as it passes some of its abatement burden to Turkey. Therefore, emission quotas and their allocation across the ETS and non ETS sectors become highly critical in distributing the overall economic gains from bilateral trading. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, appropriate mark-to-market evaluation of new investments in wind power and energy storage plants should consider the fluctuant generation of wind power And uncertain electricity prices, which are affected by wind power feed-in (WPF). To gain the input data for WPF and electricity prices, simulation models, such as econometric models, can serve as a data basis. This paper describes a combined modeling approach for the simulation of WPF series and electricity prices considering the impacts of WPF on prices based on an autoregressive approach. Thereby WPF series are firstly simulated for each hour of the year and integrated in the electricity price model to generate an hourly resolved price series for a year. The model results demonstrate that the WPF model delivers satisfying WPF series and that the extended electricity price model considering WPF leads to a significant improvement of the electricity price simulation compared to a model version without WPF effects. As the simulated series of WPF and electricity prices also contain the correlation between both series, market evaluation of wind power technologies can be accurately done based on these series.

It begins with analysis of gross fixed capital formation and decarbonisation trends to examine past performance of OECD countries in reducing GHG emissions from 1997 to 2007. Many OECD countries made progress in decoupling GHG emissions from infrastructure investment in residential buildings, and to a lesser extent from power and industry, but increased efforts are required, especially in the transportation sector. The analysis highlights the need to accelerate the pace and scale of change to reverse GHG emission trends to bring into reach ambitious climate policy goals. It then assesses future global infrastructure needs under low-carbon and business-as-usual (BAU) global warming scenarios, and the incremental costs of going low-carbon are estimated to be small relative to the magnitude of the BAU infrastructure investment needs. Global infrastructure needs for 2015-2020, including buildings and transportation vehicles, are approximately 6.7 trillion USD/year under BAU. Incremental costs of low-carbon infrastructure are of the order 70 to +450 billion USD/year. Achieving climate resilient infrastructure may add costs, but there is potentially synergistic overlap with low-carbon attributes. Although estimates are incomplete, the technical and financial inter-dependency between infrastructure systems suggests the potential to generate infrastructure investment to support a virtuous cycle of low-carbon growth.

Understanding the driving forces of carbon emissions is necessary for policy formulation and decomposition analysis is widely used for this purpose. This study uses an extended Kaya identity as the scheme and applies the log mean Divisia index (LMDI I) as the decomposition technique. Change in carbon emissions is decomposed from 1990 to 2010 and includes a measure of the effect of renewable energy penetration. Results illustrate that scale effects of affluence and population growth act to increase emissions and are countered primarily by energy intensity and fossil fuel substitution. Renewable energy penetration has a minor effect but has been increasing in recent years. Policy will need to significantly reduce intensity and increase renewables if applicable targets are to be reached. This requires not only a comprehensive suite of policies and measures but emphasis on the development path and 'non-technical' change for optimal outcomes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Jacobson and Delucchi replied defending their position. This is a response to the main points made in that reply. The main issues are to do with intermittency of renewable energy sources and the implications for redundant plant and storage, vehicle to grid systems as a storage solution, the embodied energy costs of renewable energy, and overall system capital costs. It is argued that Jacobson and Delucchi do not provide satisfactory analyses of these issues and that they do not show that energy supply can be 100% renewable.

We begin by examining what types of firms were most likely to participate in this voluntary initiative. We find that the Climate Wise program was attractive to large firms, more R&D intensive firms, and firms with more financial resources. To consider the impact of Climate Wise participation on the innovative behavior of firms, we investigate whether participants and non-participants differed in the number of successful environmental and non-environmental patent applications between 1993 and 2003.

The processes of spatial polarization and territorial integration that have taken place in Italy since the 1950s have not been accompanied by corresponding institutional adaptations, generating the current huge discrepancy between the functional and politicaladministrative organization of the territory. It is argued that this institutional lock-in is rooted in a mistaken conceptualization of territorial integration, which has focused solely on the identification of the emerging functional urban areas', neglecting the fundamental phenomenon of the formation of inter-municipal territorial systems which have acquired the nature of cities de facto. On the basis of both functional and morphological features, this paper identifies the cities de facto with regard to the eight largest Italian cities de jure.","[Calafati, Antonio G.; Veneri, Paolo] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Econ, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Calafati, AG (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Econ, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",a.g.calafati@univpm.it; p.veneri@univpm.it,"Veneri, Paolo/JCP-4773-2023","Veneri, Paolo/0000-0002-4640-5500",,,,,54,13,13,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Previous studies have evaluated the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of CFE, but they have largely overlooked the influences of different agricultural planting modes. In this study, five scenarios related to cassava planting modes were selected to evaluate the lifecycle energy balance and GHG emissions of the CFE system. The results show that, although all the five CFE scenarios show positive net energy values (NEV) and GHG emissions savings compared with the conventional gasoline, the planting modes have significant impacts on their energy and GliG performance. Modes that are considered intensive (i.e. high fertilizer use intensity and highly mechanized harvesting) generally show poorer performance than the extensive ones, primarily because of the intensive energy consumption and GHG emissions during nitrogen fertilizer production, the N2O emission of nitrogen fertilizer use, and higher yield loss rate caused by mechanized harvesting. This study shows that it is important to evaluate the planting modes when producing bioethanol in order to gain an understanding of the life-cycle energy use and GHG performance.

We provide a comprehensive assessment of the cost competitiveness of this electric power source. Based on data available for the second half of 2011, we conclude that utility-scale PV installations are not yet cost competitive with fossil fuel power plants. In contrast, commercial-scale installations have already attained cost parity in the sense that the generating cost of power from solar PV is comparable to the retail electricity prices that commercial users pay, at least in certain parts of the U.S. This conclusion is shown to depend crucially on both the current federal tax subsidies for solar power and an ideal geographic location for the solar installation. Projecting recent industry trends into the future, we estimate that utility-scale solar PV facilities are on track to become cost competitive by the end of this decade. Furthermore, commercial-scale installations could reach grid parity in about ten years, if the current federal tax incentives for solar power were to expire at that point. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Korean consumers have been required to pay for their use of renewable electricity as of 2012. First, we find that Korean consumers recognise renewable electricity as a differentiated good from traditional electricity generated from fossil fuels or nuclear energy. The mean willingness to pay to use renewable electricity is USD 1.26 per month. Second, we confirm the existence of perfect substitution relationships. among variant renewable technologies, which suggests that Korean consumers do not perceive them as differentiated goods. One reason for this perception is that Korean consumers are more inclined to favour economic feasibility over sustainability or the availability of the resource stock when choosing between renewable technology types. In sum, we can say that Korean consumers recognise renewable electricity as a differentiated good but that they do not differentiate between variant renewable technologies. Thus, the imposition of the cost of renewable electricity on consumers in the form of increased electricity charges would be acceptable to consumers as long as any price rise properly reflects their preferences.

We find that the common component of changes in unit labour costs has a notable impact on inflation.

To support the development of public policies aimed to decrease total tonnes of emissions, we used a bottom-up approach to estimate the amount of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), nitrogen oxides (NO,), particulate matter (PM), and aldehydes (RCHO), that are emitted by road transportation in the state of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) from 1980 to 2010. The results from 2010 show that cars are responsible for 55% of CO emissions, 61% of THC emissions, and 93% of RCHO emissions. Due to the use of hydrated ethanol and compressed natural gas (CNG) instead of petroleum based fuels during the period analyzed, 1,760,370 t of air pollutant emissions were avoided. Compared to Brazil, in 2010, RJ had a quantity of emissions per vehicle from 12% (CO) to 59% (PM) smaller than the national average. As strategies to reduce air pollutant emissions, we consider reducing the intensity of use, with a proportional reduction in emissions, and increased the use of biodiesel. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology is applied to Portugal and results are analyzed in a life-cycle perspective. A BAU trend and 5 additional scenarios are explored: Policy-based (Portuguese political targets considered); Liquid fuels-based (dependency on liquid fuels and no deployment of alternative refueling infrastructure); Diversified (introduction of a wide diversity of alternative vehicle technology/energy sources); Electricity vision (deployment of a wide spread electricity recharging infrastructure); Hydrogen pathway (a broad hydrogen refueling infrastructure is deployed). Total life-cycle energy consumption could decrease between 2 and 66% in 2050 relatively to 2010, while CO2 emissions will decrease between 7 and 73% in 2050 relatively to 2010. In 2050 the BAU scenario remains 30% above the 1990 level for energy consumption and CO2 emissions; the other considered scenarios lead to 4 to 29% reductions for energy consumption and 10 to 33% for CO2 emissions in 2050 compared to the BAU. Therefore, alternative vehicle technologies are required in the long-term, but changes in taxation and alternative transportation modes policies are crucial for achieving short-term impacts.

Recently, China has taken a series of measures to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions from the coke industry, including eliminating old and low energy-efficiency coking technologies, promoting advanced technologies, and strengthening energy and environmental requirements on coking processes. As a consequence, China's coke industry is experiencing an unprecedented technology shift, which was characterized by the elimination of old, inefficient, and polluting indigenous ovens and small machinery ones within 10 years. This study examines the policies and the prompt technology shift in China's coke industry, as well as the associated energy and environmental effects, and discusses the implications with respect to the development of the coke industry in China towards a more efficient and clean future. As China sets stricter requirements on energy efficiency and the ambient environment, a more significant change focusing on technologies of energy saving and emission reduction is urgently needed at present. Those mature technologies, including coke dry quenching, coke oven gas recycle, fine particle removal, etc., should be enforced in the near future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2011 in particular, high coal prices and capped electricity prices in China discouraged coal-fired power generation, triggering widespread power shortages. We suggest that these coal-price disturbances could be symptomatic of a major change in pricing dynamics of global fossil-fuel markets, with increasing correspondence between coal and oil prices globally. Historically, global coal prices have been more stable and lower than oil and natural gas prices on a per-heat basis. In recent years, however, coal prices have been increasingly volatile worldwide and have tracked other fossil fuel prices more closely. Meanwhile, the recent development of unconventional gas has substantially decoupled US natural gas and oil prices. Technically, low US natural gas prices, with potential fuel switching, could drive US domestic coal prices lower. However, this effect is unlikely to counteract the overall trend in increasing coal consumption globally. China's market size and unique, partially-controlled energy system make its reform agenda a key force in the global economy. Policymakers in the US, E.U. and elsewhere should monitor China's economic reform agenda to anticipate and respond to changes accompanying China's increasing importance in the global energy economy.

In the new White Paper on transport, the role of road freight transports in this is strongly emphasized. This far, however, the efficiency practices utilised in logistics firms are less studied. Drawing from policy goals and new survey data on 295 road transport firms our results show that hauliers are aware of the possible energy efficiency actions but lack the knowledge and resources to fully utilize them. Energy efficiency seems also to be unimportant for many shippers, so there are no incentives for hauliers to improve it. Examples from various countries show that clear energy efficiency improvements can be achieved with active cooperation between hauliers, shippers and policy makers. Such cooperation can be developed in Finland through the sectoral energy efficiency agreements. The novelty and the utility of these results allow scholars to answer important open questions in the national-level determinants of enhancing energy efficiency practices among road freight hauliers, and contribute to our understanding of how these can be fostered in public policies.

We derive generic moment conditions and an optimal weight matrix that can be used for generalized method-of-moments (GMM) estimation of any parametric income distribution. Our derivation of the weight matrix and its inverse allows us to express the seemingly complex GMM objective function in a relatively simple form that facilitates estimation. We show that our proposed approach, which incorporates information on class means as well as population proportions, is more efficient than maximum likelihood estimation of the multinomial distribution, which uses only population proportions. In contrast to the earlier work of Chotikapanich, Griffiths, and Rao, and Chotikapanich, Griffiths, Rao, and Valencia, which did not specify a formal GMM framework, did not provide methodology for obtaining standard errors, and restricted the analysis to the beta-2 distribution, we provide standard errors for estimated parameters and relevant functions of them, such as inequality and poverty measures, and we provide methodology for all distributions. A test statistic for testing the adequacy of a distribution is proposed. Using eight countries/regions for the year 2005, we show how the methodology can be applied to estimate the parameters of the generalized beta distribution of the second kind (GB2), and its special-case distributions, the beta-2, Singh-Maddala, Dagum, generalized gamma, and lognormal distributions. We test the adequacy of each distribution and compare predicted and actual income shares, where the number of groups used for prediction can differ from the number used in estimation. Estimates and standard errors for inequality and poverty measures are provided.

The main argument is that it is a loss of green energy and an economic loss to curtail generation with near zero marginal costs. However, this view could lead to overinvestment in grid infrastructure and underinvestment in renewable energy sources. This article argues that some curtailment of fluctuating (variable) generation is optimal. We address the possible contributions to total curtailment from involuntary and voluntary curtailment. The costs of curtailment in terms of lost generation are discussed based on market price and support levels including the rationale for compensating generators for losses. The extent of actual curtailment is illustrated by examples from different global markets. In general, both the value of the curtailed energy and the amount of curtailed energy relative to total fluctuating generation is low but rising. Single generators may be affected considerably if insufficient compensation measures are in place. In the future, optimal curtailment will increase along with an increased share of fluctuating renewable generation. Extending renewable generation comparatively cheaply can be achieved by the installation of additional capacity at offshore locations until optimal curtailment levels are reached.

Such an approach can prove useful in providing robustness against a variety of breaks in the deterministic trend function of unknown form and number. In this article, we generalize the unit root testing procedure based on local generalized least squares (GLS) de-trending proposed by Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock (1996) to allow for a Fourier approximation to the unknown deterministic component in the same way. We show that the resulting unit root tests possess good finite sample size and power properties and the test statistics have stable non-standard distributions, despite the curious result that their limiting null distributions exhibit asymptotic rank deficiency.","[Rodrigues, Paulo M.

An important area for New Zealand is domestic hot water which typically accounts for one-third of a household's electricity usage. We use in-depth interviews to examine the decision processes of six householders who were replacing existing hot water systems or building new homes. We also interviewed different trades people and professionals advising those households. Seven themes emerge from the interviews which demonstrate huge inertia to change.

This raises questions, to what extent bioenergy production is able to adapt to changes and overcome critical events. These dynamics have important implications for effective policy development. Using a case study method, which draws on various data sources, we investigate in detail how agricultural bioenergy sectors in the German State of Brandenburg adapted to diverse past events. The case analysis rests on the adaptive-cycle concept and the system properties potential, connectedness and resilience as defined by Holling and Gunderson (2002a). Our case study concludes that Brandenburg's biogas sector has a low potential and connectedness within the system, and a low resilience against crop failures. The biofuels sector displays similar properties in the short term. In the medium term the potential could increase in both sectors. The properties imply risks and opportunities for biogas production and the possibility to develop towards a stage with a higher potential and a higher connectedness. But adaptive capacity is limited and there are certain barriers for the agricultural bioenergy sectors to overcome potentially critical states. Policy needs to be tailored accordingly.

Not only do they need to change their personal behaviour, they also have to accept new low-carbon technologies in order to decarbonise the energy they are using. This study uses an adapted version of the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) model (Stern, 2000) to examine individual-motivational factors in the acceptability of demand-side and supply-side strategies to reduce carbon emissions. The study found that environmental identity, climate change concern, and personal norms are all significantly associated with the acceptability of both demand-side measures and supply-side technologies. While personal values were also important, their associations were mediated by more specific factors. Overall, the adapted VBN model was better able to explain the acceptability of low-carbon behaviours than of low-carbon energy-supply technologies. Concern about energy security appeared to be of limited importance. It was negatively associated with the willingness to engage in low-carbon behaviours, suggesting that a shift in focus towards energy security issues may not necessarily help a transition to a low-carbon society.

These authors offer an alternative four-tiered IBT, the performance of which they show by evaluating its welfare and income distribution effects taking the current uniform tariff as reference. To measure the surplus loss to a representative household in a given block the authors use the trapezoid approach. But, because of the limited data on demand, they calculate the household's response by using a constant point estimate of the own-price elasticity of electricity demand. In this note I show there is an incompatibility between these two modeling assumptions. Combining them is causing an upward bias in the surplus loss, which is of significance given the large price change associated with the IBT. I then offer a correction to this bias.

It currently faces a fundamental decision on a new orientation of its energy strategy. Current electricity generation is based on coal (54.7%) and nuclear energy (32.7%). Nowadays the lifespan of the recoverabe reserves is less than 20 years in case of sub-bituminous coal and less than 2 years in case of uranium. Also the original lifespan of all 4 blocks of the power station Dukovany, one of county's two nuclear power plants, is approaching. These are the main reason why the Czech Republic is forced to revise its future energy strategy as well as its current optimal energy mix. This paper analyses the role of individual energy minerals in the future electricity generation portfolio of the Czech Republic. From the point of the energy security, it seems to be optimal to increase the availability of domestic sub-bituminous coal and continue with the preparation of new nuclear energy blocks and extending the lifespan of existing ones. These actions should be supported by investments to the geological survey of domestic uranium deposits. Impartial evaluation of RES potential and impact of their use on the electricity price is advisable simultaneously. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

While such policies intend to reduce HDV energy consumption and emissions, energy savings that reduce transportation costs may lead to increased demand for HDV transportation services. Increased HDV transportation, in turn, can result in increased energy use and emissions-i.e., a direct rebound effect. This paper provides a critical review of the literature related to the HDV rebound effect. Results of this review demonstrate that the lack of focused studies in this area combined with the variability and heterogeneity of the trucking sector limit general understanding of the HDV rebound effect. Currently, the studies that do exist often create biased or erroneous rebound effect estimates by inappropriately relying on freight elasticities or applying metrics that omit important elements of fuel consumption. Research following a more transparent and coherent approach can improve estimates of the rebound effect from policy measures to improve HDV energy efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper revisits the question of to what extent transport infrastructure endowment proxied by regional motorways has contributed to regional growth in the EU between 1990 and 2004. It analyses infrastructure in relationship to other factors which may condition economic growth, such as innovation, migration, and the local social filter, taking also into account the geographical component of intervention in transport infrastructure and innovation. The results of the two-way fixed-effect (static) and difference GMM (dynamic) panel data regressions indicate that infrastructure endowment is a relatively poor predictor of economic growth and that regional growth in the EU results from a combination of an adequate social filter, good innovation capacity, both in the region and in neighbouring areas, and a region's capacity to attract migrants. The meagre returns of infrastructure endowment on economic growth raise interesting questions about the opportunity costs of further infrastructure investments across most of Western Europe.","[Crescenzi, Riccardo; Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Crescenzi, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.crescenzi@lse.ac.uk; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008; Crescenzi, Riccardo/F-9165-2014","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856; Crescenzi, Riccardo/0000-0003-0465-9796",ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,77,178,184,5,91,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The method does not impose unitary final demand shocks with a fixed (predetermined) sectoral structure, thus allowing the economy to change across the spectrum of all possible final demand variations represented by vectors of modulus 1. It can be very helpful in measuring interindustry linkages and key sectors in a national or regional economy.

At the same time, the sector is regarded as one of the most cost-effective options for saving CO2 emissions. To target this potential, the European Union introduced energy performance certificates (EPC). EPCs should provide clear information about the energy performance of buildings to building purchasers, owners and tenants. This study analyses, in how far EPCs have helped purchasers of owner-occupied dwellings in Germany to incorporate energy efficiency in their purchasing decisions. The results suggest that the effectiveness of EPCs is limited. Main reasons are first, that the certificates are not helpful for understanding the financial implications of energy efficiency. Second, EPCs are not viewed for most buildings due to their legal status. Third, energy efficiency is only a minor purchasing criterion for dwelling purchases. The results of the study however also point to the potential of EPCs, as these barriers can be removed.

J,"Boute, A",,,,"Boute, Anatole",,,Promoting renewable energy through capacity markets: An analysis of the Russian support scheme,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Renewables; Capacity markets; Russia,DEPLOYMENT,"Most existing support schemes aim to stimulate the deployment of renewable energy sources in the electricity sector on the basis of the electricity output (MW h) of renewable energy installations. Support is anchored in the electricity commodity market. In contrast to this established approach, Russia intends to promote renewable energy through the capacity market. The idea is to remunerate investors for the installed capacity (MW) of their installations, in particular for the availability of their installations to produce electricity. This article argues that, contrary to the implicit consensus, a capacity-based approach to supporting renewable energy can provide an alternative to the current output-based schemes. Capacity-based schemes limit the incentive that the operators of renewable energy installations currently have under output-based schemes to deliver electricity to the grid even in periods of low demand. These schemes also provide investors with a more predictable income flow. However, to be successful, the regulation of capacity supply - currently designed for flexible power plants - needs to accommodate the specific production patterns of variable renewable energy installations. This paper examines ways to overcome this challenge in Russia and provides more general conclusions on the complex interaction between capacity markets and renewable energy investments.

The choice of which element one fixes can influence posterior predictions. Thus, we propose restricting the trace of the covariance matrix, which we achieve without computational penalty. This permits a prior that is symmetric to permutations of the nonbase outcome categories. We find in real and simulated consumer choice datasets that the trace-restricted model is less prone to making extreme predictions. Further, the trace restriction can provide stronger identification, yielding marginal posterior distributions that are more easily interpreted.","[Burgette, Lane F.] RAND Corp, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Nordheim, Erik V.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA",RAND Corporation; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Burgette, LF (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",burgette@rand.org; nordheim@stat.wisc.edu,,,,,,,15,18,25,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

In this paper the UK example of Newcastle-upon-Tyne is used to critique current practice, noting that important features of urban energy systems are often omitted by bottom-up tools including interactions between technologies, spatial disaggregation of demand, and the ability to pursue over-arching policy goals like cost minimization. An alternative optimization-based approach is then described and applied to the Newcastle case, at the scale of both the whole city and the South Heaton district, and using Monte Carlo techniques to address policy uncertainty. The results show that this new method can help policy makers draw more robust policy conclusions, sensitive to spatial variations in energy demand and capturing the interactions between developments in the national energy system and local policy options.

Using a stylized case study for three European countries, we illustrate how the selection of conceptual boundaries along these dimensions determines the outcome. This can be avoided by more clearly separating between security of supply and other policy objectives.

Electricity utilities experience significant losses as a result of conflict: severe coal price fluctuations, and uncertainty in the quantity and quality of coal supplies. This paper explores whether establishing cooperative relationships between coal suppliers and electricity utilities can resolve conflicts. We begin with a discussion of the history of coal and electricity pricing reforms, and then conduct a theoretical analysis of relational contracting to provide a new perspective on the drivers behind the establishment of cooperative relationships between the two parties. Finally, we empirically investigate the role of cooperative relationships and the establishment of mine-mouth power plants on the performance of electricity utilities. The results show that relational contracting between electricity utilities and coal suppliers improves the market performance of electricity utilities; meanwhile, the transportation cost savings derived from mine-mouth power plants are of importance in improving the performance of electricity utilities.

Combined heat and power (CHP) reactors can support the EU low-carbon society goals while providing stability in production and cost. High temperature reactor technologies are well suited for the production of high value heat by producing temperatures of 200-550 degrees C. However, little is known about the market potential or economic competitiveness of these reactors in future European cogeneration markets. This study shows that the greatest potential is in chemical/petroleum, paper, metal, and bioenergy markets with small capacities (50-250 MWth). Target market costs for coal-CHP and natural gas-CHP were determined to range from 60-100 (sic)/MWh and 95-208 (sic)/MWh, respectively. Costs for heat-only ranges from 30-60 (sic)/MWh based on gas boilers. Parametric analysis was used to create a cost breakdown (capital, operations and maintenance, fuel, and decommissioning) for an equivalent nuclear CHP that could compete against coal-CHP and natural gas-CHP. Sensitivity analysis showed that reactor capital costs and the costs of capital had the largest influence on competitiveness. In summary, the opportunities for nuclear CHP are highest in natural gas-CHP markets; however the benefits for CO2 reduction were greatest against coal-CHP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, we extend McLaughlin's analysis by comparing housing supply elasticities by dwelling type and also test for the presence of longer supply lags than previously examined in the supply literature. Based on widespread implementation of land-use regulations by Australian federal and state governments over the past 30 years, we hypothesize difference in elasticity between housing types is ambiguous, with supply lags greater for multifamily units. We employ the urban growth model of new housing supply developed by Mayer and Somerville (J Urb Econ 48(1):85-109, 2000a) and Mayer and Somerville (Reg Sci Urb Econ 30(6):639-662, 2000b) and employed in Zabel and Paterson (J Reg Sci 46(1):67-95, 2006) and McLaughlin (Australas J Reg Stud 1(17):60-80, 2011), to estimate the elasticity of new housing supply in Australia's six capital cities-Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, and Hobart-using an unbalanced quarterly panel from 1983-2010. Our findings suggest that the elasticity of new supply is greater for multifamily units than single-family units, while supply response lags for multifamily homes are on the order of 4-8 quarters longer than that of single-family homes. These findings suggest that although Australian land-use policies may be achieving their goal of increasing the supply of smaller, more affordable units, future policies should seek to reduce the extensive supply lags of housing types to help ease short-run price increases.","Univ S Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",University of South Australia,"McLaughlin, RB (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",ralph.mclaughlin@unisa.edu.au,"McLaughlin, Ralph B/G-6844-2011",,,,,,36,14,14,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Some evidence from an empirical study,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gasoline demand; Econometric modelling; Price asymmetry,,"We generally consider that the price elasticity of the energy demand is quite small. But it appears that strong increases in gasoline price lead to modifications in consumer behaviors. The high volatility of petroleum prices and the strong increases since the beginning of 2000 justify an analysis of price effects on gasoline consumption. We estimate the effects of price variations on gasoline consumption, in the United States and India. We use a co-integration modelling to test for long-run relationship between gasoline consumption, income, price and vehicle ownership in the two countries. We use an error correction model to test for short-run prices effects and more precisely for asymmetric effects on demand of increases and decreases in gasoline prices. The main conclusions are the following. Concerning the United States, the long-term price elasticity is relatively high for an industrialised country because gasoline taxes are low, but we show that households are more sensitive to a price increase than a price decrease. About India, price elasticity in the long-run is quite high but is quite small in the short-run. It is not surprising for an emergent country. It seems that there is no asymmetric effect of price variations on gasoline consumption. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper focuses on the Korean oil industry to examine which post-trade liberalization tax reform strategy is optimal, depending on the government's priority between social welfare and government revenue. We find that the important factors for choosing an optimal tax reform policy are price elasticity of demand and market competition. Based on a price-inelastic demand and the low competitive market for Korea's oil industry, if the goal of a tax reform policy is to increase social welfare, the recommended strategy is to raise the consumption tax by a scale of less than the sum of tariff cuts times the crude oil price and oil import tax cuts. This strategy would also reduce inflation, but it could be detrimental to government revenue. However, if the policy's goal is the preservation of government revenue, the recommended strategy is to raise the consumption tax by a scale equal to the sum of tariff cuts times the crude oil price at the pre-tax reform and oil import tax cuts. This strategy does not change either government revenue or social welfare. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These are necessary despite deep mid-term (2025-2030) uncertainties over which national policy makers have little control. We investigate the effect of two critical mid-term uncertainties on optimal near-term investment decisions using a two-stage stochastic energy system model. The results show that where future fossil fuel prices are uncertain: (i) the near term hedging strategy to 2030 differs from any one deterministic fuel price scenario and is structurally dissimilar to a simple 'average' of the deterministic scenarios, and (ii) multiple recourse strategies from 2030 are perturbed by path dependencies caused by hedging investments. Evaluating the uncertainty under a decarbonisation agenda shows that fossil fuel price uncertainty is very expensive at around 20 pound billion. The addition of novel mitigation options reduces the value of fossil fuel price uncertainty to 11 pound billion. Uncertain biomass import availability shows a much lower value of uncertainty at 300 pound million. This paper reveals the complex relationship between the flexibility of the energy system and mitigating the costs of uncertainty due to the path-dependencies caused by the long-life times of both infrastructures and generation technologies.

By a process-based energy analysis, nonrenewable energy cost in the corn-ethanol production process incorporating agricultural crop production, industrial conversion and wastewater treatment is conservatively estimated as 1.70 times that of the ethanol energy produced, corresponding to a negative energy return in contrast to the positive ones previously reported. Nonrenewable energy cost associated with wastewater treatment usually ignored in previous researches is shown important in the energy balance. Denoting the heavy nonrenewability of the produced corn-ethanol, the calculated nonrenewable energy cost would rise to 3.64 folds when part of the nonrenewable energy cost associated with water consumption, transportation and environmental remediation is included. Due to the coal dominated nonrenewable energy structure in China, corn-ethanol processes in China are mostly a conversion of coal to ethanol. Validations and discussions are also presented to reveal policy implications against corn based ethanol as an alternative energy in long term energy security planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Protest related to the polluter pays principle (PPP) is expected to pose an important hurdle to the application of SP research in environmental liability claims, for instance under the European Environmental Liability Directive. Our main objective is to test the effect of PPP induced protest votes on welfare measures for lost passive use value using different treatment procedures. We argue for a more reliable and defensible indicator of willingness to pay (WTP) in environmental liability litigation cases than current standard removal practices in cases where protest votes affect sample representativeness. Analyzing the impact of PPP-based protest response on WTP values with the help of a Full Information Maximum Likelihood sample selection model, a significant correlation is found between the decision to participate in the CV market and the WTP bids. Self-censoring biases average WTP and is correlated with factors such as respondent use of the resource and disposition towards its future protection. Simply removing protest response from the sample is indefensible and results in a biased estimation of WTP. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, the central question of mitigation revolves around the scope of policy to influence or accelerate the diffusion of low-carbon technology. While market forces clearly influence technology deployment, understanding the longer-term and large-scale changes in the energy system requires a broader understanding of the relative influence of institutional, behavioral, and social factors. This paper presents the results of an interview-based, comparative case approach to investigating systematically the relative importance of these non-economic factors influencing technological change across technology and country contexts. We identified two low-carbon energy sectors (bioenergy and nuclear power) that underwent significant changes over the past 50 years in the energy portfolio of three countries: Brazil, Sweden, and the United States. We identified nine categories of factors that might contribute to these large technological transformations, and then evaluated, via interviews with sector participants in each country, which factors were viewed as being determinative or highly influential in the trajectory of that technology in their country context. We also draw out policy implications and directions for future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyses how, in its short life between 2002 and 2008, the Netherlands Institute for Spatial Research (a government think tank) engaged with and impacted upon policy-making. For this analysis, theory of policy-science interfaces and of 'framing' strategies are used. These are applied to the organization as a whole, to the published reports (2004-2007) and to media coverage. On the whole, this 'planbureau' kept a distance from practice and paid little attention to adapting its research practices to the needs or wishes of the policy community, for example in the choice of its research topics. Its framing strategy was, for a large part, to challenge and reject prevalent spatial planning concepts, and to get media coverage for this. Those research and framing strategies help to explain the impact that the planbureau was able to make on the policy processes in Dutch spatial planning.","[Lagendijk, Arnoud; Needham, Barrie] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Sch Management, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Lagendijk, A (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Sch Management, Postbus 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",a.lagendijk@ru.nl; b.needham@fm.ru.nl,,,,,,,28,3,3,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We investigate this issue in the context of the Italian Power Exchange (IPEX), using data on the daily average day-ahead price (PUN) between April 2004 and December 2008. Estimates of baseline time series models (SARMAX and SARMAX-EGARCH) and their forecasting performances suggest that the trend in natural gas prices, market power indicators, deterministic weekly patterns, perceived temperatures, persistence in conditional volatility, and the inverse leverage effect are essential features of the PUN dynamics. We then augment the best-performing models with dummies that account for changes in the market architecture, such as the introduction of contracts for differences (CfDs) to support renewables, trading of white certificates for energy efficiency, and the demand-side liberalization. The findings show that changes in the market architecture affected both the PUN level and its volatility. Specifically, wholesale electricity prices and volatility appear to have decreased upon the introduction of CfDs, only to be pushed upwards following the start of white certificates' trading and retail liberalization. Moreover, after controlling for reforms the inverse leverage effect vanishes, and the persistence in volatility is lower than in the baseline estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose a Usefulness Index is defined, which, for any grid flexibility, leads to a PV-storage combination that allows high grid-penetration without storage being wastefully large. The paper then examines the sensitivity of this appropriate storage size to variations in our assumptions. The specific case of the Israeli electricity grid is employed for numerical discussion, but the formalism should be useful for wider application. In particular, the appropriate storage size deduced in this manner is argued to be a valuable point of departure for optimizations of a more sophisticated nature. Regarding available storage technologies, none is found to have all of the required properties for massive PV-grid penetration, but hybrid combinations should be capable of achieving this end.

The political economy of diversification in resource-rich countries",ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Non-renewable natural resources; Resource curse; Political economy,DEMOCRACY; CURSE; OIL; INSTITUTIONS,"For resource-rich countries, diversification is claimed to represent a strategy for reducing resource curse problems. This, however, depends on whether diversification has a positive effect on the country's institutions. While there is a lot of evidence that exports of oil have a negative impact on institutions, we know much less about the extent to which diversification leads to better institutions. This article applies recent political economy theory to the phenomenon of diversification. Theoretical arguments suggest that it is the pattern of industrial activity rather than diversification per se, which affects institutions like democracy. In other words, not all forms of diversification lead to better institutions. Furthermore, where diversification has a positive impact on institutions, diversification may be difficult to attain when it threatens the power base of the ruling elite. A possible implication of these arguments is that policies for diversification should focus on international regulation affecting elite incentives, rather than domestic industrial policy.

To address such questions in the context of uranium the authors develop a model of long-run cost dynamics which (1) builds on a classic model of declining uranium ore grades, (2) includes both new and existing parameterizations of extraction cost structures, (3) incorporates the extraction cost impacts of learning and productivity growth, and (4) is driven by the IAEA's most recent uranium demand projection. The authors emphasize the importance of allowing interaction between temporal versus cumulative cost mitigating processes (productivity growth and learning respectively) and such processes' interaction with demand growth profiles. It is demonstrated that - under rather conservative assumptions on the dynamics of these processes - the rate of increase of uranium extraction costs is significantly attenuated relative to that which might otherwise occur. Indeed in some cases - again, for rather conservative assumptions on productivity growth and learning - it may not be unreasonable to anticipate that such costs may decline (as have those of several commodities over the past century). The policy implications of such attenuated - or even declining - uranium costs are significant. (C) 2014 International Atomic Energy Agency. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To deal with the complex environment, the wind power industry needs to improve its level of flexibility so that it can become more adaptable to the changing environment. Hence it is important to explore the dynamics of the wind power industry chain flexibility with respect to the ever changing environment. This study uses questionnaire surveys and expert interviews to identify the influential flexibility components of the wind power industry chain. Subsequently a fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) methodology was used to establish a flexibility operating mechanism model. The research found that special attention should be paid to competition flexibility, technology flexibility, and intellectual property and talent flexibility. Policies play a pivotal role in regulating the driving effects of these components of flexibility with the aim being long term sustainability of a healthy level of overall flexibility of the wind power industry chain. This should in turn facilitate the sustainable development of the industry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Cheap Talk (CT) has been found to be an effective remedy in some applications, though empirical results are ambiguous. We discuss reasons why CT may fail to effectively remove specific types of hypothetical bias in Choice Experiments. We suggest augmenting CT in Choice Experiments with a so-called Opt-Out Reminder (OOR). Prior to each choice set, the OOR explicitly instructs respondents to choose the opt-out alternative, if they find the experimentally designed alternatives too expensive. In an empirical survey we find the OUR to significantly reduce total WTP and to some extent also marginal WTP beyond the capability of the CT applied without the OOR. This suggests that the CT practice should be adapted to fit the potentially different decision processes and repeated choices structure of the Choice Experiment format, rather than merely being adopted directly from Contingent Valuation.

Population change and new firm formation in urban and rural regions, Regional Studies. Many regions across the European Union, including regions in the Netherlands, face population decline, entailing changing demographics and related social and economic implications. This paper looks into the connection between population change and structure, and rates of new firm formation. Although it is clear that fewer people will eventually lead to fewer firms, as well as fewer new firms, it is assessed whether this negative relationship differs with the intensity of population change and across regional contexts. In order to establish the impact of population change on new firm formation, this paper examines data on population density, size, growth and decline, together with firm dynamics for the period 2003-09. The results show that the relationship between new firm formation and population change depends heavily on the regional context. The results indicate that new firm formation in urban regions tends to be negatively influenced by population change, while the impact in rural regions remains positive. In conclusion, clear differences are found in the intensity of the impact of population change on new firm formation according to the type of region. The regional context and the intensity of decline must be taken into account when determining the kind of coping mechanism needed to deal with the consequences of decline.","[Delfmann, Heike; Koster, Sierdjan; McCann, Philip; Van Dijk, Jouke] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Econ Geog, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Delfmann, H (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Econ Geog, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands.",h.s.delfmann@rug.nl,"van Dijk, Jouke/J-6558-2019; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","koster, sierdjan/0000-0001-6047-920X; McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654",,,,,65,45,48,4,75,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Based on a dataset of 322 municipalities in Northern Italy, we carried out a statistical analysis to investigate which factors influence the adoption of energy efficiency in municipal buildings. In particular, the analysis focuses on four categories of factors: (i) capacity building for energy efficiency, (ii) existing structure and competences for energy efficiency, (iii) technical and economic support for energy efficiency, and (iv) spill-over effect caused by adoption of easier energy-efficient measures. Our results show that capacity building through training courses and technical support provided by energy audits affect positively the adoption of energy efficiency in municipal buildings. The size of the municipal authority, the setting of local energy policies for residential buildings and funding for energy audits are not correlated with energy efficiency in public buildings, where the plucking of low hanging fruit often prevails over more cost-effective but long-term strategies. Finally, our results call for the need to promote an efficient knowledge management and a revision of the Stability and Growth Pact. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, integrating wind into the electricity grid is not without cost. Wind power output is highly variable and average capacity factors from wind farms are often much lower than conventional generators. Further, the best wind resources with highest capacity factors are often located far away from load centers and accessing them therefore requires transmission investments. Energy storage capacity could be an alternative to some of the required transmission investment, thereby reducing capital costs for accessing remote wind farms. This work focuses on the trade-offs between energy storage and transmission. In a case study of a 200 MW wind farm in North Dakota to deliver power to Illinois, we estimate the size of transmission and energy storage capacity that yields the lowest average cost of generating and delivering electricity ($/MW h) from this farm. We find that transmission costs must be at least $600/MW-km and energy storage must cost at most $100/kW h in order for this application of energy storage to be economical. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy efficiency (EE) will play an increasingly important role in future generations. The aim of this work is to estimate how much the PNEf (National Plan for Energy Efficiency) launched by the Brazilian government in 2011 will save over the next 5 years by avoiding the construction of additional power plants, as well as the amount of the CO2 emission. The marginal operating cost is computed for medium term planning of the dispatching of power plants in the hydro-thermal system using Stochastic Dynamic Dual Programming, after incorporating stochastic energy efficiencies into the demand for electricity. We demonstrate that even for a modest improvement in energy efficiency (< 1% per year), the savings over the next 5 years range from R$ 237 million in the conservative scenario to R$ 268 million(1) in the optimistic scenario. By comparison the new Belo Monte hydro-electric plant will cost R$ 26 billion to be repaid over a 30 year period (i.e. R$ 867 million in 5 years).

Modeling multivariate volatility, however, encounters several difficulties, including the curse of dimensionality. Dimension reduction can be useful and is often necessary. The goal of this article is to extend the idea of principal component analysis to principal volatility component (PVC) analysis. We define a cumulative generalized kurtosis matrix to summarize the volatility dependence of multivariate time series. Spectral analysis of this generalized kurtosis matrix is used to define PVCs. We consider a sample estimate of the generalized kurtosis matrix and propose test statistics for detecting linear combinations that do not have conditional heteroscedasticity. For application, we applied the proposed analysis to weekly log returns of seven exchange rates against U.S. dollar from 2000 to 2011 and found a linear combination among the exchange rates that has no conditional heteroscedasticity.","[Hu, Yu-Pin] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Int Business Studies, Puli, Nantou, Taiwan; [Tsay, Ruey S.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",National Chi Nan University; University of Chicago,"Hu, YP (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Int Business Studies, Puli, Nantou, Taiwan.",huyp@ncnu.edu.tw; ruey.tsay@chicagobooth.edu,,,"National Science Council, Taiwan [NSC-101-2118-M-260-001]; Booth School of Business, University of Chicago","National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Booth School of Business, University of Chicago(University of Chicago)","The research of Y.

Nontraditional cookstoves aim to solve problems associated with biomass fuel usage in developing countries. Recent studies do not explain what drives user's cookstove choice. This study therefore builds a holistic framework that centralizes product-specific preferences or needs. The case study identifies product-specific factors that influence rural Senegalese inhabitants to switch to solar cooking, using best worst scaling. Looking at the preferences, the case study classified 126 respondents, in three distinct market segments with different solar cooking expectations. The paper identifies socio-demographic characteristics that explain these differences in the respondents' preferences. Finally, the respondent sample is divided in two groups: solar cooker owners and non-owners. When studied with regard to the same issue, solar cooker owners appear to value benefits of the solar cooker lower than non-owners. This is due to program factors (such as formations, after-sales network) and miscommunication (such as a wrong image of the solar cooker) that highly influenced the respondents' cookstove choice. As a conclusion, solar cookers and solar cooking programs are not always adapted to the needs and requirements of the end-users. Needs-oriented and end-user adopted strategies are necessary in order to successfully implement nontraditional cookstoves programs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

By assumption, a large store is certain to have the particular product a consumer wants, whereas a small store has it with probability w. Large and small stores alternate with each other on a circular roadway. Consumers must search by visiting stores. In the Nash price equilibrium, large stores charge higher prices than small stores.

Price risk is considered the principal deficiency of this market-based policy since it causes investors to require higher returns. Moreover, investors are exposed to regulatory risk; namely, the risk that a change in the regulation will materially impact the certificate price. Regulatory uncertainty is reflected in market volatility exacerbating certificate price risk. Using an econometric approach, we investigate the role of regulatory changes on price volatility in the Swedish certificate market. The results of our analysis indicate that regulatory changes strongly affect certificate markets, resulting in periods of higher volatility. Moreover, we analyze whether certificate price volatility has changed after creating a joint Swedish/Norwegian market. Results indicate that the ambivalence surrounding the creation of this bigger market led to a period of increased price volatility between 2010 and 2011. Overall, this article brings a better understanding of the role of regulatory uncertainty on certificate markets, and gives evidence for its negative impact in terms of increased price volatility.

In addition, the country's low-carbon development strategy, government-controlled gas price, and some other factors also contribute to the surging gas consumption. This paper studies China's natural gas consumption in residential, industrial and commercial sectors. We adopt the cointegration test and error correction model to study the relationships of explanatory factors and gas consumption of different sectors and climate factor is included into the analysis. In order to find the direction of natural gas pricing reform and establish the benchmark gas price, this paper also estimates the size of gas price subsidy by using price-gap approach. Our findings are as follows: In the long term, China's residential sector is more sensitive to price than the other two. Urbanization is an important factor promoting industrial and commercial gas consumption. Prices of other energies have an influence on natural gas consumption significantly due to the substitutability between energies. The slow-moving and unsatisfying pricing reforms on refined oil and natural gas lead to positive price elasticity of natural gas in the commercial sector, which implies that a further energy price reform is still stringent for China.

A major obstacle to examining social implications of declining EROI is that we do not have adequate empirical understanding of how EROI is linked, directly or indirectly, to an average citizen's ability to achieve wellbeing. To evaluate the possible linkages between societal well-being and net energy availability, we compare these preliminary estimates of energy availability: (1) EROI at a societal level, (2) energy use per capita, (3) multiple regression analyses and (4) a new composite energy index (Lambert Energy Index), to select indicators of quality of life (HDI, percent children under weight, health expenditures, Gender Inequality Index, literacy rate and access to improved water). Our results suggest that energy indices are highly correlated with a higher standard of living. We also find a saturation point at which increases in per capita energy availability (greater than 150 GJ) or EROI (above 20:1) are not associated with further improvement to society.

We compare some of the obtained indices with the decisions of a Committee of five professors concerning a group of Physicists which applied for the Italian National Scientific Qualification (the so called Abilitazione Scientifica Nazionale, the new process to recruit University Professors in Italy, based on scientific qualification criteria). Many well known indices, such as the A-index or the e-index, are sensitive to few highly cited publications. Conversely, our approach, based on a sum of increasing and concave functions, is aimed to reward researchers with a more stable and reliable scientific production.

Most models and scenarios assume that future trends in global GDP will be similar to the growth experienced in the past century, which would imply multiplying current output by about 19 times in the 21st century. However, natural resource and environmental constraints suggest that future global economic growth may not be so high. Furthermore, the environmental implications of such growth depend on how it is distributed across countries. This paper studies the implications on GHG abatement policies of low global GDP growth and high convergence levels in GDP per capita across countries. A partial equilibrium model (POLES) of the world's energy system is used to provide detailed projections up to 2050 for the different regions of the world. The results suggest that while low stabilisation could be technically feasible and economically viable for the world in all the scenarios considered, it is more likely to occur with more modest global growth. However, that will imply higher global abatement costs relative to GDP. Convergence in living standards on the other hand places greater pressures in terms of the required reduction in emissions. In general we find that there are major differences between regions in terms of the size and the timing of abatement costs and economic impact. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

They tend not to be comfortable with any suggestion that there might be insurmountable limits and insoluble problems, or that the problems they are working on require social solutions rather than technical solutions. Various contributions to this Special Edition provide illustrations. This paper explores some challenges to the dominant Promethian world view. These include a consideration of the magnitude of the energy and other problems, the possibility that renewable energy cannot solve them, the significance of energy and of declining EROI for economic growth, and the possible effects of rising resource input costs and unstable capital markets for energy investment. Finally the ultimate heresy is considered, the possibility that access to abundant energy would not be good for us. In summary, it is suggested that coercive limits to growth are being encountered and that the resulting problems cannot be solved by action on the supply side but will require a radical rethinking of social goals, systems and values.

Our hypothesis in this paper is that the lack of evidence supporting theoretically expected behavior about the role of agglomerations is mainly explained by the fact that administrative rather analytical regions have been used. To check this, we propose a study based on spatially disaggregated data from the Population Census and its aggregation into analytical regions that incorporate ideas from the new economic geography. Our results regarding the effect of space on employment opportunities with this alternative classification suggest, as expected, that living in large cities or close to metropolitan areas increases the possibilities of being employed. The different results support the need for more highly disaggregated data at spatial level in order to overcome the limitations inherent to empirical analysis based on administrative regions.","[Vinuela, Ana; Rubiera-Morollon, Fernando; Fernandez-Vazquez, Esteban] Univ Oviedo, Reg Econ Lab, REGIOlab, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Rubiera-Morollón, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Reg Econ Lab, REGIOlab, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",avinuela@uniovi.es; frubiera@uniovi.es; evazquez@uniovi.es,"Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/L-8372-2019","Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/0000-0001-9192-8901; Vinuela, Ana/0000-0002-6017-9124; Rubiera Morollon, Fernando/0000-0002-4854-0802",,,,,33,9,9,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Proposed paper analyses, models and optimizes main clinical and administrative processes in ED in order to orchestrate their mutual interactions and suggest feasible performance improvements in terms of average length of stay, average waiting time, utilization of resources and total costs. Consequently, we propose several scenarios, demonstrating gradual parametric optimization of the initial overestimated and costly configuration. After its exemplary extension with the Theory of Constraints, Lean and Six Sigma principles we achieved comparable performance with considerably less resources.

Thus, at the time of the global financial crisis the Slovak koruna was pegged and the others had their currencies floating. Against a backdrop of this difference a set of interesting questions arises: What was the nature of shocks that hit Poland and Slovakia during the crisis? What were the sources of real exchange rate movements? Were real exchange rates acting as a shock absorber or rather a shock-propagating mechanism? Does the ERM II insulate against financial shocks? These questions are addressed by examining the real exchange rates, output, real interest rates and prices in Poland and Slovakia. For both countries we build a set of Bayesian structural VAR models, that allows us to identify supply, demand, monetary and financial shocks.

However, this repeatedly causes electricity shortages in the peak summer and winter seasons because of over-consumption. Forcing a decline in the demand for electricity by raising power rates would thus help prevent a national blackout, lowering dependence on foreign energy and reducing CO2 emissions cost-effectively. This paper simulates the effects of a rise in power rate on demand for electricity and output price by estimating a restricted cost function, in which the quantity of raw materials is set to its cost-minimizing level, jointly with an inverse supply relation for the top three electricity-intensive manufacturing sectors. The empirical results indicate that a 10% increase in electricity rate would result in 8.0-10.1% less demand across all three manufacturing sectors, ceteris paribus. The impact on output price is of little statistical significance in the basic metals sector, while output price on average falls by 0.16% in the TV and communication equipment sector.

Because local governments may neglect the effects of their policies on the rest of the region, the resulting population size can be inefficient. We show that local adoption of housing regulations tends to over-restrict population growth when there are strong agglomeration economies in the regional production.

This paper examines three case studies in which voluntary activities have played a successful role in mitigating climate change. Based on interviews with business organisations together with a literature review and data analysis, we show why businesses are motivated to take socially responsible actions and describe the major benefits of such activities. One of the important benefits of voluntary activities is their flexibility in phasing measures. This flexibility is greatly appreciated, since industries are able to retain control of their responses to future uncertainties, which allows them to tackle climate change issues aggressively. We conclude that voluntary activities have been more environmentally effective than alternative policy measures under a proper institutional framework, which consists of effective motivation mechanisms for businesses, governmental measures to encourage their compliance, and capable industrial associations that can lessen the transaction costs both of the government and of industry.

This paper elaborates an empirical analysis of the returns to education of a cohort entering the labour force between 1995 and 2005; the objective is to capture the extent of spatial and occupational determinants on income distribution as Finland slid from its most troubled to its most prosperous times.","[Consoli, Davide] Univ Politecn Valencia, INGENIO CSIC UPV, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Consoli, Davide] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res MIoIR, Manchester M13 5QH, Lancs, England; [Vona, Francesco] Observ Francais Conjonctures Econ, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Vona, Francesco] SKEMA Business Sch, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Saarivirta, Toni] Univ Tampere, Res Unit Urban & Reg Dev Studies Sente, FIN-33014 Tampere, Finland",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; CSIC-UPV - Instituto de Gestion de la Innovacion y del Conocimiento (INGENIO); University of Manchester; SKEMA Business School; Tampere University,"Consoli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, INGENIO CSIC UPV, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",davide.consoli@ingenio.upv.es; francesco.vona@sciences-po.fr; toni.saarivirta@uta.fi,"Consoli, Davide/Q-7183-2019; Vona, Francesco/ABE-8328-2020; Consoli, Davide/H-3313-2011","Consoli, Davide/0000-0002-7829-2838; Vona, Francesco/0000-0002-2112-5537;",,,,,69,6,6,1,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Those interruptions are the result of perturbations sustained by the power network. A normalised direct worth (NDW) approach was used as a direct method for assessment, while the compensatory estimation method (CEM) was used for indirect assessment. A survey was conducted with a representative sample of industries in Cameroon using a questionnaire as the main research instrument. The results show that power interruption losses are very significant. Using the direct method for assessment, the average outage cost varies from (sic)3.62/kWh to (sic)5.42/kWh for a 1-h interruption and from 1.96/kWh to (sic)2.46/kWh for a 4-h outage. The study finds that advance suspension notices could help in reducing outage costs by 19.83-33%. With the indirect method, the total capital costs and total running costs of generators are approximately (sic)180,040,180.08 and (sic)4,305,510.6, respectively, while the average cost per unused kWh of electricity stands at (sic)3.37/kWh.

Before the Fukushima accident that followed the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011, both Britain and Japan were considering an ambitious expansion of nuclear power as part of their strategy to reduce carbon emissions. However, the accident may have thrown nuclear power as a publicly accep' energy technology into doubt. This study uses several nationally representative surveys from before and after the Fukushima accident to examine how it may have changed public perceptions of climate change and energy futures in Britain and Japan. The study found that already before the accident the Japanese public were less supportive of nuclear power than the British. While British attitudes have remained remarkably stable over time, the Japanese public appear to have completely lost trust in nuclear safety and regulation, and have become less acceptive of nuclear power even if it would contribute to climate change mitigation or energy security. In Japan the public are now less likely to think that any specific energy source will contribute to a reliable and secure supply of energy. The implications for energy policy are discussed.

However, their heterogeneity within countries and between countries indicate that one must be very cautious in drawing general conclusions about the positive and negative local economic effects of nuclear power stations over time. Using information about a specific nuclear facility in Spain and its zone of influence, we investigate the local economic impact of a nuclear facility by applying an infrequently used methodology called the counterfactual method. The purpose of this application of the counterfactual method is to establish what would have happened if the nuclear power plant had not been built where it was. This method permits observation of the impact of the nuclear power plant on the evolution of a set of variables whose influence is extremely important for the local area, such as the population, unemployment level, per capita income, and municipal governments' revenues. Generalization of this method could offer the possibility of providing comparative results. However, the method must be complemented with other short-term approaches to provide a more specific analysis of the economic effects on the local actors involved and to offer incentives to policymakers to design and develop policies aimed at boosting economic activity in the area.

Nonetheless, it is not yet commercially viable on a large scale, and its inclusion into countries' energy planning agendas depends on realistic assessments of its emission reduction benefits. The use of CCS leads to energy penalties resulting from direct consumption of additional energy, and results in indirect CO2 equivalent emissions outside plant boundaries, due to both energy consumption and leakages. Accounting for these emissions allows for an evaluation of the mitigation benefits of CCS. This study performs a life-cycle assessment (LCA), with and without CCS, for a coal-fired power plant located in Brazil. Findings show that when indirect emissions are taken into account, a plant which captures 90% of its CO2 will have its CO2 equivalent emissions capture potential, based on a global warming potential metric with a 100-year time horizon, reduced to 72%. The advantage of the use of carbon capture towards climate change mitigation is reduced mainly as a result of an increase in CH4 emissions, significant in the coal-mining stage, an effect which is only taken into account when a LCA is performed.

This paper quantitatively analyzes embodied carbon emissions along the life cycle of electricity supply, based on network theory. A modified carbon emission flow model is established, based on life cycle assessment considering power losses. There is also a case study of China's interregional electricity supply system in 2010, focusing on two carbon emission carriers, electricity coal transportation and electricity transmission. Results show that the total carbon emission flow reached 169.355 MtCO(2)eq, i.e., 4.67% of the life cycle carbon emission. Of this, 61.1% was carried by electricity coal transportation before power generation and transmission, owing to an uneven distribution of coal resources. The eastern and southern regions are the major net sinks of carbon emission flows, representing 52.9%. and 27.8% of the total, respectively, because of their enormous energy imports. In contrast, the Sanxi region and central China are major. net sources of carbon emission flow. The proposed model may help allocate environmental responsibility among different regions, to guarantee balanced trans-regional development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Odum, building upon his seminal work outlining the energy basis for man and nature, the method is still developing. Some very important aspects of the method, such as the global baseline for renewable emergy and how the emergy yield ratio (EYR), a critical index for implicating the contribution of a process to society, is to be calculated are still under debate in the scientific community. This makes it all the more critical that when an emergy analysis is done all methodology is laid bare and justified. Unfortunately, Zhang et al. (2012. Energy Policy 42, pp 232-238) is deficient in doing so. In the response below I lay out the problems I observed in the paper and propose a revision to their analysis. I should note that no issues were found with the embodied energy portion of the analysis and the inconsistencies with accepted methodology were likely due to an unfamiliarity with the emergy method.

Europe has taken the leadership in the carbon emission policy by introducing the Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), formerly regulated by Directive 2003/87/EC and since 2013 by Directive 2009/29/EC. This new Directive imposes a full auctioning system for allocating CO2 allowances to the power sector and encourages the use of renewable energy sources. We investigate the economic impacts of the EU ETS on the Italian electricity market using a power generation expansion model. We adopt a technological representation of the energy market that also accounts for power exchanges with foreign countries and we assume that generators operate in different zones connected by interconnections with limited capacity. We study both an oligopolistic and a perfectly competitive behavior of Italian generators and we compare the corresponding outcomes under different EU ETS scenarios. Our analysis shows that, in perfect competition, generators generally invest more than in an oligopolistic framework, but in both market configurations, investments in Italy are mainly concentrated in fossil-fired plants, especially in 2020. This happens also when incentives are given to renewables. The developed models are implemented as complementarity problems and solved in GAMS using the PATH solver. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Results show the SMEs in the low income economies to be characterized by a lower entrepreneurial quality.","[Fernandez-Serrano, Jose; Romero, Isidoro] Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ & Business Sci, E-41018 Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Fernández-Serrano, J (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Av Ramon & Cajal 1, E-41018 Seville, Spain.",jfserrano@us.es; isidoro@us.es,"Fernández-Serrano, José/F-2096-2016; Romero, Isidoro/E-8160-2010","Fernández-Serrano, José/0000-0003-4882-2399; Romero, Isidoro/0000-0001-8764-2599",,,,,49,31,36,3,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

This paper introduces human capital, innovation and several types of entrepreneurship as potential drivers of regional economic performance with an impact of agglomeration economies. We use measures of specific types of entrepreneurship, discerned at the individual level, as well as human capital and invention through patenting activity for the period 2001-2006. The empirical application on 111 regions across 14 European countries investigates their relation with observed regional productivity rates in 2006. Our main findings indicate that (i) human capital, patenting activity and entrepreneurship are all linked to regional performance, more so in regions containing large as well as medium-sized cities; (ii) they act as complements rather than substitutes, facilitating productivity differently; and (iii) accounting for patenting activity and entrepreneurship captures agglomeration externalities effects previously subscribed only to the density of resources of regional performance. The particular role of regions with medium-sized cities next to regions with large cities complies with observed growth trends as well as recently proposed place-based development approaches that assume that interactions between institutions and geography are critical for regional economic performance.","[van Oort, Frank G.] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bosma, Niels S.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Utrecht University,"van Oort, FG (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",f.g.vanoort@uu.nl,"Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020; Bosma, Niels/B-8187-2008","Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X; Bosma, Niels/0000-0003-1977-7680",,,,,81,26,31,1,96,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Employment impact is an essential indicator of SD. Based on an input-out approach this research builds a quantitative assessment model to evaluate the employment impacts of CDM. Both direct and indirect jobs creation and job losses of CDM projects in the power sector registered by the end of 2011 are calculated by project types and power grids where the project is located. Results of this study show that, although the above mentioned CDM projects causes about 99,000 net direct job losses, they also create about 3.08 million indirect jobs, resulting in the gross employment of CDM to be about 2.98 million. Thereof, hydro projects induce both direct and indirect job losses, which comes to approximately 0.89 million.

A higher bank density is connected to more competition and lower mark-ups, and indicates more efficient banking markets as well. As efficiency is the main determinant of bank profits and competition seems to be (mildly) indicative of stronger regional growth, the preservation of a fair regional bank outreach appears to be an important policy target.","Univ Linz, Dept Finance, A-4040 Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Burgstaller, J (通讯作者)，Univ Linz, Dept Finance, Freistadterstr 315, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",Johann.Burgstaller@jku.at,"Burgstaller, Johann/S-4449-2017","Burgstaller, Johann/0000-0002-8753-9468",,,,,120,13,14,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Several meta-analyses and model comparisons have previously been performed that aim to identify the causes for the wide range of MAC curves. Most of these concentrate on general equilibrium models with a focus on aspects such as specific model type and technology learning, while other important aspects remain almost unconsidered, including the availability of abatement technologies and level of discount rates. This paper addresses the influence of several key parameters on MAC curves for the United Kingdom and the year 2030. A technology-rich energy system model, UK MARKAL, is used to derive the MAC curves. The results of this study show that MAC curves are robust even to extreme fossil fuel price changes, while uncertainty around the choice of the discount rate, the availability of key abatement technologies and the demand level were singled out as the most important influencing factors. By using a different model type and studying a wider range of influencing factors, this paper contributes to the debate on the sensitivity of MAC curves. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a case study of using high resolution grid map of solar radiation combined with the other restriction factors to evaluate the comprehensive potential analysis of solar PV generation at the regional scale, in order to present a framework of decision support tool for solar energy management in a regional, area. The cost of PV generation is calculated based on the geographical distribution of technical potential. Moreover, geospatial supply curve (GSC) is employed to portray the evolution of available potential of photovoltaics (PV) generation with the increase of the generation cost. By integrating the economic evaluation variables of net present value and simple payback period, grid-based economic feasibility of PV generation project is then carried out under two feed-in-tariff scenarios. Finally, total CO2 reduction potential and its spatial distribution in the study area are calculated. The results confirm that PV technology provides high potential for roof-top application and large-scale PV stations. Additionally, determining a reasonable feed-in tariff is essential for expanding the application of solar PV energy. The findings improve understanding of regional renewable energy strategies and the supply/demand assessment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Do new gambling products displace old? Evidence from a postcode analysis. Regional Studies. This paper examines the extent to which new gambling products displace traditional products. In particular, it tests whether the introduction of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) affected the number of traditional gambling machines in Great Britain. It uses data from geographical districts based on postcodes within Great Britain between 2001 and 2006. Using a propensity score-matching approach, no significant evidence is found that FOBTs caused a reduction in the number of machines in venues other than licensed betting offices.","[Paton, David] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Williams, Leighton Vaughan] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England",University of Nottingham; Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham,"Paton, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",David.Paton@Nottingham.ac.uk; Leighton.Vaughan-Williams@ntu.ac.uk,"Paton, David/E-7286-2011","Paton, David/0000-0002-7486-9353",,,,,27,4,5,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

We find that pollution tax incentive policies, regardless of the level of incentives or the size of increases in incentives, can impel the firm to purchase anti-pollution equipment. However, increases in the size of incentives cause the firm to relocate back to city centers. The size of incentive increase thus has an uncertain impact on location choice, suggesting that increases may also produce the opposite of the intended effect by pulling plants back to city centers. This confirmed the argument of Oates and Baumol (Economic analysis of environmental problems, Columbia University Press, New York, 1975, p. 104) that taxes on polluting activities may fail to do their job with full effectiveness. In addition, we have also found that increased uncertainty over pollution tax policies tends to increase purchases of anti-pollution equipment for a risk-averse firm. This impact is unrelated to the investment flexibility of anti-pollution equipment. These results are different from those of Carlsson regarding risk-neutral firms. In addition, the findings of this study that increases in pollution taxes tend to cause a firm to purchase additional anti-pollution equipment and leave city centers differ from those of Hwang and Mai in the latter result.","[Yang, Biing-Shiunn] Tamkang Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan; [Mai, Chao-Cheng] Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan; [Mai, Chao-Cheng] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Tamkang University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Mai, CC (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, 128,Sec 2,Acad Rd, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",bsyang@mail.tku.edu.tw; ccmai@gate.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,30,4,4,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Building on a detailed discourse analysis of 97 textual units produced by EU leaders and institutions and 104 documents and speeches by Russian policy-makers, the paper argues that these three discourses differ widely in their assessment of the two partners' mutual ties, both in terms of the relationship's symmetry and the perceived benefits for each partner. The paper comes up with two basic arguments. First, in spite of the shared usage of the three basic notions by both sides, the interpretations of each of the discourses are widely different in the EU and in Russia, which causes continuous frictions and misunderstandings. Second and surprisingly, the discourse of integration is dominant both in the EU and Russia, which shows that the claims about the alleged securitization of EU-Russian energy relations are clearly exaggerated.

We focus on modeling the adoption probability of photo-voltaic solar panels by households. Using data from Ontario, Canada where a generous feed-in-tariff is available to households generating electricity from solar panels, we measure household level preferences for panels and use these preferences along with household characteristics to predict adoption time intentions. We use discrete choice experiments to measure' household level preferences and establish a causal link between the attributes of the technology and adoption time intentions using discrete time survival mixture analysis. Significant preferences included lower cost, greater energy savings and lower fossil fuel inflation. The conditional (hazard) probability of adoption at a particular time given no previous adoption showed that the attribute preferences had intuitively reasonable effects. The hazard probabilities allow us to compute the cumulative probability of adoption over a 10-year period per household. Technology awareness has a significant effect on the adoption probability, reinforcing the need for effective education. Our approach indicates the level of heterogeneity in preferences, particularly high for investment criteria and CO2 emissions. These findings suggest that education campaigns should explain more about investment criteria, feed-in tariffs and environmental effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the prevalence of these strategies in existing U.S. homes is not well understood. To help address this issue, this research evaluated a nationally-representative sample of 1000 existing homes distributed geographically across the US. Using satellite images, each building was evaluated for three passive design strategies: orientation, roof color, and level of shading. Several statistically significant regional trends were identified. For example, existing homes in the High Plains, Ohio Valley, Northwest, and Southern regions show a statistically significant trend towards orientation in the East-West direction, an effective passive design strategy. Less intuitively, in terms of what would seem to be optimal passive design, buildings in the High Plains and Ohio Valley generally have lighter roof colors than buildings in the warmer Southwest region. At the national level, no statistically significant trends were found towards the passive design strategies evaluated. These trends give us no reason to believe they were a major consideration in the design of existing homes. Policy measures and education may be required to take advantage of the opportunity for cost-effective energy savings through more widespread passive solar design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores the extent to which economically viable thermal renovations can contribute to the 80% goal, based on an analysis of Germany's experience. It finds that the theoretical savings being achieved, based on calculated pre- and post-renovation consumption, are around 33%, while actual savings, based on measured consumption, are likely to be around 25%. The difference appears to be due to the effects of household behaviour. Further, average measured consumption is estimated to be around 150-180 kWh/m(2)a nationally, and this would have to be reduced to 30-35 kWh/m(2)a to meet the 80% policy goal. This is beyond the limits of economically viable renovation technology, which currently achieves around 100 kWh/m(2)a. The paper suggests that policymakers should de-couple the criterion of economic viability from the 80% goal, emphasise other reasons for renovating to economically viable levels, and consider a more systematic approach to facilitate household behaviour change.

This study uses the bottom-up LBNL China End-Use Energy Model to assess the role of energy efficiency policies in transitioning China to a lower emission trajectory and meeting its 2020 intensity reduction goals. Two scenarios - Continued Improvement and Accelerated Improvement - were developed to assess the impact of actions already taken by the Chinese government as well as planned and potential actions, and to evaluate the potential for China to reduce energy demand and emissions. This scenario analysis presents an important modeling approach based in the diffusion of end-use technologies and physical drivers of energy demand and thereby help illuminate China's complex and dynamic drivers of energy consumption and implications of energy efficiency policies. The findings suggest that China's CO2 emissions will not likely continue growing throughout this century because of saturation effects in appliances, residential and commercial floor area, roadways, fertilizer use; and population peak around 2030 with slowing urban population growth. The scenarios also underscore the significant role that policy-driven efficiency improvements will play in meeting 2020 carbon mitigation goals along with a decarbonized power supply.

We discuss data sources and collection strategies for the different attributes of the model, especially for those characteristics that are nonstandard such as symbolic values.

It finds that each type of charging infrastructure has its limitation, and integration is needed to offer a reliable charging service. It also reveals that the service radius of fast charging stations directly influences the final distribution pattern and an infrastructure deployment strategy with short service radius for fast charging stations has relatively fewer disturbances on the power grid. Additionally, although the adoption of electric vehicles will cause an additional electrical load on the Beijing's power grid, this additional load can be accommodated by the current grid's capacity via the charging time management and the battery swap strategy.

During this period, no absolute convergence process of incomes occurs in the IOZ. Nevertheless, a bipolar situation emerges, such that countries with the weakest relative incomes in relation to the IOZ average remain in the same relative position-that is, the poorest countries remain poor. The relatively richest countries (i.e., Australia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Singapore, and Thailand) constitute a convergence club. Use of conditioned distributions shows that the dynamics of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) distributions can be explained both by the openness rate measured as trade/GDP ratio, or a proxy for trade policy, and by manufactured goods exports. However, this result likely confirms that the openness was accompanied by an increase in manufactured goods trade for many of these countries. In addition, openness defined following Sachs and Warner has a less explanatory power than traditional measure. Finally, bilateral trade and trade agreements have limited effects.","[Peron, Olivier; Rey, Serge] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Dept Econ, CATT, F-64016 Pau, France",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,"Rey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Dept Econ, CATT, Ave Doyen Poplawski,BP 1633, F-64016 Pau, France.",Olivier.peron@univ-pau.fr; Serge.rey@univ-pau.fr,"REY, Serge/R-2052-2019","REY, Serge/0000-0002-7967-9188",,,,,68,10,12,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Behavioural economics (BE) suggests the adoption of efficient appliances could be accelerated further by: (i) monetising efficiency, (ii) directly communicating the link between efficiency and carbon emissions, (iii) communicating the long-term (e.g., operational life) financial and environmental impact of product choices, and, (iv) framing the information as avoided losses ('extra') rather than gains ('savings'). This study tested these hypotheses via an online, stated preference survey of 465 UK residents using actual market pricing and efficiency data for washing machines. The provision of information about either running costs or running emissions did encourage selection of more expensive and efficient products (strongly correlated variables in the choice set and actual market) (p<.001, r=.30-.41) with no statistically significant difference between their impact. Providing lifetime running cost information also nudged respondents towards more expensive, efficient products than annual information (p=.006-.027, r=.15-.18). Finally, loss-framed running emissions information encouraged selection of more expensive, efficient products than gain-framed information (p<.05, r=.13-.16). The EU label is an impracticable means of communication, but digital communication channels (e.g., price comparison websites) may offer potential for inexpensive localisation and personalisation of the information. The results suggest that successful communication could benefit the private sector whilst making a contribution to reducing carbon emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The UK faces a major challenge to improve the thermal performance of its existing housing stock. Millions of dwellings possess 'hard-to-treat' solid walls and have glazing which is not cost effective to improve. A range of fabric efficiency incentive schemes exist, but many do not target the full range of private and social housing. From now on, the Green Deal will be the UK's key energy efficiency policy. However, the scheme is forecasted to have low consumer appeal and low incentives for investors. Moreover, calculated Green Deal loan repayments will be reliant upon estimated energy savings, yet it is claimed that retrofit measures may only be half as effective as anticipated due to a lack of monitoring, poor quality installation and the increased use of heating following refurbishment. Looking to Germany, there has been success through the Passivhaus standard, but the UK currently lacks appropriate skills and cost effective components to replicate this approach.

We study one such state, Pennsylvania, within the context of RIM, a regional electricity market covering numerous different states. Our focus is on the distributive impacts of this policy-specifically how the policy is likely to impact electricity prices in different areas of Pennsylvania and in the PJM market more generally. Such spatial differences in policy impacts are difficult to model and the transmission system is often ignored in policy studies. Our model estimates supply curves on a zonal basis within regional electricity markets and yields information on price and fuel utilization within each zone. We use the zonal supply curves estimated by our model to study regional impacts of energy-efficiency legislation on utilities both inside and outside of Pennsylvania. For most utilities in Pennsylvania, it would reduce the influence of natural gas on electricity price formation and increase the influence of coal. It would also save 2.1 to 2.8 percent of total energy cost in Pennsylvania in a year similar to 2009. The savings are lower than 0.5 percent in other PJM states and the prices may slightly increase in Washington, DC area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The maritime transportation sector must bear its share of responsibility for adopting corrective innovative measures on a global scale. The authors projected the energy consumption and emissions of different marine transportation types in 2050 and applied the model of stabilization wedges to explore activities and technologies to deduce policies that would lead to sustainable marine propulsion. Three percent of the global emissions reductions -about 44 GtCO(2)/y- required to stabilize the temperature under 2 degrees C above current levels must come from the maritime sector. To meet a reduction target of this segment, about 1.67 GtCO(2)/y in 2050, we propose a range of technologies that include mission refinement, resistance reduction, prime mover and propulsion innovation, and new fuels. The authors find that the goal is partially attainable and proposes the balance to be delivered by dedicated land-based synfuel refineries that use carbon dioxide from coal power plants and hydrogen produced from sustainable sources, an approach that would extend the lifecycle of conventional prime movers.

The evaluation of alternative fuel modes is performed according to cost and policy aspects. In order to evaluate each alternative fuel, one base scenario and ten alternative scenarios with different weight factors selection per criterion are presented. After deciding the alternative fuels' scoring against each criterion and the criteria weights, their synthesis gives the overall score and ranking for all ten alternative scenarios.

Yet, the global geopolitical landscape has changed considerably since the IEA's creation. The rise of new energy consumers, new energy-related challenges and new international energy forums prompt a rethink of the agency's current role and institutional design. This article seeks to contribute to the recent debate on the future role of the IEA by examining specific drivers, avenues and constraints for institutional reform. The method used is SWOT analysis, which allows to summarize the key factors emanating from an assessment of an organization's internal characteristics (strengths and weaknesses) and its external environment (opportunities and threats). Building on this SWOT analysis, the article formulates a strategy for the IEA to remain the focal point in global energy governance. Key elements of this strategy include: stronger engagement with new consumers, rapprochement with OPEC, becoming a leading voice in the energy transition, and changing the agency's internal governance practices.

Utilizing in-state feedstock supplies could be an efficient way to stimulate biofuel industries and the local economy. In this paper we estimate supply under output price and quantity uncertainty for major biofuel feedstock crops in Washington. Farmers are expected to be risk averse and maximize the utility of profit and uncertainty. We estimate very large Washington price elasticities for corn and sugar beets but a small price elasticity for a third potential feedstock, canola. Even with the large price elasticities for two potential feedstocks, their current and historical production levels in the state are so low that unrealistically large incentives would likely be needed to obtain sufficient feedstock supply for a Washington biofuel industry. Based on our examination of state and regional data, we find low likelihood that a Washington biofuels industry will develop in the near future primarily using within-state biofuel feedstock crops.

A cost-minimizing linear optimization tool was used to calculate the best CSP plant configuration for Morocco's coal-dominated power system as well as for Algeria, where flexible gas-fired power plants prevail. The results demonstrate that in both North African countries, storage-based CSP plants offer significant economic advantages over non-storage, low-dispatchable CSP configurations. However, in a generalized renewable integration scenario, where CSP has to compete with other renewable generation technologies, like wind or photovoltaic (PV) power, it was found that the cost advantages of dispatchability only justify CSP investments when a relatively high renewable penetration is targeted in the electricity mix.

We also find a strongly significant positive impact of lagged jumps on volatility, which however is absorbed more quickly. We then estimate continuous-time stochastic volatility models that are able to reproduce the statistical features captured by the discrete-time model. We show that a single-factormodel driven by a fractional Brownian motion is unable to reproduce the volatility dynamics observed in the data, while a multifactor Markovian model fully replicates the persistence of both volatility and leverage effect. The impact of jumps can be associated with a common jump component in price and volatility.

The prices of minerals and metals, another exhaustible resource group, increased by a mere 45% in the same period. The paper contends that the actions of OPEC, primarily production quotas, cannot account for this stark difference in price performance. Neither can the evolution of oil prices be rationalized by cost developments, for costs have remained far below the prices. The price evolution is better explained by capacity constraints caused by the inefficiency of state owned enterprises that dominate the oil industry since the 1970s, and that, additionally, have been deprived by their owners of financial resources to invest in capacity maintenance and growth. A capacity-destroying resource curse afflicting many oil producing nations, has been a further factor driving prices upwards. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite these challenges, almost all Southeastern and Eastern European countries have begun to align their oil stockholding arrangements with the European model, albeit there is variation in the actual degree of convergence. The greatest convergence is observed for Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In marked contrast, the oil stockholding system of Moldova continues to be different from the European model. This study provides an overview of the Southeastern and Eastern European countries' progress in approximating the European requirements for emergency oil stocks and identifies the factors responsible for the cross-country variation. The differences observed stem from the extent to which the countries are legally obliged to comply with the European provisions, their membership aspirations, levels of energy-related investment from the European Union, and dependence on oil imports.

This study utilizes several data envelopment analysis (DEA) based models to evaluate the total-factor energy and emission performance of China's 30 regions within a joint production framework of considering desirable and undesirable outputs as well as separated energy and non-energy inputs. DEA window analysis is applied in this study to deal with cross-sectional and time-varying data, so as to measure the performance during the period of 2000-2009. Two treatments for undesirable outputs are combined with DEA models and the associated indicators for simplex energy performance and unified energy and emission performance measurement are proposed and compared. The evaluation results indicate that the treatment of undesirable outputs transformation is more appropriate for China's regional energy and emission performance evaluation because it has stronger discriminating power and can provide more reasonable evaluation results that characterize China's regions. The empirical result shows that east China has the highest and the most balanced energy and emission performance. The energy and emission performance of China remained stable during 2000-2003, decreased slightly during 2004-2006, and has continuously increased since 2007. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These positive impacts on neighborhood human capital efficiency may likewise help to reduce the poverty rate in that neighborhood. The results established in this paper indicate that not only is the sharing of economic information in urban neighborhoods important for neighborhood human capital development but also that neighborhood income sharing, the sharing of neighborhood social capital, and the diversity of neighborhood social capital may all have a beneficial influence on both the human capital efficiency rate and the rates of neighborhood poverty.","Benedict Coll, Sch Business & Econ, Columbia, SC 29204 USA",Benedict College,"Lee, R (通讯作者)，Benedict Coll, Sch Business & Econ, Columbia, SC 29204 USA.",leer@benedict.edu,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, offshore wind power is not yet competitive with traditional electricity generation technologies, so its sustained development depends on national support policies. Employing a DCF model, this paper scrutinizes how national regulations and geographic conditions of designated national offshore wind development areas affect profitability. The focus of the analysis is on a set of hypothetical offshore wind park scenarios from five countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, and the UK). The inclusion of geographic conditions is significant, since water depth and distance to shore influence costs and because available wind resources determine the amount of electricity produced. The paper's findings are threefold: Firstly, profitability results indicate that currently relevant scenarios in the UK and Germany are most attractive, but that the upcoming UK Round III projects have low attractiveness. Belgium, France, and Denmark follow in the rankings successively. Secondly, there is high variation among scenarios with respect to capital costs-differences amount up to +61%. Lastly, a future scenario assuming technology improvements and learning effects suggests that remuneration levels could be lowered by similar to 25% by 2020. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors argue that mandatory and voluntary SDEID are two complementary regulatory instruments for emission reduction in the power industry. An analytical framework of SDEID with six facets is suggested in this paper to demonstrate relevant legal provisions and regulatory policies of mandatory and voluntary SDEID of power industries in the US. Empirical research shows that mandatory and voluntary SDEID of the power industry have been regulated simultaneously in the US. The foundation of power companies' willingness to disclose emission information voluntarily is the combination of mandatory scientific monitoring with market regulation in the current SDEID system in the US. In comparison, the SDEID of power industries has yet to be widely implemented in developing countries. Finally, the paper provides some implications to developing countries that plan to learn institutional arrangements from developed countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In developing countries such as Ghana, the rudimental way of operating LPG cars is of a national concern since there is no clear cut framework within which they function. This paper presents a scenario of development from conversion of gasoline to LPG fuelling system in cars in Ho, Ghana. Data were collected through survey (100 questionnaires), in-depth interviews (2), Focus Group Discussions (3) and direct observations. The result shows LPG conversion is carried out by the local informally trained mechanics especially for Taxis because of its low consumption resulting in more profit. Conversion takes 1-2 day with an average estimated cost of GH square 450 cedis ($300). The LPG policy in Ghana focuses on domestic purposes hence the fuel being heavily subsidised. Challenges' being faced by the autogas market in Ghana includes; no clear cut policy, low number of refuelling stations, lack of standard conversion and installation kits and unprofessional LPG installers. In order for government to benefit from LPG as automotive fuel, coherent autogas policy should be formulated ensuring the availability of the LPG with price affordability as in the case of gasoline and diesel.

Given a programmable household appliance switching system, and user-reported appliance use times, we simulated the load reduction effectiveness of three types of algorithms, which were applied at both the single household level and across all 30 households. All three algorithms effected significant load reductions, while the least-to-highest potential user inconvenience ranking was: coordinating the timing of frequent intermittent loads (algorithm 2): moving period-of-day time-flexible loads to off-peak times (algorithm 1); and applying short-term time delays to avoid high peaks (algorithm 3) (least accommodating). Peak reduction was facilitated by load interruptibility, time of use flexibility and the willingness of users to forgo impulsive appliance use. We conclude that a general factor determining the ability to shift the load due to a particular appliance is the time-buffering between the service delivered and the power demand of an appliance. Time-buffering can be 'technologically inherent', due to human habits, or realised by managing user expectations. There are implications for the design of appliances and home automation systems.

Based on the dynamic equilibrium of input-output economics theory, it considers three simulation scenarios: fixed-technology, technological-innovation, and green-building effect. It is applied to analyse Hong Kong in 1980-2007. Continual increase in energy consumption with rapid economic growth degraded environmental utility. First, energy consumption at fixed-technology was determined by economic outcome. In 1990, it reached a critical balanced state when energy consumption was 22 x 10(9) kWh. Before 1990 (x(1) <22 x 10(9) kWh), rise in energy consumption improved both economic development and environmental utility. After 1990 (x(1) > 22 x 10(9) kWh), expansion of energy consumption facilitated socio-economic development but suppressed environmental benefits. Second, technological-innovation strongly influenced energy demand and improved environmental benefits. The balanced state remained in 1999 when energy consumption reached 32.33 x 10(9) kWh. Technological-innovation dampened energy consumption by 12.99%, exceeding the fixed-technology condition. Finally, green buildings reduced energy consumption by an average of 17.5% in 1990-2007. They contributed significantly to energy saving, and buffered temperature fluctuations between external and internal environment. The case investigations verified the efficiency of the EUEC model, which can effectively evaluate the interplay of energy consumption and environmental quality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop an optimization model to determine the lowest cost investment and operation plan for the generating capacity of an electric power system. The model incorporates demand response to price change. In a case study for a U.S. state, we show the price, demand, and generation mix implications of a renewable electricity standard, and of a carbon cap-and-trade policy with and without initial free allocation of carbon allowances. This study shows that both the demand moderating effects and the generation mix changing effects of the policies can be the sources of carbon emissions reductions, and also shows that the share of the sources could differ with different policy designs.

However, availability of suitable sites for the installation of such applications is questioned, since apart from the fact that many locations of high RES potential and adequate infrastructure have already been allocated, the society opposition often sets additional barriers. The present study focuses on the assessment of the levels of social acceptability for selected RES technologies (wind, small hydro and photovoltaics) in a representative region of Southern Greece. The specific area is of major interest since, apart from the operating and scheduled installations of RES applications in the next years, the local population is also familiar with the long-term operation of a lignite-based power station (850 MW). One three-part questionnaire has been deployed for conducting the survey based on a representative sample of local inhabitants. According to the results obtained, high levels of acceptability of renewable energy applications have been encountered although the need for additional public information regarding RES exploitation has also been designated.

This paper uses the Log-Mean Divisia Index I (LMDI-I) methodology to decompose gas consumption trends in the gas-connected residential sector in Ireland from 1990 to 2008, which despite an increasing number of energy efficiency policies, experienced total final consumption growth of 470%. The analysis decomposes this change in gas consumption into a number of effects, examining the impact over time of market factors such as a growing customer base, varying mix of dwelling types, changing share of vacant dwellings, changing size of new dwellings, the impact of building regulations policy and other factors such as the weather. The analysis finds the most significant effects are changing customer numbers and changing intensity; the analysis also quantifies the impact of building regulations and compares it with other effects such as changing size of new dwellings. By comparing the historical impact on gas consumption of policy factors and non-policy factors, this paper highlights the challenge for policy-makers in achieving overall energy consumption reduction.

As contribution to the current discussions about DESERTEC, MedGrid and other initiatives this article describes the approach and results of an analysis of possible solar electricity import corridors from MENA to Europe including Turkey. The study is based on solar energy potentials of the MENA countries identified by remote sensing, reviewed performance and cost data of generation and transmission technologies, and geographic data and information systems (GIS) for the spatial analysis. CSP plants combined with high temperature heat storage and high voltage direct current (HVDC) overhead lines and sea cables represent the key technologies for implementing this promising option for renewable energy import/export. The total technical solar power generation potential from remote sensing analysis in the seven MENA countries considered was calculated to about 538,000 TWh/yr. This huge potential implies that less than 0.2% of the land suitable for CSP plants would be enough to supply 15% of the electricity demand expected in Europe in the year 2050. A GIS analysis of potential future HVDC corridors led to the description and characterization of 33 possible import routes to main European centers of demand. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Some groups have a financial penalty for carbon emitted in excess of the ration, and systems whereby under-emitters are rewarded using the monies collected from over-emitters. CRAGs therefore operate the nearest scheme in existence to the proposed policy of Personal Carbon Trading (PCT). This paper reports the findings of a study of the opinions and experiences of individuals involved in CRAGs ('CRAGgers'). In general, interviewees have made significant behavioural changes and emissions reductions, but many would be unwilling to sell spare carbon allowances within a national PCT system. The choices made by CRAGgers with respect to the design and operation of their 'carbon accounting', their experiences of reducing fossil fuel energy use, and their views on personal carbon trading at CRAG and national level are discussed. Some possible implications for PCT and other policies are considered, as well as the limitations of CRAGs in informing an understanding of the potential impacts and operation of PCT.

In an initial empirical analysis, this paper attempts to answer the following questions, which have often been posed but have not, to our knowledge, been answered empirically at global level. At which date, if unaddressed, will the risks become critical? Given that the substitution of fossil fuels by wind and solar energy is often proposed as a solution to these problems, what is its current aggregate growth rate and is there a plausible future growth rate which would substitute it for fossil fuels before the risks become critical? The study finds that the peak fossil fuel risk will start to be critical by 2020. If however the future growth rate of wind and solar energy production follows that already achieved for the world mobile phone system or the Chinese National Expressway Network the peak fossil fuel risk can be prevented completely. For global warming, the same growth rate provides significant mitigation by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels to zero by the early 2030s. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In part II we present summary results from field trials using the RHC, and provide an estimate of the carbon abatement and economic evaluation of the system. Statistically significant yield increases are demonstrated for RHC addition in irrigated rice cultivation (33% increase in paddy rice yield for a 41.5 t (dry weight) RHC application per hectare). The carbon abatement from the RHC addition is approximately 0.42 t CO2 t(-1) rice husk; including energy generation from gasification this increases to ca. 0.86 tCO(2) t(-1). Assuming a carbon value of $5 t CO2 t(-1), and agronomic value of $3 t(-1) RHC based on the field trials, the economic value of the RHC varies from $9 t(-1) (including only recalcitrant carbon) to $15 t(-1) (including avoided emissions from energy production). We summarise results from parts I and II, concluding that the gasification-biochar system meets many of the criteria of sustainability, but requires better waste water management and more field trials to demonstrate repeatable agronomic efficacy of RHC application.

The method can closely approximate a wide variety of distributions while maintaining weak assumptions on the shape of distribution functions. We show how moments and quantiles of general functions of the random variable can be computed analytically and/or numerically. We illustrate the method by revisiting the determinants of income expectations in the United States. A Monte Carlo analysis suggests that a quantile-based flexible approach can be used to successfully deal with censoring and possible rounding levels present in the data. Finally, our analysis suggests that the performance of our flexible approach matches that of a correctly specified parametric approach and is clearly better than that of a misspecified parametric approach.","[Bellemare, Charles; Kroeger, Sabine] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Bissonnette, Luc] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & OR, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Laval University; Tilburg University,"Bellemare, C (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Pavillon JA DeSeve,1025 Ave Sci Humaines, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",cbellemare@ecn.ulaval.ca; l.bissonnette@uvt.nl; skroger@ecn.ulaval.ca,"; Kroger, Sabine/K-6530-2013","Bissonnette, Luc/0000-0002-4684-508X; Bellemare, Charles/0000-0002-8149-1678; Kroger, Sabine/0000-0002-9784-8205",FQRSC,FQRSC,"The authors thank Arthur van Soest, participants at the ESA meetings in Nottingham and Tucson, two referees, an associate editor, and the editor for comments.

Its early internationalization was supported in creating business networks that were very valuable in the autarkic Spain. In the 1950s, this group owned match companies in Portugal, Morocco and several Latin American countries like Cuba, Venezuela and Ecuador.

This paper applies modern panel data techniques to help shed light on the importance of the heterogeneity among different regions within China. Empirical analyses are conducted for the full panel as well as three subgroups of the panel. The empirical results show that coal consumption and GDP are both I(1) and cointegrated in all regional groupings. Heterogeneity is found in the GDP equation of the full panel. The regional causality tests reveal that the coal consumption-GDP relationship is bidirectional in the Coastal and Central regions whereas causality is unidirectional from GDP to coal consumption in the Western region. Thus, energy conservation measures will not adversely affect the economic growth of the Western region but such measures will likely encumber the economy of the Coastal and Central regions, where most of the coal intensive industries are concentrated.

Human capital composition and economic growth at the regional level, Regional Studies. This paper analyses the impact of human capital composition on regional catch-up for Spain over the period 1960-1997. Empirical evidence shows that human capital has a non-linear impact on convergence at both NUTS-2 and NUTS-3 geographical disaggregation levels. Tertiary education drives regional catch-up, while the accumulation of non-technical education slows down this convergence. When one controls for the development stage of the regions, strong complementarities seem to arise between different types of skills. When closer to the frontier, the complementarities between tertiary education and secondary/vocational training drive the convergence process, while the impact of intermediate education is weak for regions at lower development stages.","[Manca, Fabio] Inst Perspect Technol Studies, JRC, E-41092 Seville, Spain; [Manca, Fabio] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); University of Barcelona,"Manca, F (通讯作者)，Inst Perspect Technol Studies, JRC, Edificio EXPO WTC,Calle Inca Garcilaso 3, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",fabio.manca@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,35,25,27,3,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Studies on barriers to the adoption of building energy-saving technologies are of great significance on implementing policies related to achieving energy-saving goals. This paper studied 15 barriers with the aid of information collected through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The respondents were 135 employees working in the Jing-jin-tang area. Based on the results of the factor analysis, the barriers were categorized into five groups: attitudes of stakeholders, policies and regulations, auxiliary resources, profitability, and adaptability of the technologies. Analysis of the entire sample showed that the stakeholders' reluctance to use was the largest barrier, followed by high initial investment and low profitability. Further analysis showed that the occupation and designation of the respondents and the size of the enterprises that they served influenced their perspectives on the barriers. It was found that architects attributed more importance to the adoption of energy-saving technologies than contractors; barriers confronted by employees of large enterprises and small enterprises were different; managers perceived weaker barriers than frontline employees and were more optimistic about the prospect of building energy-saving technologies. Finally, policy recommendations were proposed based on these in-depth and targeted analyses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, he does not carry out a detailed analysis of the reliability or the cost, but bases his conclusion on five arguments, each of which is either irrelevant or erroneous. In particular, his research question, concerning the cost of a CSP kilowatt-hour during winter is irrelevant, and the answer misleading, because the power station will deliver electricity in summer too. A more relevant and not misleading question would be about the performance - the yearly levelised costs of electricity and the reliability - of a CSP fleet. We argue based on a detailed analysis of the performance of CSP in four deserts worldwide, that a coordinated fleet of CSP stations can indeed provide fully dispatchable electricity, and in some cases even baseload, at low cost.

The extent to which and just how participatory approaches can work has however remained under-researched. This paper develops a normative framework for participatory governance to examine, analyse, and understand nuclear policy making processes and outcomes, with a particular reference to a case study of the UK nuclear consultation exercise in 2007. By comparing the actual consultation practice in the UK and our normative content-process-outcome framework, we found that the government approach paid insufficient attention to trust and some other normative values underpinning participatory governance, contributing to undesirable outcomes relating to policy legitimacy and public distrust. Our findings suggest that the UK government needs to pay more attention to the interaction that can occur between different rationales for participation and the processes and consequences of participatory exercises.

J,"Romanova, T",,,,"Romanova, Tatiana",,,Russian energy in the EU market: Bolstered institutions and their effects,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,EU-Russian energy relations; Energy dialogue; Energy charter treaty; Rational choice institutionalism; Transgovernmental; Transnational levels,,"The article examines institutional changes in EU-Russian energy relations since 2000. The article explores the ability of transformed institutions to limit the politicisation of energy and to reconcile the EU competitive-market approach with Russian state capitalism. More specifically, the article focuses on changes in intergovernmental, transgovernmental and transnational interactions. The article demonstrates that the gradual strengthening of transgovernmental and transnational institutions has inhibited the politicisation of energy relations and facilitated regulative cooperation between the EU and Russia. However, the potential of shared institutions is constrained by internal institutions on both sides. In Russia, these obstacles are insufficient top-down delegation of responsibilities in the government and its great power aspirations. In the EU, key barriers include inter-institutional rivalries, the EU's propensity to impose its legislation on external partners and the integration of energy policy with foreign policy. The article presents several policy implications. First, it is futile to institutionally impose the regulative paradigm of one partner on the other; rather, mutual dialogue is needed. Thus, institutions should be structured appropriately. Second, current depoliticisation will require the involvement of not only the EU and Russia but also transit countries, such as Ukraine. Third, transgovernmental and transnational cooperation should be nurtured because this is a useful channel for both information exchange and a regulative convergence of policy implementing mechanisms. Finally, this incremental regulative convergence is the only option available today for the EU and Russia; this is also a way to further depoliticise energy relations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The research sets out to determine whether householders believe these buildings are thermally comfortable, and if they feel confident operating the smart technologies that help achieve the net zero energy outcome? Combining interviews from 25 households and monitored energy data from over 50 near zero energy homes, this paper examines the validity of this policy goal from the building user perspective. The evidence shows households attain high levels of thermal comfort, enjoy lower energy bills, and believe their behaviour has been influenced by the building and its energy systems. Yet many remain concerned that the building industry is unable to produce homes that maintain thermal comfort in all spaces and all seasons. The residents have also identified significant issues in the reliability and usability of the energy technologies. Whilst the policy appears valid from the end-user perspective, the case study highlights the substantial task ahead for policy makers to establish suitable commissioning and compliance processes, and develop effective energy rating tools on the path to zero energy homes.

The procedures discussed in this article are nonparametric, so one can test the significance of a regressor without specifying a functional form. The results are used to test the null hypothesis that the entire function takes the value of zero. We show that the standardized test has a normal distribution regardless of whether there is a near unit root in the regressor. This is in contrast to tests based on linear regression for this model where tests have a nonstandard limiting distribution that depends on nuisance parameters. Our results have practical implications in testing the significance of a regressor since there is no need to conduct pretests for a unit root in the regressor and the same procedure can be used if the regressor has a unit root or not. A Monte Carlo experiment explores the performance of the test for various levels of persistence of the regressors and for various linear and nonlinear alternatives. The test has superior performance against certain nonlinear alternatives. An application of the test applied to stock returns shows how the test can improve inference about predictability.","Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Juhl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, 415 Snow Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",juhl@ku.edu,,,,,,,16,5,5,0,5,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Therefore, reforming the energy subsidies, as planned by the government, will have a significant impact on household welfare and energy-intensive sectors, such as the transport sector. This study employs a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to highlight the transmission channels through which the removal of energy subsidies affects the domestic economy. The findings show that the shock increases real GDP and real investment, while decreasing Malaysian total exports and imports. The removal of energy subsidies also decreases the aggregate energy demand, and, consequently, decreases the level of carbon emissions in the Malaysian economy. In addition, households experience significant falls in their consumption and welfare. The transport sector is significantly influenced through an increase in production costs due to an increase in the prices of intermediate inputs. The total output and total exports of the whole transport sector decrease while its imports increase. In addition, the use of all kinds of transport by households decreases significantly. The Malaysian energy subsidy reform, leads to an initial decrease in CO2 emissions and demand for electricity, gas, and petroleum products in the entire transport sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, we propose two non-radial directional distance functions for energy/carbon efficiency analysis of fossil fuel electricity generation. One is named a total-factor directional distance function that incorporates the inefficiency of all input and output factors to measure the unified (operational and environmental) efficiency of fossil fuel power plants, and the other is called an energy-environmental directional distance function that can be used to measure the energy-environmental performance of fossil fuel electric power plants. Several standardized indicators for measuring unified efficiency and energy-environmental performance are derived from the two directional distance functions. An empirical study of 252 fossil fuel power plants in China is conducted by using the proposed approach. Our empirical results show that there exists a significant positive relationship between the plant size and unified efficiency, the five state-owned companies show lower unified efficiency and energy-environmental performance than other companies. It is suggested that Chinese government might need to consider private incentives and deregulation for its state-owned enterprises to improve their performance proactively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze data from a 2009 survey of more than 400 owner-occupiers of single-family detached, semidetached, and row houses in Germany, that was conducted as a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI). In the survey, respondents were asked directly for reasons for and against retrofitting their homes, but also faced a choice experiment involving different energy retrofit measures. Overall, we find that house owners who are able to afford it financially, for whom it is profitable, and for whom there is a favorable opportunity are more likely to undertake energy retrofit activities. The latter point seems to be of particular importance in explaining the persistent low retrofit rate in Germany. Our results suggest that professional energy advice could stimulate the demand for building energy retrofits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A spatial analysis is here proposed to investigate the extent to which technology-specific innovation patterns are determined by the concentration of economic activities, the level and the quality of local research and knowledge flows from neighboring areas. The diversity of employment and the concentration of economic activities are found to be important drivers of spatial patterns of innovation activities, with an expected rate of innovation that increases with a higher concentration of economic activities. Such effect is higher in particular for technological fields as Chemistry. Although local research also stimulates innovation activities, the spatial distribution of the latter is subject to decreasing returns to local research. Additionally, knowledge flows from neighboring areas enforce local research activities, in particular for the case of Mechanical engineering and Electricity, locking-in the process of the localization of innovation activities. The knowledge of the appropriate channel of inducing technology-specific innovation patterns enables decision makers to formulate market-based or research support instruments able to stimulate private initiatives, with further consequences upon the spatial organization of innovation activities.","[Corsatea, Teodora Diana] Univ Sci & Technol Lille, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Jayet, Hubert] Univ Sci & Technol Lille, Lab EQUIPPE, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille; Universite de Lille,"Corsatea, TD (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol Lille, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",corshateo@gmail.com; hubert.jayet@univ-lille1.fr,,,,,,,72,4,5,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

In contrast to previous papers, the analysis is carried out from the perspective of stationarity testing, incorporating quadratic trends and the possibility of smooth changes. For a classical database, we find significant evidence of trend stationarity in most of the series, suggesting that shocks are mostly of a transitory nature. Exceptions are silver and natural gas, with stationarity being rejected for all the specifications considered in the paper.

Some key findings were made. (1) PHEVs could help save around 60% or 40% in energy costs, compared with conventional gasoline vehicles (CGVs) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), respectively. However, for motorists whose daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) is significant, HEVs may be even a better choice than PHEV405, particularly in areas that lack a public charging infrastructure. (2) The incremental battery cost of large-battery PHEVs is difficult to justify based on the incremental savings of PHEVs' operating costs unless a subsidy is offered for large-battery PHEVs. (3) When the price of gasoline increases from $4/gallon to $5/gallon, the number of drivers who benefit from a larger battery increases significantly: (4) Although quick chargers can reduce charging time, they contribute little to energy cost savings for PHEVs, as opposed to Level-II chargers.

Here, the social practices model (Spaargaren, 2003) is applied to examine solar technology adopters in two U.S. States who were interviewed about adopting residential solar electric technology and specifically about their experiences with the rebate and incentive programs available to them. Examining the policies and interrogating their potentially unintended consequences from the perspective of the user sheds light on how residential solar incentive programs act as systems of provision, shaping the practices of solar technology adopters, in hopes of improving these incentive programs and effectively encouraging increased residential solar technology adoption. Findings suggest that feed-in tariffs offer additional positive outcomes related to broadening the context for adoption and encouraging future energy conservation while size restrictions, wholesale pricing in net metering agreements, and inconsistent policy mechanisms across utilities in the same state all have potentially unintended negative consequences.

The majority of ICS research reveals a strong pro-diffusion bias toward proving these benefits. Few studies have examined ICSs from the adopters' point-of-view. The purpose of this case study was to describe how culture and social perceptions affect the adoption and use of ICSs. Results showed that stoves in this rural Guatemalan community had several layers of practical importance beyond cooking food. Most prominently, household members valued stoves as heat and light sources, and as a social gathering point for families. Most ICS models have been purposely designed in controlled conditions to deliver maximum heating efficiency at the lowest production cost. However, this case study revealed that the fuel-efficient designs sacrificed important functional, social, and cultural needs: Efforts to increase adoption rates of ICSs will be more successful if the inacro-level triple benefits paradigm is adapted to include functional consumer-centric benefits beyond heating food, such as providing heat and ambient light. Adoption programs should account for the cultural and social needs of users, such as recognizing that stoves often serve as a gathering point for families. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to analyze how providers' online marketing in one of the most developed markets for green energy can be improved. We conducted a content analysis of nearly 480 providers' websites, examining as many as 620 products. We found that energy providers' communication seems to be in line with academic research on potential customer benefits (utilitarian benefits, warm glow, nature experience). However, communication could be improved by giving more detailed information on the impact of the consumer's decision, e.g. by giving numbers on CO2-emissions saved. Moreover, providers could improve the effectiveness of their visual messages by using more pictures related to renewable energy. Further, self-expressive benefits of buying green energy could be created by offering merchandise articles symbolizing the contribution a consumer makes by choosing a green tariff. When comparing purely green energy providers to other providers, we found that the former offer a wider choice as well as more products supporting new renewable installations. Important implications for policy makers aiming to phase out alternative energy subsidies emerge from our findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Through the clean development mechanism (CDM) introduced under the Kyoto Protocol, developing countries are able to earn certified emission reduction (CER) credits through a myriad of emission reduction projects. This study aims to explore the potential of implementing CDM projects in the construction and built environment (C&BE) industry, which has been criticized for not only consuming an enormous amount of resources, but also for contributing to adverse environmental health. In this research, we limit the boundary of the C&BE industry to include the planning, procurement, construction, occupation and refurbishment/demolition phases of a project's life cycle. Surveys and in-depth follow-up interviews with experts have generated useful insights pertaining to CDM potential and its adaptation into the C&BE industry. From this foundation, this paper evaluates the current obstacles to CDM and presents feasible suggestions to increase CDM projects related to the C&BE industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As with current criteria pollutants, proposals call for control of CO2, assuming that the control of each of the three criteria pollutants is separable from the others. However, control of CO2, SO2, and NOX emissions is most appropriately viewed as joint rather than separable based on engineering relationships. Empirically, we also find considerable jointness. Using a 10-year panel for 77 U.S. electric utilities, which comprise the largest sector in terms of energy-related CO2 emissions, we estimate a multiple-input, multiple-output directional distance function combining good inputs (production capital, pollution control capital, labor, and energy) and a bad input (sulfur burned) to produce good outputs (residential and industrial/commercial electricity production) and bad outputs (SO2, NOX, and CO2). We find that while utilities do not directly control CO2 emissions, considerable jointness exists across SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions. Failure to account for this jointness increases the cost of pollution control, making it less acceptable to the public and policymakers. We also compute the technical efficiency of our set of utilities and find that considerable cost savings can be achieved by adopting the best technology for production of electricity and reduction of pollutants.

The study finds that, consistent with past literature, institutions do have a significant effect on trade. Different measures that capture domestic and international institutions were used. It was found that domestic institutions had a more significant effect on trade than international institutions. Domestic institutions were also found to be more inward looking and protectionist in nature and were probably increasing average tariffs in order to protect domestic trade, while international institutions were probably more concerned about regional integration, tariff reduction and trade facilitation in general. Using different measures of economic policy, we find from our results that institutions that affect trade do not differ significantly from one another. The effectiveness of domestic institutions in promoting trade was examined through interacting domestic institutions with access to local and foreign markets (market access), market potential (market size) as well as regional average tariffs, the result was that domestic institutions increase cost of international trade through increasing tariffs but decrease transportation to markets and were not developing regional specific market potential, the results for international institutions were a reduction of all three factors i.e. tariffs, cost of transportation to market and market size.","[Alege, Phillip; Ojeaga, Paul; Ogundipe, Adeyeini] Covenant Univ, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ & Dev Studies, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,,paul.ojeaga@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; yemi_keke2001@yahoo.com,"Ogundipe, Adeyemi/M-8498-2013","Ogundipe, Adeyemi/0000-0003-0707-294X",,,,,34,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,2807,2845,,,,,,39,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308101052,0

Many banks abandoned their essential intermediation role of mobilizing savings and inculcating banking habit at the household and micro enterprise levels. This paper presents empirical findings on the effects of the 2005 bank consolidation on small business finance in Nigeria. The main objective of this paper is to assess the response of flow of credit from the banking sector to small and medium enterprises in Nigeria. Data for the study were sourced from the list of the 25 post consolidation banks in Nigeria. Panel data covering a period from 2004 to 2011 were analysed using the Levitt, Lin and Chu panel unit root test analysis to ascertain the authenticity and accuracy of the data series as well as its reliability on policy issues. The study adopts panel regression approach comprising of fixed and random effect models and used Hausman Taylor (1981) option in selection of a more efficient estimator for the model equation. The study shows a percentage increase in post consolidation asset base by over 9 percent for the banks and profit maximization increases by 72 percent which could translate to increased bank propensity and readiness to lend. There is also a significant increase in SME credit supply accessible by firms resulting to increase investment and consolidated effort to encourage the development of more SME driving enterprise. The study therefore recommends that credit policy effect should ensure that banks reorganize their asset portfolios so as to create more provision for lending to small firms rather than implementing policies that allow for more stringent conditions and requirements that discourage future development of SME investments in the economy.","[Babajide, Abiola A.; Olokoyo, Felicia O.; Taiwo, Joseph N.] Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,,abiola.babajide@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; felicia.olokoyo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; joseph.taiwo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"Babajide, Abiola Ayopo/M-8059-2013; Olokoyo, Felicia O./M-8193-2013","Taiwo, Joseph/0000-0001-5039-5854; Olokoyo, Felicia/0000-0003-0176-0194",,,,,26,2,2,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,2522,2540,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308101038,0

This problem is frequently solved problem in many fields and it is more appropriate for real-life applications, because in practice data are hardly deterministic, but tend to change unexpectedly. This paper introduces fuzzy decomposition methodology and ranking function approach to solve fuzzy defined problems and suggests a possibility of solving portfolio optimization problem with uncertain data set using presented methods. Fuzzy portfolio optimization problem takes into account the fact that share profits could not be the same as predicted, but real share profits values could be different; the future profit of the shares are presented in the model by triangle fuzzy numbers. In this paper classic portfolio optimization problem is transformed into fuzzy linear programming problem and solved by presented techniques. Results obtained by fuzzy approaches used in this paper are compared with p-fractile approach which is briefly reviewed in the paper.

The aim of this paper is to propose a new method for interval AHP where a relative importance of one element (alternative or a criterion) over another element is expressed by an interval rather than a crisp number from Saaty's fundamental scale from 1 to 9. In the proposed method weights of alternatives (criteria) are estimated by an interval generalization of the geometric mean, and for the final ranking of alternatives a formula based on a possibility theory is employed. The proposed method is computationally simpler than the standard linear programming (LP) approaches and its use is demonstrated on examples.

The author uses quarterly data from 2002 to 2013 and estimates the sensitivity of the NPLR to unemployment rate, PPI inflation, lending interest rates, and the change of real effective exchange rate of the Czech Crown (CZK). The author employs a vector error correction model (VECM) which is suitable for cointegrated series and can distinguish long run relations and short run dynamics. The author finds that, macroeconomic variables are significant determinants of NPLR in Construction sector. VECM reveals high and statistically significant impact of the change in the companies lending rate and unemployment rate to the change of NPLR in the Czech Republic. These findings may help policy-makers to better understand behavior of NPLR in this endangered sector and improve their reaction in order to prevent possible spillovers to the entire economy.","VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Melecky, A (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",,"Melecky, Ales/AAZ-1918-2020; Melecky, Ales/HNP-2751-2023","Melecky, Ales/0000-0002-4495-6296;",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,643,648,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900111,0

For biotech companies open innovation represents a core activity, with most of them having high values of revenues deriving from joint development projects. On the other side, for pharmaceutical companies open innovation is somehow ancillary: even if most open innovation activities are widespread, their values are not really significant if compared to the total business volume. For companies in the technology hardware & equipment industry the use of spin-ins as a mean for incorporating external knowledge is the most frequent open strategy. The paper contributes to the research on open innovation by defining the business models that science based companies adopt to foster open innovation.","[Michelino, Francesca; Cammarano, Antonello; Caputo, Mauro] Univ Salerno, Dept Ind Engn, Salerno, Italy",University of Salerno,,fmichelino@unisa.it; acammarano@unisa.it; emilia.lamberti@uniroma2.it; mcaputo@unisa.it,"Cammarano, Antonello/AAA-3770-2020; Caputo, Mauro/N-2857-2015; Michelino, Francesca/E-5173-2017","Cammarano, Antonello/0000-0002-7922-5864; Caputo, Mauro/0000-0003-3500-4290; Lamberti, Emilia/0000-0002-3761-8213; Michelino, Francesca/0000-0003-1175-509X",,,,,25,0,0,0,17,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,79,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100010,0

J,"Samuelson, RD",,,,"Samuelson, Ralph D.",,,The unexpected challenges of using energy intensity as a policy objective: Examining the debate over the APEC energy intensity goal,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy intensity; APEC; Energy efficiency,,"Aims: Energy intensity (energy demand per unit of economic output) is one of the most widely used indicators of energy efficiency in energy policy discussions. Yet its application in real-world policymaking can be surprisingly problematical. This paper aims to provide guidance to governments and organizations considering using energy intensity as a policy objective. Scope: In 2007 the APEC community adopted, then in 2011 revised, an APEC region-wide energy intensity improvement goal. This paper presents a case study of that experience, focusing on three key 'lessons learned'. These lessons are not original findings. However, none of them have received the recognition they deserve, and consequently, they came as a surprise to many of those involved in APEC's policy discussions. Conclusions: The three lessons are as follows: (1) Energy intensity improvement is happening surprisingly quickly, but not quickly enough to meet the world's energy challenges. (2) It is difficult to find a definition of energy intensity that can make it suitable for use as an indicator of regional energy efficiency. (3) Whether the GDP's of individual economies are converted to common currency using market exchange rates or purchasing power parity (PPP) can dramatically change regional energy intensity improvement calculations.

We illustrate the versatility of these models on several examples of decision making and evaluation problems. A major advantage of the linguistic rule base representation of the decision making process is its clarity and easy understandability for all people involved in the HR management process including the staff. Expert knowledge and experience can be reflected, modifications of the models are possible in real time and can be done by the practitioners.

Participants expressed a stronger preference for demand-side options than for supply-side ones. They also chose fuel switching (to electricity) and technical energy efficiency measures above more behaviour focused options. Renewable energy options (wind, solar, marine and hydro) were preferred to other low carbon supply options (nuclear power, carbon capture and storage), with offshore wind power more popular than onshore. Nuclear power was the least popular generation option. Acceptability of the government's three proposed scenarios was tested by comparing these scenarios with the research findings. Greatest support was suggested for the two scenarios emphasising business greenness, home energy efficiency, electrification of home heating and travel behaviour. The lowest level of support was demonstrated for the scenario based on significant growth in nuclear power with minimal increases in energy efficiency. Despite issues regarding the representivity of the sampled respondents, the work demonstrates the possibility of using outputs from the tool to assess publically preferred pathways.

Among these methodologies, the use of entry-exit tariffs computed via least squares has received the most attention over the last few years and there is a wide consensus towards the application of this approach. The main contribution of this paper is to raise awareness on the fact that, even after a given methodology has been chosen, there are still important details to be fixed before the final tariffs are computed. Within the context of the least squares methodology we argue that, although many of these details may seem minor, they can have a big impact on the final outcome. The paper also presents proposals on how these details can be handled while still pursuing the goals set by the EU; goals such as being transparent, cost-reflective, and non-discriminatory. Finally, the paper concludes with an illustration of the discussed proposals, applying them to the Spanish gas transport network. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, there has been only limited analysis of the way in which decentralisation in China might affect variables such as welfare, output and income at the aggregate level and none at the regional level. This paper makes a start at filling this gap by analysing the aggregate and regional effects of various policies which aim to change the balance between fiscal activities of the national and regional governments. For this, we use a small theoretical model designed to capture some of the features of the Chinese economy, and we solve it numerically using a parameterisation based on Chinese data. We analyse the effects of four different shocks; all of them involve a transfer of resources to the regional governments financed by a cut in central government expenditure, but they differ in the way in which regional governments use the additional funds: (1) they adjust expenditure on the consumption good, (2) they adjust infrastructure expenditure, (3) they maximise the size of their own budget, and (4) they maximise the welfare of the representative citizen. We find that the aggregate economic effects of decentralisation depend on the precise nature of the policy and that aggregate benefits may often mask a deterioration in the inter-regional distribution of those benefits.","[Chen, Anping] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Groenewold, Nicolaas] Univ Western Australia, Dept Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",Jinan University; University of Western Australia,"Groenewold, N (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Dept Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",anping.chen@yahoo.com.cn; nic.groenewold@uwa.edu.au,,"Groenewold, Nicolaas/0000-0003-3612-4470",,,,,59,6,7,0,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This paper focuses on the important energy-related needs in retailers' stores such as for food refrigeration and lighting, as well as heating, ventilation and air conditioning of the building. For the definition of best environmental management practices in the European framework, frontrunner retailers have been identified as those retailers integrating energy minimization and saving measures as standard practice systematically across stores. These best performers also integrate a comprehensive monitoring system in the energy management of every store or building belonging to the company, enabling the rapid identification of energy saving opportunities. An integrative approach is needed to define how best practices should be implemented in combination to optimize energy management within stores: building aspects such as insulation of the building envelope or the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, should be optimized in combination with best options for refrigeration in food retailers. Refrigeration systems are responsible for half of the final energy use in stores and of their carbon footprint. Natural refrigerants, heat recovery from the condensation stage and covering of display cases are measures with high environmental benefits to reduce the impact of refrigeration. Finally, practices for lighting, as optimal lighting strategies, and the integration of renewable energy sources in overall zero energy building concepts can save considerable amounts of fossil energy, reduce the carbon footprint and produce significant cost-savings in the long term.

The potential for cellulosic ethanol production from agricultural residues in Nigeria is 7556 km(3) per annum exceeding the mandate of 10% renewable fuel required and providing the potential for 12 large- and 11 medium-scale processing facilities based on the use of a single feedstock. Cassava and yam peelings provided in excess of 80% of the process residues available with enough feedstock to supply 10 large-scale facilities with a fairly even distribution across the zones. Sorghum straw, millet straw and maize stalks represented 75% of the potential resource available from field residues with the potential to supply 2 large- and 7 medium-scale processing facilities, all of which would be located in the north of the country. When a multi-feedstock approach is used, this provides the potential for either 29 large- or 58 medium-scale facilities based on outputs of 250 and 125 km(3) per annum respectively.

Currently, China is the largest carbon emitter with large annual incremental carbon emissions and might have to face the challenge of CBTA. Therefore, it is a pressing policy challenge for the government to get prepared for mitigating the negative impacts of CBTAs on China. In this article, we compare the impacts of CBTAs across large developing economies and compare the performances of different policy options to mitigate the negative impacts. The main findings are as follows. First, CBTA would affect different economies and different sectors differently. CBTA would result in a shift of production across sectors and relocation of output from the target countries to CBTA users. Second, CBTA would contribute to world's emissions reduction, but less than expected due to carbon leakage. Finally, policy options, which could reduce the present distorting effects, would be preferred to other policy options that would add additional distorting effects to the economy. Looking ahead, the Chinese government should get prepared for mitigating the negative impacts of CBTAs because its economy could be adversely affected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The South Australian Government responded to concern for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by creating a model development of near zero energy homes in a near zero carbon impact estate. The creation of the Lochiel Park Green Village challenged a collective of industry experts and policy makers to set objectives, performance targets and regulatory guidelines outside existing institutional and professional norms. Literature suggests that the creation of niche events can help the transition away from dominant technologies, practices and beliefs, and lead to organisations embracing new tools, construction practices, technologies, standards and policies. By applying a multi-level socio-technical framework, and utilising evidence collected from a series of interviews with key government and industry leaders, this paper examines how, under the influence of landscape pressures, structural change at the regime level can come from the incubation of ideas and experiences at the niche level. The available evidence finds that the creation of the Lochiel Park Green Village has allowed many individuals and organisations to gain a more detailed and practical understanding of sustainable housing, and has given organisations the confidence to change industry practices, government policies, and regulatory standards.

The dataset covers the sector of private households in Austria for the period from 1993 to 2009. The main findings of the analysis are: (1) while technical improvements reduce final energy use for heating significantly, rising comfort needs nearly outweigh these savings. (2) Consumer behaviour reduces calculated final energy use considerably. (3) The extent of this reduction is declining significantly in the period observed. (4) The growing share of single-family houses has increased energy demand for heating in the observed period, though a reversal of this trend is detected from 2007 onwards.

Farm-based AD has proliferated in some EU countries, driven by favourable policies promoting sustainable energy generation and GHG mitigation. Despite increased state support there are still few AD plants on UK farms leading to a lack of normative data on viability of AD in the whole-farm context. Farmers and lenders are therefore reluctant to fund AD projects and policy makers are hampered in their attempts to design policies that adequately support the industry. Existing AD studies and modelling tools do not adequately capture the farm context within which AD interacts. This paper demonstrates a whole-farm, optimisation modelling approach to assess the viability of AD in a more holistic way, accounting for such issues as: AD scale, synergies and conflicts with other farm enterprises, choice of feedstocks, digestate use and impact on farm Net Margin. This modelling approach demonstrates, for example, that: AD is complementary to dairy enterprises, but competes with arable enterprises for farm resources. Reduced nutrient purchases significantly improve Net Margin on arable farms, but AD scale is constrained by the capacity of farmland to absorb nutrients in AD digestate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Thereby the focus lies on the role of the main actors and their composition of so called discourse coalitions.

Current life cycle assessment (LCA) models that assess greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from crude oil transportation are linearly-scale and fail to account for project specific details. This research sets out to develop a detailed LCA model to compare the energy inputs and GHG emissions of pipeline and rail transportation for oil sands products. The model is applied to several proposed oils sands transportation routes that may serve as future markets. Comparison between transportation projects suggest that energy inputs and GHG emissions show a high degree of variation. For both rail and pipeline transportation, the distance over which the product is transported has a large impact on total emissions. The regional electricity grid and pump efficiency have the largest impact on pipeline emissions, while train engine efficiency and bitumen blending ratios have the largest impact on rail transportation emissions. LCA-based GHG regulations should refine models to account for the range of product pathways and focus efforts on cost-effective emission reductions.

For this purpose, we combine the concept of the metafrontier Malmquist productivity index and the non-radial directional distance function to develop a new index called the non-radial metafrontier Malmquist CO2 emission performance index (NMMCPI). This new methodology allows for the incorporation of technological heterogeneities and slack variables into the previously introduced Malmquist CO2 emission performance index (MCPI). The NMMCPI can be derived by solving several non-radial data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. The NMMCPI can be decomposed into an efficiency change (EC) index, a best-practice gap change (BPC) index, and a technology gap change (TGC) index. By fixing the non-energy inputs, we measure the pure CO2 emission performance change. Based on the proposed indices, the comparative study between Chinese and Korean fossil fuel power industries is conducted for the 2005-2010 period. Empirical results indicate significant differences in terms of various decomposed CO2 emission performance changes between China and Korea. Korean power plants demonstrate improvements in innovation, while Chinese power plants demonstrate a higher ability for technological leadership. Some related policy implications are also proposed based on the empirical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a methodology which uses these data to design FITs for domestic scale grid-connected PV systems in Ireland. A sample of 2551 household electricity demand data collected at 1/2-hourly intervals, electricity output from a 2.82 kW(p) PV system over the same time interval as well as PV system costs and electricity tariffs were used to determine the required FIT to make it worthwhile for the households to invest in the PV system. The methodology shows that it is possible to design single, multiple and continuous FITs. Continuous FITs are the most efficient and result in no overcompensation to the housholder while single and multiple FITs are less efficient since they result in different levels of overcompensation. In the PV case study considered, it was shown that the use of three FITs (0.3170, 0.3315 and 0.3475 (sic)/kW h) resulted in a 59.6% reduction in overcompensation compared to a single FIT of 0.3475 (sic)/kW h; assuming immediate and complete uptake of the technology, this would result in NPV savings of over (sic)597 m to the Irish government over a 25 year lifetime.

The proposed test statistic is a Portmanteau statistic with an automatic selection of the order of the residual serial correlation tested. The test presents several attractive characteristics: simplicity, robustness, and high power in finite samples. The test is simple to implement since the researcher does not need to specify the order of the autocorrelation tested and the proposed critical values are simple to approximate, without resorting to bootstrap procedures. In addition, the test is robust to the presence of conditional heteroscedasticity of unknown form and accounts for estimation uncertainty without requiring the computation of large-dimensional inverses of near-to-singularity covariance matrices. The basic methodology is extended to general nonlinear multivariate time series models. Simulations show that the proposed test presents higher power than the existing ones for models commonly employed in empirical macroeconomics and empirical finance. Finally, the test is applied to the classical bivariate VAR model for GNP (gross national product) and unemployment of Blanchard and Quah (1989) and Evans (1989).

This study uses a multi-objective planning method to minimize the cost of power generation and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by decreasing the dual objective of building the power supply scheduling model and the target year. This is conducted according to simulations of future carbon emission reduction policies for the scheduling of power supply situations. The results show that nuclear units will be able to reduce the power generation electricity costs and carbon dioxide emissions effectively; renewable energy has excellent potential to reduce emissions, and the cost of solar power technology with high fossil fuel prices will gradually enhance its cost competitiveness. Gas, although the cleanest fossil fuel, cannot be underestimated for its carbon dioxide emissions. As fossil fuel prices increase, gas will gradually experience a reduction in carbon reduction benefits; integrated gasification combined cycle with carbon capture and storage technology will replace part of the oil and gas power generation, and in addition to the reduction of carbon dioxide and costs, will achieve the goal.

In a first step, this paper identifies the distributional effects caused by this policy instrument which occur when energy efficiency measures are implemented (phase of delivery) and when its costs are passed on to the society (phase of financing). In the phase of delivery, suppliers prefer to implement measures at the property of those customers which enable them to minimise their costs, i.e. enterprises with large energy savings potentials and high-income households who can contribute a greater share of the costs. In the phase of financing, distributional effects occur when the costs of the scheme are passed on from the obliged suppliers to their customers, primarily affecting less competitive customers, i.e. households and small enterprises. In the British scheme, the so-called priority group was installed in order to decrease distributional effects and to support energy poor households. In a second step, this paper evaluates approaches to reduce energy poverty and indicates ineffectiveness, high transaction costs and incoherency with the aims of the obligation scheme. Alternative approaches to tackle energy poverty are briefly described. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Results show that local acceptance towards existing biogas power plants is relatively high in Switzerland. Perceived benefits and costs as well as trust towards the plant operator are highly correlated and have a significant effect on local acceptance.

We attempt to shed light on the question how the transport sector should best be decarbonized. We perform our study with the global bottom-up energy systems model TIAM-ECN, a version of the TIAM model that is broadly used for the purpose of developing energy technology and climate policy scenarios, which we adapted for analyzing in particular the transport sector. Given the global aggregated perspective of TIAM-ECN, that in its current version yields at every point in time a single CO2 price for different forms of energy use across geographic regions and economic sectors, it generates a decarbonization process that for the transport sector occurs later in time than for the power sector. This merely reflects that emission reductions are generally cheaper for electricity production than for transportation, and that it is thus cost-minimizing to spend limited financial resources available for CO2 emissions abatement in the power sector first. In our scenarios the use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines and fuel cells, rather than electricity as energy carrier and batteries to store it, gradually becomes the dominant transport technology. This outcome is in agreement with some recent publications but is at loggerheads with the current popularity of the electric car. Based on sensitivity analysis we conclude that even if the establishment of a hydrogen infrastructure proves about an order of magnitude more costly than modeled in our base case, electricity. based transportation only broadly emerges if simultaneously also the costs of electric cars go down by at least 40% with respect to our reference costs. One of the explanations for why the electric car is today, by e.g. entrepreneurs, often considered the supposed winner amongst multiple future transportation options is that the decision horizon of many analysts is no more than a few decades, instead of a full century. Electric cars fit better the current infrastructure than hydrogen fueled vehicles, so that from a short time perspective (covering the next decade or two) investments are not optimally spent by establishing an extensive hydrogen distribution network. Hence the path-dependency created by the present existence of a vast power transmission and distribution network can make electricity the most efficient choice for transportation, but only if the time frame considered is short. Electric transportation generally proves the more expensive alternative in our long-term perspective, except when electric car costs are assumed to drop substantially. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

European policy makers have therefore declared that they aim to implement cost-efficient and fair policies to reduce carbon emissions. The purpose of this paper is to assess whether the cost of the EU policies for 2020 can be reduced through the inclusion of carbon sequestration as an abatement option while equity is also improved. The assessment is done by numerical calculations using a chance-constrained partial equilibrium model of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and national effort-sharing targets, where forest sequestration is introduced as an uncertain abatement option. Fairness is evaluated by calculation of Gini-coefficients for six equity criteria to policy outcomes. The estimated Gini-coefficients range between 0.11 and 0.32 for the current policy, between 0.16 and 0.66 if sequestration is included and treated as certain, and between 0.19 and 0.38 when uncertainty about sequestration is taken into account and policy-makers wish to meet targets with at least 90 per cent probability. The results show that fairness is reduced when sequestration is included and that the impact is larger when sequestration is treated as certain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

More specifically, it compares, across industries and countries, the predictions of two of the most popular localization indexes, that is, the Ellison and Glaeser index of 1997 and the Duranton and Overman index of 2005. Independently from the index used, it is found that localization is a pervasive phenomenon in all countries studied; and the degree of localization is very unevenly distributed across industries in each country. Furthermore, it is shown that in all countries localized sectors are mainly 'traditional' sectors or, if one controls for country industrial structures, science-based sectors. Moreover, it is found that the two indexes significantly diverge in predicting the intensity of localization of the same industry both across and within countries. In turn, these differences point to the different role played by pecuniary versus non-pecuniary externalities in driving firms' location decisions.","[Vitali, Stefania] ETH, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Vitali, Stefania] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Econ, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Napoletano, Mauro] OFCE & SKEMA Business Sch, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Napoletano, Mauro; Fagiolo, Giorgio] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Marche Polytechnic University; Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Vitali, S (通讯作者)，ETH, Syst Gestaltung KPL F 28,Kreuzpl 5, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",svitali@univpm.it; mauro.napoletano@ofce.sciences-po.fr; giorgio.fagiolo@sssup.it,"Fagiolo, Giorgio/HGB-6892-2022; Fagiolo, Giorgio/AAI-6807-2021","Fagiolo, Giorgio/0000-0001-5355-3352; Napoletano, Mauro/0000-0002-8128-6674",,,,,37,12,14,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In addition, due to concerns about energy saving and emissions reduction, clean energy sources are rapidly being developed and deployed. This presents a significant challenge for the construction and planning of peaking power solutions in China. Pumped storage plants provide a means of reducing the peak-to-valley difference and increasing the deployment of wind power, solar photovoltaic energy and other clean energy generation into the grid. Pumped storage plants represent the most mature approach among the peaking power sources and thus are one of China's major investments for the future. This paper presents China's current development of pumped storage plants, their role in the electric power system, the management models for pumped storage plants and the electricity price patterns utilising them. Here, we also analyse China's future plans for pumped storage plants, including the influencing factors and related policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Social attitudes are a major challenge to overcome in order to successfully introduce low carbon technologies as a sustainable alternative to more traditional means of energy provision. It becomes a challenge to educate the target population in order to counteract any negative preconceptions or scepticisms in using these technologies which can have adverse effect upon their viability and long term success. This work presents the results of a rural energy survey conducted in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The survey highlights the opportunities and attitudes of these rural communities towards sustainable modern energy services and the technologies used to deliver them. Results from the survey show that there is interest in using sustainable or renewable technologies for energy provision and suggest that cost, reliability and ease of use are more important factors than the environmental benefits. A suggestion for a way to improve RET adoption in rural communities is also presented based on the results of this study. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, a federal renewable fuel standard (RFS) mandates an increase in cellulosic ethanol production over the next decade. This paper quantifies the effects on local biomass supply and demand of different co-firing policies imposed on 398 existing coal-fired power plants. Our model indicates which counties are most likely to be able to sustain cellulosic ethanol plants in addition to co-firing electric utilities. The simulation incorporates the county-level biomass market of corn stover, wheat straw, switchgrass, and forest residues as well as endogenous crop prices. Our scenarios indicate that there is sufficient feedstock availability in Southern Minnesota, Iowa, and Central Illinois. Significant supply shortages are observed in Eastern Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, and the tri-state area of Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky which are characterized by a high density of coal-fired power plants with high energy output.

Men and women often do not compete for the same jobs, but rather it is found that high male unemployment has an indirect, positive significant effect on female employment rates.

A rational cost allocation model should indicate the performance of cogenerations and balance the benefits between electricity generation and heat production. Based on the second law of thermodynamics, the present paper proposes an entropy change method for cost allocation by choosing exhaust steam entropy as a datum point, and the new model works in conjunction with entropy change and irreversibility during energy conversion processes. The allocation ratios of heat cost with the present and existing methods are compared for different types of cogenerations. Results show that the allocation ratios with the entropy change method are more rational and the cost allocation model can make up some limitations involved in other approaches. The future energy policies and innovational directions for cogenerations and heat consumers should be developed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The document looked at the problems with the international negotiations, the options for Brazil as it attempts to control emissions, and ways to leverage the mitigation process. Several options are currently being proposed, but these are neither clear in order to support a solid polycentric approach with adequate metrics, nor a robust international coordination and a sound scientific communication. Brazil has a central role in this process, for having successful initiatives on renewable energy and deforestation control. Its leadership can demonstrate how such policies might take shape. However, the country's future is uncertain in terms of low carbon development. Although the country is still well positioned among BRICS to find practical solutions to the stalemate in international cooperation, several internal challenges need to be harmonized.

Without taking the difference explicitly, we propose using a semiparametric minimum average variance estimation (SMAVE) based on a dummy variable method to remove the fixed effects and obtain consistent estimators for both the parameters and the unknown link function. As both the cross-section size and the time series length tend to infinity, we not only establish an asymptotically normal distribution for the estimators of the parameters in the single index and the linear component of the model, but also obtain an asymptotically normal distribution for the nonparametric local linear estimator of the unknown link function. The asymptotically normal distributions of the proposed estimators are similar to those obtained in the random effects case. In addition, we study several partially linear single-index dynamic panel data models. The methods and results are augmented by simulation studies and illustrated by application to two real data examples.

This paper focuses on the knowledge networks and processes of anchoring in Portuguese biotechnology firms. It argues that distant knowledge networks are absolutely necessary to promote biotechnology emergence and early growth in non-high-technology regions such as Portugal. Hence, localized knowledge interactions become essential to anchor, that is, absorb and recontextualize mobile knowledge in place. Moreover, it is also argued that besides intentional firms' agency, the evolution of these networks has been influenced by institutional supports at different spatial scales, namely the presence of a (still) fragile bio-institutional environment in Portugal, European and national funding schemes, and networking platforms and active brokerage.","[Vale, Mario] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Geog Studies, P-1600214 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vale, Mario] Univ Lisbon, Inst Geog & Spatial Planning, P-1600214 Lisbon, Portugal; [Carvalho, Luis] Erasmus Univ, European Inst Comparat Urban Res Euricur, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Carvalho, Luis] Erasmus Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies IHS, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Vale, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Ctr Geog Studies, Alameda Univ, P-1600214 Lisbon, Portugal.",mario.vale@campus.ul.pt; decarvalho@ese.eur.nl,"Carvalho, Luis/W-3271-2019; Vale, Mario/H-1085-2011","Carvalho, Luis/0000-0002-7700-4558; Vale, Mario/0000-0002-4548-2459",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [36343/2007],Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The fieldwork undertaken for this study was developed as part of the Eurodite Integrated Project (EU FP6, Contract Number 006187) and it greatly benefited from the insights of other colleagues involved in the whole team.

However, uncertainties remain as to how the agriculture and forest sectors might jointly respond to increased demand for bioelectricity feedstocks and the potential environmental consequences of increased biomass production. We use an economic model to examine how the agriculture and forest sectors might combine to respond to increased demands for bioelectricity under simulated future nationallevel renewable electricity standards. Both sectors are projected to contribute biomass, although energy crops, like switchgrass, produced on agriculture land are projected to be the primary feedstocks. At the highest targets for bioelectricity production, we project increased conversion of forest to agriculture land in support of agriculture biomass production. Although land conversion takes place in response to renewable electricity mandates, we project only minor increases in forest and agriculture emissions. Similarly, crop prices were projected to generally be stable in the face of increased bioelectricity demand and displacement of traditional agriculture crops. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The study uses data from two rounds of Nepal Living Standard Surveys and a Population Census and examine how the choice of a migration destination is influenced by various covariates, including income differentials across possible destinations. We find that migrants move primarily to nearby, high population density areas where many people share their language and ethnic background. Better access to amenities is significant as well. Differentials in average income across destination districts are significant in univariate comparisons but not once we control for other covariates. Differentials in consumption expenditures are statistically significant but smaller in magnitude than other determinants. It is differentials in absolute, not relative, consumption between destination districts that are correlated with the destination of work migrants.

Government policies are contributing to this rising investment in the smart grid in many countries around the globe. Using Rothwell and Zegveld's innovation policy framework as a starting point, this paper compares innovation policy in smart grids across the Pacific; specifically, China and the USA. This research describes the policy tools used by both countries and presents results that indicate national preferences for innovation policy that differ in the ways in which they are linked with the state of the power system. China has preferred to use supply-side policy, which focuses on public enterprise, scientific and technical development and legal regulation. The USA has preferred to use environmental-side policy, which focuses on scientific and technical development, financial, political and public enterprise.

The data, from 84 listed Chinese chemical and steel companies from 2006 to 2010, was analyzed using both a fixed effect model and the generalized method of moments (GMM) model. The empirical results demonstrate that these institutional factors positively affect corporate energy conservation and emissions reduction. Specifically, four factors - tax policies, government subsidies, credit policies and media supervision - have a significant positive relationship with corporate energy conservation and emissions reduction; whereas laws and marketization degree exhibit no significant effects.

Since it is aimed that the incurred capital and operating costs of generation technologies be recovered in Iranian electricity pool, the noncompetitive capacity payment mechanism has been introduced for this purpose in order to encourage new investments in electric power generation system. In the current mechanism, the capacity payments are designated to the generating units in the whole country electricity market. An annual base value of capacity payment is proposed based on recovering the capital cost of a benchmark generation technology. This value is altered according to the operational reserve in the day-ahead electricity market. This supporting policy is simulated and analyzed in the proposed dynamic framework in order to track the trend of new investments in the Iranian electricity market. The feasibility study of implementing the regional capacity assignment is the main focus of this paper. Different possible regulating policies such as floating rates for capacity payment and electricity price cap, the multiple capacity payments to various technologies, and the regional electricity market with territorial capacity allocation are examined in order to investigate the consequences and performances of different decisions and policies in the capacity investment of Iranian electricity market.

A low carbon fuel standard is designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by targeting the fuel portion of the fuel-vehicle system. Specifically, a NLCFS would set national targets for the average carbon intensity (Cl) of motor fuels, and establish a market for credits that allows fuel producers and importers to respond in a variety of ways to the signal provided by the credit price. An important method for lowering the Cl of transportation is to substitute lower-carbon alternative fuels such as advanced biofuels, electricity, CNG, and H2. Despite the focus on GHGs, so long as transportation fuels remain dominated by petroleum, transportation fuel policies like a NLCFS also will be evaluated in terms of their energy security impacts. We examine the fuel substitutions that are projected to be induced by a NLCFS and consider the energy security implications of displacing higher carbon fuels, such as imported Canadian Oil Sands oil or certain imported crude oils, with lower-carbon domestic oil, biofuels, or lower carbon oil imported from other sources.

Undoubtedly, cities have a high level of complexity, especially considering problems related to obtaining suitable information about a building's energy performance and consumption. This study developed a methodology able to characterize the energy performance of the built environment in a city or neighbourhood and to evaluate the effects of different energy strategies. The methodology was designed to be as simple as possible, not time consuming and applicable to all Italian towns, as well as elsewhere, if basic building information are available; the main phases of the methodology were the collection and analysis of the available data about the built environment and the implementation of a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) city buildings database. To test the developed tool, the city of Milan was considered as a case study.

The study first used a conventional data envelopment analysis model and the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) to measure the energy efficiency and productivity change over the period 2001-2008. The results indicated inefficiency in many of the plants: The average energy efficiency was only 61.1%. The annual growth rate of productivity was 7.96% over this period and technical change was the main contributor to this growth. The research then took undesirable outputs into consideration by using the Malmquist-Luenberger Productivity Index (MLPI) to explore the productivity change from 2006 to 2008. Omitting undesirable outputs would result in biased efficiency change and technical change.

How to select appropriate technologies to improve energy efficiency and control pollution from PAHs simultaneously is encountered by both the researchers and the decision makers. This study sets up a framework on technology selection and combination which integrates technology assessment, multiple objective programming and scenario analysis. It can predict proper technology combination for different emission controls, energy conservation targets and desired levels of production. An iron and steel factory in Southwestern China is cited as a case. It is shown that stricter PAHs control will drive the transformation from process control technology to alternative smelting technology. In low PAHs limit, 25% energy reduction is a threshold. Before inclusion of a restraint on energy consumption at 25% reduction, PAHs emission is the key limiting factor for the technology selection; while after inclusion of this restraint, energy consumption becomes the key limiting factor. The desired level of production will also. influence the technology selection. This study can help decision makers to select appropriate technologies to meet the PAHs control objectives and energy conservation strategies in energy-intensive industries. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

With constant costs, there is a permanent trade-off between economic growth and a cleaner environment. With endogenous technical change, it is possible to harmonize more output and less emissions by replacing non-renewable resources for renewable ones.

The model is fitted to years 2000-2011 recorded data for South Africa to make a comparative analysis with the Generalized Pareto-type (GP-type) distribution. Peak electricity demand is influenced by the tails of probability distributions as well as by means or averages. At times there is a need to depart from the average thinking and exploit information provided by the extremes (tails). Empirical results show that both the GP-type and the GPD are a good fit to the data. One of the main advantages of the GP-type is the estimation of only one parameter. Modelling of extreme daily increases in peak electricity demand helps in quantifying the amount of electricity which can be shifted from the grid to off peak periods. One of the policy implications derived from this study is the need for day-time use of electricity billing system similar to the one used in the cellular telephone/and fixed line-billing technology. This will result in the shifting of electricity demand on the grid to off peak time slots as users try to avoid high peak hour charges. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, the various power sector technologies [fossil fuel plants with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS), nuclear power stations, and renewable energy technologies (available on a large and small {or domestic} scale)] all involve differing environmental impacts and other risks. Three transition pathways for a more electric future out to 2050 have therefore been evaluated in terms of their life-cycle energy and environmental performance within a broader sustainability framework. An integrated approach is used here to assess the impact of such pathways, employing both energy analysis and environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA), applied on a 'whole systems' basis: from 'cradle-to-gate'. The present study highlights the significance of 'upstream emissions', in contrast to power plant operational or 'stack' emissions, and their (technological and policy) implications. Upstream environmental burdens arise from the need to expend energy resources in order to deliver, for example, fuel to a power station. They include the energy requirements for extraction, processing/refining, transport, and fabrication, as well as methane leakage that occurs in coal mining activities - a major cotribution and from natural gas pipelines. The impact of upstream emissions on the carbon performance of various low carbon electricity generators [such as large-scale combined heat and power (CHP) plant and CCS] and the pathways distinguish the present findings from those of other UK analysts. It suggests that CCS is likely to deliver only a 70% reduction in carbon emissions on a whole system basis, in contrast to the normal presumption of a 90% reduction. Similar results applied to other power generators. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Meanwhile, fossil fuel depletion has also been identified as a future challenge. This chapter reviews the connection between these two issues and concludes that limits to availability of fossil fuels will set a limit for mankind's ability to affect the climate. However, this limit is unclear as various studies have reached quite different conclusions regarding future atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by fossil fuel limitations. It is concluded that the current set of emission scenarios used by the IPCC and others is perforated by optimistic expectations on future fossil fuel production that are improbable or even unrealistic. The current situation, where climate models largely rely on emission scenarios detached from the reality of supply and its inherent problems are problematic. In fact, it may even mislead planners and politicians into making decisions that mitigate one problem but make the other one worse. It is important to understand that the fossil energy problem and the anthropogenic climate change problem are tightly connected and need to be treated as two interwoven challenges necessitating a holistic solution.

The CDM contributes to cost-efficient reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in industrialized countries and promotes sustainable development in developing countries. Its fundamental framework is based on partnerships between industrialized and developing countries. This study employs social network analysis to investigate the dynamics of the partnership networks observed in 3816 CDM projects registered in the database of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change over the period of 2005 to 2011. Our three main findings can be summarized as follows. First, the CDM partnership network is a small world; however, its density tends to decrease as the number of participants for a CDM project decreases. Second, the partnership networks' leading groups tend to shift from partner countries into host countries. Third, a host country that pursues more partnership-based projects takes better control of resources and knowledge-flow in the ego-network formed around that country, and can thus better utilize global resources for its CDM projects.

We identify two structural breaks that occur in 1990 and 2008 which coincidentally correspond to the Iraqi/Kuwait conflict and the global financial crisis, respectively. We find evidence of persistence and leverage effects in the oil price volatility.

This implies that foreign companies invest in low-margin mining activities with motives other than profit. It is argued that foreign investors and Japanese trading companies in particular used government investment concessions and subsidies to help create oversupply in the seaborne coal market. The aim of this strategy is to depress contract prices at the cost of achieving reasonable profitability levels, which have historically been well below that of other investors in the Australian mining sector. This study shows that the quasi-integration via concessional funding arrangements is not a credible strategy employed by Japanese trading companies or the Japanese Government. The analysis rejects the hypothesis that via foreign direct investment. Japanese companies are securing coal at below average prices. Furthermore we find no clear evidence of Japanese trading companies using their information advantage as equity investors to secure coal at favourable prices during contract negotiations. Finally we examine the investment behaviour of new entrants in the Australian coal production sector to highlight the differences in investment strategy between Japanese companies and other foreign investors regarding the security of supply.

It improves the quality of community life by promoting sanitary conditions and minimizing the negative impact of wastewater on ecosystems. The price for this important public service, however, varies considerably across regions and localities. In this paper, we examine the physical factors and institutional characteristics that affect wastewater service prices across regions and localities. Our major concerns are the following: (1) institutional arrangements and characteristics of a wastewater utility, (2) government regulations, (3) supply factors and characteristics, and (4) natural environments and local characteristics. To analyze the price differences, we employ the demand and price equations for wastewater services using a simultaneous equations framework. For empirical estimation, we utilize a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) method to account for the correlations between the residuals in the four price equations for wastewater services. Our empirical results are that the institutional arrangement of services, including monthly charges (versus bi-monthly or quarterly charges), provision of other infrastructure services in addition to wastewater services, and long-term debt, explain much of the price difference. In addition, the wastewater prices are influenced by state environmental regulations as well as supply factors, such as the number of wastewater treatment plants and infiltration and inflow into the sewer system. Interestingly, local geographic and meteorologic factors that were hypothesized to affect the selection of treatment processes were not found to be associated with price. These findings suggest ways wastewater services might be offered at lower prices for users.","[Bae, Suho] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Grad Sch Governance, Seoul 110745, South Korea; [Gen, Sheldon] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Publ Adm, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA; [Moon, Seong-Gin] Inha Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Inchon 402751, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); California State University System; San Francisco State University; Inha University,"Bae, S (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Grad Sch Governance, 53,Myeongnyun Dong 3 Ga, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",baes@skku.edu; sgen@sfsu.edu; moons@inha.ac.kr,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

After decades' application and research, China biogas has achieved considerable accomplishments. This study presents the progress and prospect of biogas technologies and industry in China. Two biogas patterns exist in China, that is, household-scaled digester for scattered farmers and biogas plant for centralized biogas production. Household-scaled digester which is simple and practical has been widely used and fully developed. Biogas plants have being sprung up with different materials, process and biogas utilization technologies. By the end of 2010, 38.51 million household-scaled digesters, and 27,436 large- and medium-scaled biogas plants for agricultural wastes were built. The calculation result of biogas potential from agricultural wastes shows that those used raw materials account for only 1.90% of the total availability. Chinese government promulgated several laws and policies, and gave financial supports to promote the development of biogas. However, some problems such as inferior equipment technology, imperfect policy incentive hamper its wide application and promotion. With the rapid development of economy and the improvement of rural living condition, China biogas industry is expected to advance toward orientation of scalization, industrialization and commercialization.

However, the effect of the dieselization on controlling emissions has been questioned by many authors. At the Spanish national level, we first provide descriptive evidence of the effects of dieselization on passenger cars emissions. Second, we use a panel data set for 16 Spanish regions between 1998 and 2006, and estimate a dynamic panel data model that relates CO2 emissions generated by passenger cars with a set of variables related to the dieselization process, fuel efficiency and other control variables. Combining both analysis, we find the existence of a significant indirect, negative effect on CO2 emissions caused by the dieselization, which is more important than the direct, positive technology-efficiency impact.

Although China's electricity industry has been reformed since 1978, the substantial reform has not been conducted until 1985. Before 1985, China's power industry had been absolutely monopolized by the central state-owned companies. The absolute monopoly has been broken since 1985, when the Chinese government opened doors for non-central state-owned investment entities and foreign investors in power supplies in order to solve the chronic power shortage. In 2002, the comprehensive electricity reform plan entitled Scheme of the Reform for Power Industry was enacted. However, implementation of this plan was delayed due to electricity supply shortages. Even worse, a new kind of monopoly has been developed under the background the state advances, the private sector retreats in late years. In some sense, the former absolute monopoly has transformed the current relative monopoly. We contend that the relative monopoly has reversed the market-oriented reform in China's electric industry. If the relative monopoly remains unchanged, it will be harmful to public welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We compare our projection with forecasts by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) for eight countries-U.S., China, India, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Mexico. We find that the EIA's projections are lower than ours in the case of China, the U.S., India, Japan, and Mexico.

This study uses GIS-based techniques to develop a methodology that assesses the regional-scale potential for community-based renewable electricity across Cumbria and whether a combination of these developments at the community-scale could make a significant contribution to local electricity consumption. This methodology looks at a range of technologies including hydro-power, wind-power, solar PV and bioenergy. The results suggest there is ample resource available for small communities by combining a mix of localised renewable electricity developments, which is highlighted through energy scenarios for a selected community.

Two main categories of power supply attributes are explored: source of renewable power (wind, solar and biomass) and the origin of such power. The findings suggest that most consumers are not willing to pay a premium for increases in the shares of renewable in their electricity mix. For two of the three renewable sources considered (wind and biomass) an increase of the renewable mix would require a discount. Instead, we record positive willing to pay for increases in the share of both solar power and locally generated power. However, preferences for types of renewable (solar and wind) are found to be heterogeneous. By classifying respondents in two groups according to the implied importance of the share of renewable sources in their power mix we identify a market segment consisting of 20% of respondents that could promote renewable energy in the absence of subsidies. This is because such a segment shows willingness to pay higher than the current feed-in tariffs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We model adoptions of crops, livestock, and forests. Both specialized and diversified enterprises are modelled. This paper finds that livestock, forests, and a diversification into crops, livestock, and forests are key adaptation strategies. Under the UKMO (United Kingdom Meteorological Office) scenario, a livestock-only enterprise would expand by 4 per cent, a crops-livestock-forests by 3 per cent, and a forests-only by 3 per cent. Adaptation behaviours are closely tied with ecosystem changes under global warming. A livestock-only would increase especially in the grasslands. A crops-livestock-forests enterprise expands into xeromorphic forests. A crops-livestock expands in Andean grasslands and tall grasslands. A forests-only expands in the coasts and woody zones. A crops-only enterprise decreases across South America.","Univ Sydney, Fac Agr & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Seo, SN (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Agr & Environm, RD Watt A04, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",niggol.seo@sydney.edu.au,,"Seo, S.

J,"Birkin, M; Clarke, G",,,,"Birkin, Mark; Clarke, Graham",,,The enhancement of spatial microsimulation models using geodemographics,ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The generation of synthetic population estimates through spatial microsimulation has been a popular technique in recent years, with applications to research and policy problems in many areas of social science. Estimation techniques typically involve cloning or matching households in surveys with small-area census data. When model estimates are benchmarked against real-world data, the models are typically well behaved and very robust, but they can struggle to capture the diversity of spatial variations shown by observed data. We argue in this paper that this is the result of 3 potential problems in spatial microsimulation estimation techniques. The first issue results from the matching process in the estimation techniques, and the second problem relates to the variations of household types in the surveys being reweighted. Third, similar household types may show different behaviours or have different attributes depending on geographical factors not contained in surveys (such as the proximity of service or job locations). The aim of this paper is to demonstrate and measure the loss of accuracy and intensity induced by spatial microsimulation in the context of real individual data. It will be argued in particular that while the first two problems have begun to be addressed in the literature, the third issue is still largely unreported. The paper will thus suggest a solution framework which involves linking spatial microsimulation models with geodemographics and demonstrates the promise of this technique with real numerical experiments.","[Birkin, Mark; Clarke, Graham] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Clarke, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",g.p.clarke@leeds.ac.uk,,"Birkin, Mark/0000-0001-5991-098X",ESRC [ES/I025634/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I025634/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,28,19,19,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, little is known about how consumers perceive, and how they might respond to the opportunities that smart grid technologies offer. This paper reports the results from a Hong Kong survey (n=505). It contributes to the literature by providing a better understanding of the perceptions and behaviour of electricity consumers about the possible deployment of smart grids. Our results indicate that Hong Kong consumers generally welcomed smart grid technologies and had a preference for energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energy while they showed a high level of opposition to nuclear power. They displayed an interest in playing a much more informed and active role in energy decision-making, but they were sensitive to tariff increases. Motivations and barriers for consumers to support smart grid developments are also discussed. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications for effective consumer engagement.

This article examines the influence of investment subsidies, greenhouse gas (GHG) prices, and renewable energy credit (REC) prices on the economic performance of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems. Our model integrates PV output, capacity-factor-based dispatch, and cost-benefit financial components to evaluate new PV installations in California and Texas. Relative to the base case, the benefit-cost ratio increases between 5-53% in California and 5-38% in Texas for the policy-derived cases of GHG and REC prices. The economic performance of PV is higher in California due to higher grid electricity prices and the profile of displaced marginal fuels. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the electricity and GHG prices required to achieve profitability. A key element of the economic analysis demonstrates the importance of assessing the marginal fuels displaced by the PV system, not the average mix of displaced fuels, in terms of accurately monetizing the GHG abatement embodied in the displaced fuels. In California, for example, the discounted benefits derived from pollution abatement under the marginal displacement approach were 1.6-3.0 times higher than under the three average fuel mix cases.

The empirical results, obtained from dynamic panel demand models, show a positive and statistically significant relationship between ICT and electricity consumption when ICT is measured using internet connections, mobile phones or the number of PCs. Long-run ICT elasticities are smaller than income elasticities but because ICT growth rates are so much higher than income growth rates, the impact of ICT on electricity demand is greater than the impact of income on electricity demand. One implication of these results is that policies designed to close the digital divide between developed and developing economics by increasing the adoption of ICT in developing countries are put at odds with energy policies to reduce GHG emissions.

However, a series of market-oriented reforms since 1997 call for more decentralized decision-making by individual market participants. Moreover, with the rapid growth of wind power in China, the strict planning system has become one of the significant factors that has curtailed the generation of wind power, which contradicts with the original purpose of using the government's strong control abilities to promote wind power development. In this paper, we first present the reasons why market mechanisms are important for large-scale utilization of wind power by using a case analysis of the Northeast Grid, and then we illustrate the impact of conflicts between strict planning and market mechanisms on large-scale wind power utilization. Last, we explore how to promote coordination between markets and planning to realize large-scale wind power utilization in China. We argue that important measures include implementing flexible power pricing mechanisms instead of the current fixed pricing approach, formulating a more reasonable mechanism for distributing benefits and costs, and designing an appropriate market structure for large-scale wind power utilization to promote market liquidity and to send clear market equilibrium signals.

The present paper proposes a method to estimate the required amount of storage backup for a mostly solar and wind system that uses also biomass and hydroenergy as minor components of the electricity mix. An hourly simulation was carried out to determine the amount of electricity that could be produced based on the meteorological conditions of year 2001 in Japan, and this was compared with the maximum electricity demands imposed in the system for each month of the year. The system thus proposed has 100% chance of meeting around 40% of the electricity demand between 11:00 and 18:00, and the optimum scenario obtained (a 2:1 mix of solar to wind energy) required around 40 TW of storage to balance the extra electricity demand that occurs during the summer in Japan. It appears unlikely that the batteries in EV in vehicles will be able to meet this storage requirement in the future, though the system is able to adequately meet the electricity demand during the majority of the year, and hence showcases the viability of renewable energy.

Measuring the effect on travel behavior in Korea,ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper measures and identifies the effects of urban form on travel behavior in Korea. The characteristics of urban form include urban size, density, distribution and clustering. Using cluster analysis, urban form in Korea is categorized into two groups: group 1 (i.e., large-sized, high-density, equally distributed and highly clustered areas) and group 2 (i.e., small-sized, low-density, unequally distributed and highly dispersed areas). The results showed that the large-sized, high-density, unequally distributed and dispersed pattern is a relevant strategy for both groups to minimize vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) per capita. For group 1, increasing the average travel distance may be an efficient strategy to reduce the number of automobile trips. For group 2, however, decreasing the average travel distance may be a more efficient strategy. Previous recommendations for a so-called compact urban form require more validation before adoption in Korea. Different strategies are required for areas that show different characteristics in order to reduce VKT. It is important that planners and policy decision makers understand the relevant implications of urban form on travel behavior and energy use in order to implement spatial urban developments aimed at sustainability.","[Kim, Brian H.

The debates remain whether Zipf's law holds true for large and diverse countries with long urbanization history, and how varied geographical settings with different socioeconomic conditions affect city-size distributions. This research investigates China's urban system dynamics through expanded Zipf's law at national and regional level. First, the paper revisits urban system dynamic theories and recent applications of Zipf's law. The city data from 1960 to 2000 are then used to analyze rapid changes of urban systems in China through Zipf's plots of cities over the entire nation and in six macro regions, respectively. The paper also examines top ten city rank changes nationally and regionally to examine temporal trajectories of key cities and the impacts on urban systems over space.

Barriers to energy efficiency have been widely studied but to our knowledge, except for a few studies, we found inadequate consideration for barrier-barrier interactions when proposing policy measures for improving energy efficiency. Leveraging systems thinking's power as a problem solver which identifies underlying structure that explains (similar) patterns of behavior in a variety of different situations, we attempted to identify patterns of barriers to adoption of energy efficiency measures in industrial companies. Inspired by systems thinking, the proposed framework has four stages, namely, Motivation, Capability, Implementation and Results, as well as a feedback loop. Using a case study, we show that following the four stages will lead to positive feedback for future energy efficiency implementations. The framework highlights the interconnected nature of the barriers and a need for policymakers to address these barriers in a holistic manner. We argue that the overall effectiveness of energy efficiency policies is only as strong as the weakest link in the four-stage framework. This differs from most prior research that addressed barriers in isolation, where a solution is proposed for each of the barriers without considering the relationship between the barriers. Our framework also offers a way to understand the roles and responsibilities of major stakeholders such as governments and energy service companies (ESCOs) in driving energy efficiency. This allows the assessment and identification of weak links in energy efficiency policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Motivated by this worry, this article proposes several Time Varying Dimension (TVD) models where the dimension of the model can change over time, allowing for the model to automatically choose a more parsimonious TVP representation, or to switch between different parsimonious representations. Our TVD models all fall in the category of dynamic mixture models. We discuss the properties of these models and present methods for Bayesian inference. An application involving U.

Besides, due to the existence of self-selection effects, the observed interrelationship between them might be the spurious result of the fact that some unobserved variables are causing both. These concerns motivate us to (1) consider residential location choice and household energy consumption behavior (for both in-home appliances and out-of-home cars) simultaneously and, (2) explicitly control self-selection effects so as to capture a relatively true effect of land-use policy on household energy consumption behavior. An integrated model termed as joint mixed Multinomial Logit-Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value model is presented here to identify the sensitivity of household energy consumption to land use policy by considering multiple self-selection effects. The model results indicate that land-use policy do play a great role in changing Beijing residents' energy consumption pattern, while the self-selection effects cannot be ignored when evaluating the effect of land-use policy. Based on the policy scenario design, it is found that increasing recreational facilities and bus lines in the neighborhood can greatly promote household's energy-saving behavior. Additionally, the importance of soft policy and package policy is also emphasized in the context of Beijing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that when the buy-out fund is redistributed, the supply of renewable energy responds positively to the market conditions and renewables target. Without it, the buy-out rate is equivalent to a maximum price. However, redistribution of the buy-out fund may induce strategic behavior from producers who have market power. We analyze the impacts of market power and integration on the supply of conventional and renewable energy under the RO program with the buy-out fund recycled, and devise some empirical tests to predict these impacts.

The system is based on commercially available technologies: concentrating solar thermal (CST) power with thermal storage, wind, photovoltaic (PV), existing hydro and biofuelled gas turbines. Hourly solar and wind generation data are derived from satellite observations, weather stations, and actual wind farm outputs. Together CST and PV contribute about half of total annual electrical energy supply. A range of 100% renewable energy systems for the NEM are found to be technically feasible and meet the NEM reliability standard. The principal challenge is meeting peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days when CST storage is partially charged and sometimes wind speeds are low. The model handles these circumstances by combinations of an increased number of gas turbines and reductions in winter peak demand. There is no need for conventional base-load power plants. The important parameter is the reliability of the whole supply-demand system, not the reliability of particular types of power plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

After decades of economic and industrial stagnation in a district called Poblenou, in the year 2000 the City Council of Barcelona implemented a plan to renew the area's urban and economic structure. Under the development plan, knowledge-based firms were encouraged to set up in the area and thus to create a cluster of advanced activities. This paper examines the success of this local policy and aims to determine whether cluster amenities have played a part in attracting knowledge-based firms. First, we evaluated the cluster implementation via a difference-in-differences analysis, comparing the increase in the percentage of knowledge-based firms in this specific area with the increase of these firms in other local areas. Second, to determine whether the cluster amenities are an important element in attracting knowledge-based activities, we perform a multivariate regression to see if cluster amenities (as valued by firms in a survey) do have an effect on the decision of knowledge-intensive firms to locate in the district.","[Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Business, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria] Univ Rovira & Virgili CREIP QURE, Dept Econ, Reus 432204, Catalonia, Spain; [Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet; Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria] Univ Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona IEB, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Barcelona,"Viladecans-Marsal, E (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Business, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",eviladecans@ub.edu; josepmaria.arauzo@urv.cat,"Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria/D-6612-2013","Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria/0000-0002-3801-223X; Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet/0000-0003-3722-2371",,,,,47,26,26,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Unlike in other countries where these policies are enacted at a national level, the 50 states in the US pursue different policies in an attempt to foster the growth of renewable energy, and specifically solar photovoltaics. This paper provides an economic and financial analysis of the US federal and state level policies in states with solar-targeted policies that have Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SREC) markets. After putting a value on SRECs, this study further compares solar carve-outs with other incentives including the federal tax credit, net metering, and state personal tax credits. Our findings show that SREC markets can certainly be strong, with New jersey, Delaware, and Massachusetts having the most potential. Despite their strong potential as effective renewable policies, the lack of a guaranteed minimum and the uncertainty attached are major drawbacks of SREC markets. However, the leveraging of this high value offers hope that the policies will indeed stimulate residential solar photovoltaic markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

I consider peaking from the economic point of view, where economic forces determine the shape of the equilibrium extraction path. Within that framework. I ask whether the timing of peak production reveals anything useful about scarcity. I find peaking to be an ambiguous indicator. If someone announced the peak would arrive earlier than expected, and you believed them, you would not know whether the news was good or bad. However, I also show that the traditional economic indicators of resource scarcity (price, cost, and rent) fare no better, and argue that previous studies have misconstrued the connection between changes in underlying scarcity and movements in these traditional indicators.

Though the theoretical literature on conceptualizes these forces without specific geographic scale, the empirical literature largely treats them as working mainly at the metropolitan level. We argue that agglomeration may work at different spatial scales. There is now extensive evidence that metropolitan areas are polycentric, with a significant portion of employment clustered in employment centers outside the CBD. This provides basic evidence of net agglomeration benefits at the sub-metropolitan level. We explore theories of agglomeration and consider how they may explain the presence, location, characteristics, and growth of employment centers. We illustrate the usefulness of exploring polycentricity with a case study of the Los Angeles region. Our understanding of agglomeration economies can be enriched by investigating the nature of employment centers and the forces that produce and sustain them.","[Giuliano, Genevieve; Redfearn, Christian L.] Univ So Calif, Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Agarwal, Ajay] Queens Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Kingston, ON, Canada",University of Southern California; Queens University - Canada,"Redfearn, CL (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",agarwala@queensu.ca; giuliano@sppd.usc.edu; redfearn@usc.edu,,,,,,,55,48,55,2,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

A quasi-maximum likelihood result shows that DECO provides consistent parameter estimates even when the equicorrelation assumption is violated. We demonstrate how to generalize DECO to block equicorrelation structures.

Policy makers aim to accelerate and redirect technological change by targeting relevant firms via climate policy, e.g., the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), and climate-relevant technology policies, e.g., feed-in tariffs. Changes in firm's behaviour, i.e., their research and development (R&D) as well as diffusion activities, are at the heart of technological change. However, firms are heterogeneous actors with varying attributes which perceive policy differently. Hence, they can be expected to react very heterogeneously to these new policies. Based on an original dataset of 201 firms, we perform a cluster analysis grouping firms along their R&D and diffusion activity changes. We then compare these clusters with regards to the characteristics of the contained firms. Our analysis results in seven clusters showing very diverse contributions to low-carbon technological change, suggesting potential for policy to become more effective. A comparison of the firms' characteristics allows us to derive indicative recommendations on how to adjust the policy mix in order to induce contributions from most firms in the power sector.

The study is unique in that it correctly highlights the need to analyze the dynamics of zoning structure and accommodates the neighborhood spillover effects associated with the real estate market. Results indicate that the probability of rezoning vacant land is expected to increase as housing price in a neighboring location increases. The rise in the housing price in a neighboring location implies increasing pressure on housing demand. This increased pressure on housing demand likely contributes to greater demands for residential development and commercial development that complements residential use. Currently, the major guidelines for the approval of rezoning petitions, according to the planners in the Knoxville area, are consistency with long-and short-range land use plans adopted by state, municipality, and county governments, and consistency with surrounding land use and environmental constraints, e. g., slope, flooding, and drainage. Local planning authorities can modify and update consistency measures in the current guidelines by accounting for varying degrees of housing demand pressure. For example, consistency measures can be strengthened in areas with greater housing-price increases, if preservation is desirable because these areas are likely to experience greater rezoning pressure.","[Cho, S.; Kim, J.; Roberts, R.

The results show that service offshoring raises the relative demand for high- and medium-skilled workers. Its effects are qualitatively identical, and quantitatively similar, to those of material offshoring. Additional evidence suggests, however, that the two types of offshoring may work through different channels: complementarity between imported services and domestic skills in the case of service offshoring, substitution of low-skilled labour in the case of material offshoring. Overall, the effects are not large in economic terms.","Inst Anal Econ, Barcelona 08193, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Crinò, R (通讯作者)，Inst Anal Econ, CSIC Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",rosario.crino@iae.csic.es,,"Crino, Rosario/0000-0002-8562-1679","Barcelona GSE Research Network; Government of Catalunya; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO 2009-07958]; Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research; Bocconi University; Unicredit Group","Barcelona GSE Research Network; Government of Catalunya; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Bocconi University; Unicredit Group","The author is also a research affiliate of MOVE, Centro Studi 'L.

Federal environmental policy and local industrial diversification: the case of the Clean Air Act, Regional Studies. Air-quality regulations under the Clean Air Act alter local industrial diversification by reducing concentration in polluting sectors of the economy for non-attainment areas. Using comprehensive county-level data covering the entire United States over a period of twenty-six years, this study finds an important connection between air-quality regulations and local industrial diversification in both non-attainment areas and jurisdictions that have gained attainment status. Non-attainment status for ozone, carbon monoxide (CO) or sulphur dioxide (SO2) brings about significant decreases in local industrial specialization. Furthermore, these effects persist after attainment status has been gained for ozone, carbon monoxide, or sulphur dioxide.","[Carr, Douglas] Oakland Univ, Rochester, MI 48309 USA; [Yan, Wenli] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Oakland University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Carr, D (通讯作者)，Oakland Univ, Rochester, MI 48309 USA.",carr@oakland.edu; yanw@indiana.edu,,,,,,,40,4,5,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Gates or no gates? A cross-European enquiry into the driving forces behind gated communities, Regional Studies. This paper addresses one of the biggest gaps in research on gated communities: why is the phenomenon so strong in some countries, but absent in others? After reviewing the mainstream explanations, it outlines an alternative thesis based on theories of public choice and fiscal federalism. To test the relevance of the theory, European countries are divided into two groups - those with a considerable number of gated communities and those with very few or none - and they are compared on fifteen indicators. The results indicate that beyond the visible manifestation of gates and walls, there are deeper institutional driving forces.","[Csefalvay, Zoltan; Webster, Chris] Cardiff Univ, Sch City & Reg Planning, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales; [Csefalvay, Zoltan] Andrassy Gyula Deutschsprachige Univ Budapest, H-1088 Budapest, Hungary",Cardiff University; Andrassy Gyula University,"Cséfalvay, Z (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch City & Reg Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward 7 Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",CsefalvayZ@cardiff.ac.uk; Webster@cardiff.ac.uk,"Webster, Christopher John/F-2039-2013","Webster, Christopher John/0000-0002-2171-7495",,,,,71,34,35,6,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper draws on the positivist and interpretive conceptualizations of space, place and time to present a framework for exploring how spatiality and temporality are articulated and represented in spatial planning. It focuses on five aspects of planning: the conception of spatiality; spatial and scalar structuring; the treatment of time and future; the use of evidence in plan-making; and representation and visualization. How the two traditions have influenced planning, particularly in the United Kingdom, is discussed and illustrated by historical and contemporary examples.

New energy technologies are assumed to make major contributions to this goal. However, in the light of scientific uncertainty (e.g. about climate sensitivity, feedback effects, etc.), market uncertainty (e.g. fuel price volatility), technological uncertainty (e.g. availability of renewable technology), socio-economic uncertainty (e.g. development of different macroeconomic factors) and policy uncertainty (e.g. about commitment to specific targets and stability of CO2 prices), it is difficult to assess the importance of different technologies in achieving robust long-term climate risk mitigation. One example currently debated in this context is biomass-based energy, which can be used to produce both carbon-neutral electricity and at the same time offer the possibility of negative emissions by capturing carbon from biomass combustion at the conversion facility and permanently storing it. In this study, we analyze the impact of uncertainty on investment decision-making at the plant level in a real options valuation framework, and then use the GCI Scenario Database (HASA, 2009) as a point of departure for deriving optimal technology portfolios across different socio-economic scenarios for a range of stabilization targets, focusing, in particular, on the new, low-emission targets using alternative risk measures.

Yet, despite their appeal, and the numerous policies implemented to promote these technologies, the diffusion of RE projects remains somehow below expectations. This limited penetration is also due to a lack of appropriate financing and to a certain reluctance to invest in these technologies. In order to shed light on this phenomenon, in this paper we examine the decision making process underlying investments in RE technologies. We propose and test a conceptual model that examines the structural and behavioural factors affecting the investors decisions as well as the relationship between RE investments and portfolio performance. Applying econometric techniques on primary data collected from a sample of European investors, we study how the investors' a-priori beliefs, their preferences over policy instruments and their attitude toward technological risk affect the likelihood of investing in RE projects. We also demonstrate that portfolio performance increases with an increase of the RE share in the portfolio. Implications for scholars, investors, technology managers and policy makers are derived and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines whether differences in educational externalities affect individual earnings across regions in the European Union. Using microeconomic data from the European Community Household Panel, it resorts to spatial economic analysis in order to determine to what extent differences in individual earnings are the result of (1) the educational attainment of the individual, (2) the educational attainment of the other members of the household in which he/she lives, (3) the educational endowment of the region where the individual lives, or (4) the educational endowment of the neighbouring regions. The results highlight that, in addition to the expected positive returns of personal educational attainment, place-based regional and supra-regional educational externalities generate significant pecuniary benefits for workers. These findings are robust to the inclusion of different individual, household, and regional control variables.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] IMDEA Social Sci Inst, Madrid, Spain; [Tselios, Vassilis] Newcastle Univ, CURDS, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Newcastle University - UK,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk; v.tselios@ncl.ac.uk,"Tselios, Vassilis/ISB-5776-2023; Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Tselios, Vassilis/0000-0001-6330-7278; Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856","ESRC [ES/G005966/1, ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1, ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,66,13,17,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This study explores the role of values in citizen perceptions. The case study is Canada's proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline (NGP), which would transport bitumen from Alberta's oil sands to British Columbia's (BC) northern coast for export. Data were collected in 2013 from a sample of Canadian citizens (n=2628). The survey instrument elicited citizen perceptions of the NGP, as well as values and attitudes. Respondents in the Alberta subsample are the most likely to support the NGP and to perceive economic benefits. Respondents in the BC subsample are the most likely to oppose the NGP and to perceive environmental risks. To explore heterogeneity in motivations among both subsamples, respondent clusters are constructed based on values. In both regions, opposition is highest in clusters with strong biospheric-altruistic values, while acceptance is highest in clusters with strong traditional values. Regional effects are also substantial; NGP acceptance is higher in each of Alberta's clusters relative to equivalent clusters in BC. Regional context seems to shape how values correspond with perceptions. Insights are drawn for energy project development, public consultation and energy planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The regression analyses, based on 1331 dyads involving 3895 employee movements across 397 companies in the Bangalore information technology cluster in India, indicate that companies tend to hire locally and from rivals. Moreover, multinational corporations favour labour outflows to cluster firms, which enhance their local social capital and fuel knowledge transfers within clusters.","[Angeli, Federica] Dept Hlth Serv Res, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Grandi, Alessandro; Grimaldi, Rosa] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, I-40131 Bologna, Italy",Maastricht University; University of Bologna,"Angeli, F (通讯作者)，Dept Hlth Serv Res, Duboisdomein 30,6229 GT,POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",federica.angeli@maastrichtuniversity.nl; alessandro.grandi@unibo.it; rosa.grimaldi@unibo.it,"Grandi, Alessandro/F-5104-2012; grimaldi, rosa/E-9017-2012","Angeli, Federica/0000-0003-4010-3103; GRANDI, ALESSANDRO/0000-0003-0902-8504",,,,,89,11,14,2,70,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Relocation of establishments is identified by their move across the border of wards, counties, or cities and distinguished between beyond and within their workers' commuting distance. It seems that relocation beyond commuting distance costs more than that within commuting distance since the former includes additional costs related with searching for, hiring, and training new workers. Key findings of this paper show that external benefits from agglomeration are large enough to be recognized by manufacturers through relocation beyond the border of their workers' commuting area. When the own industry's share of employment in all manufacturing industries becomes doubled through relocation, the probability for establishments to relocate over a long distance across the boundary of their workers' commuting area rises by 17 per cent. The results for sub-samples divided by the age of establishments show that older establishments are more likely to relocate over a long distance to an area with disproportionate presence of establishments in the same industry. These results seem to fit product life cycle theory by Duranton and Puga.

In the 1990s, the government had a policy to prioritize Camisea gas for domestic consumption. The revocation of this policy in the 2000s allowed private developers to export 40% of Camisea's proven reserves, equivalent to one third of Peru's total. This USD 3.9 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project boasts the largest single foreign direct investment in Peru's history. A major component of the financing was granted by international financial institutions on economic grounds. While the project was expected to yield a substantial return to private investors, the export of one third of Peru's total proven natural gas reserves is not in line with its long-term interests. We undertake cost-benefit analyses for a series of scenarios, starting with the project's formative stage in the mid-2000s, and then in 2012, two years after it began its commercial operation. In all cases, Peru does not have sufficient reserves to warrant export, and the economic costs far exceed the benefits. This policy of LNG exports should not have been approved by the government, nor should the loans have been granted by international financial institutions to make it possible. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrasting wind and solar PV,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Green industrial policy; Renewable energies; Germany,RENEWABLE ENERGY; ELECTRICITY; MITIGATION; ECONOMICS,"In this paper, we address the challenge of Germany's energy transition (Energiewende) as the centrepiece of the country's green industrial policy. In addition to contributing to global climate change objectives, the Energiewende is intended to create a leading position for German industry in renewable energy technologies, boost innovative capabilities and create employment opportunities in future growth markets at the least possible cost. The success in reaching these aims, and indeed the future of the entire concept, is hotly debated. The paper aims to provide an up-to-date assessment of what has become a fierce controversy by comparing solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy along five policy objectives: (1) competitiveness, (2) innovation, (3) job creation, (4) climate change mitigation, and (5) cost. We find mixed evidence that Germany reaches its green industrial policy aims at reasonable costs. Wind energy seems to perform better against all policy objectives, while the solar PV sector has come under intense pressure from international competition. However, this is only a snapshot of current performance, and the long term and systemic perspective required for the energy sector transformation suggests a need for a balanced mix of a variety of clean energy sources.

High transaction costs in the region in recent years imply that the regional market is sub-optimally organized. Since 2010, the continued prevalence of oil-indexation has had the most adverse effect on Japan, the world's largest LNG importer. In response, Japan implemented several strategies to challenge traditional LNG pricing mechanisms in the region and ultimately reduce transaction costs. Japan's efforts include an increase in the share of spot and short-term purchases, sourcing new supplies from the United States under alternative pricing arrangements and driving regional buyer cooperation. This paper evaluates the potential effect of Japan's LNG strategy on regional pricing in the broader institutional context, arguing that LNG pricing in the region will only partially shift away from oil-indexation by the end of the decade. While recent cooperation among regional LNG importers indicates that there may be scope for change in the regional institutional setting, the degree of cooperation is insufficient to have a profound effect on regional pricing.

The tests are distribution-free and allow for a weak drift in the null model. The methods do not require either smoothing parameters or bootstrap resampling for their implementation and so are well suited to practical work. The article develops limit theory for the tests under the null and shows that the tests are consistent against a wide class of nonlinear, nonmartingale processes. Simulations show that the tests have good finite sample properties in comparison with other tests particularly under conditional heteroscedasticity and mildly explosive alternatives. An empirical application to major exchange rate data finds strong evidence in favor of the martingale hypothesis, confirming much earlier research.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Taking Shanghai as an example, which is the economic center and front-runner of China, this paper estimates the distributional effect of a carbon tax on households in various income groups by using the input-output model and the Suits index. The results indicate that the comprehensive distributional effect of the carbon tax is regressive. The expenditure of the low-income group caused by the carbon tax accounts for 0.853% of the total expenditure, while that of the high-income group 0.712%. The direct distributional effect presents a weak progressivity, while the indirect one is significantly regressive, and the latter is much larger than the former. Moreover, the Suits index of the carbon tax is -0.078, implying that the carbon tax burden on the low-income group is the highest and thus that a carbon tax can intensify income inequality. Therefore, when introducing a carbon tax, some rational associated redistribution or compensation measures, such as purposive transfer payments, should be implemented to restrict or even eliminate the regressivity of the carbon tax.

For the first specification, namely EKC, we show that there is an inverted U-shape relationship between environmental degradation and income; while for the second specification, namely modified EKC (MEKC), we show that there is an inverted U-shape relationship between sustainability and human development (HD). The relationships are shaped by other factors such as energy, trade, manufacture added value and the role of law.

This paper argues that a firm's ability to produce and absorb technological knowledge, or technological capability, influences its choice of location among regions characterized by different types of agglomeration. This paper found that geographically bounded knowledge externalities, one of the forces that attract firms into a particular location, have a differential effect on firm location choice across firms depending on the level of their technological capability: for firms with low technological capability knowledge externalities from co-located competitors, or competitive specialization, have a stronger positive effect on their location choice, while for firms with high technological capability knowledge externalities from co-located firms from related and complementary industries, or complementary specialization, more strongly influence their location choice. Furthermore, the differential effect of agglomeration economies between low- and high-capability firms is more pronounced in industries with strong non-legal appropriability, implying that firms can use their location choice as a strategic tool for dealing with the spillovers of tacit knowledge.

Il s'est avere que l'externalite de connaissance bien delimitee geographiqement, l'une des forces maitresses qui attirent les entreprises vers un emplacement particulier, a un effet differentiel sur le choix d'emplacement des entreprises en fonction du niveau de leur capacite technologique: pour les entreprises dont la capacite technologique est faible, l'externalite de connaissance des concurrents co-localises, ou la specialisation competitive, a un effet plus positif sur leur choix d'emplacement, tandis que, pour les entreprises dont la capacite technologique est forte, l'externalite de connaissance des entreprises co-localisees des industries annexes et complementaires, ou la specialisation complementaire, influe plus fortement sur leur choix d'emplacement. Qui plus est, l'effet differentiel des economies d'agglomeration entre les entreprises de faible et de forte capacite est plus marque dans les industries dont la faculte d'appropriation non-juridique est forte, ce qui laisse supposer que les entreprises peuvent se servir de leur choix d'emplacement comme un outil strategique pour traiter les retombees de la connaissance tacite. Jo Y. und Lee C.-Y. Technologische Kapazitat, Agglomerationsokonomien und Standortwahl von Firmen, Regional Studies. In diesem Beitrag argumentieren wir, dass sich die Fahigkeit einer Firma zur Erzeugung und Absorbierung von technologischem Wissen - d. h. ihre technologische Kapazitat - auf ihre Standortwahl innerhalb von Regionen auswirkt, die sich durch verschiedene Arten von Agglomeration auszeichnen. Wir stellen fest, dass geografisch begrenzte Wissensexternalitaten - eine der Krafte, die Firmen zu einem bestimmten Standort anziehen - je nach dem Umfang ihrer technologischen Kapazitat eine differentielle Wirkung auf die Standortwahl verschiedener Firmen ausuben: Fur Firmen mit geringer technologischer Kapazitat haben Wissensexternalitaten von Konkurrenten am selben Standort bzw. eine konkurrenzbedingte Spezialisierung eine starkere positive Auswirkung auf ihre Standortwahl, wahrend sich fur Firmen mit hoherer technologischer Kapazitat Wissensexternalitaten von Firmen am selben Standort aus verwandten und komplementaren Branchen bzw. eine komplementare Spezialisierung starker auf ihre Standortwahl auswirken. Daruber hinaus fallt die differentielle Auswirkung von Agglomerationsokonomien fur Firmen mit geringer und hoherer Kapazitat in Branchen mit starker nicht-rechtlicher Verwertbarkeit ausgepragter aus, was darauf schlie ss en lasst, dass Firmen ihre Standortwahl als strategisches Mittel zum Umgang mit den Spillovers von stillschweigendem Wissen nutzen konnen. Jo Y. y Lee C.-Y. Capacidad tecnologica, economias de aglomeracion y la eleccion del emplazamiento de las empresas, Regional Studies. En este articulo argumentamos que la habilidad de una empresa para producir y absorber conocimiento tecnologico, es decir, su capacidad tecnologica, influye en el emplazamiento que elige entre las regiones caracterizadas por diferentes tipos de aglomeracion. Observamos que los efectos externos de conocimiento delimitados geograficamente, una de las fuerzas que atraen a las empresas hacia un lugar determinado, tienen un efecto diferencial en el lugar que eligen las empresas en funcion del nivel de su capacidad tecnologica: para empresas con baja capacidad tecnologica, los efectos externos de conocimiento de competidores situados en el mismo lugar, es decir, la especializacion competitiva, tienen un efecto positivo mas fuerte en el emplazamiento elegido, mientras que para las empresas con alta capacidad tecnologica, los efectos externos de conocimiento de empresas situadas en el mismo lugar que trabajan en industrias relacionadas y complementarias, es decir, la especializacion complementaria, influyen de forma mas pronunciada en el emplazamiento elegido. Ademas, el efecto diferencial de las economias de aglomeracion entre las empresas con capacidades bajas y altas esta mas pronunciado en industrias con fuerte apropiabilidad no juridica, lo que implica que las empresas pueden utilizar su eleccion del emplazamiento como una herramienta estrategica para tratar con los desbordamientos de conocimiento tacito.","[Jo, Yuri; Lee, Chang-Yang] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Seoul 130722, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Jo, Y (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business, 85 Hoegiro Dongdaemun Gu, Seoul 130722, South Korea.",blackjo@business.kaist.ac.kr; drcylee@business.kaist.ac.kr,"Lee, Chang-Yang/C-1629-2011",,,,,,64,14,16,3,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We use choice based data on Italian households' current consumption expenditures from January 1999 to December 2006 merged with an air quality index. We consistently find that the income elasticity of willingness to pay for environmental quality is very close to one across income groups. Besides contributing to a strand of literature where there is scant empirical evidence, we provide the first attempt at implementing the theoretical approach suggested by Ebert (2007), which derives willingness to pay and its income elasticity using revealed preferences combined with household production.

This paper uses data from the Labour Force Survey (1995-2005) to examine the short-run impact of European Union Objective One funding on local labour markets in Great Britain. The evidence from a difference-in-difference analysis reveals that employment and job-related training gaps between the Objective One and non-Objective One area narrowed during the funding period. Further investigation, using a range of control groups, suggests that this cannot be attributed to Objective One status per se. However, there is substantial variation across the four funding areas: Objective One status had a positive effect on employment in South Yorkshire and on job-related training in Wales.","[Jones, Melanie K.; Skilton, Louise] Swansea Univ, Dept Econ, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Skilton, Louise] ONS, Newport NP10 8XG, Shrops, England",Swansea University,"Jones, MK (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Dept Econ, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",M.K.Jones@swan.ac.uk; louise.skilton@ons.gsi.gov.uk,,,,,,,28,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

From a practical viewpoint, community approaches are deemed essential in order to transition from a predominantly centralized energy supply to a decentralized one, and to exploit the potential of renewable energies. In this paper, I discuss how the emergence of community-based energy projects can be analyzed from an institutional perspective. In this context, a 'community' is treated as an individual institutional order that shapes decisions. I examine how community structures the implementation of biogas cooperatives in the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol in Northern Italy. My findings suggest that 'community spirit', a cooperative tradition, and the norms of locality and responsibility are central drivers behind the emergence and constitution of biogas cooperatives. Not only do these institutional features of community influence the decision concerning which farmers are in or out but also plant location and scale. I argue that 'community' is a necessary analytical category for understanding community energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Extensive evidence is also found of agglomeration economies among manufacturing industries. In particular, supportive incumbent industrial structures for input and output markets are strongly linked to higher establishment entry rates.

Whether benefits of new dams will outweigh costs remains unresolved despite contentious debates. We investigate this question with the outside view or reference class forecasting based on literature on decision-making under uncertainty in psychology. We find overwhelming evidence that budgets are systematically biased below actual costs of large hydropower dams excluding inflation, substantial debt servicing, environmental, and social costs. Using the largest and most reliable reference data of its kind and multilevel statistical techniques applied to large dams for the first time, we were successful in fitting parsimonious models to predict cost and schedule overruns. The outside view suggests that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly in absolute terms and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk-adjusted return unless suitable risk management measures outlined in this paper can be affordably provided. Policymakers, particularly in developing countries, are advised to prefer agile energy alternatives that can be built over shorter time horizons to energy megaprojects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study explores the productivity puzzle of Chinese exporters using a plant level dataset which includes the large industrial firms during the period of 1998-2007. Based on total factor productivity (TFP) estimated by the semi-parametric method proposed in Olley and Pakes, this study confirms productivity puzzle of Chinese exporters. The productivity puzzle however does not remain after controlling for firm locations. This result is robust for different model specifications and productivity measurements. Further analysis indicates that productive firms would favour the domestic market particularly when they can enjoy local protection. Export spillover effects would help less productive firms to enter the international market. Ownership and scale economies however condition the impacts of local protection and spillover effects. This paper suggests that local protection and spillover effects can influence the export decision of Chinese firms, providing a complementary contribution to the related literature.","[Yang, Rudai; He, Canfei] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yang, Rudai] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Yang, RD (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",rudaiyang@gmail.com; hecanfei@urban.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,37,15,15,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Based on artificial neural network, the quantitative coefficients of the actual system are identified. Taking the real situation in China for instance, an empirical study is undertaken by adjusting the parameters of the actual system. The dynamic evolution behavior of energy intensity and economic growth in reality are observed, with the results in perfect agreement with actual situation. The research shows that the introduction of CCE into ESER system will have certain restrictive effect on energy intensity in the earlier period. However, with the further development of the actual system, carbon emissions could be better controlled and energy intensity would decline. In the long run, the impacts of CCE on economic growth are positive. Government control and low carbon lifestyle play a decisive role in controlling ESER system and declining energy intensity. But the influence of government control on economic growth should be considered at the same time and the controlling effect of low carbon lifestyle on energy intensity should be strengthened gradually, while the investment in new technology of ESER can be neglected. Two different cases of ESER are proposed after a comprehensive analysis. The relations between variables and constraint conditions in the ESER system are harmonized remarkably. A better solution to carry out ESER is put forward at last, with numerical simulations being carried out to demonstrate the results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The survey randomly selected 700 participants, of which 571 questionnaires were valid. Half of respondents were found to have positive WTP for renewable electricity. The average WTP of Beijing residents for renewable electricity is estimated to be 2.7-33 US$ (18.5-22.5CNY) per month. The main factors affecting the WTP of the respondents included income, electricity consumption, bid and payment vehicle. Knowledge of and a positive attitude towards renewable energy also resulted in the relatively higher willingness of a respondent to pay for renewable electricity.

Nor do they contribute to host country's national greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Contributions to net emission reductions in host countries is likely to become mandatory in new mechanisms under development such as in the framework for various approaches, a new market-based mechanism and even in a reformed JI. This research analysed the question if approaches for carbon market-based mechanisms exist that allow the generation of net emission reductions in host countries while keeping project initiation attractive. We present a criteria-based assessment method and apply it for four generic options in existing mechanisms and derive implications for future mechanism frameworks. We identified the application of discounts on the amount of avoided emissions for the issuance of carbon credits and standardisation below business as usual as most promising options over limiting the crediting period and over-conservativeness. We propose to apply these options differentiated over project types based on internal rate of return to ensure cost-efficiency and attractiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy from biomass is anticipated to make major contributions to these. However there are concerns about the availability and sustainability of biomass for the bioenergy sector. A Biomass Resource Model has been developed that reflects the key biomass supply-chain dynamics and interactions determining resource availability, taking into account climate, food, land and other constraints. The model has been applied to the UK, developing four biomass resource scenarios to analyse resource availability and energy generation potential within different contexts. The model shows that indigenous biomass resources and energy crops could service up to 44% of UK energy demand by 2050 without impacting food systems. The scenarios show, residues from agriculture, forestry and industry provide the most robust resource, potentially providing up to 6.5% of primary energy demand by 2050. Waste resources are found to potentially provide up to 15.4% and specifically grown biomass and energy crops up to 22% of demand. The UK is therefore projected to have significant indigenous biomass resources to meet its targets. However the dominant biomass resource opportunities identified in the paper are not consistent with current UK bioenergy strategies, risking biomass deficit despite resource abundance.

Thus, developing an accounting technique is of particular importance in coping with increasing problems related to renewable agriculture and rural energy supply. In this study, extended exergy was generalised for the sustainability evaluation of biogas projects. Furthermore, a series of extended exergy-based indicators was presented as benchmarking from the perspectives of resources, economics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The sustainability of a Three-in-One biogas production system in southern China was thereby evaluated based on the proposed framework. The results show that economic costs concentrate in the construction phase. GHG emissions are mainly derived from bricks and cement, with proportions of 36.23% and 34.91%, respectively. The largest resource depletion occurs during the consumption of feedstock (87.06%) in the operation phase. Compared with other renewable energy conversion systems, the biogas project has a higher renewability (0.925) and economic return on investment ratio (6.82) and a lower GHG emission intensity (0.012). With the merit of bridging thermodynamics and externality, the extended exergy-based approach presented in this study may effectively appraise the energy and environmental performance of biogas projects.

The aim of the work is to improve the support tools for policy makers in the field of renewable energy development. Analytic Network Process (ANP) helps to better understand capital-risk investors preferences towards different kinds of biomass fueled power plants. The results of the research allow public administration to better foresee the investors' reaction to the incentive system, or to modify the incentive system to better drive investors' decisions. Changing the incentive system is seen as major risk by investors. Therefore, public administration must design better and longer-term incentive systems, forecasting market reactions. For that, two scenarios have been designed, one showing a typical decision making process and another proposing an improved decision making scenario. A case study conducted in Italy has revealed that ANP allows understanding how capital-risk investors interpret the situation and make decisions when investing on biomass power plants: the differences between the interests of public administrations's and promoters', how decision making could be influenced by adding new decision criteria, and which case would be ranked best according to the decision models.

The required energy system is among others characterised by intensive utilisation of renewable energy sources (RES). RES technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, for the strategic planning there is a great demand for the comparison of RES technologies. Furthermore, there are additional functions of RES utilisation expected beyond climate change mitigation, e.g. increment of employment, economic growth and rural development. The aim of the study was to reveal the most beneficial RES technologies with special respect to sustainability. Ten technologies of power generation and seven technologies of heat supply were examined in a multi-criteria sustainability assessment frame of seven attributes which were evaluated based on a choice experiment (CE) survey. According to experts the most important characteristics of RES utilisation technologies are land demand and social impacts i.e. increase in employment and local income generation. Concentrated solar power (CSP), hydropower and geothermal power plants are favourable technologies for power generation, while geothermal district heating, pellet-based non-grid heating and solar thermal heating can offer significant advantages in case of heat supply.

Although these challenges add to the locational and time dependency of the underlying cost of operating the system, this variability in time and location is not reflected in residential tariff schemes. Consequently, residential users are not incentivised to react to varying system conditions and to help the integration of renewable energy resources. Therefore, this paper provides a theoretical framework for designing a locational dynamic pricing scheme. This can be used to assess existing tariff structures for consumption and injection, and can serve as a theoretical background for developing new tariff schemes. Starting from the underlying costs, this paper shows that the potential for locational dynamic pricing depends on the locational and time dependency of its cost drivers. When converting costs into tariffs, the tariff design should be determined. This includes the advance notice of sending tariffs to users, and the length of price blocks and price patterns. This tariff design should find a balance between tariff principles related to costs, practicality and social acceptability on the one hand, and the resulting demand response incentive on the other.

Electric vehicles (EVs) appear as one alternative to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy resources. This research work analyzes the benefits of the introduction of EVs in a small energy system, the Flores island, Azores, in terms of primary energy and CO2 emissions. Four scenarios were designed considering different penetration rates of EVs (Low and High) and different time of recharging strategies (Fixed and Flexible). The high shares of RES in the electricity production. system (60-62%) did not guarantee a significant use of RES for the recharging of EVs (10-40%), as the additional electricity required had to be produced mainly from the diesel generators. The flexible recharging strategies allowed doubling the share of RES in the recharging of the EVs when compared to fixed recharging, and consequently double the impact on the reduction of primary energy consumption and fossil fuels imports. While the reduction of primary energy ranged between 0.2% and 1.1%, for CO2 emissions there was a decrease between 0.3 and 1.7%, proving that EVs can help improve the sustainability of energy systems.

This makes the subsurface, including its groundwater, of crucial importance for primary energy savings. The regulation of ATES systems is similar in many countries around the world. This paper seeks solutions for the institutional hindrances to the diffusion of ATES. The use of aquifers by individual ATES systems can be optimized to maximize their efficiency on the one hand, and to optimize the performance of the regional subsurface for energy storage on the other. The application of ATES in an aquifer has similar properties as other common resource pool problems. Only with detailed information and feedback about the actual subsurface status, a network of ATES systems can work towards an optimum for both the subsurface and buildings, instead of striving for a local optimum for individual buildings. Future governance of the subsurface may include the self-organization or self-governance. For that the ATES systems need a complementary framework; interpretation of interaction, feedback and adaptable and dynamic control interpretations are the key elements for the optimal and sustainable use of the subsurface.

This paper investigates the potential of PV resource, which could be systematically integrated into the Japanese power system, using a high time-resolution optimal power generation mix model. The model allows us to explicitly consider actual PV and wind output variability in 10-min time resolution for 365 days. Simulation results show that, as PV expands, the growth of PV integration into the grid slows down when the installed PV capacity is more than the scale of the peak demand, although Japan has immense potential of installable PV capacity - equivalent to 40 times of the peak. Secondly, the results imply that a large-scale PV integration potentially decreases the usage ratio of LNG combined cycle (LNGCC) in specific seasons, which is a challenge for utility companies to ensure that LNGCC is used as a profitable compensating generator for PV variability. Finally, a sensitivity analysis on rechargeable battery cost suggests that the reason for suppressing the PV output instead of storing its surplus output by the battery can be attributed to the high battery cost; hence, the improvement of its economic performance is significant to integrate the massive PV energy.

This paper employs a case study-based approach to demonstrate the significance of local governments' policy measures in assisting industrial enterprises with energy-saving activities in China. Based on the longitudinal case of the jasmine Thermal Electric Power Company, this paper hypothesizes that sub-national governments have played a major role in implementing energy-saving policies in China since the 11th Five-year-plan period. A wide range of provincial and municipal agencies collaborated in implementing five types of policy measures - informational policy, skill building, improved enforcement of central directives, price adjustment, and funding - that reduced barriers to energy saving and motivated active pursuit of energy-saving activities at industrial enterprises. The case study demonstrates how an enterprise and local governments work together to achieve the enterprise's energy-saving target.

The results indicate the presence of unexploited scale economies. However, very large companies in the sample and companies with a disproportionate mixture of output and density present an exception. Furthermore, the estimated optimal size for majority of companies in the sample has shown a value far greater than the actual size, suggesting remarkable efficiency gains by reorganization of the industry.

Utilizing data from the power corporation of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, we study the politics of electricity losses. Examining annual data over four decades, we document that UP's electricity losses tend to increase in periods immediately prior to state assembly elections. Drawing upon geographically disaggregated data for the period 2000-09, we observe higher line losses just prior to the 2002 and 2007 state elections. Our analysis shows that the incumbent party was more likely to retain the assembly seat as line losses in the locality increased. We interpret these results as corroboration that political parties deliberately redirect electricity to flat rate and unbilled users in a context of chronically inadequate supply. Political factors appear to affect line losses in ways that technical and economic factors alone cannot explain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Demand response rates have still low customer acceptance, apparently because the consumption habits requires stronger incentive to change than any proposed financial incentive. An hourly CO2 intensity signal could give customers an extra environmental motivation to shift or reduce loads during peak hours, as it would enable co-optimisation of electricity consumption costs and carbon emissions reductions. In this study, we calculated the hourly dynamic CO2 signal and applied the calculation to hourly electricity market data in Great Britain, Ontario and Sweden. This provided a novel understanding of the relationships between hourly electricity generation mix composition, electricity price and electricity mix CO2 intensity. Load shifts from high-price hours resulted in carbon emission reductions for electricity generation mixes where price and CO2 intensity were positively correlated. The reduction can be further improved if the shift is optimised using both price and CO2 intensity. The analysis also indicated that an hourly CO2 intensity signal can help avoid carbon emissions increases for mixes with a negative correlation between electricity price and CO2 intensity.

This paper constructs a dynamic game model that, for the first time compares the incentive effects of four common subsidy modes on waste cooking oil supply for biofuel refining and sales of waste cooking oil refined products. The model considers the impact of preferential tax treatment, a raw material subsidy, a sales subsidy and an investment subsidy on the profits of biofuel enterprises and waste cooking oil recyclers. Results indicate that common approaches adopted in developed economies such as raw material price subsidies and finished products sales subsidies increase the profits of both biofuel enterprises and recyclers. On the contrary, investment subsidies, which are relatively common in some regions of China, increase the profits of recyclers, while reducing revenues achieved by biofuel enterprises.

Traveling distances are mostly approximated by the length of shortest paths, which need to be computed in advance. In recent years, the availability of open data is rapidly growing. Remarkable example is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) portal providing detailed geographical information. We use OSM data to extract the road network and to identify customers' locations. For example, for the area of the Slovak Republic we obtained a network representing customers interconnected via the road network composed from nearly 2 million nodes. In this contribution, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the shortest paths which is based on the hierarchical decomposition where smaller graph segments are interconnected through the macroscopic network.

To investigate the effect of central bank liquidity facilities on term interbank lending rates near the start of the crisis, we estimate a six-factor arbitrage-free model of U.S. Treasury yields, financial corporate bond yields, and term interbank rates. This model can account for fluctuations in the term structure of credit and liquidity spreads observed in the data. A significant shift in model estimates after the announcement of the liquidity facilities suggests that these central bank actions did help lower the liquidity premium in term interbank rates.","[Christensen, Jens H.

For the quarterly time series total nights spent by residents and non-residents in Hotels; Holiday and other short-stay accommodation; camping grounds, recreational vehicle parks and trailer parks, we have focused on the analysis of the seasonality and a two years forecasting quarterly time series. The database covered the period between 2002 and 2013; data from some countries were not available or were partly available. The results have suggested that, across Europe, the number of trips by personal purpose is inversely proportional to the length of stay, and for professional purpose, the number of overnight stays +4 nights are approximately equal. In terms of nights spent in the accommodation establishments from Romania, by tourists from United States were the most numerous. Regarding seasonality analysis of the number of resident tourists staying in hotels, holiday and other short - stay accommodation, there were achieved positive averages of gross seasonal deviations for Germany, Italy, Romania and United Kingdom, and negative averages for Bulgaria and Austria. For non-residents, the analysis of seasonality in the same conditions as those indicated above, we have obtained positive results for all countries analyzed, except for Romania and the United Kingdom.","[Diniu, Toma Adrian; Vlad, Ionela Mituko; Stoian, Elena; Condei, Reta; Niculae, Ioana] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,,tomadinu@yahoo.fr; bmitsouko@yahoo.fr; stoian_ie@yahoo.com; r_condei@yahoo.com; iniculae2006@yahoo.fr,"Stoian, Elena/HTM-4209-2023; Condei, Reta/HZJ-0379-2023; Vlad, Ionela/AAT-5057-2021; NICULAE, IOANA/HWQ-4562-2023; Dinu, Toma Adrian/IQV-4799-2023; VLAD, Ionela Mituko/HHC-1979-2022","Stoian, Elena/0009-0001-6518-6649; Condei, Reta/0009-0009-5932-2024; Vlad, Ionela/0000-0002-2776-0419; NICULAE, IOANA/0009-0002-2976-5587; Dinu, Toma Adrian/0009-0005-0994-2867;",,,,,5,1,1,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,515,526,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100058,0

This paper studies the link between regional disparities and migration flows, focusing on the skill content of migration. Disparities may lead to migration, which should reduce them; but at the same time if migration is skill-selective, it may have an opposite effect and reinforce the richest regions. The object of this empirical analysis is Italy, a country where unskilled interregional migration flows were a large and very well-known phenomenon during the 1950s and 1970s, whilst in recent years, after three decades of very low labour mobility, thousands of Southern graduates have been moving to Northern regions. What is the economic impact of those flows of selective migration? Using data covering the period 1980-2001, it is found that although a slight process of convergence occurred between Italian regions, the loss of human capital in the South was detrimental to regional growth.","[Fratesi, Ugo] Politecn Milan, ABC, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, PAM, Milan, Italy; [Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, CERTeT, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Fratesi, U (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, ABC, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",ugo.fratesi@polimi.it; marco.percoco@unibocconi.it,"Fratesi, Ugo/IAM-5881-2023","Fratesi, Ugo/0000-0002-0755-460X",,,,,72,74,78,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, few studies have analyzed the specific conditions that gave rise to it. Further research is required into the specific factors determining the early appearance of criticism of the prevailing liberal oil regime during the formative years of Argentina's oil industry. In this paper, we propose to make a contribution in this regard, analyzing the period from the first direct state intervention in exploration to the emergence of YPF. We seek to identify the characteristics of the existing oil land regime, the relationship between the exploration and drilling sector and the domestic market, and the prospects for foreign private capital which entered the country in those years. Finally, we suggest that, given the particular oil structure in Argentina, the rise of YPF appeared as a necessary response to overcome the obstacles presented by the liberal regime of oil lands to achieve integration between upstream and downstream stages.","[German Dachevsky, Fernando] Fac Ciencias Sociales UBA, Inst Invest Gino Germani, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [German Dachevsky, Fernando] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Dachevsky, FG (通讯作者)，Fac Ciencias Sociales UBA, Inst Invest Gino Germani, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,,,,,,46,0,1,0,5,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,2385-3247,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Understanding these issues is necessary if optimal development of wind energy and transmission is to occur. This paper applies a model that integrates the special concerns of electricity generation to empirically consider the challenges of developing wind resources in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Given the lack the high frequency data needed to address the special problems of intermittency and congestion, our solution is to create a dispatch model of the region and to use simulations to generate the necessary data, then use this data to understand patterns that have occurred as wind resources have been developed. Our results indicate that the price effects caused by changes in power output at intermittent sources are strongly dependent on supply conditions and the presence of market distortions caused by transmission constraints. Peculiarities inherent in electric grid operation can cause system responses that are not always intuitive. The distribution of the rents accruing to wind generation, particularly in unexpectedly windy periods are strongly dependent on the allocation of transmission rights when congestion occurs, which impacts potential returns to developing wind resources. Incidents of congestion depend on the pace of development of wind and transmission capacity. Not accounting for such distortions may cause new investment to worsen market outcomes if mistaken estimates of benefits or costs lead to sub-optimal development of wind and transmission facilities.

Firms enjoyed great leeway in adapting rules to their needs. The corporation was especially flexible in this way. Spanish law also allowed firms to in effect create their own legal form. Until 1920, firms faced the choices typical of civil-law countries, namely, the corporation, and the ordinary or limited partnership. But the Spanish business code was explicitly open, allowing firms to do something else if they wished. This second type of flexibility reached its zenith in the Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (SRL), a form similar to Germany's GmbH or Britain's PLC. For its first decades the SRL was a creation of notaries and entrepreneurs, and was not written into Spanish law until 1953.

It is simple to use and significantly outperforms other financial and macroeconomic indicators in predicting recessions two to six quarters ahead. The steepness of the yield curve should be an excellent indicator of a possible future economic activity. A rise in the short rate tends to flatten the yield curve as well as to slow down real growth the near term. This paper aims to analyze the dependence between slope of the yield curve and an economic activity of France, Germany and Great Britain between the years 2000 and 2013. The slope of the yield curve can be measured as the yield spread between sovereign 10-year bonds and sovereign 3-month bonds. The natural and probably the most popular measure of economic growth is by GDP growth, taken quarterly. The results showed that the best predictive lag is a lag of five quarters. The theory says that it should be lag of four quarters. The results presented also confirm that 10-year and 3-month yield spread has significant predictive power for real GDP growth after financial crisis. These findings can be beneficial for investors and provide further evidence of the potential usefulness of the yield curve spreads as indicators of the future economic activity.","[Hvozdenska, Jana; Kajurova, Veronika] Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hvozdenska, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",174974@mail.muni.cz; vkajurova@seznam.cz,"Kajurova, Veronika/O-4739-2014; Hvozdenska, Jana/AAA-8859-2021","Hvozdenska, Jana/0000-0003-4379-7120",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,343,347,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900060,0

In absolute terms, however, the state was more present in the economy in 2011 than in 2000 or 1980; helping reduce inequality, meaning that the compensation effect may exist, despite the analysis showing an ambiguous result. The results are generally confirmed by the quantitative analysis, with multiple linear cross-sectional regressions and panel regression (with and without outliers) showing that indeed openness to trade, measured either through tariffs or through trade as share of GDP, is associated with a smaller state, with a (reliable) tariff coefficient. Our work in mainly conceived as a theoretical research grounded on statistical data. The conclusions of the case study point towards the existence of the efficiency effect, with growing trade associated with a smaller relative presence of the state in the economy.

It could be expected that various audiences watch TV at different times of the day/week. However, this assumption has not been confirmed. Only minor groups of commercials are usually aired in specific day/week times. This is caused by the fact that such commercials are aired only a few times a week (or even a year). The main (industry) groups of commercials have not shown any significant difference in the times that the commercials are broadcasted. The media market is on the edge of manageability and the Pressure on low CPP and bundling the advertising space causes unreasonable ineffectiveness when targeting suitable audiences.

The European Union and the United States aim ZEBs implementation to address 'peak oil' and environmental concerns. However, literature shows no agreement on a consensual definition of ZEB. Seeking a Brazilian ZEB definition, this paper addresses PassivHaus and thermal comfort standards for hot climates, source metrics for ZEB, Brazil's energy mix, residential energy end uses and Brazilian legal framework for residential photovoltaic (PV) generation. Internal Rate of Return for PV systems in two Brazilian cities is calculated under various scenarios. It shows grid parity was reached from April 2012 to November 2012 assuming residential electric tariffs of that period and the financial conditions given by the Brazilian government for the construction of new dams in the Amazon and the lowest rates offered by Brazilian banks to private individuals. Governmental decision to lower electric residential tariffs in November 2012 reduced the scope of grid parity. Later revocation of a tax exemption in April 2013 ended grid parity in Brazil. It concludes, conversely to developed countries, it is the volatile Brazilian energy policy, instead of economical barriers, the main obstacle for ZEB viability in Brazil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, CGE modelers have paid little attention to variations in input (i.e., policy changes or exogenous shocks). Recently, a few input-output studies consider sources of input variations, but focus on addressing a single source of variation and, therefore, ignore the interactions (and cumulative effects) among them. In this study, we propose methods for calculating the range (confidence intervals) of impacts from input variations within a CGE framework, explicitly accounting for multiple sources of input variations. To illustrate our approach, we use, as an example, recreational fisheries in Alaska, and estimate confidence intervals of economic impacts from regulatory changes. In doing so, we consider two important sources of input variation driving the impacts: (i) sample variation in recreational fishing-related expenditures, which is estimated using bootstrapping approach and (ii) stochastic variation from the parameters in the recreation demand model, which is estimated using a simulation-based approach. Results show that confidence bounds on total economic impacts calculated while only accounting for the first type of variation (sample variation) are much narrower than the confidence bounds on the impacts when we account for both sample and stochastic variation in model inputs.","[Seung, Chang K.; Lew, Daniel K.] NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Lew, Daniel K.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Seung, CK (通讯作者)，NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",Chang.Seung@noaa.gov; Dan.Lew@noaa.gov,"Lew, Daniel K./AAL-3013-2021","Lew, Daniel/0000-0002-3394-138X",,,,,24,6,6,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

We present a meta-analysis of 32 studies of the impacts of these interventions, conducted in the US or Canada. We find that methodological problems are common in the design of these studies, leading to artificially inflated results relative to what one would expect if the interventions were implemented in the general population. Particular problems include having volunteer participants who may have been especially motivated to reduce their electricity use, letting participants choose their preferred intervention, and having high attrition rates. Using estimates of bias from medical clinical trials as a guide, we recalculate impact estimates to adjust for bias, resulting in values that are often less than half of those reported in the reviewed studies. We estimate that in-home displays were the most effective intervention for reducing overall electricity use (similar to 4% using reported data; similar to 3% after adjusting for bias), while dynamic pricing significantly reduced peak demand (similar to 11% reported; similar to 6% adjusted), especially when used in conjunction with home automation (similar to 25% reported; similar to 14% adjusted). We conclude with recommendations that can improve pilot studies and the soundness of decisions based on their results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking a meso-level perspective and a network approach to governance, this paper sheds some new light on this issue, by focusing on the relation, channels of communication and interactions between low carbon community groups (LCCGs) and other actors. Based on data gathered from LCCGs in Oxfordshire, UK, via network survey and interviews the research maps the relations in terms of the exchanges of information and financial support, and presents a relation-based structure of local energy governance. Analysis reveals the intensity of energy related information exchanges that is taking place at the county level and highlights the centrality of intermediary organization in facilitating information flow. The analysis also identifies actors that are not very dominant in their amount of exchanges, but fill 'weak-tie' functions between otherwise disconnected LCCGs or other actors in the network. As an analytical tool the analysis could be useful for various state and non-state actors that want to better understand and support financially and otherwise actors that enable energy related local action.

We conduct financial modeling of actual renewable projects in India; and derive the following insights. First, the high cost of debt is the most pressing problem: higher cost and inferior terms of debt in India may raise the cost of renewable energy by 24-32% compared to the U.S. Second, even if cost of debt goes down, loan terms - including short tenors and variable interest rates - will become significant impediments, given that they add 13-14% to the cost of renewable energy in India compared to the U.S. Finally, due to the high cost of debt, policy lessons from the U.S. and Europe; which focus on finer instruments such as duration of revenue-support, revenue-certainty, investor-risk-perception, and completion/cost-certainty; are not likely to be as effective, with potential impacts on the cost of renewable energy in the 3-11% range. In fact, we find that an interest-rate subsidy, which reduces the cost of debt, reduces the overall subsidy burden by 13-16%. This suggests that Indian policymakers need to prioritize the provision of low-cost, long-term debt and take a closer look at the successful efforts by China and Brazil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A major concern is that biofuels reduce food security by increasing food prices. In this paper we use survey evidence to assess the impact of castor production on poor and food insecure rural households in Ethiopia. About 1/3 of poor farmers have allocated on average 15% of their land to the production of castor beans under contract in biofuel supply chains. Castor production significantly improves their food security: they have fewer months without food and the amount of food they consume increases. Castor cultivation is beneficial for participating households' food security in several ways: by generating cash income from castor contracts, they can store food for the lean season; castor beans preserve well on the field which allows sales when farmers are in need of cash (or food); spillover effects of castor contracts increases the productivity of food crops. Increased food crop productivity offsets the amount of land used for castor so that the total local food supply is not affected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that a generation mix comprising 49% hydro, 23% wind, 13% geothermal, 14% pumped hydro energy storage peaking plant, and 1% biomass-fuelled generation on an installed capacity basis, was capable of ensuring security of supply over an historic 6-year period, which included the driest hydrological year on record in New Zealand since 1931. Hydro spillage was minimised, or eliminated, by curtailing a proportion of geothermal generation. Wind spillage was substantially reduced by utilising surplus generation for peaking purposes, resulting in up to 99.8% utilisation of wind energy. Peaking requirements were satisfied using 1550 MW of pumped hydro energy storage generation, with a capacity factor of 0.76% and an upper reservoir storage equivalent to 8% of existing hydro storage capacity. It is proposed that alternative peaking options, including biomass-fuelled gas turbines and demand-side measures, should be considered. As a transitional policy, the use of fossil-gas-fuelled gas turbines for peaking would result in a 99.8% renewable system on an energy basis. Further research into whether a market-based system is capable of delivering such a renewable electricity system is suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Mason, I.

Current policy adopts a market-based model promoting rational choice and technological determinism as a solution to the environmental challenges of carbon emissions and energy reduction. We argue that this approach externalises professional actors' situated practices by singling out isolated factors impeding policy's rationale of implementing the Code (e.g. cost). Drawing on our empirical study we identify diverse practices that transpire from professional-technology interactions, demonstrating how sustainable technologies and professional practices are mutually shaped.

This study covers three main economic sectors in Pakistan namely agricultural, manufacturing and services sectors. Our cointegration results reveal that the variables are cointegrated at the aggregate and sectoral levels. At the aggregate level, we find that there is uni-directional Granger causality running from electricity consumption to real output in Pakistan. At the sectoral level, we find that electricity consumption Granger-causes real output in the manufacturing and services sectors. However, there is no causal relationship between electricity consumption and real output in the agricultural sector. The policy implication of these results is that electricity conservation policies in general would deteriorate the process of economic growth as well as the real output in the manufacturing and services sectors in Pakistan. Nevertheless, we suggest the Pakistani government to implement the electricity conservation policies merely to the agricultural sector because such policies may have less or no adverse impact on its real output.

As a result, improving efficiency has become a focus of attention, and recently a lot of time and effort has been expended to develop new energy efficiency methodologies and technologies. Considering the amount of focused attention, the rate of improvement has not been encouraging. Human behaviour is an important factor of the energy efficiency challenge, and research has revealed several consumer profiles with significantly different perceptions on energy issues. In this study, the focus is not on consumers but on energy efficiency professionals. A number of Finnish energy efficiency professionals from both the private and public sectors were surveyed revealing that experts have decidedly different perceptions regarding energy efficiency. Our analysis of survey results suggests that energy efficiency expertise comes from a variety of educational and professional backgrounds, and that instead of working on common ground, experts with differing perspectives are endeavouring to make progress in a complex and multifaceted arena. Focusing on specific areas in which players need to share a common understanding of terminology and where common and clearly stated goals can be established should result in an acceleration of efficiency improvement results.

Working closely with the Energy Saving Trust and energy suppliers, the aim is to develop a data framework to monitor changes in energy efficiency, develop and evaluate programmes and improve information available to consumers. Key applications of the framework are to understand trends in built stock energy use, identify drivers and evaluate the success of different policies. For energy suppliers, it could identify what energy uses are growing, in which sectors and why. This would help with market segmentation and the design of products. For building professionals, it could supplement energy audits and modelling of end-use consumption with real data and support the generation of accurate and comprehensive benchmarks. This paper critically examines the results of the first phase of work to construct a national energy efficiency data-framework for the domestic sector focusing on two specific issues: (a) drivers of domestic energy consumption in terms of the physical nature of the dwellings and socio-economic characteristics of occupants and (b) the impact of energy efficiency measures on energy consumption.

The methodology employed in this paper is based on the bivariate vector autoregression (VAR) and Granger causality tests. Moreover, the impulse response function and variance decomposition analysis are employed to trace the dynamic response paths of shocks to the system. The empirical analysis shows that, when it is allowed for any deterministic component in the data, total energy consumption and real GDP are not co-integrated in the period observed. Furthermore, there is a unidirectional causality running from total energy consumption to GDP, and an impulse response to GDP caused by energy consumption, being mainly embodied in the first years. The results indicate that total energy consumption is an important component determining economic growth in Croatia and that energy conservation policy should be formulated and implemented wisely. This paper also tests the causality between real GDP and consumption of the five energy variables by using the bivariate VAR. The main implication of these tests is that individual energy forms matter when it comes to energy policy formulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a genetic algorithm and an existing simulation tool to identify the lowest cost (investment and operating) scenarios of renewable technologies and locations for NEM regional hourly demand and observed weather in 2010 using projected technology costs for 2030. These scenarios maintain the NEM reliability standard, limit hydroelectricity generation to available rainfall, and limit bioenergy consumption. The lowest cost scenarios are dominated by wind power, with smaller contributions from photovoltaics and dispatchable generation: CST, hydro and gas turbines. The annual cost of a simplified transmission network to balance supply and demand across NEM regions is a small proportion of the annual cost of the generating system. Annual costs are compared with a scenario where fossil fuelled power stations in the NEM today are replaced with modern fossil substitutes at projected 2030 costs, and a carbon price is paid on all emissions. At moderate carbon prices, which appear required to address climate change, 100% renewable electricity would be cheaper on an annual basis than the replacement scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In most schemes the concept of life cycle costs (LCC) is used to guide setting the MEPS levels. Although a large body of literature shows that product cost is decreasing with increasing cumulative production, the experience curve, this is currently not used for setting MEPS. This article shows how to integrate the concept of the experience curve into LCC calculations for setting MEPS in the European Union and applies this to household laundry driers, refrigerator-freezers and televisions. The results indicate that for driers and refrigerator-freezers at least twice the energy savings compared to the current approach can be achieved. These products also show that energy label classes can successfully be used for setting MEPS. For televisions an experience curve is provided, showing a learning rate of 29%. However, television prices do not show a relation with energy efficiency but are to a large extent determined by the time the product is placed on the market. This suggests to policy makers that for televisions and other products with a short (re)design and market cycle timing is more important than the MEPS levels itself. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However current widely used generation scheduling model based on predefined production quota and tariff results in heavy energy consumption and severe environment pollution. From 2007, as concerns over energy shortage and environmental pollution, the Chinese authorities introduced the implementation of energy-saving generation dispatching model, which is an important approach to facilitating energy-saving and reduction of pollutant emission. The objective of implementing energy-saving generation dispatching model is to prioritize the use of renewable energy resources and new power plants with high efficiency without compromising power system security and reliability. This paper analyzes the necessity and feasibility of implementing energy-efficient and environmentally friendly generation scheduling models in China.

This paper focuses on the debate over the importance of infrastructure in the course of European integration. It aims to analyse whether the accessibility created by the improvement in the access to the transport network has any effect on European regional specialization levels within manufacturing. The results point to the conclusion that the higher the accessibility cost in a region, the higher its specialization level. In essence, those regional economies that are far (because of either an excessive time-cost access or a lower potential accessibility) need to be more specialized in one or a few manufacturing sectors than those other regional economies with lower accessibility costs.","[Mora, Toni] Univ Int Catalunya, Sch Econ & Social Sci, E-08017 Barcelona, Spain; [Mora, Toni] Barcelona Inst Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Moreno, Rosina] Univ Barcelona, Res Grp AQR IREA, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC); University of Barcelona,"Mora, T (通讯作者)，Univ Int Catalunya, Sch Econ & Social Sci, Immaculada 22, E-08017 Barcelona, Spain.",tmora@cir.uic.es; rmoreno@ub.edu,"Mora, Toni/I-4358-2012; Moreno, Rosina/D-4723-2014","Mora, Toni/0000-0002-2686-5307; Moreno, Rosina/0000-0002-3500-8622",,,,,36,4,4,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

To overcome the barriers, the potential of CDM to facilitate EEB promotion is then discussed. These barriers are verified and potential solutions are tested with a questionnaire survey conducted among five professional groups in China, i.e. designers, project managers, quantity surveyors, marketing managers and property managers. The results suggest that they generally identified with the barriers.

The GoB procures energy from generator companies through auctions of long-term energy contracts. After an auction, the winning generator companies sign contracts directly with distribution companies. In particular, the GoB runs two different auctions: one for energy from existing power plants (i.e., old energy) and another for energy from power plants that have not yet been built (i.e., new energy). This paper describes these auctions and compares the outcomes from the old and new energy auctions from 2004 to 2010 using final auction prices. The Brazilian case is particularly interesting, not only because energy is predominantly supplied by hydropower plants but also because new energy auctions reach prices below those for old energy. Therefore, it is likely that it is not necessary to run the two different energy auctions. As a secondary objective, this article analyze whether the Anglo-Dutch hybrid auction model is a better design for electricity procurement in Brazil. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that locational economies are important for aiding innovation, with firms in the North Staffordshire industrial district holding an inherent advantage vis-a-vis non-district firms. However, while close vertical ties enhance innovation, recent concerns have arisen that horizontal collaboration between district and Asian firms is having a detrimental impact upon innovative capacity within the district. Finally, institutions also appear to play an important role in facilitating the innovation process.","[Tomlinson, Philip R.] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Jackson, Ian] Staffordshire Univ, Sch Business, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DE, Staffs, England",University of Bath; Staffordshire University,"Tomlinson, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",P.R.Tomlinson@bath.ac.uk,"Jackson, Ian/HNP-0274-2023; Tomlinson, Philip/AFJ-1113-2022","Tomlinson, Philip/0000-0001-6292-3204",,,,,83,20,22,0,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

These pivotal suppliers are expected to sell at monopolistic prices on their portions of the market demand. In this paper, we show that these market conditions may imply the non-concavity in prices of the pivotal supply function, which in turn means that there can be situations in which a pivotal operator's supply has virtually no price limits. We also show that this monopolistic market power can be significantly reduced by vertical integration and/or regulatory policies such as virtual power plants. Based on these results, we propose a simple price-capping rule that induces the pivotal operator to compete for quantity instead of taking advantage of its monopoly. Then, we infer the profit function of the Italian pivotal operator (Enel) for the sample period 2007-2010 using real auction data and cost curves employed by engineers. We discuss the bidding behaviour of Enel and show how its profit function varies over time and in response to pro-competitive measures introduced during our sample period. We examine the existing price-cap and propose an alternative mechanism. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

New car CO2 emissions have not decreased at the expected levels because of negligible downsizing and increasing power of diesel cars. Interestingly, today there are relatively more models available with higher-than-average emission levels than in the late 1990s. We further constructed matched pairs of gasoline and diesel models in order to explore how their power and emissions ratio has evolved during the same decade. Results imply that German consumers may not have chosen to buy the diesel powered matched pair of a gasoline car they would have bought a few years earlier; instead they selected among the variety of diesel cars available in the market, and preferred a more powerful diesel car than what they might have bought otherwise. These findings reinforce the view that low-carbon transport policies must address the issue of changes in vehicle size and performance, which compromise the environmental effectiveness of regulations. In contrast to current EU regulations, CO2-related standards should discourage increases in a vehicle's weight and power. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, one of the main obstacles faced with upgrading existing urban systems to meet target energy reductions is the current rate of refurbishment and new build, where it is estimated that 75% of existing buildings will still be in place by 2050. Moreover limited renewable resources and predicted warming trends place further limitations on policies aimed at carbon management. This paper examines current thinking around energy management associated with building operational and regulated loads and the role of urban form. Its focus is on cooling loads for office buildings in central London and offers a new perspective on energy management at an urban scale by demonstrating (within the 25% redevelopment rate) that when building energy management is considered within an urban context, the overall performance of an urban system can be significantly improved. The work highlights the often overlooked role of urban form on building energy performance (both individually and in combination) and demonstrates that as we move towards a low energy future; the role of urban form becomes increasing significant.

J,"Goebel, C",,,,"Goebel, Christoph",,,On the business value of ICT-controlled plug-in electric vehicle charging in California,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Plug-in electric vehicles; Electricity markets; ICT business value,LOAD,"The increasing penetration of variable renewable energy, such as wind and solar, requires the deployment of large scale energy storage or dynamic demand side management. Leveraging the intrinsic energy storage potential of certain electric loads could be the key for an efficient transition to green power generation. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are about to be introduced on a large scale. In this paper, we investigate the savings potential of electricity retailers resulting from the ability to control the charging behavior of a fleet of PEVs using Information and Communication Technology (ICT). This savings potential is important as it could jumpstart the development of advanced control infrastructures for dynamic demand side management. The paper makes three major contributions: first, it applies a novel car usage model based on data from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). Second, it develops and evaluates several charging scheduling algorithms with low computational requirements. Third, it identifies several key parameters influencing the relative and absolute savings potential of ICT-controlled PEV charging. We obtain a relative savings potential of up to 45%. The absolute yearly savings per PEV, however, are rather small, which could limit the economic incentives of electricity retailers to deploy the required infrastruaute.

The decision to liberalise energy markets has far-reaching consequences not only for gas companies, but also for the rest of the real economy in view of the fact that natural gas is being used as an important primary energy source in several sectors of production and in the power industry. We aim to answer how liberalisation/unbundling has influenced gas pricing/prices in the Czech Republic. We investigate the individual components of end-customer gas prices according to the value chain and we define and structure the drivers of these components. We use a case study from the Czech Republic, one of the Central and Eastern European countries, which, contrary to the old Member States, is buying most of its gas from one supplier (high import dependence and low supply diversity) and where the transmission and distribution network is characterised by a sufficient contractual and physical capacity. We stress that next to basic conditions on the European gas market (import dependency on external gas producers) legal and institutional conditions and the initial market structure of each Member State are also important for the results of the liberalisation.

Integrative retrofits required by the newer building energy standard produced significant heating-energy savings (i.e., 53%) when compared with baseline buildings commonly built in early 1980s. Taking into account district-heating-system upgrades as part of integrative retrofit measures, a representative apartment building was 66% more efficient than the baseline building. Contrary to expectation, little behavioral change was found in response to the provisions of monetary incentive, billing-method reform, or metering of heating energy use in individual apartment units. Yet this paper identified sizable energy savings potential if occupants' behavioral changes were to actually happen. This indicates that provisions of financial incentives or individual metering were insufficient for triggering substantial behavioral changes leading toward more energy savings in the current buildings. It is recommended that innovative energy policies, technology upgrades, and education would be needed to promote behavioral changes toward additional energy savings. Finally, measures and strategies to further enhance thermal integrity criteria (e.g., insulations of roof and balcony) are recommended in China's future building energy policy reforms.

We begin by describing how limited liability leads to risk-loving behaviour in nuclear power companies and unsafe nuclear power reactors. By reviewing current regulatory regimes, we show that this issue is not being sufficiently addressed today. Therefore, we evaluate five regulatory instruments: (1) safety regulation, (2) minimum equity requirements, (3) mandatory insurance, (4) risk-sharing pools, and (5) catastrophe bonds. We conclude that any of these instruments either cannot be recommended in its pure form or is infeasible in reality. We therefore propose a new approach that, in its core, consists of a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, capital markets assess the risk stemming from each nuclear reactor via catastrophe bonds. In the second step, the regulator uses this private risk assessment and intervenes by charging an actuarially fair premium in the form of a Pigouvian risk tax. Society ultimately acts as an explicit insurer for nuclear risk and is, on average, fairly compensated for the risk it is taking over. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analyses are based on cross-sectional data from SMEs which participated in a German energy audit program between 2008 and 2010. In general, our findings appear robust to alternative model specifications and are consistent with the theoretical and still scarce empirical literature on barriers to energy-efficiency in SMEs. More specifically, high investment costs, which are captured by subjective and objective proxies, appear to impede the adoption of energy-efficiency measures, even if these measures are deemed profitable. Similarly, we find that lack of capital slows the adoption of energy-efficiency measures, primarily for larger investments. Hence, investment subsidies or soft loans (for larger investments) may help accelerating the diffusion of energy-efficiency measures in SMEs. Other barriers were not found to be statistically significant. Finally, our findings provide evidence that the quality of energy audits affects the adoption of energy-efficiency measures. Hence, effective regulation should involve quality standards for energy audits, templates for audit reports or mandatory monitoring of energy audits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike other works, we take into account the population and economic size of each region in the analysis as well as the spatial dimension in the convergence process. Our results indicate that un-weighted analysis provide a limited information of the convergence behaviour, since the weighted analysis matter in that process. Besides, although the multimodality prevails in all the analysis made, we find that convergence in labour productivity is mainly driven by capital intensity. In addition, it is also observed two distinctive clubs in the distribution of TFP that may account for the different speed of regional development in China. These results suggest the need to promote further economic policies in the Chinese economy.","Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Herrerías, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",herreria@eco.uji.es,,,,,,,61,11,15,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

European gas markets have radically changed. In order to build a single European gas market, a new regulatory framework has been established through three European Gas Directives. The purpose of this article is to investigate the impact of the reforms in the natural gas industry on consumer prices, with a specific focus on gas prices for industrial use. The strength of the relationship between the industrial gas prices of six western European countries is studied by testing the Law of One Price for the period 1991-2009. Estimations were carried out using both cointegration analysis and time-varying parameter models. Results highlight an emerging and on-going process of convergence between the industrial gas prices in western Europe since 2001 for the six EU member states. The strength and the level of convergence differ widely between countries. Strong integration of gas markets in continental Europe, except for the Belgian market, has been established. It appears that the convergence process between continental countries and the UK is not completed. Thus, the integration of European gas markets remains an open issue and the question of how far integration will proceed will still be widely discussed in the coming years. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It presents the definition and model results for a set of mitigation scenarios for Germany that achieve 85% CO2 emission reduction in 2050 relative to 1990. During consecutive dialogues, civil society stakeholders from the transport and electricity sector framed the definition of boundary conditions for the energy-economy model REMIND-D and evaluated the scenarios with regard to plausibility and social acceptance implications. Even though the limited scope of this research impedes inferential conclusions on the German energy transition as a whole, it demonstrates that the technological solutions to the mitigation problem proposed by the model give rise to significant societal and political implications that deem at least as challenging as the mere engineering aspects of innovative technologies. These insights underline the importance of comprehending mitigation of energy-related CO2 emissions as a socio-technical transition embedded in a political context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This growth was greatly enabled by the renewable energy policy framework created by its landmark Renewable Energy Law, passed in 2005 and amended in 2009, which established key policies including: national renewable energy targets; a mandatory connection and purchase policy; a national feed-in tariff system; and arrangements for cost-sharing and funding of renewable energy incentives. This paper describes the mechanisms established by the Renewable Energy Law and its implementing regulations, as well as the challenges China continues to face in improving its renewable energy policy framework to improve integration and utilization of renewable energy sources. It also provides a comparison of the Chinese renewable energy policy framework with those in the European Union and United States. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for improving implementation of the Renewable Energy Law, with regard to implementing a renewable power quota system and priority dispatch policy, developing technical standards for connection of renewable resources with the grid, development of a more advanced feed-in tariff system, and central-local coordination of renewable energy development.

GHG reduction potential depends on vehicle design, adoption, driving and charging patterns, charging infrastructure, and electricity generation mix. We construct an optimization model to study these factors by determining optimal design of conventional vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with optimal allocation of vehicle designs and dedicated workplace charging infrastructure in the fleet for minimum life cycle cost or GHG emissions over a range of scenarios. We focus on vehicles with similar body size and acceleration to a Toyota Prius under government 5-cycle driving conditions. We find that under the current US grid mix, PHEVs offer only small GHG emissions reductions compared to HEVs, and workplace charging is insignificant. With grid decarbonization, PHEVs and BEVs offer substantial GHG emissions reductions, and workplace charging provides additional benefits. HEVs are optimal or near-optimal for minimum cost in most scenarios. High gas prices and low vehicle and battery costs are the major drivers for PHEVs and BEVs to enter and dominate the cost-optimal fleet. Carbon prices have little effect. Cost and range restrictions limit penetration of BEVs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
