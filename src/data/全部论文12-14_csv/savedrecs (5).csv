In equilibrium, some citizens ignore their private information and abstain from voting, in deference to those with higher-quality signals. Even as the number of highly informed peers grows large, however, citizens with only moderate expertise continue voting, so that voter participation remains at realistic levels (e.g. 50 to 60 percent, for simple examples). The precise level of voter turnout, along with the margin of victory, are determined by the distribution of expertise. Improving a voter's information makes her more willing to vote, consistent with a growing body of empirical evidence, but makes her peers more willing to abstain, providing a new explanation for various empirical patterns of voting. Equilibrium participation is optimal, even though the marginal voter may have very little (e.g. below-average) expertise, and even though nonvoters' information is not utilized.","Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"McMurray, JC (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",,,,,,,,76,32,37,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The author pays special attention to the importance of promotion, which in the context of ongoing trade liberalisation and increasing competition in the international market becomes a powerful tool for influencing the maintenance and development of agri-food production. Undoubtedly, the membership in European structures has had a positive effect on the activity of Polish food producers and exporters in the field of implementation of measures to promote their sales (through participating in the mechanisms of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy). In the first years of functioning in the common market, the level of interest in running foreign campaigns was low. However, in subsequent period, the situation has changed. Domestic food producers' interest in participating in food quality schemes set out in the Rural Development Programme also grows. It offers the possibility of obtaining financial support from the EU for promotional and informational activities. In addition, domestic Promotion Funds, established following the EU's example, facilitate the implementation of highly cost-intensive, large-scale and long-term actions.","[Michalczyk, Joanna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Int Econ Relat, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Michalczyk, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Int Econ Relat, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",joanna.michalczyk@ue.wroc.pl,"Michalczyk, Joanna/P-2753-2018","Michalczyk, Joanna/0000-0002-4333-0566",,,,,7,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-248-3095-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,227,234,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393737200022,0

(2010) and Broda and Weinstein (2010) shows that a significant share of product creation and destruction in U.S. industries occurs within existing firms and accounts for an important share of aggregate output. In the present paper, and consistent with this evidence, we relax the standard assumption of mono-product firms in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. Our analysis is based on a model of firm dynamics with two deviations from the conventional real business cycle framework-imperfect competition with endogenous entry and multi-product firms. The combination of these two features enables our model to successfully generate a mechanism that accounts for the strong procyclicality of product creation. Due to the proliferation effect induced by firm-level adjustments in product scope, we show that our model embodies a quantitatively important magnification mechanism of aggregate shocks.

Five institutional spheres are introduced which are in need of systemic change, due to the entrenched contradictions and problems which the current set of institutions generate.

We show that part of what is conventionally regarded as the market price of risk in electricity is actually that of its underlying fuel commodity, gas; that market power has a double effect on prices, insofar as it increases spot prices and induces a forward premium; that oil price sentiment spills over and that the premium reacts to scarcity and the higher moments of spot price uncertainty.

Saving rates then vary discontinuously with asset level, generating a poverty trap and divergence in incomes. An increase in the likelihood of surviving raises aggregate saving. A more equitable distribution of assets can be consistent with greater aggregate savings and growth because of declining marginal propensity to save over some asset intervals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we revisit the rationale for delegation to a weight-conservative central banker when the social planner's knowledge about the true preferences of delegates is ex ante ambiguous and he exhibits a preference for robustness. In this context, a robust (worst-case oriented) delegation strategy is intended to minimize the maximum welfare loss over the uncertainty set, when no prior probability distribution for the preference bias is available. We find that both effective over- and underconservatism may emerge with respect to the certainty case, for robust delegation is shown to be model-dependent. Most importantly, under reasonable model's parameterizations, Rogoff's principle is reversed: it is optimal for society to appoint a weight-liberal central banker. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Varieties produced at a lower cost (a) are imported at lower absolute demand elasticities and (b) earn higher revenues. By virtue of larger demand elasticities, low revenue varieties benefit the most from tariff liberalization. Further, if varieties are substitutable, low revenue varieties benefit at the expense of high revenue varieties. These predictions are confirmed using a case study of US Uruguay Round ad-valorem tariff cuts, where within exporter-industry groups, low revenue varieties experienced large gains, and high revenue varieties experienced negligible gains. Further, I find evidence suggesting that these effects were also relevant for other trade shocks, such as exchange rates and specific tariffs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Additional evidence shows that there is a huge inconsistency between the phase-difference of the return series of oil price and industrial production at the 12-16 month frequency bands but at the 16-24 month frequency bands, we find that oil price changes that have occurred during 1982-2009 were demand-driven. In a nutshell our results suggest that oil price changes that have occurred after 1994 were demand-driven and the volatility of the inflation rate started to decrease after the 1990s but the volatility of the industrial output growth rate started to decrease after the 2000s.

But no empirical studies exist to link the two phenomena. We applied our model to a set of football coaches, football being an industry that produces outlying incomes. We estimated the relation between a set of intellectual capital characteristics of those coaches and their incomes. We found that indeed, IC explains almost two thirds (63%) of the evolution of the very big salaries of those very rich people. Even if those results are interesting, and give an indication of the influence of IC in the success of rich people, they are only limited to a small sample of persons. Anyway, from our research we may infer that IC (social capital, human capital, and structural capital) plays a major role in defining the wealth of the top earners in the world. From this we may conclude that a policy of inequality reduction should take into account that intangible assets are at the base of those persons wealth.

The main findings are: i) An increase in heterogeneity in investors' beliefs results in an increased likelihood of equity issuance over debt when public signal is favorable, whereas it results in a reduced likelihood when public signal is modestly adverse. ii) The tightness of short sale constraints has a positive effect on the likelihood of equity issuance only when public signal is highly favorable.

While intellectual capital (IC) and emerging technologies are linked in the working population, this connection has not been widely used with the elderly. The goal of creating this connection in the frail elderly is to create means for meaningful actions and possibilities to act as equal citizens. It is important that the resources and independent initiative of older people are stressed. If the functional capacity of older people is supported at the right time and in the right place, it is preventive, cost-effective and productive. Finding ways of using digital media to build intellectual capital in the elderly in nursing homes becomes the challenge. A grounded theory linking vernacular creativity, folk art and well being using an iPad was developed during a college supported 3 year educational action learning project at a large, metropolitan nursing home. The project determined usability of an iPad and investigated preferences of over 135 residents for content collections of photographs, music playlists, e-books, as well as use of e-mail, search engines, video sharing websites (Youtube) and video and voice-over-Internet software (Skype). Approximated 60 college students in 5 different courses participated in some segment of this iterative project. Project start-end dates coincided with those of the college level service learning course and learning outcomes were defined in the syllabus. The touch pad features of an iPad present an opportunity to provide previously unavailable resources to frail residents in a nursing home. Computer technology can be a cost-effective way to engage individuals in self-selected creative activities that, when viewed as folk art, support feelings of wellbeing and build intellectual capital. Examples of vernacular creativity and folk art include decorated eggs, road side memorials to car victims, homemade shrines to Elvis and Di, photos and photo albums. Folk art is a matter of communication of creativity, not an abstract aesthetic value. Computer technology is a new artistic, creative tool much like the Kodak camera was at its inception. In 2006 Apple marketed the iPad and promised users access to creativity through software and effortless usability in hardware. Apple forged a campaign to blend ordinariness, creativity and technology in the iPad. The iPad's lightweight, touch screen technology and graphic user interface provides long-term care residents with an opportunity to be creative and share that creativity. The use of technology in problem based learning in a college academic service learning course enables the community to become co-educators and supports students by providing them with professional skills. It also recognizes community voices in defining needs, faculty expertise in developing projects to address defined needs, uses students' voices in implementing community learning projects, and builds intellectual capacity by introducing technology as a creative tool that produces a feeling of well-being to physically infirm residents in long term care and builds intellectual capital.","Berkeley Coll, New York, NY 10017 USA",,"Zanetich, J (通讯作者)，Berkeley Coll, New York, NY 10017 USA.",jtz@berkeleycollege.edu,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,13,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,471,476,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000054,0

This study hypothesizes that privatization and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow are the two key factors in this process. We focus on identifying the exact, specific and detailed mechanisms of privatization and FDI inflow in promoting economic growth, especially from the provincial level. Then using a panel data covering 31 provinces of Chinese mainland over 1978-2008, we find statistically significant evidence to support our hypotheses.

The direction of the relationship between individual risk attitudes and type of university degree chosen is potentially ambiguous. On the one hand, risk averse individuals may prefer degree courses which allow high returns in the labour market; on the other hand, if these degrees expose students to a higher probability of dropping out, those who are more risk averse may be induced to choose less challenging fields. Using data from a sample of students enrolled at a middle-sized Italian public university in 2009, we find that, controlling for a large number of individual characteristics, more risk averse students are more likely to choose any other field (Humanities, Engineering, and Sciences) rather than Social Sciences. We interpret this result bearing in mind that some of these fields, such as Humanities, involve a reduction in the risk of dropping out, while others (such as Engineering and Sciences) involve a lower risk in the labour market. It also emerges that the effect of risk aversion on degree choice is related to student ability. Risk averse students characterized by high abilities tend to prefer Engineering, while the propensity of risk averse students to enrol in Humanities decreases when ability increases, suggesting that the attention paid to labour market risks and drop-out risk varies according to student skills.","[De Paola, Maria; Gioia, Francesca] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria,"De Paola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",m.depaola@unical.it,,"DE PAOLA, Maria/0000-0002-1704-4136",,,,,19,15,18,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

But we also find that for-profit students end up with higher unemployment and idleness rates and lower earnings six years after entering programs than do comparable students from other schools and that, not surprisingly, they have far greater default rates on their loans.","[Deming, David J.] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Katz, Lawrence F.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Deming, DJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",david_deming@gse.harvard.edu; cgoldin@harvard.edu; lkatz@harvard.edu,,,,,,,24,164,310,4,38,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Contrary to the general belief about the ad-valorem tariff being superior under various imperfectly competitive market settings, it is shown that the specific tariff generates more welfare under monopolistic competition. We argue that this result is not general. If we follow the empirical evidence that firms use variable mark-ups and use a utility function that allows for it, we find that the ad-valorem tariff is more efficient when consumers' love for variety is low. The relative efficiency overturns to the specific tariff as consumers' love for variety increases. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The equilibrium growth rate is solved analytically, and conditions for the introduction of a progressive income tax in an economy with an existing proportional tax to reduce the equilibrium growth rate are obtained. The model is numerically illustrated after calibrating its parameters to mimic some basic features of the US economy to quantify the effects of progressivity changes. It is found that higher levels of progressivity lead to lower equilibrium growth rates. The effects on after-tax income inequality and in individual welfare, however, strongly depend on the specific assumptions made about labor supply by old individuals and the specific income tax design.

In this paper, we apply a novel index number decomposition technique to the results of a multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium model to quantify the influence of five factors on the growth of future carbon emissions: (1) growth in global economic activity; (2) shifts in the regional composition of gross world product; (3) shifts in the sectoral composition of regions' GDP; (4) changes in sectors' energy-output ratios; and (5) changes in the CO2 intensity of energy sources. We elucidate how the relative importance of these factors changes in response to the imposition of a global carbon tax and alternative assumptions about the future availability of key energy supply technologies. Rising global economic activity and shifts in regional composition put upward pressure on emissions while changes in energy and emission intensity and the sectoral output mix have attenuating effects. A global emission tax that increases over time slows economic expansion and shifts the fuel mix, with the most pronounced impacts on China, India, and Russia. Limited availability of carbon capture and storage, nuclear, and hydroelectric generation all lead to upward shifts in the long-run marginal abatement cost curve, causing some countries to choose to pay the tax rather than abate.

Furthermore, moving from having a short-term contract or no contract to having a long-term contract significantly increased one's odds of having social insurance, whereas losing a long-term contract reduced the likelihood of having social insurance.

The paper decomposes this total value into two components: redistributive value, which is due to predictable changes in income (and family circumstances), and insurance value, which occurs when taxes and transfers compensate for unexpected income shocks. Our approach is a forward-looking one, where we examine income and transfers net of taxes over a 10-year period. We model state taxes (personal income taxes, the EITC, and sales taxes) and state means-tested transfers (AFDC/TANF and Medicaid/SCHIP). The calculations are made using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and allow for analysis of the role of changes in tax-and-transfer programs, demographics, and income in the value of state net benefits over a period of more than 30 years. We find that the redistributive value of state tax-and-transfer programs sharply declines with income, but that the insurance value is increasing in income. The resulting total value still declines with income, but not nearly as sharply as the redistributive value-Hence, the insurance value mitigates the incentives for mobility that would undo state redistributive spending.

In general, no ordinally invariant bargaining rule satisfies the other three axioms of Nash. Parallel to Roth (J Econ Theory 16:247-251, 1977), we introduce a weaker independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) axiom that we argue is better suited for ordinally invariant bargaining rules.

As a first step towards understanding the prevalence of self-employment in South Korea, we structurally estimate risk aversion parameters based on the standard expected utility theory. We use hypothetical lottery questions from a large-scale longitudinal survey (the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study) conducted in two waves to a sample of approximately 8,000 individuals. The estimation results show that the constant relative risk aversion parameter ranges from 0.6 to 0.8: male, younger, less educated, unmarried and higher income individuals are less risk averse. Erroneous responses are more likely for male, younger, more educated and poorer respondents. We also find significant impact of responses to the hypothetical questions on self-employment, which suggests that our estimates for risk preferences are likely predictive of actual choice of self-employment.","[Kim, Young-Il; Lee, Jungmin] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea; [Lee, Jungmin] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Sogang University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea.",yakim@sogang.ac.kr; jlee.fiu@gmail.com,"lee, jungmin/IXW-6580-2023",,,,,,34,13,15,0,22,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

In this paper, we take two structural vector-auto-regression (SVAR) approaches to answer this question. First, we quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of news shocks among candidate shocks, estimating a structural vector-error-correction model (SVECM). Our estimated results suggest that the contribution of the TFP news shocks is nonnegligible, which is in line with the findings of previous works. Furthermore, we disentangle the source of news shocks by adopting several kinds of restrictions and find that news shocks on investment-specific technology (IST) also have an important effect. Second, to minimize the gap between the SVAR approach and the Bayesian estimation of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, we adopt an alternative approach: SVAR with sign restrictions. The SVAR with sign restrictions reconfirms the results that the news shocks are important in explaining the Japanese macroeconomic fluctuations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper argues that Thorstein Veblen's socio-economic theory - in particular his conceptions of capital, technological knowledge and institutional change - offers a fruitful framework to analyze the emergence of free software as an economic and social phenomenon. From the Veblenian perspective, the free software movement argues that the technological knowledge in the software industry should freely be available to society as a part of its common stock of knowledge. In other words, they are against the use of copyright law as a predatory strategy by software corporations, while the current technological conditions in the software industry allow for an institutional arrangement of production and innovation based on cooperative habits of thought.","Isik Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Isik University,"Kologlugil, S (通讯作者)，Isik Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",,,,,,,,59,5,6,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We assume that the corporate tax rate in the host country, where MNFs undertake foreign direct investment to locate their manufacturing divisions, is lower than that in the home country. Our conclusion is that the tax authorities of the home country should not always force MNFs to hold down the transfer price through a too strict audit standard if it aims to maximize social welfare of the country in the long-run equilibrium. This result implies that tax authorities face a trade-off between consumer welfare and tax revenue when determining the standard price used for auditing. One notable implication is that the tax authorities should raise the upper-limit price allowed for internal transfers as the elasticity of substitution between brands for consumers decreases.","[Matsui, Kenji] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Kobe University,"Matsui, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodaicho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",kmatsui@b.kobe-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,40,5,5,0,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

J,"McKibbin, WJ; Stoeckel, AB",,,,"McKibbin, Warwick J.; Stoeckel, Andrew B.",,,Global Fiscal Consolidation,ASIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The buildup in government debt in response to the great recession, has raised a number of policy dilemmas for individual countries as well as the world as a whole. The recent need for a change of fiscal policy stance has fuelled debates about the impact of fiscal consolidation on domestic economies that are tightening, the flow-on effects to the world economy, and also about how much tightening there should be and how quickly it should happen. This paper explores these issues in a global framework focusing on the national and global consequences of coordinated fiscal consolidation. It explores the implications this fiscal adjustment might have on country risk premia and what happens if all countries coordinate their fiscal adjustment except the United States. A coordinated fiscal consolidation in the industrial world that is not accompanied by U.S. actions is likely to lead to a substantial worsening of trade imbalances globally as the release of capital in fiscally contracting economies flows into the U.S. economy, appreciates the U.S. dollar, and worsens the current account position of the United States. The scale of this change is likely to be sufficient to substantially increase the probability of a trade war between the United States and other economies. To avoid this outcome, a coordinated fiscal adjustment is clearly in the interest of the global economy","[McKibbin, Warwick J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, ANU Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [McKibbin, Warwick J.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Stoeckel, Andrew B.] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, ANU Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University; Brookings Institution; Australian National University,"McKibbin, WJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, ANU Coll Business & Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",warwick.mckibbin@anu.edu.au; abstoeckel@gmail.com,"McKibbin, Warwick J/A-4919-2008","McKibbin, Warwick J/0000-0002-1604-1021",,,,,14,3,3,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1535-3516,,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

This paper argues that this change arose at least in part because of a shift in the type of regulation used at the federal level, from command-and-control regulation toward more incentive-based regulation. Under an incentive-based federal regulation, a state imposing a tighter regulation will bear only part Of the additional cost, and thus ha more incentive to tighten regulation than it does under federal command-and-control. This difference helps to explain observed patterns of regulation. In addition, it has implications for the choice of regulatory instruments. For a pollutant that causes both local and spillover damage, a federal pollution tax is likely to yield a more efficient outcome than federal command-and-control policy or a federal system of tradable permits.

We modify the standard Nash demand game so that incompatible demands do not necessarily lead to the disagreement outcome. Rather, with exogenous probability q, one bargainer receives his/her demand, with the other getting the remainder. We use an asymmetric bargaining set (favouring one bargainer) and disagreement payoffs of zero, and we vary q over several values. Our results mostly support game theory's directional predictions. As with conventional arbitration, we observe a strong chilling effect on bargaining for q near one: extreme demands and low agreement rates. Increasing q reinforces the game's built-in asymmetry - giving the favoured player an increasingly large share of payoffs - but also raising efficiency. These effects are non-uniform: over sizable ranges, increases in q have minimal effect, but for some q, small additional increases lead to sharp changes in results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

If prices are regulated, profit constraints can improve welfare and be a complement or substitute to a higher regulated price, depending on the degree of altruism. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, employing intermediaries is not worthwhile for traders who benefit little from trade. Together, these decisions amount to non-monotone participation choices in intermediation: only traders of middle type employ intermediaries, while the rest, the high and the low types, prefer to search for a trading partner directly. We provide a theoretical foundation for this, hitherto unexplained, phenomenon. We build a dynamic matching model, where a trader's equilibrium bargaining share is a convex increasing function of her type.

There are also seasonal patterns in the short term trade tax payment. The results point to some scope to harness the benefits associated with trade policy reform without having to worry a lot about its effects on trade (and overall) tax revenue.

In particular, a situation is discussed in which the firms do not know the exact distribution of the random location of consumer demand and its responsiveness to price changes (measured by the scale of transport costs), but resolve the resulting ambiguity using the alpha-maxmin or minimax regret criteria. When the firms are sufficiently pessimistic (a is high enough), results are in contrast with the existing literature. In particular, an increase of demand location uncertainty decreases the equilibrium product differentiation, intensifying the second-stage competition in prices, although the effect is dampened by uncertainty about transport costs. Endogenizing the choice of objective function leads to the dominance of an extreme form of pessimism, which turns out to be socially-optimal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that only the dominant manufacturer can necessarily benefit from the wholesale price dominance strategy. Furthermore, both dominant manufacturer and retailer can benefit from the channel dominance strategy, and consumers can also benefit from it. The channel dominance strategy, however, is not always the optimal choice for the dominant manufacturer. Whatever dominance strategy is it, the weak manufacturer will suffer loss, but in the channel dominance strategy, the market share proportion of the weak manufacturer will increase under certain circumstances.

The move is significant, but the success of this new growth strategy depends critically on the level of domestic market integrations.

We find evidence of border effects at both national and regional levels with significant regional differences, but they are smaller than some earlier studies suggest. Income growth, lower transportation costs, and higher intra-industry trade all have positive effects on China's regional trade. Among the factors affecting regional trade, a better business environment has the largest positive impact on lifting China's domestic trade between regions, especially in intermediate goods, suggesting that improving business environment should be the priority of government at all levels in China.","[Xu, Zhenhui] Georgia Coll & State Univ, Coll Business, Milledgeville, GA 31061 USA; [Fan, Jianyong] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University System of Georgia; Georgia College & State University; Fudan University,"Xu, ZH (通讯作者)，Georgia Coll & State Univ, Coll Business, Milledgeville, GA 31061 USA.",zhenhui.xu@gcsu.edu; jianyongfan@fudan.edu.cn,,,,,,,36,12,12,1,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This paper examined the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in the regional and sectoral aspects by adopting provincial panel data in China from 1995 to 2008. The results indicate that economic growth causes more energy consumption in China not only at the national level but also at the regional and sectoral levels. Then the Eastern Region and the industrial sector show results quite similar to that of the whole country, in which a bidirectional causality relationship exists between energy consumption and economic growth. The implication for energy policies in China is that the Eastern Region and the industrial sector should play a leading role in the adjustment of energy consumption patterns and the transformation of the economy structure. Energy prices have limited effects on energy consumption but do have effects on economic growth because the energy price mechanism is more government-oriented than market-oriented in China.

The introduction of undesirable fiscal outcomes into this assessment makes it possible to identify meaningful and informative characteristics of local public finance performance in China. When reforms are first implemented, local public financial performance improves because undesirable fiscal phenomena have not yet become too serious. The tax sharing system reform did not work well in its early stages, and negatively impacted public expenditure efficiency. The reform started to play a substantial role between 2001 and 2005, when local governments experienced better public finance performance. Corresponding to the deterioration of the financial sector in recent years, local public financial performance worsened after 2007. Further reform of the current fiscal and taxation system is necessary in China, to ensure a brighter future for the nation.","[Zhang, Shujian] Georgetown Univ, Publ Policy Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Zhang, Jun; Chen, Shiyi] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Georgetown University; Fudan University,"Chen, SY (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Publ Policy Inst, Washington, DC USA.",sz311@georgetown.edu; junzh_2000@fudan.edu.cn; shiyichen@fudan.edu.cn,,,,,,,35,3,3,1,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2012,20.0,6,,,,,82,101,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.12003.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,051RZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312146300004,0

We broaden the analysis of relative (in)flexibility in labour costs by investigating the use of other margins of labour cost adjustment at the firm level beyond base wages. Using data from a unique survey, we find that European firms make extensive use of other components of compensation to adjust the cost of labour. Interestingly, firms facing base wage rigidity are more likely to use alternative margins of labour cost adjustment; therefore there appears to be some degree of substitutability between wage flexibility and the flexibility of other cost components. Changes in bonuses and non-pay benefits are some of the potential margins firms use to reduce costs. We also show how the margins of adjustment chosen are affected by unionisation and firm and worker characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

First, we derive theoretically that globalization's influence on education expenditures depends on the type of government. For benevolent governments, the model suggests that expenditures for higher education will increase and expenditures for basic education will decline with deepening economic integration. For Leviathan governments, on the other hand, the effects of globalization on public education spending cannot be unambiguously predicted. In the second part of the paper, we empirically analyze globalization's influence on primary, secondary, and tertiary education expenditures with panel data covering 104 countries over the 1992-2006 period.

However, their existence also has an economic effect. For instance, we find that the profit of a monopolistic firm will increase as a result of selling the refill packs when the depreciation rate of the durable good is low. In an extension of the model, we point out that there is an entrant that competes with the incumbent in relation to the composite goods and the refill packs. In order to compete in terms of the prices of the composite goods, the incumbent sells the refill packs not only to increase profit, but also to reduce the amount of waste resulting from the durable goods. As for competing in regard to the prices of the refill packs, if the cost of the composite goods is small, then the incumbent's profit from selling the composite goods will increase. By comparing two extensions of the model, we find that the environmental effect of the price competition in regard to the refill packs is greater than the environmental effect of the price competition in relation to the composite goods.","[Chang, Ming-Chung] Kainan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Luchu 338, Taoyuan Country, Taiwan; [Hu, Jin-Li] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lee, Mei-Yu] Yuanpei Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",Nan Kai University Technology; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Chang, MC (通讯作者)，Kainan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 1 Kainan Rd, Luchu 338, Taoyuan Country, Taiwan.",changmc@mail.knu.edu.tw,"Hu, Jin-Li/S-6534-2019; Chang, Ming-Chung/AAY-2919-2021","Hu, Jin-Li/0000-0002-7337-2935; Chang, Ming-Chung/0000-0001-9249-0489",,,,,16,1,1,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Despite the n + 1 stocks in the model, the analysis is tractable and the symmetric Markov perfect equilibrium unique. If only the contribution levels are contractible, then investments are suboptimally small if the contract is short term or close to its expiration date. To encourage investments, the optimal contract is more ambitious if it is short term, and it is tougher to satisfy close to its expiration date and for players with small investment costs. If renegotiation is possible, such an incomplete contract implements the first-best. The framework helps to analyse emissions, investments, and international environmental agreements, and the results have important lessons for how to design a climate treaty.","[Harstad, Bard] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Harstad, Bard] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Harstad, Bard] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; University of Oslo; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Harstad, B (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,45,69,75,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Zivot and Andrews (1992) [Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 10.251-270] proposed using the infimum of t-ratio Dickey-Fuller statistics across all candidate break points in a trimmed range, however this procedure can have an asymptotic size of one when a break occurs under the unit root null. We show that if the same approach is used, but instead with coefficient Dickey-Fuller statistics in an additive outlier framework, the test is asymptotically conservative when a break is present under the null, provided the degree of trimming is appropriately controlled. The test is also shown to have superior local asymptotic power to the t-ratio version. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, generics' markup advantages are short-lived, which limits their impact on increasing generic adoption.

Even though the shocks were small relative to lifetime income, men increase private consumption when they receive the shock but not when their wives do, a rejection of efficiency. Such behavior is not specific to the experiment-both spouses spend more on themselves when their labor income is higher.

The most common type pays every subject one out of her multiple tasks (within-subjects randomization). Recently, another type has become popular, where a subset of subjects is randomly selected, and only these subjects receive one real payment (between-subjects randomization). In earlier tests with simple, static tasks, RISs performed well. The present study investigates RISs in a more complex, dynamic choice experiment. We find that between-subjects randomization reduces risk aversion. While within-subjects randomization delivers unbiased measurements of risk aversion, it does not eliminate carry-over effects from previous tasks. Both types generate an increase in subjects' error rates.

Moreover, the contribution of extensive margin was also positive due to geographical expansion.

The two leading tourism countries for Taiwan are Japan and the USA, which are sources of short- and long-haul tourism, respectively. As a strong domestic currency can have adverse effects on international tourist arrivals through the price effect, daily data from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2008 are used to model the world price, exchange rates, and tourist arrivals from the world, the USA and Japan to Taiwan, and their associated volatility. Inclusion of the exchange rate and its volatility captures approximate daily and weekly price and price volatility effects on world, US and Japanese tourist arrivals to Taiwan. The heterogeneous autoregressive model is used to approximate the slowly decaying correlations associated with the long-memory properties in daily and weekly exchange rates and international tourist arrivals, to test whether alternative short- and long-run estimates of conditional volatility are sensitive to the long-memory in the conditional mean, to examine asymmetry and leverage in volatility, and to examine the effects of temporal and spatial aggregation. The approximate price and price volatility effects tend to be different, with the exchange rate typically having the expected negative impact on tourist arrivals to Taiwan, whereas exchange rate volatility can have positive or negative effects on tourist arrivals to Taiwan. For policy purposes, the empirical results suggest that an arbitrary choice of data frequency or spatial aggregation will not lead to robust findings as they are generally not independent of the level of aggregation used.","[Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Taichung, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [McAleer, Michael] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",National Chung Hsing University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Kyoto University; Complutense University of Madrid,"Chang, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Taichung, Taiwan.",,"Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X;",,,,,41,18,20,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

Recently, largely on account of increasing interest in historical national accounting, the late-medieval figures have been revised upward, in line with an upward adjustment in the estimated shares of manufacturing and pasture. Leaving GDPs dating from the ancient world unaltered would consequently generate figures indicating increased economic growth during the first millennium ce. A considerable number of studies of the late-medieval period (the object of increasing attention on the part of specialists in early economic history) have caused estimates for the ancient one to be revised upwards, essentially leaving estimates of the changes in economic development over time unaltered. These studies, however, have focused on the Roman Empire and Italia while there is a consensus in the literature that it was quite unrepresentative of all ancient societies with its relatively high share of GDP from the manufacturing sector of the economy. We therefore estimate a new per capita income for another contemporary agrarian society: ancient Mesopotamia. In addition, by examining manufacturing and pasturethe two main reasons for higher income which have been identified in the literaturewe have found a tentative explanation for the fact that ancient Mesopotamia's per capita income deviated from that of Rome.","[van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Utrecht, Fac Humanities, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands; [Foldvari, Peter] Univ Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary; [van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Utrecht University; University of Debrecen; University of Warwick,"van Leeuwen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Humanities, Janskerkhof 13, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands.",bas.vanleeuwen1@googlemail.com,"Foldvari, Peter/AAW-9861-2021","Foldvari, Peter/0000-0003-4557-8810; van Leeuwen, Bas/0000-0001-7817-5298",,,,,42,13,13,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

While econometric studies of this link have flourished, they are of limited use in understanding the causal mechanisms making some institutions responsible for economic performance. Several works using game theory and akin to the 'new institutional economics' have entertained the goal of developing micro-explanations of the institutions-performance link. Because game theory focuses on individuals' actions and beliefs, game-theoretic studies of institutions are thought to oppose more 'structuralist' explanations that downplay the role of individual agents and put more emphasis on the importance of social (or 'macro') structures. This paper demonstrates that this claim is misconceived, as the micro-explanations produced by game-theoretic models must assume already existing macro-structures. Institutions produce downward effects, shaping each agent's action. Moreover, in a game-theoretic framework, macro-structures are constitutive of individual agency since, without them, agents would often be unable to choose. I illustrate this claim with the example of Avner Greif's study of the role of cultural beliefs in the economic organisation of medieval societies.","Univ Reims, Dept Econ, F-51100 Reims, France",Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Hédoin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Reims, Dept Econ, 57B Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51100 Reims, France.",cyril.hedoin@univ-reims.fr,"Hédoin, Cyril/AAL-8244-2021","Hédoin, Cyril/0000-0002-5358-7111",,,,,46,8,11,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Controlling for IQ years of education is of modest statistical significance. If IQ gaps between countries persist and model parameters remain stable, TFP levels are forecasted to sharply diverge, creating a twin peaks result.

Then using variants of the dictator game that allow for either revealing the dictator's identity or allowing the dictator to choose the recipient, we attribute variation in sharing to three different motives. The first of these, directed altruism, is related to preferences, while the remaining two are incentive-related (sanctions and reciprocity). We observe high average levels of sharing in our baseline treatment, while variation across individuals depends importantly on the incentive-related motives.

We raise the question if the global market for petroleum will actually keep the door open for substantial supply of oil and gas from the Arctic, a region with almost a quarter of global undiscovered petroleum resources, but at high costs and long lead times. This makes future Arctic supply highly dependent on oil and gas prices, influenced by future supply of unconventional oil and gas and also by huge amounts of conventional gas in the Middle East coming on stream. We study the oil and gas supplies from 6 Arctic regions during 2010-2050 using the FRISBEE model of global oil and gas markets, based on Arctic resource estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey. Following the IEA reference oil price assumption, we find that even if almost a quarter of the world's undiscovered petroleum is situated in Arctic basins, the future share of global production will only be 8-10% in our reference scenario. Although a major part of the undiscovered Arctic resources is natural gas, the relative importance of the Arctic as a world gas supplier will decline. while its relative importance as a global oil producer might be maintained. Less undiscovered oil resources will have minor effect on total Arctic oil production and a marginal effect on Arctic gas extraction as Arctic Russia is the dominant petroleum producer with a sufficiently large stock of already discovered resources at relatively low costs to support their petroleum production before 2050.

The paper investigates the relationship between volatility and innovation using firm level patent data. The analysis builds on the empirical work by Mazzucato (Rev Econ Dyn 5:318-345, 2002; J Evol Econ 13(5):491-512, 2003) where it is found that stock return volatility is highest during periods in the industry life-cycle when innovation is the most 'radical'. In this paper we ask whether firms which invest more in innovation (more R&D and more patents) and/or which have more important innovations (patents with more citations) experience more volatility in their returns. Given that returns should in theory be higher, on average, for higher risk stocks, we also look at the effect of innovation on the level of returns. To take into account the competition between firms within industries, firm returns and volatility are measured relative to the industry average. We focus the analysis on firms in the pharmaceutical industry between 1974 and 1999. Results suggest that there is a positive and significant relationship between volatility, R&D intensity and the various patent related measures-especially when the innovation measures are filtered to distinguish the very innovative firms from the less innovate ones.","[Mazzucato, Mariana] Univ Sussex, Sci & Technol Policy Res Unit, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England; [Tancioni, Massimiliano] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Sussex; Sapienza University Rome,"Mazzucato, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sci & Technol Policy Res Unit, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England.",M.Mazzucato@sussex.ac.uk; massimilano.tancioni@uniroma1.it,"Mazzucato, Mariana/H-4456-2011","Mazzucato, Mariana/0000-0001-9183-5000",,,,,31,35,40,2,82,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The paper analyzes the implications of this process on the estimation of agricultural production functions using a panel of countries. The data includes a measure of capital in agriculture absent from most studies. We employ a heterogeneous technology framework where implemented technology is chosen jointly with inputs to interpret information obtained in the empirical analysis of panel data. In this framework, estimates depend upon the economic environment, which is represented by state variables. It turns out that the old problem of identifying the production function cannot be resolved through the use of instrumental variables, but can be resolved using the allocation error. The paper discusses the scope for replacing country and time effects by observed state variables. The empirical results differ from those reported in the literature for cross-country studies, largely in augmenting the elasticities of capital and land and reducing those of fertilizer and labor.

The possibility to abstract from seasonality for the assessment of economic conditions is a widely debated issue. In this paper we propose a strategy for assessing the role of seasonal adjustment (SA) on business cycle measurement. In particular, we provide a method for quantifying the contribution to the unreliability of the estimated cycles extracted by popular filters, such as Baxter and King and HodrickPrescott (HP). The main conclusion is that the contribution is larger around the turning points of the series and at the extremes of the sample period; moreover, it much more sizeable for highpass filters, like the HP filter, which retain to a great extent the high-frequency fluctuations in a time series, the latter being the ones that are more affected by SA. If a bandpass component is considered, the effect has reduced size. Finally, we discuss the role of forecast extensions and the prediction of the cycle. For the time series of industrial production considered in the illustration, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the cycle at the end of the sample.","Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Proietti, T (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy.",,,"Proietti, Tommaso/0000-0001-5285-7522",,,,,37,0,7,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

In 2009 we probed this question by conducting an international survey across these communities, namely at conferences of the European Society for Ecological Economics, the Association for Heterodox Economics, and the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists. The research was designed to gain insight into the extent to which ecological economics can be described as heterodox and a distinct field from orthodox environmental and resource economics. Conflicting visions of ecological economics have led to a prevalence of neoclassical articles and thought mixed in amongst more heterodox work. We introduce a novel classification of work in the field of environmental policy in order to test for the existence of differences in terms of methodological and ideological approaches. How heterodox economists understand environmental issues is also an important question to answer if there is to be more collaboration between them and ecological economists. The findings have implications for cooperation and the future direction of both ecological and heterodox economics.","[Spash, Clive L.] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Inst Environm & Reg Dev, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Ryan, Anthony] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Australian National University,"Spash, CL (通讯作者)，WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Inst Environm & Reg Dev, Nordbergstr 15,UZA 4 B406, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",clive.spash@wu.ac.at,"Spash, Clive/IST-5510-2023",,,,,,48,47,49,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The two inputs are two types of skilled labor: engineering, which exerts a positive externality on total factor productivity, and law, which does not. The paper shows that a marginal prospect of migration by engineers increases human capital accumulation of both types of workers (engineers and lawyers), and also the number of engineers who remain in the country. These two effects are socially desirable, since they move the economy from the (inefficient) free-market equilibrium towards the social optimum. The paper also shows that if the externality effect of engineering is sufficiently powerful, everyone will be better off as a consequence of the said prospect of migration, including the engineers who lose the migration lottery, and even the individuals who practice law.","[Stark, Oded] Univ Bonn, ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Stark, Oded] Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Warsaw Univ, Warsaw, Poland; [Stark, Oded] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Zakharenko, Roman] ICEF, Off Zh 709, Moscow 109028, Russia",University of Bonn; University of Klagenfurt; University of Vienna; University of Warsaw; Warsaw School of Economics,"Stark, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",ostark@uni-bonn.de; rzakharenko@hse.ru,"Zakharenko, Roman/AAW-9852-2021","Zakharenko, Roman/0000-0002-8791-2146",,,,,23,5,5,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Economists, however, have emphasized the need for incentives that induce even the self-interested to contribute to the public good. Implicitly most have assumed that these two approaches are complementary or at worst additive. But this need not be the case. Behavioral experiments find that if reciprocity-minded subjects feel hostility towards free riders and enjoy inflicting harm on them, the incentives provided by the anticipated punishment support near efficient levels of contributions to a public good. Cooperation may also be supported if altruistic individuals internalize the group benefits that their contributions produce. But the effects of these two supports for high levels of cooperation may be less than additive. Using a utility function embodying both reciprocity and altruism we show that unconditional altruism attenuates the punishment motive and thus may reduce the level of punishment inflicted on defectors, resulting in lower levels of contribution. Increases in altruism may also reduce the level of benefits from the public project net of contribution costs and punishment costs. The range over which altruism inhibits cooperation and reduces material payoffs is greater, the stronger is the reciprocity motive among group members. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although this pace of growth is more robust than it was in the 1990s, we can still witness the presence of macroeconomic constraints to its continuation in the long term, such as the exchange rate overvaluation, particularly since 2005, and in general the modus operandi of monetary policy. Such constraints may jeopardise the sustainability of the current pace of growth. We argue that Brazil still lies in a trap made up of high interest and low exchange rates. The elimination of the exchange rate misalignment would bring about a large increase in the rate of interest, which in turn would impact negatively upon investment and hence upon long-term growth. We indicate a set of policy measures to eliminate such a trap, in particular, the adoption of an implicit exchange rate target, capital controls and the substitution of the present regime of inflation targeting with a 'double mandate regime' where monetary authorities must pursue two objectives, i.e. output stabilisation and inflation control. Recent events seem to go in this direction.","[Oreiro, Jose Luis; Punzo, Lionello F.; Araujo, Eliane C.] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Punzo, Lionello F.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, INCT PPED, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Araujo, Eliane C.] Univ Estadual Maringa, Maringa, Parana, Brazil",University of Siena; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Estadual de Maringa,"Oreiro, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Campus Univ Darcy Ribeiro, BR-70919970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",,"Oreiro, José Luis Da Costa/HRC-2082-2023","da Costa Oreiro, Jose Luis/0000-0001-8955-8868",,,,,29,9,14,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Local governments may respond to local conditions, but ignore inter-jurisdictional spillovers. Alternatively, central governments may internalize spillovers, but impose uniform incentives ignoring local heterogeneity. We provide a simple model that demonstrates that the choice of pricing policy also depends crucially on a third factor, the shape of marginal costs of providing the public good. If marginal costs are convex, then marginal abatement cost elasticities will be higher around the local policies. This increases the deadweight loss of those policies relative to the centralized policy, ceteris paribus. If they are concave, then the opposite is true. Using a detailed simulation model of the US electricity sector, we then empirically explore these tradeoffs for US air pollution. We find that US states acting in their own interest lose about 31.5% of the potential first-best benefits, whereas the second-best uniform policy loses only 0.2% of benefits. The centralized policy outperforms the state policy for two reasons. First, inter-state spillovers are simply more important that interstate heterogeneity in this application. Second, because of the convexity of the marginal cost functions, elasticities are much lower over the range relevant to the centralized policy, dampening the distortions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that recent graduates that enter into flexible jobs face large wage penalties, a worse job match and less training participation than graduates who take permanent jobs, even after correcting for differences in ability. When the labour market situation for a particular field of education deteriorates, more recent graduates are forced into flexible jobs, threatening their position on the labour market in the long run.

The regime-dependent impulse responses do not indicate strong pass through from crude oil prices to inflation in both regimes. However, this channel is working through refined petroleum product prices. The results show that there is a substantial decline in pass-through from refined petroleum prices to inflation as the economy moves from high to low inflation regime.

Researchers have tested the hypothesis of income convergence in different settings using either regression or unit root analysis, with mixed results. In this paper, we use both methods on the same samples over a significant time period. This allows us to judge differences in results across varied time-frames and methodologies. The focus of these tests is on convergence to German and EMU average incomes by Eastern European countries and those within the Euro-zone from 1971-2007. The evidence for convergence is mixed. Among the Euro-zone countries, there is more evidence of convergence in the 1970s and 1980s than recently. There is significant evidence that Eastern Europe experienced convergence and that capital formation was one of the root causes. While the results do not support the hypothesis that joining the EU increases convergence, reforms undertaken in the 1990s by Eastern European countries in preparation for joining may have helped them to catch up, even if the act of joining the EU did not directly impact convergence.","[Quinn, Michael A.] Bentley Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02452 USA",Bentley University,"Quinn, MA (通讯作者)，Bentley Univ, Dept Econ, 175 Forest St, Waltham, MA 02452 USA.",mquinn@bentley.edu,,,,,,,74,14,14,0,20,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

When improving coverage for one service reduces use of another, the savings are referred to as offset effects. For example, costs of better coverage for prescription drugs may be partly offset by reductions in hospital costs. Offset effects have welfare implications but it has not been clear how to value these impacts in design of health insurance. We show that plan-paid - rather than total - spending is the right welfare measure of the offset effect, and go on to develop a sufficient statistic for evaluating the welfare effects of change in coverage in the presence of multiple goods.

The analysis takes into consideration the period of most intense transition and post-transition (1994-2002) of 26 former socialist countries. The empirical estimates enable us to draw two main conclusions: first classical locational FDI factors maintain their role in the context of transition countries, and, second, that FDI are influenced by specific market and institutional factors. Among market variables, relatively higher labour costs surprisingly do not constitute an obstacle for foreign investment. We find that variables reflecting market stabilising institutions play a more important role than those representing market creating institutions. Although, there is a certain tolerance of foreign investors towards weak institutional environment, we demonstrate that, to attract FDI, countries should reinforce their macroeconomic stability by focusing on market stabilising institutions.","[Gorbunova, Yulia; Infante, Davide; Smirnova, Janna] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy",University of Calabria,"Gorbunova, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, Campus Arcavacata, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy.",d.infante@unical.it,,"Infante, Davide/0000-0001-8520-7008; Smirnova, Janna/0000-0002-1204-361X",,,,,47,24,24,0,14,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Limited mobility across industries and occupations, at least in part due to preferences for part-time work, and an institutional wage-setting mechanism also play a role. Growing demand for workers in the care industries, rising skill levels of women, and slowing growth in participation as rates converge with those of men will contribute to stronger wage growth in the future.","Prod Commiss, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",,"Gordon, J (通讯作者)，Prod Commiss, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",Jenny.Gordon@pc.gov.au,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

Controls related to financial knowledge and resources also explain the gender difference. The residual effect of the male gender on the conditional equity share, after all appropriate controls, is 3 percentage points and statistically significant. The effect on stock market participation on the other hand is close to zero or negative, so men contribute more to the nonparticipation puzzle conditional on covariates.

Farmers participated in a game protocol in which they were asked to make a simple decision: whether or not to purchase fertilizer and if so, how many bags. The return to fertilizer was dependent on a stochastic weather draw made in each round of the game. In later rounds a random selection of farmers made this decision in the presence of a stylized weather-index insurance contract. Insurance was found to have some positive effect on fertilizer purchases. Purchases were also found to depend on the realization of the weather in the previous round. We explore the mechanisms of this relationship and find that it may be the result of both changes in wealth weather brings about, and changes in perceptions of the costs and benefits to fertilizer purchases.","[Hill, Ruth Vargas; Viceisza, Angelino] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Viceisza, A (通讯作者)，IFPRI, 2033 K St NW,Room 400, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",r.v.hill@cgiar.org; a.viceisza@cgiar.org,,,,,,,52,55,59,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Drawing on the notion of 'conception of control' set out by Neil Fligstein (1990), we argue that CSR has given rise to a new 'conception of control', which we term 'shareholder-CSR compatible'. Such a conception reflects how governance changes when environmental and societal responsibilities are combined with responsibility to shareholders.

Using information on whether a household received food stamp benefits, I compare actual food stamp recipients' time cost to those who do not receive food stamp benefits. Previous literature that also uses American Time Use Survey data suggests that typical food stamp recipients incur a higher time cost of preparing food at home. I cannot confirm this finding using actual data on food stamp recipients and non-recipients. In fact, the lower shadow wage of household production of food stamp recipients more than offsets the larger amount of time spent preparing food at home, generating lower time cost of food preparation for them.","Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Raschke, C (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",crasch2@lsu.edu,,"Raschke, Christian/0000-0002-2773-2477",,,,,20,9,10,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The construction cost of the facility depends on where it is sited. When a district accepts the facility, it bears a disutility. The problem here is to choose a siting district and to share the construction cost while considering fair compensation for the siting district. We provide an axiomatic framework to analyze this problem and seek normatively desirable and practical decision rules. A is one that selects a district so as to minimize the social loss, applies a negative price to waste according to the social loss involved, and provides full compensation to the siting district. We show that this rule is a unique rule that satisfies certain requirements of efficiency, fairness, and robustness regarding the strategic transfers of waste. We then establish the nearly robustness of this rule to the misrepresentation of disutility information.","Yokohama Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan",Yokohama National University,"Sakai, T (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan.",toyotaka.sakai@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,20,21,1,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In the model, heterogeneity arises through a combination of exogenous efficiency differences and accumulated innovations resulting from R&D investments.

An empirical test using 9784 new Chinese household survey data show that our structural model is a significant improvement over the existing behavioral life cycle model, as it is able to capture the psychological states affecting different groups of consumers such as employed workers and unemployed retirees.

The present study is apparently one of only a few attempts in the literature to examine directly the effects of corruption on trade and the first attempt to examine trade over time in a specific country whose level of corruption changed significantly. Israel was chosen as the subject of the study mainly because of the fact that, according to international indexes, the country's status as a civil society has declined significantly over the past decade. According to the corruption index of Transparency International, Israel was ranked 33rd in the world, at the end of the sample period in 2008, having fallen from 14th in 1995. The results of the research can serve as the basis for comparison to similar studies of other Western countries.

We show that credit conditions were an important channel through which the crisis affected trade volumes, by exploiting the variation in the cost of capital across countries and over time, as well as the variation in financial vulnerability across sectors. Countries with higher interbank rates and thus tighter credit markets exported less to the US during the peak of the crisis. This effect was especially pronounced in sectors that require extensive external financing, have limited access to trade credit, or have few collateralizable assets. Exports of financially vulnerable industries were thus more sensitive to the cost of external capital than exports of less vulnerable industries, and this sensitivity rose during the financial crisis. The quantitative implications of our estimates for trade volumes highlight the large real effects of financial crises and the potential gains from policy intervention. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides the first Canadian study of the link between cost to the student and the choice of university. Over the past two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the differences among Ontario universities in net cost defined as tuition and fees minus the expected value to an academically strong student of a guaranteed merit scholarship. Our estimates generally indicate no relationship between net cost and the overall share of strong applicants that a university is able to attract. An increase in net cost is associated with an increase in the ratio of strong students from high-income neighbourhoods to strong students from middle-income and low-income neighbourhoods in Arts and Science programs but not in Commerce and Engineering. Finally, more advantaged students are more likely to attend university, but merit aid is not of disproportionate benefit to those from more economically advantaged backgrounds, given registration.

Concurrently, there are concerns that additional aid will not be used effectively due to a problem of absorptive capacity in recipient countries. Empirical studies lend support to these concerns with many finding that there are diminishing returns to foreign aid. This paper reviews the extensive aid effectiveness literature to identify the various dimensions of absorptive capacity. It proceeds by devising a composite index of absorptive capacity for individual recipient countries which can assist policymakers in guiding the allocation of their aid. The relevance of the index is confirmed through its employment in a standard empirical model of aid effectiveness. The paper highlights the developing countries that currently receive high levels of aid relative to their estimated level of absorptive capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Whilst the majority of psychologists have concluded there is not much of a relationship at all, the economic literature has unearthed a possible U-shape relationship with the minimum level of satisfaction occurring in middle age (35-50). In this paper, we look for a U-shape in three panel data sets, the German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP), the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Household Income Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA). We find that the raw data mainly supports a wave-like shape that only weakly looks U-shaped for the 20-60 age range. That weak U-shape in middle age becomes more pronounced when allowing for socio-economic variables. When we then take account of selection effects via fixed-effects, however, the dominant age-effect in all three panels is a strong happiness increase around the age of 60 followed by a major decline after 75, with the U-shape in middle age disappearing such that there is almost no change in happiness between the age of 20 and 50.

As a result, profits are convex in toughness: the firm selects either the toughest or softest test available.

We examine whether IST changes are a major source of business fluctuations in Japan, by estimating a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model using Bayesian methods. We show that IST changes are less important than neutral technological changes in explaining output fluctuations. We also demonstrate that investment fluctuations are mainly driven by shocks to investment adjustment costs. Such shocks represent variations of costs involved in changing investment spending, such as financial intermediation costs. We find that the estimated series of the investment adjustment cost shock correlates strongly with the diffusion index of firms' financial position in the Tankan (Short-term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan). Therefore, we argue that the large decline in investment growth in the early 1990s was due to an increase in investment adjustment costs stemming from firms' financial constraints after the collapse of Japan's asset price bubble.","[Hirose, Yasuo] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Hirose, Y (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",yhirose@econ.keio.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23730306] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,36,13,13,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We use data from the Peru and the Philippines in which independent surveyors elicited loan use both directly (i.e., by asking how individuals spent their loan proceeds) and indirectly (i.e., through a list-randomization technique that allows individuals to hide their answer from the surveyor).

In the typical dictator game, recipients are given no endowment. We give an endowment to the recipient as well as the dictator. This new dimension allows us to test directly for inequality aversion. Our results confirm that the inequality between dictator's and recipient's endowment is a key determinant of the dictator's giving. As we increase the recipient's endowment from 0 to an amount equal to the dictator's endowment, the mean amount passed drops from 30 percent to less than 12 percent of the dictator's endowment, and the proportion of dictators who pass positive amounts falls from 75 percent to 26 percent. Thus the majority of dicta tors exhibit behavior consistent with inequality averse preferences.

In this setting, estate taxation is a questionable instrument of redistribution: it penalizes the wealthy, but favors the top wealthy.

To correct for this, many European countries use pricing instruments specifically targeted at heavy duty vehicles, so far targeted almost exclusively at the primary road network. In line with the overall EU objective of greening the transport sector, we discuss the possibility of expanding the road charging system to a more comprehensive, area-wide one. The degree to which peripheral or disadvantaged regions are hit over-proportionally by such a measure remains an open question in the literature on heavy duty vehicle road pricing. We combine an input-output and a computable general equilibrium approach to analyse the case for Austria. We find that while it is not the sectors of highest economic importance in the periphery regions that are hit by the charge, those sectors that are hit are those which are relatively more important in peripheral regions (with up to a twofold share in value added) and for whom production price impacts tend to be relatively strong. The short term consumer price effect of extending the current primary road network charges to the secondary network is found not to exceed 0.15%. In terms of the principles of sustainable transport we find that extending charge coverage is compatible with most core principles, the exception being the principle of regional need. In terms of environmental impact, for example, expanding heavy duty vehicle charges to the secondary road network reduces heavy duty vehicle kilometres in the overall network (and related emissions) by roughly 2%. However, in order to comply with the needs principle, suitable complementary transfer policies need to be designed and implemented for peripheral regions.","[Steininger, Karl W.] Graz Univ, Dept Econ, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Steininger, Karl W.; Schmid, Christoph; Tobin, Alexandra] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Steininger, KW (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",karl.steininger@uni-graz.at,"Steininger, Karl/O-6971-2016","Steininger, Karl/0000-0003-3850-9315",,,,,31,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2012,39.0,2,,,SI,,261,278,,10.1007/s10663-012-9184-9,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309994100006,0

COOPER; TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; GENERATION; RETURNS; PLANTS; SCALE,"This study discusses a combined use of DEA (Data Environment Analysis) and DEA-DA (Discriminant Analysis) to determine the efficiency-based rank of energy firms. This type of performance evaluation is important because we often have a difficulty in accessing a large sample on energy firms to derive reliable empirical results. The proposed approach is useful in dealing with such a limited number of energy firms, often found in previous DEA studies on energy industries in the world. The proposed approach uses DEA to classify energy firms into efficient and inefficient groups based upon their efficiency scores. Then, it utilizes DEA-DA to assess their efficiency scores and ranks. In this stage, we can find an adjusted efficiency score for each energy firm. The proposed approach provides us with the following analytical capabilities, all of which cannot be found in a conventional use of DEA in assessing energy firms. First, the proposed DEA approach can avoid zero in all multipliers on efficient energy firms by incorporating SCSC (Strong Complementary Slackness Condition) so that it can handle an occurrence of multiple reference sets and multiple projections. The DEA result classifies all energy firms into efficient and inefficient groups. Second, DEA-DA, applied to the two groups, evaluates all energy firms by an industry-wide evaluation, not depending upon a limited number of efficient energy firms in a reference set, as found in a conventional use of DEA. The analytical capability can reduce the number of efficient energy firms. Third, the proposed approach can provide their efficiency-based ranking scores. Finally, we can conduct a rank sum test based upon their ranking scores to obtain a statistical inference. As an application, this study uses the proposed approach to examine the performance of Japanese electric power industry. We find two economic implications. One of the two implications is that no major change has occurred in the operational performance of Japanese electric power industry because of Japanese sluggish economy from 2005 to 2009. The other implication indicates that there are strategic differences in the operation of Japanese electric power firms after the liberalization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In 2002 the number of disability recipients approached one million. However, since then the number of disability cases has dropped remarkably due to a number of policy changes, the last of which being the new 2006 disability insurance scheme. On the other hand, in recent years the number of beneficiaries in the special scheme dedicated to the young handicapped has increased rapidly. In order to evaluate various policy alternatives and to forecast the effects of the 2006 law, a dynamic microsimulation model has been developed at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. This model has evolved into four separate forecasting models for the various disability schemes that are currently in force and are now fully integrated into the budget process. In these models, transitions within the disability schemes are estimated with multinomial logistic regression models based on administrative datasets. Current long-term forecasts show that the number of disability beneficiaries stabilizes at the current level of 800,000. The decreasing number of benefits in the employees' scheme is compensated by an increase in the scheme for the young handicapped. These long-term forecasts have been an important input for determining the focus of the new government's plans on disability insurance, namely to reduce the number of benefits of the young handicapped.

If a household's production decisions are separable from the household's consumption decisions, generally this suggests there is no surplus labor. Many scholars aver that China's surplus rural labor has spurred rapid economic growth, but concerns have arisen as to whether China still has surplus labor available. We investigate this issue using rural household panel data from 1993 to 2009 The regression results confirm that households in rural China have progressed from being non-separable to separable. The estimation results for both the entire country and regions reject the separability hypothesis before 2004 but fail to reject the hypothesis after 2004 (with the exception of the central region). These results suggest that China's surplus labor supply is dwindling, especially in the eastern and the western regions. The sustainability of China's high economic growth is questionable in the absence of a large reservoir of surplus rural labor.","[Wu, Cuirong; Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Wu, Cuirong; Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Xin, X (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",b10105234@cau.edu.cn; xinxian@cau.edu.cn,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2012,20.0,3,,,,,54,68,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01287.x,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,952BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304763800004,0
J,"Calvo, G",,,,"Calvo, Guillermo",,,Financial crises and liquidity shocks a bank-run perspective,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,Liquidity; Financial crises; Bubbles; Monetary and financial policy,EQUILIBRIUM; INFLATION; MONEY; MODEL,"In contrast with the financial multiplier literature, this note explores a case in which the shock triggering a financial crisis stems from the financial sector itself: it is not a shock stemming from the real sector which gets amplified by, say, agency problems. The basic intuition is provided by the bank-run literature of the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) variety. Financial development is modeled as a mechanism that endows real assets (e.g., land and capital) with liquidity. However, liquidity can be impaired by shocks that are equivalent to a bank run. Liquidity creation enhances real asset prices, while a liquidity crunch generates asset price collapse. This bubble-looking episode is not driven by standard fundamentals, although it is fully in line with rationality. In this context, devoid of other frictions like price stickiness, the note examines the effect of monetary policy in the absence of nominal rigidities. It shows that preventing price deflation is not enough to offset relative (to output) asset price meltdown, but lower policy interest rates increase relative asset prices and steady-state output. Moreover, in the neighborhood of a first-best capital allocation, an increase in the liquidity of capital may lower the welfare of the representative individual, even if the higher liquidity of capital is sustainable and, hence, not destroyed by future crash - illustrating the possibility of excessive financial innovation. An extension of the basic model supports the conjecture that low policy interest rates may have given further incentives to the development of shadow banking. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model considers two countries with a scope for welfare improving economic integration. The first-best tax system has two important characteristics: (i) the tax rate on interest flows to the other country is zero to ensure the optimal level of economic integration; (ii) the tax rate on interest flows to tax havens is high enough to deter profit shifting to tax havens. In second-best environments, countries face a trade-off between economic integration and protection against tax havens, which causes protection to be suboptimally low. The key to the result is that economic integration makes it easier for multinational firms to circumvent taxes on interest payments to tax havens with conduit loans. The paper thus provides an explanation for the empirical puzzle that many countries do not tax interest payments to tax havens despite the scope for profit shifting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We believe that it is equally important that macroeconomic models used to evaluate historical monetary policy reflect the framework that policymakers used to formulate that policy. To that end, we use the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) transcripts to examine the role that the Phillips curve framework played in Fed policymaking from 1979 through 2003. The FOMC's transcripts allow us to trace the evolution in policymakers' discussion of the Phillips curve framework over time. Our analysis suggests that the Phillips curve was much less central to the formulation and implementation of US monetary policy than it is in models commonly used to evaluate that policy.","[Meade, Ellen E.] American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Thornton, Daniel L.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",American University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Meade, EE (通讯作者)，American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",meade@american.edu,,,,,,,28,21,21,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

An alternative explanation of the data is that borrowing costs respond endogenously to expectations of future default, driven by macroeconomic shocks. We investigate by imposing restrictions on a structural vector autoregression that isolate the influence of expected default on spreads. We find that adverse credit shocks have contributed to declining output in every post-1982 recession, and account for three-fifths of the decline in output during the 2007-2009 contraction. However, on average credit shocks account for only a fifth of business cycle fluctuations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper introduces a new explanation that relies on none of these assumptions: if the cartel's member firms have private information about their costs, price wars can be optimal in the face of complexity. Specifically, equilibria that are robust to pay-off irrelevant disruptions of the information environment generically cannot attain or approximate efficiency. An optimal robust equilibrium must allocate market shares inefficiently and may call for price wars under certain conditions. For a two-firm cartel, cost interdependence is a sufficient condition for price wars to arise in an optimal robust equilibrium. That optimal equilibria are inefficient generically applies not only to collusion games but also to the entire separable pay-off environment-a class that includes most typical economic models.","Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Miller, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,,,,,,,60,16,19,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Political considerations contributed to delays in monetary tightening, insufficiently aggressive anti-inflation policies, and the premature abandonment of attempts at disinflation.

The conditions under which any structural restrictions would apply were believed to be very narrow, rarely found to apply, and virtually never investigated. As a result, current practice does not test the structural hypothesis in terms of the comparison of the estimated reduced form and the permissible reduced form sign patterns. This paper shows that such tests are always possible. Namely, that the sign patterns of the hypothesized structural arrays always limit the sign patterns that can be taken on by the estimated reduced form. Given this, it is always possible to falsify a structural hypothesis based only upon the sign pattern proposed.

Second, some economic researchers affirmatively collect data of interest.

To answer this question, we examine 92 episodes of export surges, defined as significant increases in manufacturing export growth that are sustained for at least 7 years. We find that export surges in developing countries tend to be preceded by a large real depreciation, which leaves the exchange rate significantly undervalued. In contrast, in developed countries, the role of the exchange rate is less pronounced. We examine why the exchange rate is important in developing countries and find that the depreciation is associated with a significant reallocation of resources in the export sector. In particular, depreciation stimulates entry into new export products and new markets. These new exports are important, accounting for over 40% of export growth on average during the surge in developing countries. We argue that a large real depreciation induces firms to expand the product and market space for exports. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

One reason for this is that financial crises increase uncertainty, increasing the real option value of delaying investment. In this paper, we show that the negative effect of crises on investment differs significantly across countries: in countries with low tolerance for uncertainty, the negative effect is strong. The negative effect is absent in countries that are more tolerant of uncertainty. These findings are similar across different types of financial crisis; they vary as predicted across type of investor, asset and industry; and they are not driven by uncertainty-averse countries adopting more rigid institutions.

The ratio of value added to gross exports (VAX ratio) is a measure of the intensity of production sharing. Across countries, export composition drives VAX ratios, with exporters of Manufactures having lower ratios. Across sectors, the VAX ratio for Manufactures is low relative to Services, primarily because Services are used as an intermediate to produce manufacturing exports. Across bilateral partners, VAX ratios vary widely and contain information on both bilateral and triangular production chains. We document specifically that bilateral production linkages, not variation in the composition of exports, drive variation in bilateral VAX ratios. Finally, bilateral imbalances measured in value added differ from gross trade imbalances. most prominently, the U.S.-China imbalance in 2004 is 30-40% smaller when measured in value added.

This paper argues that excessive wages and profits are better thought of as responses to changes in the economic, political and institutional environment, and there is no a priori reason for a negative relationship between them. We thus investigate whether there is a causal effect of excessive wages on capital return using aggregate panel data for 19 OECD countries for the period 1970-2000. We account for the endogeneity of excessive wages by exploiting variations in institutional and labour market characteristics. Our main finding is that excessive wages do not affect the return on capital. This result remains robust to alternative empirical specifications and to alternative definitions of profitability and excessive wages, and questions the standard advice by international economic organizations on wage moderation.","[Katsimi, Margarita; Moutos, Thomas] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, CESifo, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Katsimi, M (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, CESifo, Patis Str 76, Athens 10434, Greece.",mkatsimi@aueb.gr,"Kalyvitis, Sarantis/AAI-4581-2021; Moutos, Thomas/AAE-2552-2022","Kalyvitis, Sarantis/0000-0002-7540-6019",,,,,73,2,2,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Poor households have less interest in the enforcement of property rights than rich households. We also consider heterogenous households with different tastes.

Our ordinary least-squares estimate shows that one year of schooling increases an individual's earnings by 8.4%. If we use a within-twin fixed effects model, the return is reduced to 2.7%, but rises to 3.8% after the correction of measurement error. These results suggest that a large portion of the estimated returns to education is due to omitted ability or the family effect. We further investigate why the true return is low and the omitted ability bias high, and find evidence showing that it may be a consequence of China's education system, which is highly selective and exam oriented. More specifically, we find that high school education may mainly serve as a mechanism to select college students, but as a human capital investment per se it has low returns in terms of earnings. In contrast, both vocational school education and college education have a large return that is comparable to that found in the United States. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we address the degree of alignment between ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation strategies, using data from the state of Minnesota, USA. Minnesota voters recently passed an initiative that provides approximately $171m annually in dedicated funding for conservation. We find a high degree of alignment between investing conservation funds to target the value of ecosystem services and investing them to target biodiversity conservation. Targeting one of these two objectives generates 4770 per cent of the maximum score of the other objective. We also find that benefits of conservation far exceed the costs, with a return on investment of between 2 to 1 and 3 to 1 in our base-case analysis.

The paper begins by clarifying the role of citation analysis in the evaluation of research. Next, a summary of results about the citation distributions' basic features at different aggregation levels is offered. These results indicate that citation distributions share the same broad shape, are highly skewed, and are often crowned by a power law. In light of this evidence, a novel methodology for the evaluation of research units is illustrated by comparing the high- and low-citation impact achieved by the US, the European Union, and the rest of the world in 22 scientific fields. However, contrary to recent claims, it is shown that mean normalization at the sub-field level does not lead to a universal distribution. Nevertheless, among other topics subject to ongoing research, it appears that this lack of universality does not preclude sensible normalization procedures to compare the citation impact of articles in different scientific fields.","[Ruiz-Castillo, Javier] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Ruiz-Castillo, Javier] CEPR Project SCIFI GLOW, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Ruiz-Castillo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain.",jrc@eco.uc3m.es,"Ruiz-Castillo, Javier/O-8180-2019",,,,,,51,15,15,0,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

We find that information frictions lead to price dispersion. When the two goods are complements, their prices will tend to be negatively correlated, so if one is priced high, the other will be discounted. This finding is supported by some empirical evidence which suggests that simultaneous price discounts of complements are infrequent. If the goods are substitutes, their prices will be uncorrelated, potentially rationalizing the lack of evidence on their co-pricing. When selling complements, retailers earn higher profits than in the one-good model through taxing captive consumers with a high overall price tag and attracting shoppers by pricing one of the goods aggressively. Bundling practices are thus shown to be detrimental to retailers' profits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Recent literature on multinational firms has focused on low productivity as a barrier to the internationalization of firms. But labour market frictions or financial constraints may also hamper internationalization. In order to assess the importance of these barriers, we present new empirical evidence on the extensive and intensive margin of exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) based on micro-level data of German firms. First, we find a positive impact of firm size and productivity on firms international activities. Second, labour market frictions can constitute barriers to foreign activities. Third, self-reported financial constraints have no impact on firms internationalization decisions.

Courts are an important element in the institutional framework of labor markets, often determining the degree of employment protection. German labor courts provide a vivid example in this regard. However, we know relatively little about court behavior. A unique dataset on German labor court verdicts reveals that social and other criteria like employee characteristics, the type of job, local labor market conditions and court composition influence court decisions. At least as striking is that workers' chances to win depend on where and when their cases are filed. This generates considerable ex ante uncertainty about outcomes.","[Neugart, Michael] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Berger, Helge] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; Free University of Berlin,"Neugart, M (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Univ Pl 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",michael.neugart@unibz.it,,"Neugart, Michael/0000-0002-3348-8570",,,,,40,17,20,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

In a closed economy, the planner trades off product variety and average productivity effects. Neither subsidies on entry fixed costs nor on operating fixed costs are welfare enhancing. These results reflect the Pareto optimality of the laissez faire equilibrium. In a small'' open economy a la Demidova and Rodriguez-Clare (J Int Econ 78(1):100-112, 2009), an entry fixed cost subsidy does not enhance welfare, while a small operating fixed cost subsidy does. Only the latter affects the relative attractiveness of exporting. The average firm thus reallo-actes labor from export to domestic activity and operates at a smaller scale, which allows for a larger increase in domestic product variety than in the closed economy.","Univ Tubingen, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Jung, B (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Nauklerstr 47, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",benjamin.jung@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2012,39.0,1,,,,,87,108,,10.1007/s10663-010-9165-9,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309994000005,0

The main assumption is that the firm can offer two different kinds of contracts to the workers, either a short-term contract or a long-term one. The short-term contract acts as a probationary stage in which the firm can learn about the worker. After this stage, the firm can propose a long-term contract to the worker or it can decide to look for another worker. We show that, if the short-term wage is fixed endogenously, it can be optimal for firms to start a working relationship with a short-term contract, but that this policy decreases unemployment and welfare. On the contrary, if the wage is fixed exogenously, this policy could be optimal also from a welfare point of view.","[Paolini, Dimitri; de Dios Tena, Juan] Univ Sassari, CRENoS, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Paolini, Dimitri; de Dios Tena, Juan] Univ Sassari, DEIR, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Paolini, Dimitri] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [de Dios Tena, Juan] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain",University of Sassari; University of Sassari; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Paolini, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, CRENoS, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",dpaolini@uniss.it,"Tena, J.D/AAF-3763-2021","Tena, J.D/0000-0003-3018-2442",,,,,18,2,3,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2012,39.0,1,,,,,1,18,,10.1007/s10663-010-9152-1,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309994000001,0

Here it is shown that multipliers over 1 000 can occur from a new mechanism in banking. This new multiplier uses a default insurance note to insure an outstanding loan in order to return the value of the insured amount into capital. The economic impact of this invention is calculably greater than the original invention of reserve banking. The consequence of this lending invention is to render the existing money multiplier equations of reserve banking obsolete where it occurs. The equations describing this new multiplier do not converge. Each set of parameters for reserve percentage, nesting depth, etc. creates a unique logarithmic curve rather than approaching a limit. Thus it is necessary to show the behavior of this new equation by numerical methods.

Their investment strategy was based on replicating the fluctuations of some of the world's well-known stock market indexes. Legislation and regulation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as in other neighboring countries, provides the possibility of establishing index funds, with no concrete initiatives at the moment. One of the better-known asset valuation models, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), determines the required rate of return on risky assets if the assets are to be added to an already well-diversified portfolio. Since a market portfolio is a theoretical concept, wide stock market indexes are used as proxies for the market. These stock market indexes have to obtain mean-variance efficiency for the CAPM tests. In this paper, we apply a mean-variance optimization model to a basket of securities from the Bosnia and Herzegovina stock market. We explore the efficiency of these indexes as securities portfolios. The possible efficiency of these indexes would encourage the creation of index funds in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, we investigate the possible use of these indexes in CAPM tests. Our research shows that the analyzed indexes are not mean-variance efficient. For the purpose of efficient portfolio determination, we use our own software in the application section of the paper. Using this software, we propose indexes that obtain mean-variance efficiency.","[Arnaut-Berilo, Almira] Sarajevo Sch Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Zaimovic, Azra] Sarajevo Sch Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg",,"Arnaut-Berilo, A (通讯作者)，Sarajevo Sch Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ, Trg Oslobodenja Alija Izetbe Govic 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg.",almira.arnaut@efsa.unsa.ba; azra.zaimovic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Arnaut-Berilo, Almira/AEY-8165-2022; Zaimovic, Azra/N-6276-2019","Arnaut-Berilo, Almira/0000-0002-3285-9122; Zaimovic, Azra/0000-0002-3956-4626",,,,,9,4,4,0,5,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

This paper focuses on two regulatory measures that China has adopted to incentivize air quality improvement: publishing a daily air pollution index (API) for major cities since 2000 and linking the API to performance evaluations of local governments. In particular, China defines a day with an API at or below 100 as a blue sky day. Starting in 2003, a city with at least 80% blue sky days in a calendar year (among other criteria) qualified for the national environmental protection model city award. This cutoff was increased to 85% in 2007. Using officially reported API data from 37 large cities during 2000-2009, we find a significant discontinuity at the threshold of 100 and this discontinuity is of a greater magnitude after 2003. Moreover, we find that the model cities were less likely to report API right above 100 when they were close to the targeted blue sky days in the fourth quarter of the year when or before they won the model city award. That being said, we also find significant correlation of API with two alternative measures of air pollution - namely visibility as reported by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), corrected for meteorological conditions, from NASA satellites. The discontinuity around 100 suggests that count of blue sky days could have been subject to data manipulation; nevertheless, API does contain useful information about air pollution.","[Chen, Yuyu; Shi, Guang] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jin, Ginger Zhe] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jin, Ginger Zhe] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kumar, Naresh] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",Peking University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Miami,"Chen, YY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chenyuyu@pku.edu.cn; jin@econ.umd.edu; NKumar@med.miami.edu; shiguang1@gsm.pku.edu.cn,,"Kumar, Naresh/0000-0001-6200-9172",,,,,67,83,89,4,27,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

However, this literature has been mostly cross-sectional, and so struggled to address the effects of unobserved influences on contributions that may be correlated with heterogeneity. It has also paid little attention to how heterogeneity's estimated effects are influenced by neighborhood size or the concavity of heterogeneity measures. With access to a panel of three waves of census data on volunteering rates in New Zealand, released at two fine levels of aggregation, we can control for stable unobserved neighborhood characteristics that may affect volunteering rates. We use pooled cross-section, between and fixed effects regressions to test whether volunteering rates are lowered by heterogeneity in race/ethnicity, language, birthplace, or income. We find that estimates are affected by neighborhood definition, and that ethnic and language heterogeneity are robustly associated with lower volunteering rates in New Zealand.","[Clark, Jeremy] Univ Canterbury, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Kim, Bonggeun] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea",University of Canterbury; Seoul National University (SNU),"Clark, J (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Canterbury, New Zealand.",jeremy.clark@canterbury.ac.nz; bgkim07@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,28,7,7,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

From the point of view of portfolio diversification, short-term investors are more interested in the comovements of stock returns at higher frequencies (short-term movements), while long-term investors focus on lower frequencies comovements. As such, one has to resort to a time-frequency domain analysis to obtain insight about comovements at the particular time-frequency (scale) level. The empirical literature on the CEE and developed stock markets interdependence predominantly apply simple (Pearsons) correlation analysis, Granger causality tests, cointegration analysis, and GARCH modeling. None of the existent empirical studies examine time-scale comovements between CEE and developed stock market returns. By applying a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform correlation estimator and a running correlation technique, we investigated the dynamics of stock market return comovements between individual Central and Eastern European countries and developed European stock markets in the period from 1997-2010. By analyzing the time-varying dynamics of stock market comovements on a scale-by-scale basis, we also examined how major events (financial crises in the investigated time period and entrance to the European Union) affected the comovement of CEE stock markets with developed European stock markets. The results of the unconditional correlation analysis show that the developed European stock markets of France, the UK, Germany and Austria were more interdependent in the observed period than the CEEs stock markets. The later group of countries exhibited a lower degree of comovement between themselves as well as with the developed European stock markets during all the observed time period. The Slovenian stock market was the least correlated with other stock markets. By using the rolling wavelet correlation technique, we wanted to answer the question as to how the correlation between CEE and developed stock markets changed over the observed period. In particular, we wanted to examine whether major economic (financial) and political events in the world and European economies (the Russian financial crisis, the dot-com financial crisis, the attack on the WTC, the CEE countries joining the European union, and the recent global financial crisis) have influenced the dynamics of CEE stock market comovements with developed European stock markets. The results show that stock market return comovements between CEE and developed European stock markets varied over time scales and time. At all scales and during the entire observed time period the Hungarian and Czech stock markets were more interconnected to developed European stock markets than the Slovenian stock market was. The highest comovement between the investigated CEE and developed European stock market returns was normally observed at the highest scales (scale 5, corresponding to stock market return dynamics over 32-64 days, and scale 6, corresponding to stock market return dynamics over 32-64 and 64-128 days). At all scales the Hungarian and Czech stock markets were more connected to developed European stock markets than the Slovenian stock market. We found that European integration lead to increased comovement between CEE and developed stock markets, while the financial crises in the observed period led only to short-term increases in stock market return comovements.","[Dajcman, Silvo; Kavkler, Alenka] Univ Maribor, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; [Festic, Mejra] Bank Slovenia, Ljubljana 1505, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si; mejra.festic@bsi.si; alenka.kavkler@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,42,25,26,1,37,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The estimated marginal cost of water supply of Sri Lankan rupees (SLRS) 16.50 per cubic metre in the short run, rising to SLRS 47.25 in the long run, suggests that water is under-priced under the current pricing regime. We find existence of economies of scale as well as significant substitution possibilities between inputs. Thus, under correct tariff regime, there is a scope to accelerate the expansion of water supply.","[Dharmaratna, Dinusha; Parasnis, Jaai] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Parasnis, J (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",jaai.parasnis@monash.edu,"Parasnis, Jaai/AEW-0288-2022","Parasnis, Jaai/0000-0002-0359-7477",,,,,30,9,9,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Using a large scale household survey conducted in 2002 we find that the level of optimism about the future is particularly strong in the countryside and amongst rural-to-urban migrants. The importance of these expectations for life satisfaction is particularly pronounced in the urban areas, though also highly significant for the rural area. If expectations were to reverse from positive to negative, we calculate that this would have doubled the proportion of unhappy people and reduced proportion of very happy people by 48 per cent. We perform several robustness checks to see if the results are driven by variations in precautionary savings or reverse causality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

They are also essential for meaningful crosscountry and crosstime comparisons of VAT compliance. We present a comprehensive and general framework for calculating VAT compliance rates at both the economy wide and detailed sectoral levels. Unlike existing measures of VAT compliance, our framework isolates a compliance measure from the effects on VAT receipts of detailed features of VAT systems as actually implemented by tax authorities. These features include multiple VAT rates, exemptions, registration rates, refund limitations, informal activity, taxation of domestic nonresidents and undeclared imports. We implement our comprehensive VAT compliance measure for Vietnam, a country with a complex VAT system. Our estimate of Vietnam's VAT compliance rate is about 13 percentage points higher than that calculated by the most popular measure of compliance, Collection Efficiency (CE). Our method facilitates decomposition of the difference between CE and our VAT compliance measure into individual contributions by the statutory and structural features of Vietnam's VAT regime.","[Giesecke, James; Nhi Hoang Tran] Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Giesecke, J (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Wellington Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",James.Giesecke@monash.edu,"Tran, Nhi/JUF-6013-2023","Giesecke, James/0000-0002-7283-0551",,,,,34,11,11,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using the Qu and Perron (2007) methodology, we endogenously identify three breaks in the nonlinear relationship across our 1970 to 2008 sample. We compute long-term multipliers and find that the response of output and inflation to oil price shocks is greatest in the 1970s and progressively disappears until the late 1990s. In contrast to the previous literature, we observe that both effects reappear in the 2000s, especially on inflation. Nevertheless, the transmission of oil price shocks to the economy is weaker than in the 1970s, which means that oil price shocks have lost some of their explanatory power. Precisely identifying these effects is crucial for the design of adequate economic measures to control or smoothen them.","[Gomez-Loscos, Ana; Dolores Gadea, Maria; Montanes, Antonio] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Gomez-Loscos, Ana] Fundear, Zaragoza 50001, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Gadea, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Gran Via 4, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",lgadea@unizar.es,"Montañés, Antonio/K-4306-2014; Gadea Rivas, Maria Dolores/K-1547-2014","Montañés, Antonio/0000-0002-5872-631X; Gadea Rivas, Maria Dolores/0000-0001-6609-4247",,,,,42,19,21,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Personnel selection is a big challenge in all types of companies, organizations and communities, involving multiple issues that should be evaluated simultaneously. A group as a team should work in the best form to attain its goals. Accordingly, a complex decision support methodology for effective team members' selection is required. The aim of the current research is to develop the decision model for human resource management that aggregates experts' knowledge and deals with uncertain information. The current paper considers a model based on hybrid Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods as a framework for the challenge of personnel selection. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution with Grey Relations (TOPSIS grey) are applied for this aim. AHP is used for identifying the importance of each criterion when selecting a group member. TOPSIS grey is applied for ranking of alternatives, i.e. particular personnel, characterized by a set of criteria that are determined by grey relations and expressed in intervals. A case study about process of selecting a new drummer for a rock band is presented to demonstrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed model. Criteria as technical ability, ability of accommodation to band and genre, discipline, ability to work with band (teamwork), general issues like age, behavior, ideology and etc., ability of composing and motivation are prioritized from the most important to the least important, respectively, based on AHP results. Four potential candidates are considered. One of them is selected as the best drummer for the band among four applicants based on TOPSIS grey results. The presented hybrid multiple criteria decision making helps to perform personnel selection effectively and objectively when multiple criteria are evaluated simultaneously. The first part of the proposed methodology, i.e. AHP is useful for determining the importance of each criterion and calculating weight of each criterion, while the second part with TOPSIS grey is useful for evaluating alternatives more precisely than usual crisp TOPSIS. The model can be implemented as an effective decision aid to improve human resources management in various areas of economic activities.","[Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz] Shomal Univ, Amol, Mazandaran, Iran; [Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz; Antucheviciene, Jurgita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Hashemkhani Zolfani, S (通讯作者)，Shomal Univ, POB 731, Amol, Mazandaran, Iran.",sa.hashemkhani@gmail.com; jurgita.antucheviciene@vgtu.lt,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani/AAA-9918-2021; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018","Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216",,,,,63,25,27,1,46,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We find, first, that both monetary policy actions and communications have a significant impact on market returns. Second, target rate change surprises are an important driver of emerging market returns. However, informal communications particularly when taking into account their higher frequency have a larger (cumulative) influence on returns than do target rate surprises. Third, during the recent financial crisis, central bank communication played an even more pronounced role.

It should be noted that current level of theoretical and empirical researches on phenomenon of hedonism in the theory of consumer behavior notes that hedonism as the expression of value has not been sufficiently analyzed. Theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated the lack of complex models integrating the relations of factors affecting hedonic value and consumers' behavior, behavioral outcomes. The scientific problem of this article is formulated with the help of the following questions: what factors determine consumers' perceived hedonic value and how, according to it, consumers' behavior varies? The objective of the article: to prepare a conceptual model of the relationship of consumers' perceived hedonic value and behavior that reveals main factors of the hedonic value and their affected direct and mediatory relations between hedonic value and consumer behavior. The performed analysis of scientific literature revealed the importance of cognition of the hedonic value and value factors. In this article three potential value factors were identified - social, emotional and epistemic. It was realized that each of value factors could influence consumer behavior and behavioral intentions. Therefore, having analyzed scientific literature, the authors of the article prepared a conceptual model of relationship of consumers' perceived hedonic value and behavior. In the conceptual model, direct and indirect relations among value factors (social, emotional and epistemic), hedonic value, consumers' perceived satisfaction and future behavioral intentions are analyzed. Considering theoretical findings, there are recommendations for future researches and empirical testing of conceptual model proposed.","[Kazakeviciute, Asta; Banyte, Jurate] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Kazakeviciute, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",kazakeviciute.asta@gmail.com; jurate.banyte@ktu.lt,,,,,,,33,24,27,16,86,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Thus selecting the most suitable system which minimizes the cost per ton and meets production needs is one of the main concerns of mine design and planning. It is also at times difficult to select the optimum equipment, as there are many possible options and influencing factors in selecting a system. Furthermore, some of these factors can be either quantitative or qualitative. As a result, the use of multi attribute decision making methods can be useful. In this article, the selection of the equipment fleet of Gole Gohar mine was done though four stages. First, feasible technical and operational options were determined. Next, the weights of influential criteria were determined using a hybrid method of fuzzy analytical hierarchical process and analytical network process. Then, the alternative preference rating matrix was calculated using fuzzy TOPSIS method and finally, the hierarchy of alternatives was decided by combining the available weight and ranking matrix. This model considers all affecting parameters simultaneously and facilitates making a reasonable decision about the most appropriate material handling equipment. For the purpose of evaluation in this method, the cost of each equipment fleet was assessed and compared using the traditional method. Results show that the use of the fleet of cable shovel and truck is the most economical loading and hauling system. The results not only indicate that proposed model offers chances to choose the best alternative among possible loading and hauling systems, but also help equipment managers to make an accurate and reasonable decision regarding all effective parameters.","[Lashgari, Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza; Fouladgar, Mohammad Majid] Fateh Res Grp, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Shafiee, Shahriar] CRCMinings Univ Queensland, Pinjarra, Qld 4069, Australia; [Abbate, Nick] JKTech Pty Ltd, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia",Islamic Azad University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; University of Queensland,"Lashgari, A (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.",ali.lashgari@gmail.com; a.yazdani@fatehidea.com; manager@fatehidea.com; Edmundas.Zavadskas@adm.vgtu.lt; s.shafiee@r2mining.com; n.abbate@jktech.com.au,"Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza/ABH-5851-2020; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza/0000-0001-5594-7726; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Lashgari, Ali/0000-0002-5174-8882",,,,,62,53,54,0,36,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

After controlling for capacity utilization, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) capital, outsourcing and global trade openness are found to have a statistically significant positive effect on MFP. The long run impact of ICT is small, but its recent contribution to MFP growth is sizeable for some industries, possibly reflecting the delayed benefits of the ICT investment surge in the late 1990s due to adjustment costs.

Moreover, the dominant local chain is found to behave differently depending on whether or not one of the national chains is present in the city.

Taken together, these findings lead to the conclusion that ULC is a reliable indicator of price inflation but productivity-adjusted hourly earnings is not. Thus, monetary policymakers are justified in using information about the behaviour of ULC in formulating policy actions for achieving the goal of price stability.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Nourzad, F (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",farrokh.nourzad@mu.edu,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Extending the Leontief model with a demand-driven consumption function does make that model more realistic. Extending the Ghosh model, however, makes it even more implausible in the case of a market economy, while it becomes even more problematic as a guide for a centrally planned economy. The prime reason is that complementarities between inputs are negated, not only for firms, but now also for households. Consequently, industry and aggregate output may now increase, while corresponding value added decreases, and vice versa.","Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Oosterhaven, J (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",j.oosterhaven@rug.nl,"Oosterhaven, Jan/ABA-1136-2021",,,,,,13,32,33,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

A simple inventory-based model shows that lower agency cost allows a bank to issue more loan commitments because lower agency cost alleviates the difficulty of liquidity management associated with loan commitments. Our empirical analysis confirms the model's testable implication: Commercial banks issue more loan commitments after interstate banking deregulation, which lowers agency costs through expanded internal capital markets across states. However, the effect of branching deregulation is weak or non-existent. Considering the role of bank loan commitments, this result not only shows how banking deregulation affects bank balance sheets but also suggests one route through which interstate banking affects the real economy.","Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Park, KY (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",kypark@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,25,3,3,1,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This article aims at avoiding these problems to provide consistent derivatives of leisure service expenditure elasticities. Therefore, a regular demand system is derived from microeconomic duality theory. To implement leisure specific demand factors (i.e. demand- and supply-based sports and recreational opportunities as well as sports and recreational preferences) while still being consistent with neoclassical demand theory, the basic model is extended by applying the demographic translation framework. Data of the continuous household budget survey (n = 7724) from Germany is used for the estimation of the derived demand system. It is shown how sensitive the results are depending on the applied (censored) regression model: 16 out of 18 analysed services are indicated as luxury goods based on the findings of the Tobit model type I but as necessities based on the findings of the Tobit model type II.

Considerable attention is paid to: (i) the selection of foreign, policy and target variables; (ii) establish identifying restrictions and improve the estimates of impulse response functions; (iii) assess the importance of intermediate channels in transmitting monetary policy mechanism; and (iv) the way in which the 1997 Asian financial crisis affected the working of monetary policy. Malaysia is an interesting small open economy to study because, following this crisis, the government imposed capital and exchange rate control measures. The overall results suggest that the crisis and the subsequent major shift in the exchange rate regime have significantly affected the Malaysian 'Black Box'. In the pre-crisis period, domestic variables appear to be more vulnerable to foreign monetary shocks. Further, the exchange rate played a significant role in transmitting the interest rate shocks, whereas credit and asset prices helped to propagate the money shock. In the post-crisis period however, asset prices play a more domineering role in intensifying the effects of both interest rate and money shocks on output, and the economy was insulated from foreign shocks.","[Silvapulle, Paramsothy; Athanasopoulos, George] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Raghavan, Mala] Univ Tasmania, Sch Econ & Finance, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia",Monash University; University of Tasmania,"Silvapulle, P (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, POB 197, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",param.silvapulle@monash.edu.au,"Raghavan, Mala V/G-5496-2014","Raghavan, Mala V/0000-0002-4123-5004; Athanasopoulos, George/0000-0002-5389-2802",,,,,23,18,20,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The authors have also checked the changes observed in the last years (2009 and 2010) in the reaction of trade flows to the factors considered in the model.

The global financial game system has appeared, with very low sensibility on the regulation coming outside. Former efficiency of interest rates and monetary base operations belongs already to the past. What is worse, the theory is not able to prepare new solutions or give something else instead. Perhaps the world (notably, the developed economies) have reached a break-even point, where even significant improvement of the standard monetary instruments, is not enough. A new package is needed, maybe the whole approach to the financial equilibrium should also be changed. The rise in labor productivity is accompanied by the falling power of employees representation, directing almost full income growth to the upper percentiles of the wealthy population. The rich, in turn, are marked by a low propensity to consume, and they direct a rising part of their revenues to the financial game. This process hampers the rise of demand which is necessary to maintain employment levels under the labor productivity growth. To avoid the outbreak of the next economic crisis, consumption must rise, especially its part derived from the public funds. Private consumption stopped to be the main growth driver. Public consumption could substitute it in this function, but its increase is prevented by big central budget debts. To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to raise the tax rates for the rich taxpayers or implement the non-orthodox monetary solution of directing money there, where efficient demand can be created.",,,,sopocko@mail.wz.uw.edu.pl,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,4,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2012,,4,,,,,449,486,,,,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,010IR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309088600003,0

Previous studies suggest that order imbalance can be a state variable in explaining cross sectional stock return. In this article, we examine dynamic relations between order imbalance, volatility and stock return of top gainers. Then, we develop an order imbalance based trading strategy and explain the causality. We employ a time varying Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model to investigate intraday dynamics among order imbalance, volatility and return. A significantly negative relation between order imbalance and volatility has been documented. The leverage effect proposed by Christie (1982) could explain the above result. Current period order imbalance explains current period volatility and stock return. Contemporaneous order imbalance has a significantly positive and lag-one order imbalance has a significantly negative influence on stock return. Time span of data and responsibility of market maker explain this phenomenon. Finally, we develop a profitable order imbalance based trading strategy. To explore the profitability of our trading strategy, we examine the causal relationship between return and order imbalance. We find that order imbalance is a good indicator for price discovery. Moreover, order imbalance is a better indicator for predicting returns in large firm size quartile.","[Huang, Han-Ching] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, Chungli, Taiwan; [Su, Yong-Chern; Lin, Shiue-Fang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University; National Taiwan University,"Huang, HC (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, Business Bldg 404A,4-F 200, Chungli, Taiwan.",samprass@cycu.edu.tw,,,,,,,26,5,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This aim determines the scope of the subject, which includes price changes in the secondary housing market, relating both to full and limited ownership rights to private accommodation. This research refers only to dwellings located in multi-family buildings. Such choice was determined by the two factors. Firstly, the majority of dwellings are located in multi-family residentials (dwelling blocks up to 90% in big Polish cities). Secondly., houses are characterized by great differentiation regarding both quantitative and qualitative features, which requires the database to include the appropriate information about each property in order to construct house price indices. On the other hand, the Polish secondary housing market is greater than the primary market (approximately up to three times) taking into consideration the number of transactions. The paper is divided into four parts. The first part provides the analysis of the the idea and meaning of house price indices. Then, the transaction and asking prices are described. In the following part, the hedonic methods are presented.

I analyze whether the willingness to punish harmful failures depends on how the harmed party has learned about the outcome. The harmed party can learn about the outcome via random detection or self-report by the performer. There are two major findings: first, confessions are a powerful instrument: punishment for confessed failures is less likely than for randomly detected failures. Second, confessions are much more likely to occur if there is no punishment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our investigation focuses on large-scale fossil-fueled generation technologies and is based on a stochastic model that uses copula functions to provide the input parameters of the real options model. We define the aggregated annual spread as assessment criteria for our investigation since it contains all relevant volatile input parameters that have an impact on the evaluation of investment decisions. We show that the specific characteristics of CHP plants, such as additional revenues from heat sales, promotion schemes, specific operational features, and a beneficial allocation of CO2 allowances, have a significant impact on the option value and therefore on the optimal timing for investment. For the two fossil-fueled CHP technologies investigated (combined-cycle gas turbine and steam turbine), we conclude from our analysis that a high share of CHP generation reduces the risk exposure for the investor. The maximal possible CHP generation depends significantly on the local heat demand in the surroundings of the power plant. Considering this, the size of the heat sink available could gain more relevance in the future selection process of sites for new large-scale fossil power plants. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Passengers on these important routes seem to have not been adversely impacted, and even in 2007, the airfares were not significantly higher than that of the 2002 level despite the rise in fuel price, which may provide some evidence to support the 2009 merger between China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines and justify a lenient anti-trust treatment of mergers in China's airline industry.

In particular, our analysis focuses on the context in which the Brito-Venditti system admits two balanced growth paths, each corresponding, after a change of variables, to an equilibrium point of a three-dimensional system, and proves the possible existence of points (P) over bar such that in any neighborhood of (P) over bar lying on the plane corresponding to fixed values of the state variables there exist points (Q) over bar whose positive trajectories tend to either equilibrium point. This implies that equilibrium selection in the Brito-Venditti system may depend on the expectations of economic agents rather than on the history of the economy. That is, economies with identical technologies and preferences, starting from the same initial values of the state variables (history), may follow rather different equilibrium trajectories according to the economic agents' choices of the initial values of the jumping variables (expectations). Moreover, we prove that the basins of attraction (two or three-dimensional) of locally indeterminate equilibrium points may be very large, as they can extend up to the boundary of the system phase space.","[Antoci, Angelo] Univ Sassari, DiSea, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Antoci, Angelo] Univ Sassari, CRENoS, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Galeotti, Marcello] Univ Florence, DiSIA, Florence, Italy",University of Sassari; University of Sassari; University of Florence,"Antoci, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, DiSea, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",angelo.antoci@virgilio.it,"Antoci, Angelo/AAG-2800-2021","Antoci, Angelo/0000-0003-3719-0437; russu, paolo/0000-0002-6999-7617",,,,,37,12,12,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

Commons's arguments regarding the relationship between law and capitalism with the legal adjudication of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. As going concerns, subprime lenders have opened up ambiguities in the law regarding the application of earlier legal frameworks to new profit-making activities. As with Commons's analysis of the nineteenth century legal reframing of property and value, this has promoted a range of legal projects that attempt to work through borrowers' remedial claims against lenders. In his work, Commons expressed a high degree of optimism that new authoritative sources would expand public powers to balance the growing economic power of financial and industrial going concerns. I argue that the last decade has seen substantial narrowing in the legal remedies available to borrowers who claim to have been harmed through their exposure to the subprime market. Even as highprofile enforcement actions against large lenders seem to represent the expansion of public powers to balance corporate power, I argue that the legal doctrines employed in these actions narrowly structure borrowers' remedial powers and employ certain legal techniques - most notably, a tendency to settle cases before trial and use of contract modifications - that transfer legal uncertainty back to borrowers and structure harm as legally unproblematic.","Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Ashton, P (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",,,"Ashton, Philip/0000-0001-9257-9424",,,,,32,10,12,0,7,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Workers and firms make uncoordinated investment choices prior to random matching. Investment choices depend on the expected productivity of the counterpart in production. The setting generates a potential human capital externality as a more skilled labor force induces more skilled job openings. Exploiting the externality is complicated by a market failure which may cause some workers to earn a degree but not put forth the effort required to become highly skilled.

With reputation, the equilibrium has pooling and adverse selection persists over time. The equilibrium is efficient unless collateral values are low and originators' reputational levels are low.

The ability to digest milk, or to be lactase persistent, is conferred by a gene variant that is unequally distributed across the Old World. Milk provided qualitative and quantitative advantages to the diet that led to differences in the carrying capacities of respective countries. It is shown through a number of specifications that country-level variation in the frequency of lactase persistence is positively and significantly related to population density in 1,500 CE; specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the frequency of lactase persistent individuals (roughly 24 percentage points) is associated with roughly a 40 % increase in precolonial population density. This relationship is robust to a large number of sample specifications and potentially omitted variables.","Univ Calif Merced, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA 95343 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced,"Cook, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Merced, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",jcook9@ucmerced.edu,,,,,,,71,20,21,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Unlike the related literature that studies the role of the psychological determinants of individual tax compliance, this paper focuses on the macroeconomic implications of the slippery slope framework. The main finding is that trust-building actions are better than deterring measures. In a society where the tax authority respects the taxpayers and applies transparent and fair procedures, in fact, trust and tax compliance are higher, tax evasion is lower and thus the level of taxation can be reduced. Hence, firms open more vacancies, thus increasing the employment rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

With individual-level data on antidepressant use from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we consider whether consumer responses to FDA warnings differ among targeted (children) and non-targeted (adult) age-groups. Because the warning labels specifically mentioned new users, we examine separately the effects of the warnings on initiations of antidepressant therapy and on continued use of antidepressants. We find evidence consistent with reduced initiation of antidepressant use among the intended population of children, and that usage among children with more highly educated parents responded earlier to FDA information. However, we also find spillover effects of reduced initiation among the non-targeted population of adults. Overall, our results indicate that the FDA warning may have led consumers to perceive risks beyond those specifically mentioned.","[Parkinson, Kristy] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Price, Joseph] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Simon, Kosali I.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA; [Tennyson, Sharon] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University; Brigham Young University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Cornell University,"Tennyson, S (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",sharon.tennyson@cornell.edu,"Tennyson, Sharon/G-8995-2015","Tennyson, Sharon/0000-0001-9674-6410; simon, kosali/0000-0002-3231-1466",,,,,38,7,9,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Keynes saw this policy as a way to help households raise their children and also as a way to increase consumption without reducing business investment. The paper goes on to argue that a policy of family allowances is consistent with Keynesian economics.

Our analysis finds an equilibrium where each consumer visits the platform first. The number of firms chosen by the platform is inversely related to search cost, due to the presence of two opposing effects: the competition-intensifying effect and the market-expansion effect.

We approach the latter by introducing a novel approach to country risk premiums that assumes that nominal exchange rates can move away from or towards equilibrium exchange rates, which allows exchange rate movements towards equilibrium to stimulate favourable competitiveness effects as opposed to adverse balance sheet effects. We investigate eight European emerging economies that suffer from original sin over the period 2001-2013, using the pooled mean group estimator of the dynamic panel error correction model. This methodology improves estimation efficiency and model performance, but also allows differentiation between long- and short-run country risk premium determinants. We find that, in the long run, country risk premiums increase in response to higher inflation and a higher total debt-to-GDP ratio, while they move in the opposite direction when the real GDP growth rate rises. Our results suggest that, in the short run, higher external debt service caused by exchange rate depreciation, i.e. the balance sheet effect, and market volatility tends to raise risk premiums, while higher international reserves and the federal funds rate tend to decrease them. Moreover, we show that the negative balance sheet effect is much stronger than the potentially favourable competitiveness effect, and that the rise in risk premiums is not due to the increase in the size of external debt, but to the larger debt burden represented by balance sheet effects.

Chenery and his coauthors (e.g., Chenery, 1960; Chenery et al., 1962; Chenery et al., 1986) and Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) model proposed by Syrquin (1976), this paper develops a new SDA model that directly interprets the changes of sectoral shares of output. In addition, our decomposition also demonstrates that on top of the three typical factors influencing the structural changes, i.e., the final-goods demand structure, production technology, and import substitution, the ratio of final-goods demand over total output (phi) is one of the key factors in the determination of industrial structures. This ratio is often neglected in the existing literature. Applying this model to study the change of industrial structure in China from 1992 to 2005, we find that since the 1990s, China's industrialization was associated with the rise of machinery and electrical industries, and the decline of chemical industry. The main driving force is the export (foreign) demand, however factors like production technological structure changes, and import substitution contributed negatively. Both production technological structure changes and import substitution are also key factors that hinder the transformation of Chinese economy to the service orientation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Today, the improved availability of statistical data and the progress of capital stock estimation methods have made it possible to produce datasets of WKS on the prefecture level. By applying the perpetual inventory method (PIM) to estimate prefecture-level WKS in China from 1978 to 2012, this paper aims to illustrate both the methodology for generating the WKS dataset and the utility of the WKS as a useful indicator of economic exposure to potential hazards. The estimation results indicate that the accumulated WKS for Mainland China had reached RMB 152 trillion by 2012, and it has maintained an average annual growth rate of 14% since 1990. Spatially, the uneven distribution of WKS is distinct, with approximately 47% being concentrated in the eastern economic region, and approximately 60% to 22% of China's prefectures. Methodologically, the dataset can easily be extended to more recent years with available data. Furthermore, a systematic sensitivity analysis indicates that the depreciation rate is the most important parameter for,WKS estimates. Notwithstanding certain limitations, the paper concludes that such WKS estimates, in particular with its finer spatial resolution, offer a useful baseline for quick disaster loss estimation.

It does not require whether a punishment can be justified for the deviation, which creates a great deal of freedom in constructing equilibrium strategies, resulting the well-known folk theorem. We introduce justifiable punishments in repeated games. After one player deviates, the corresponding continuation or punishment is justifiable if either the deviation is bad to the other player or the continuation itself is good to the other player. We characterize the set of payoff vectors that can be supported by subgame perfect equilibria with justifiable punishments, as the discount factor goes to one. This limiting set of equilibrium payoffs can be quite different from the set of subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs. Any efficient, feasible, and strictly individually rational payoff can be supported by equilibrium with justifiable punishments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Perhaps more puzzling is that for emerging economies saving-investment correlations tend to be significantly lower, though still positive. This deepens the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle because the mobility of capital is generally believed to be much lower in emerging economies than in advanced economies, and a country with less mobile capital should have a tighter relationship between local saving and investment rates. This paper develops a DSGE model that, without resorting to any real or financial friction, simultaneously explains these two aspects of the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle: positive saving-investment correlations in both advanced and emerging economies and significantly lower saving-investment correlations in emerging economies than in advanced economies. The main features of the model include long-run risk, an endogenous world interest rate, and cross-correlations of national and global shocks. The findings hold for both quarterly time series and long-run averages. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives of the paper are to highlight the many remaining gaps in the empirical literature and to provide guidelines for improving the current Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) literature that seeks to incorporate human health and adaptation in its framework. I begin by presenting the conceptual and methodological issues associated with the measurement of the effect of temperature extremes on health, and the role of adaptation in possibly muting these effects. The main conclusion that emerges from the literature is that despite the wide variety of data sets and settings most studies find that temperature extremes lead to significant reductions in health, generally measured with excess mortality. Regarding the role of adaptation in mitigating the effects of extreme temperature on health, the available knowledge is limited, in part due to the few real-world data sets on adaptation behaviors. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the currently available evidence for assessments of potential human health impacts of global climate change. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While this category of goods has expanded from household utilities, toll road access and software downloads to standard consumption goods paid by credit card or other bill-me-later-type systems, we know surprisingly little about how these payment patterns affect decisions. This paper exploits hourly household electricity consumption data collected by smart electricity meters to examine dynamic consumer behavior under intermittent expenditure signals. Households reduce consumption by 0.6-1% following receipt of an electricity bill, but the response varies considerably by household type and season. Our results also suggest that spending reminders can reduce peak demand, particularly during summer months. We discuss the implications for energy policy when intermittent billing combined with inattention induces consumption cycles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A theory of unpredictable behavior based on differential complexity constraints is presented in the context of repeated two-person zero-sum games. Each player's complexity constraint is represented by an endowed oracle and a strategy is feasible if it can be implemented with an oracle machine using that oracle. When one player's oracle is sufficiently more complex than the other player's, an equilibrium exists with one player fully exploiting the other. If each player has an incompressible sequence (relative to the opponent's oracle) according to Kolmogorov complexity, an equilibrium exists in which equilibrium payoffs are equal to those of the stage game and all equilibrium strategies are unpredictable.

A unique dataset of German households is used in this paper to examine the factors associated with the replacement of old incandescent lamps (Is) with new energy efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs). The 'rebound' effect of increased lamp luminosity in the transition to energy efficient bulbs is analyzed jointly with the replacement decision to account for household self-selection in bulb-type choice. Results indicate that the EU ban on Its accelerated the pace of transition to CFLs and LEDs, while storage of bulbs significantly dampened the speed of the transition. Higher lighting needs and bulb attributes like energy efficiency, environmental friendliness, and durability spur IL replacement with CFLs or LEDs. Electricity gains from new energy efficient lighting are mitigated by 23% and 47% increases in luminosity for CR. and LED replacements, respectively. Model results suggest that taking the replacement bulb from storage and higher levels of education dampen the magnitude of these luminosity rebounds in IL to CFL transitions. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Bulls buy in period 1 but receive arbitrage losses. When the number of bulls and bears approaches infinity, the equilibrium converges to the REE. Without short-sale constraints there is a non-revealing equilibrium but no revealing equilibrium. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The California cap and trade scheme imposes limits on allowance ownership, uses a tiered price containment reserve sale, and settles allowance auctions based on the lowest accepted bid. We examine the effects of these features on market liquidity, efficiency, and price variability. We find that tight holding limits substantially reduce banking, which, in turn reduces market liquidity. This impairs the ability of traders to smooth prices over time, resulting in lower efficiency and higher price variability. The price containment reserve, while increasing the supply of allowances available to traders, does not appear to mitigate the effects of tight holding limits on market outcomes. As a result, the imposition of holding limits in the allowance market may have the consequence of increasing the likelihood of the market manipulation that they were intended to prevent. Finally, we find that the choice between lowest accepted bid and highest rejected bid for the allowance auction pricing rule does not have a significant effect on market outcomes.

In multi-unit auctions, bids for marginal units may affect payments for inframarginal units, giving rise to demand reduction and furthermore to incentives for shading bids differently across units. We establish that such differential bid shading results generically in ex post inefficient allocations in the uniform-price and pay-as-bid auctions. We also show that, in general, the efficiency and revenue rankings of the two formats are ambiguous. However, in settings with symmetric bidders, the pay-as-bid auction often outperforms. In particular, with diminishing marginal utility, symmetric information and linearity, it yields greater expected revenues. We explain the rankings through multi-unit effects, which have no counterparts in auctions with unit demands. We attribute the new incentives separately to multi-unit (but constant) marginal utility and to diminishing marginal utility. We also provide comparisons with the Vickrey auction.","[Ausubel, Lawrence M.; Cramton, Peter] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Pycia, Marek] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Rostek, Marzena; Weretka, Marek] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Ausubel, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"Cramton, Peter/ABG-7651-2021","Cramton, Peter/0000-0001-8621-1092",,,,,53,117,130,0,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

I estimate a labour supply and labour demand model with heterogeneous types of labour to analyse the effects of market forces and wage rigidity on changes in skill-group labour market outcomes. The results provide evidence in favor of the Krugman hypothesis when France is compared to the USA and the UK.

This paper discusses two such models (trade unions and oligopsony), although there are many more. It also asks if imperfectly competitive models should be used whenever researchers are modeling the labor market. Some people would argue for this only in cases when the predictions and comparative statics of the imperfectly competitive model differ from those of the competitive model. Of course, to know this, one needs to know precisely what the predictions and comparative statics of the respective models are. Moreover, for policymakers to be able to determine if an intervention is required in the first place, there does need to be some analytical framework to act as a guide. In the perfectly competitive model of the labor markets, for example, typically no intervention or regulation would be justified. However, labor economics has moved far beyond this position, with the incorporation of new ideas into modeling wage determination in imperfectly competitive labor markets, and with the availability of better datasets to facilitate empirical investigation.

When recipients face aid absorption constraints, allocations that favor poorer recipients are not always optimal, contrary to what is assumed in assessments of donor performance. The most quantitatively significant factors that determine the optimal sensitivity to recipient characteristics are the generosity of the aid budget and the extent of absorption constraints. In neoclassical recipients, aid can only accelerate growth where there is already growth, so the optimal rule places little weight on growth and optimality is largely a matter of balancing recipient need against absorption constraints.

We demonstrate that if the proportion of high-value consumers is over (respectively, under) 1/2 of the total consumers, a firm has an incentive to select a large (respectively, small) quality gap among products. Therefore, there exists a cut-off level for status concerns, which eliminates quality differences, and the firm assigns the same quality to all the consumers. These results indicate that consumers' qualities will reflect distortions at the top and bottom.

I develop a model based on search and matching theory and close it by specifying a state of household confidence that is assumed to take one of two sunspot-driven values: normal or exuberant. The model generates a substantial increase in house prices and stable rents as the probability of the exuberant state increases, driven by self-fulfilling beliefs.

It begins with a demonstration that only strictly prorated author credit induces researchers to choose efficient sized teams. Nevertheless, survey evidence reveals that most economics departments only partially prorate authorship credit, implying excessive coauthorship. Indeed, a half-century increase in coauthorship may be better explained by incomplete proration than by any increased specialization among authors. A possible explanation for the reliance on incomplete proration is the self-interest of economists who are more likely to engage coauthorship-full professors. The self-interest of senior faculty may also explain the relatively small role given to citations in senior promotions. A rational response by economists to the under-proration of author credit is to engage in false authorship. Although false authorship is of dubious ethical status, it may have the perverse impact of improving the efficiency of team production. Grossly excessive coauthorship, where little attention is paid to most authors listed on a paper, as found in some other academic disciplines, may be the path down which economics is headed if the reward structure is not altered.","Univ Texas Dallas, Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Liebowitz, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Jindal Sch Management, Mail Stn SM31,800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",liebowit@utdallas.edu,"Liebowitz, Stan J/B-4135-2010",,,,,,23,23,23,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

In the context of electricity markets, I show how the auction structure and bidding data can be used to estimate these complementarities, which in these markets arise due to startup costs. I find that startup costs are substantial and that taking them into account helps better explain firm bidding strategies and production patterns. As in other dynamic settings, I find that startup costs limit the ability of firms to change production over time, exacerbating fluctuations in market prices. These fluctuations can induce estimates of market power that ignore dynamic costs to overstate markup volatility, with predicted markups that can be even negative in periods of low demand. I show how accounting for startup costs can provide a natural correction for these markup biases.","Stanford GSB, Stanford, CA USA",,"Reguant, M (通讯作者)，Stanford GSB, Stanford, CA USA.",,,"Reguant, Mar/0000-0001-8877-5780",,,,,29,59,75,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In 1950, the richest countries attained an average of 8 years of schooling whereas the poorest countries 1.3 years, a large 6-fold difference. By 2005, the difference in schooling declined to 2-fold because schooling increased faster in poor than in rich countries. What explains educational attainment differences across countries and their evolution over time? We consider an otherwise standard model of schooling featuring non-homothetic preferences and a labor supply margin to assess the quantitative contribution of productivity and life expectancy in explaining educational attainment. A calibrated version of the model accounts for 90 percent of the difference in schooling levels in 1950 between rich and poor countries and 71 percent of the faster increase in schooling over time in poor relative to rich countries. These results suggest an alternative view of the determinants of low education in developing countries that is based on low productivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

There are, however, good reasons to suppose that the degree of price flexibility adjusts endogenously to changes in monetary conditions. This article extends the standard new Keynesian model to incorporate an endogenous degree of price flexibility. The model shows that endogenizing the degree of price flexibility tends to shift optimal monetary policy towards complete inflation stabilization, even when shocks take the form of cost-push disturbances. This contrasts with the standard result obtained in models with exogenous price flexibility, which show that optimal monetary policy should allow some degree of inflation volatility to stabilize the welfare-relevant output gap.","[Senay, Ozge; Sutherland, Alan] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Senay, O (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",os12@st-andrews.ac.uk; ajs10@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Senay, Ozge/0000-0002-8310-968X; Sutherland, Alan/0000-0002-0175-3886",,,,,21,3,3,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The main contribution of the paper relates to the ethnic divide in Kazakhstan, which is the home of a big ethnic Russian community, adding to the scarce literature on ethnic differences in migration patterns. Against this background we investigate whether the determinants of interregional mobility depend on ethnicity. In line with traditional economic theory we find that migration is determined by economic factors, first of all wage. As predicted by gravity arguments, mobility is larger between more populated regions and distance has a strong negative impact on migration, indicating high migration-related costs. Most likely caused by stronger family ties and kinship bonds, the deterring effect of distance is higher for ethnic Kazakhs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Fairness requires that each agent weakly prefers his consumption bundle to any other agent's bundle. In this context, fairness is incompatible with budget balance and nonmanipulability (Green and Laffont 1979). Our approach here is to weaken or abandon nonmanipulability. We search for the rules that are minimally manipulable among all fair and budget-balanced rules. First, we show for a given preference profile, all fair and budget-balanced rules are either (all) manipulable or (all) nonmanipulable. Hence, measures based on counting profiles where a rule is manipulable or considering a possible inclusion of profiles where rules are manipulable do not distinguish fair and budget-balanced rules. Thus, a finer measure is needed. Our new concept compares two rules with respect to their degree of manipulability by counting for each profile the number of agents who can manipulate the rule. Second, we show that maximally preferred fair allocation rules are the minimally (individually and coalitionally) manipulable fair and budget-balanced allocation rules according to our new concept. Such rules choose allocations with the maximal number of agents for whom the utility is maximized among all fair and budget-balanced allocations.","[Andersson, Tommy; Svensson, Lars-Gunnar] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Ehlers, Lars] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Ehlers, Lars] Univ Montreal, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Lund University; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Andersson, T (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",tommy.andersson@nek.lu.se; lars.ehlers@umontreal.ca; lars-gunnar.svensson@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,33,21,21,0,12,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

To supplement this formal standard setting process, it has thus become frequent that part of the involved firms creates ad hoc consortia to better align positions on a common technology roadmap. This paper aims to assess whether such consortia can effectively mitigate R&D coordination failure through enhanced cooperation. We first develop a theoretical model showing that depending on the nature of firms' incentives to contribute proprietary technology, different types of R&D coordination failure - namely a Public Good or Rent Seeking problem - may occur in equilibrium. Using a large panel of standards, we then confirm empirically the prediction that consortia have different effects on innovation under a Public Good or Rent Seeking regime. Overall, we observe an increase in innovation after a firm joined a consortium. However, this effect is significantly weakened or even reversed for standards characterized by a strong Rent Seeking regime. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A burgeoning number of papers have examined the housing market in the postreform People's Republic of China from various perspectives. This paper aims to provide a thorough survey of the key literature in the field and then supply a complete picture of the dynamics of the housing market in the People's Republic of China. To assess the functional efficiency of this nascent market, we pay particular attention to the literature that is related to the academic debate over the Chinese housing bubble issue. The structure and operation of the housing market is another major concern in this paper. Finally, we summarize the key insights of the literature that we surveyed, note research gaps in the literature, and discuss further research directions in this field.","[Chen, Jie] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Han, Xuehui] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Asian Development Bank,"Han, XH (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines.",xuehuihan@adb.org,"Chen, Jie/D-5868-2018","Chen, Jie/0000-0002-9254-4413; Han, Xuehui/0000-0003-2152-798X",,,,,107,39,41,1,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The middleaged choose informal care provided to their parents and education expenditures for their children. The young enjoy their education, while the old may leave a bequest to their children. Within each period the three generations play a game inspired by Becker's (1974, 1991) rotten kids framework, with the added features that the rotten kids turn into the altruistic parent in the next period and that parents invest in the education of their children. We show that Becker's rotten kids theorem holds for the single period game in that informal aid is set according to an efficient rule. However, education is distorted upwards. In the stationary equilibrium the levels of both transfers are inefficient: education is too large and informal aid is too low. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Popular methods aggregate the statements of experts in different ways. As such, there are various reasonable ranking methods, each one of them more or less adapted to the environment under consideration. This paper introduces a new method, called the handicap-based method, and characterizes it through appealing properties. This method assigns not only scores to the items, but also weights to the experts. Scores and weights form an equilibrium for a relationship based on the notion of handicaps. The method is, in a sense made precise in the paper, the counterpart to the counting method in environments that require intensity invariance. Intensity invariance is a desirable property when the intensity of the experts' statements has to be controlled. Otherwise, both the counting and the handicap-based methods satisfy a property called homogeneity, which is a desirable property when cardinal statements matter, as is the case in many applications.","Paris Sch Econ EHESS, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Demange, G (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ EHESS, Paris, France.",demange@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,24,15,15,0,7,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The proposed standards require coal-fired power plants to have approximately the same carbon emissions as an uncontrolled natural gas-fired power plant, effectively mandating the adoption of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies for new coal plants. However, given the uncertainty in the capital and operating costs of a commercial scale coal plant with CCS, the impact of such a standard is not apparent a priori. We apply a stochastic generation expansion model to determine the impact of CO2 emission standards on generation investment.decisions, and in particular for coal plants with CCS. Moreover, we demonstrate how the incentive to invest in coal-CCS from emission standards depends on the natural gas price, the CO2 price, and the enhanced oil recovery price, as well as on the level of the emission standard. This analysis is the first to consider the entire power system and at the same time allow the capture percentage for CCS plants to be chosen from a continuous range to meet the given standard at minimum cost. Previous system level studies have assumed that CCS plants capture 90% of the carbon, while studies of individual units have demonstrated the costs of carbon capture over a continuous range. We show that 1) currently proposed levels of emission standards are more likely to shift fossil fuel generation from coal to natural gas rather than to incentivize investment in CCS; 2) tighter standards that require some carbon reductions from natural gas-fired power plants are more likely than proposed standards to incentivize investments in CCS, especially on natural gas plants, but also on coal plants at high gas prices; and 3) imposing a less strict emission standard (emission rates higher than natural gas but lower than coal; e.g., 1500 lbs/MWh) is more likely than current proposals to incentivize investment in coal CCS technology, but only at high gas prices and to a lesser extent than a stringent standard (e.g., 300 lbs/MWh). 2014 Elsevier ay.

The trajectory of emissions has changed radically since then, as China has implemented its Cancun 2010 commitment to reduce the 2005 emissions intensity of economic activity by 40-45 percent by 2020. The change in trajectory has been reinforced by China's new model of economic growth, with its greater emphasis on equity in income distribution, consumption and services. The large-scale deployment of low emissions technology in China is lowering the cost of transition to a low carbon economy all over the world. China's new emissions trajectory improves the opportunity for the international community to meet the 2 degrees C climate target.

As each retailer added both stores and global procurement centers, they created unique footprints that caused Chinese cities to be differentially exposed to the activities of these global retailers. We exploit these differences to identify the effect of multinational retailer presence on city-country exports of retail goods. We find robust evidence that increased exposure to multinational retailers was followed by rising exports. Since the export expansions are not limited to the connections formed by the retailers' bilateral networks, our evidence suggests that the growing presence of global retailers operated, at least in part, by enhancing the general export capabilities of the affected cities.

The main mechanisms have been the rapid pace of technological and social innovation, human capital accumulation, and the conversion of resources and natural capital into more valuable forms of produced capital. However, there is evidence emerging that this model may be approaching environmental limits and planetary boundaries, and that the conversion of natural capital needs to slow down rapidly and then be reversed. Some commentators have asserted that in order for this to occur, we will need to stop growing altogether and, instead, seek prosperity without growth. Others argue that environmental concerns are low-priority luxuries to be contemplated once global growth has properly returned to levels observed prior to the 2008 financial crisis. A third group argues that there is no trade-off, and, instead, promotes green growth: the (politically appealing) idea is that we can simultaneously grow and address our environmental problems. This paper provides a critical perspective on this debate and suggests that a substantial research agenda is required to come to grips with these challenges. One place to start is with the relevant metrics: measures of per-capita wealth, and, eventually, quantitative measures of prosperity, alongside a dashboard of other sustainability indicators. A public and political focus on wealth (a stock), and its annual changes, could realistically complement the current focus on market-based gross output as measured by GDP (a flow). This could have important policy implications, but deeper changes to governance and business models will be required.","[Hepburn, Cameron; Beinhocker, Eric; Farmer, J.

This study investigates behaviour of urban money lenders in Uzbekistan. Money lending in Uzbekistan is a relatively new business which emerged mostly in response to targeted demand from fellow entrepreneurs during transition. We find that their lending behaviour is more stringent than suggested by previous studies of rural money lenders. They always require collateral, do not engage with the poor and avoid lending for consumption purposes. Their lending is short-term and targeted on specific business opportunities which enjoy healthy cash flows and offer quick returns. They have limited outreach from serving networks of connections within small geographical localities. Since they rely exclusively on their own resources for loanable funds, they often have to ration their loans. They actively use all available information and instruments to reduce default risks. Although borrowers live in closer geographical proximity to lenders in urban areas, they are also engaged in various heterogeneous activities and are more self-reliant with respect to the local community, which reduces the accuracy of money lenders' assessment of the character of borrowers as well as of their ability to repay.","[Ruziev, Kobil] Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Midmore, Peter] Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales",University of West England; Aberystwyth University,"Ruziev, K (通讯作者)，Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",Kobil.Ruziev@uwe.ac.uk,"Ruziev, Kobil/ACI-4200-2022","Ruziev, Kobil/0000-0001-8047-3657",,,,,65,9,9,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,SEP,2014,26.0,3,,,,,415,435,,10.1080/14631377.2014.937107,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AO7HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341523600007,0

We estimate a probit model considering the mergers and acquisitions (M&As) announced by European listed firms (19 countries) that acquires worldwide listed or unlisted firms (36 countries) in the period 2002-2007. Our results show that managerial opportunism is a determinant in the acquisition of listed firms, occurring with greater probability in acquiring countries with low shareholder and minority shareholder protection. Information asymmetry is another relevant determinant that promotes the acquisitions of unlisted firms. Furthermore, the less developed the capital market in the country of the acquired firm, the greater the probability of acquisitions of unlisted firms. This article contributes to the M&A literature by showing that in addition to managerial opportunism and information asymmetry, the legal and institutional environments in both the acquiring and the target countries are also relevant aspects explaining the decision of whether to acquire listed or unlisted firms.","[Feito-Ruiz, Isabel] Univ Leon, Dept Business Adm, E-24071 Leon, Spain; [Fernandez, Ana I.; Menendez-Requejo, Susana] Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain",Universidad de Leon; University of Oviedo,"Feito-Ruiz, I (通讯作者)，Univ Leon, Dept Business Adm, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",ifeir@unileon.es,"Susana, Menéndez-Requejo/L-2878-2014; Feito-Ruiz, Isabel/H-4278-2015","Susana, Menéndez-Requejo/0000-0003-1641-5692; Feito-Ruiz, Isabel/0000-0001-7620-5756",,,,,44,11,13,0,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper examines the nature of FDI-related productivity spillovers in China's manufacturing sector. The empirical analysis based on firm level panel data, over the period 2000-2007, reveals that productivity spillovers arising from FDI from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan exhibit not only heterogeneity but also curvilinearity. The size of the spillovers depends on firm age, capital intensity and ownership structure. We find that FDI-related spillovers from the rest of the world are heterogeneous but not curvilinear. We find that the size of productivity spillovers depends on firm size and product quality. The analysis presented in this paper sheds some light on the complex pattern of FDI-related spillovers.

In contrast, the asymptotic Wald test exhibits serious size distortion, severely over-rejecting the true null hypothesis in small samples.

In a simple business cycle model, such signals can explain why we observe (i) occasional large changes in macroeconomic aggregate variables without a correspondingly large change in underlying fundamentals, (ii) persistent periods of high macroeconomic volatility and, (iii) a positive correlation between absolute changes in macro-variables and the cross-sectional dispersion of survey expectations.","[Nimark, Kristoffer P.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Nimark, Kristoffer P.] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Barcelona School of Economics,"Nimark, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",knimark@crei.cat,,,,,,,47,51,60,0,24,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We find evidence that this positive correlation partly comes from the imperfect substitutability of natives and immigrants within education/experience cells. Specifically, (i) the occupational distribution of natives and immigrants within these cells is more dissimilar when there are more immigrants in the cell; (ii) natives tend to perform more abstract tasks when there are more immigrants in the cell; and (iii) an important part of the positive relation between immigration and wages comes from a reallocation of natives to better-paid occupations within the cells. However, we argue that this positive correlation is also likely to be related to the inability of the Borjas (2003) model to perfectly account for the important changes in the wage distribution and the educational level characterizing the French economy in this period.

Our model emphasizes the influences of population aging and of the stock of household wealth in an explanation of the past and likely future of this tax source. Simulations with the model using U.N. demographic projections and projections of household wealth suggest that even in France and Germany where reliance on wealth transfer taxation has been increasing for part of the period studied, wealth transfer taxes can be expected to wither away as population aging deepens over the next two decades. Our results indicate that recent tax designs that rely upon the taxation of wealth transfers to preserve equity in the face of declining taxation of capital incomes may be, in this respect, politically infeasible for the foreseeable future. We conclude by using the case of wealth transfer taxation to raise the general question of the extent to which the consistency of a proposed reform with expected political equilibria ought to play a role in the design of a normative policy blueprint.","[Profeta, Paola] Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy; [Scabrosetti, Simona] Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Winer, Stanley L.] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Bocconi University; University of Pavia; Carleton University,"Profeta, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy.",paola.profeta@unibocconi.it; simona.scabrosetti@unipv.it; stanley.winer@carleton.ca,"Winer, Stanley L/GLS-3909-2022","Winer, Stanley L/0000-0001-9128-0797; SCABROSETTI, SIMONA/0000-0002-0142-6439",,,,,61,10,10,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

To examine this twofold feature, we apply Blanchard and Katz's (Brookings Pap Econ Act 1:1-75, 1992) methodology and evaluate how the Spanish labour market reacts to regional employment shocks in a variety of cases. Shock responses are channelled via changes in unemployment, labour market participation, and spatial mobility. Our results provide evidence of asymmetric responses across business cycle phases (1996-2007 and 2008-2012). While changes in participation rates are the main adjustment mechanism in expansion, unemployment and spatial mobility become the central ones in recession. We also provide evidence of real wage rigidities in both periods, due to rigidities in both nominal wages and consumer prices. We conclude with a cluster analysis showing that high and low unemployment regions have similar responses in the short-run while, in the long-run, the former are more reactive in terms of spatial mobility. Overall, we provide evidence that people in a region are more willing to migrate (relative to the national average) when a regional shock occurs in relatively worse economic contexts.","[Sala, Hector; Trivin, Pedro] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Sala, Hector] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Autonomous University of Barcelona; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Sala, H (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",hector.sala@uab.es; pedro.trivin@uab.es,"Sala, Hector/K-6370-2017","Sala, Hector/0000-0002-3043-2790; Trivin, Pedro/0000-0003-2277-0279",,,,,32,17,17,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

The results of the ARDL bound testing indicate the presence of cointegration relationships among the variables. The estimated long-run impact of gas consumption on economic growth is greater than other factor inputs suggesting that energy is a critical driver of production and growth in Pakistan. Furthermore, the results of causality test suggest that natural gas consumption and economic growth are complements. Given that natural gas constitutes to the primary source of energy in Pakistan, the implication of this study is that natural gas conservation policies could harm growth and, therefore, requires the policy makers to improve the energy supply efficiency as well as formulate appropriate policies to attract investment and establish public-private partnership initiatives.

Analysing the factors that increase a broadcaster's propensity to display a sponsor during television broadcasts is often hard to measure. Using a unique data set describing NASCAR broadcasts, we indirectly analyse what influences the value of a sponsorship contract through a proxy for driver sponsorship value: the value of time on camera (VTOC). We find that the VTOC is influenced by driver performance and their celebrity status, as measured by driver experience and inherited brand-name capital. Although the values of individual sponsorship contracts are generally not reported, the evidence herein suggests that driver performance and status likely influence the value of NASCAR sponsorship contracts.","[Rotthoff, Kurt William] Seton Hall Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studis, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA; [Depken, Craig A.] UNC Charlotte, Dept Econ, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Groothuis, Peter A.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA",Seton Hall University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Rotthoff, KW (通讯作者)，Seton Hall Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studis, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA.",rotthoff@gmail.com,"Depken, Craig/K-9496-2019","Rotthoff, Kurt/0000-0001-7874-2088",,,,,26,2,3,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The analysis proceeds in two stages. In the first, the performance of the two categories of funds is measured using partial frontier methods. In the second stage, we use quantile regression techniques. By combining two variants of the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) methods (order-m and order-alpha) in the first stage of analysis and quantile regression in the second stage, we provide detailed analyses of the impact of different covariates across methods and across different quantiles. In spite of the differences in the screening criteria and portfolio management of both types of funds, variation in the performance is only found for some of the quantiles of the conditional distribution of mutual fund performance. We established that for the most inefficient funds the superior performance of SRI funds is significant. In contrast, for the best mutual funds this evidence vanished and even Islamic funds perform better than SRI. These results show the benefits of performing the analysis using quantile regression.

This paper examines the impact on birth outcomes of children of female workers who are affected by smoking bans in the workplace. Analyzing a 2004 law change in Norway that extended smoking restrictions to bars and restaurants, we find that children of female workers in restaurants and bars born after the law change saw significantly lower rates of being born below the very low birth weight (VLBW) threshold and were less likely to be born pre-term. We do not find an effect of the ban along other birth outcomes like APGAR scores and birth defects. Using detailed data on smoking status during pregnancy we find that most of the health benefits come from changes in smoking behavior of the mother.

In contrast to conventional models of insurance, the insurer has a non-zero probability of insolvency which depends on the distribution of the risks, the premium rate, and the amount of capital in the company. When the insurer is insolvent, each loss reduces the indemnity available to the victims, thus generating negative pecuniary externalities. Our model shows that government-provided insurance will be more attractive in terms of expected utility, as it allows these negative pecuniary externalities to be spread equally among policyholders. However, when heterogeneous risks are introduced, a government program may be less attractive in safer areas, which could yield inefficiency if insurance ratings are not chosen appropriately.

Financial literacy programs have become an increasingly popular way to try and address this issue, but to date there is no evidence that they are effective in inducing savings among remittance-receiving households, nor is it clear whether such programs are best targeted at the migrant, the remittance receiver, or both. We conducted a randomized experiment in Indonesia which allocated female migrants and their families to a control group, a migrant-only training group, a family member-only training group, and a training group in which both the migrant and a family member were trained. Three rounds of follow-up surveys are then used to measure impacts on the financial knowledge, behaviors, and remittance and savings outcomes of the remaining household. We find that training both the migrant and family member together has large and significant impacts on knowledge, behaviors, and savings. Training the family member alone has some positive, but smaller effects, while training only the migrant leads to no impacts on the remaining family members. The results show that financial education can have large effects when provided at a teachable moment, but that this impact varies greatly with who receives training.

This paper uses a laboratory experiment to explore how commitment problems undermine the validity of the PCT. Overall, the results support theoretical predictions. In particular, commitment issues matter, and the existence of more commitment possibilities leads to better social outcomes. Moreover, we find that the link is valid when commitment possibilities are asymmetrically distributed between players and even when a redistribution of political power is required to take advantage of those possibilities. However, we also find that at low levels of commitment there is more cooperation than strictly predicted by our parameterized model while the opposite is true at high levels of commitment, and only large improvements in commitment opportunities have a significant effect on the social surplus, while small changes do not.

We develop a dynamic two-region model, in which each region suffers from global warming, but also has an inequality aversion over current consumption allocations. Inequality aversion generally lifts the consumption path of the poor region, while the rich region must take a greater share of the climate burden. Furthermore, with inequality aversion, the optimal climate policy generally leads to higher investment in clean capital in the North and in dirty capital in the South, thereby allowing the South to pollute more and develop faster. The optimal policy may even require the poor region to increase emissions relative to the uncoordinated Business-as-Usual case. Introducing local pollution and transfers confirm the main results.

In this article, we seek to resolve this impasse by distinguishing between uncertainty of outcome in the short run and uncertainty of outcome in the long run. We also show that it is important to control for the independent effect of absolute team strength when testing the uncertainty of outcome hypothesis. Using data on over 380 Test cricket matches played in England, Australia and New Zealand since 1980, we find that short-run uncertainty of outcome has a significant impact on attendance demand and that absolute team strength has better explanatory power for attendance demand than does long-run uncertainty of outcome.

In these countries the decentralisation process involves a vertical gap, i.e. an imbalance between the cost of local public competences and local governments' revenue-raising powers. Our analysis considers the crowding-in (or crowding-out) effect of simple unconditional central grants on local own-source revenue. We demonstrate a theoretical ambiguity concerning the nature of this effect by taking into account the collection costs of local governments' own revenue. Our empirical analysis focuses on Benin. We study the impact of a very simple grant that is collected at the border by Customs and is allocated to local governments through a fixed rule (based on population). Our empirical analysis covers panel data for the seventy-seven Benin communes (local governments) from 2003 to 2008, and addresses the potential endogeneity issues of transfer from the centre. We conclude unambiguously that there is a positive impact of this grant on local own-source revenue. This effect is contingent on a minimum level of wealth of the commune and is stronger for local governments that do not share the same political affiliation as the president in office. Our result emphasises a neglected property of those unconditional transfers whose allocation rule is solely population based: their complementarity with local own-source revenue. Such transfers are not only simpler than other formula-based equalisation transfers, but they may also have an incentive effect on local own-source revenue.","[Caldeira, Emilie; Rota-Graziosi, Gregoire] Univ Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Rota-Graziosi, Gregoire] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); International Monetary Fund,"Caldeira, E (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, 65 Blvd Franois, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",emilie.caldeira@udamail.fr,,"Rota-Graziosi, Gregoire/0000-0002-9085-6974",,,,,37,17,19,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Using a rich panel data set of broadband plans, we find a positive effect of downstream speed on prices, and that the price per Mbps of cable modem and fibre technologies is lower than that of xDSL. Operators' marketing strategies are also analysed as we show how much prices rise when the broadband service is offered in a bundle with voice telephony and/or television, and how much they fall when download volume caps are included. The most insightful results of this study are provided by a group of metrics that represent the situation of competition and entry patterns in the broadband market. We show that consumer segmentation positively affects prices. Moreover, broadband prices are higher in countries where entrants make greater use of bitstream access and lower in countries where there is an intensive use of direct access (local loop unbundling).

Our main results are the following. Underreaction to probabilities modifications is in general independent from standard risk aversion and prudence. In models involving probabilities transformation functions, it is characterized by the slope of the probability transformation function. In the MaxMin expected utility model under risk, it is related to the weights of the maximal and minimal consequences in the preferences representation function. Considering a simple prevention decision, consisting in the reduction in the probability of a monetary loss, we show that individuals who underreact to probabilities modifications, invest less in prevention than individuals who objectively evaluate these modifications. Underreaction to probabilities modification is thus a possible explanation for low investment in prevention.","[Etner, Johanna] EconomiX & Climate Econ Chair, Paris, France; [Jeleva, Meglena] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Nanterre, France",Universite Paris Nanterre,"Jeleva, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Nanterre, France.",Meglena.Jeleva@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,6,6,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

However, very little is known as to whether these effects vary across the consumption distribution. This study expands upon the previous work by examining changes in the consumption distribution between the non-retired and the retired using quantile regression techniques on pseudo-cohorts from the cross-sectional data of the 1990-2007 Consumer Expenditure Survey. The results indicate that there are insignificant changes between these groups at the lower end of the consumption distribution, while there are significant decreases at the higher end of this distribution. In addition, these changes in the distribution are gradually larger in magnitude when moving from the lower end to the higher end, which is found using several different measures of consumption. Work-related expenditures are instead shown to decrease uniformly across the consumption distribution. This evidence reveals that there is a progressive distributional component to the retirement consumption puzzle.","[Fisher, Jonathan D.] US Bur Census, New York Census Res Data Ctr, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Marchand, Joseph T.] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); University of Alberta,"Marchand, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, 7-29 HM Tory, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",jonathan.fisher@census.gov; joseph.marchand@ualberta.ca,"Marchand, Joseph/GSD-7311-2022","Marchand, Joseph/0000-0002-5894-320X",,,,,24,4,4,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

We first develop a two-period dynamic model of individual choice, considering an individual that has been already audited and detected as tax evader, who knows that Tax Authorities are looking for her to cash the due amount. We derive the optimal decision of running away in order to avoid paying the bill, and show that the experience of a prior tax notice reduces the probability to behave as a scofflaw. We then exploit information on 'post-audit, post-detection' tax compliance provided by an Italian collection agency for the period 2004-2007 to empirically assess the relationship between prior tax notices and unlawful behavior.

This article investigates and compares the risk-sensitivity of economic capital and regulatory capital requirements empirically from a systemic and institution-specific perspective. The results are assessed to determine whether current regulatory capital requirements are representative of the relevant risks financial institutions face.

LCT takes 5% of the national VAT revenue as the financial base and distributes it to the local governments based on the regional sharing ratio of private final consumption expenditures (vertical equity) and weighting system to mitigate regional financial disparity (horizontal equity). This paper first evaluates current LCT distribution in terms of both equities, suggesting that new distribution indices be needed to satisfy both goals. Before producing them, by reassessing the status and the goal of LCT, this paper suggests LCT as a new local transfer, not a local tax, should pursue another goal, the correspondence between production and incidence of regional value-added which is VAT resource and ultimately LCT base, because its interregional migration is substantial in Korea.

The aim is to improve the choice of variables of the core profit efficiency model which is commonly used in earlier Australian banking efficiency studies. After we introduce the interest income over net interest income variable in the core profit efficiency model, the proportion of fully pure technical efficient banks decreased to 23% which is significantly lower than 81% which was reported in a recent study. This research argues that the main issue that has contributed to this difference is that improving the choice of variables significantly increases the discriminatory power of efficiency estimates. Additionally, emphasising on statistical properties of efficiency estimates, this study employs bootstrap DEA to provide confidence intervals and bias corrected estimates of pure technical efficiency scores of the sample banks. The bootstrap results show the importance of incorporating sample variation and bias in estimating efficiency scores. Earlier Australian banking efficiency studies ignored such issues. The new findings from the sample banks could have important implications for the banking industry in Australia.","[Moradi-Motlagh, Amir] Swinburne Univ Technol, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Saleh, Ali Salman] Qatar Univ, Doha, Qatar",Swinburne University of Technology; Qatar University,"Moradi-Motlagh, A (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Enterprise, 1 John St, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",amoradimotlagh@swin.edu.au,,,,,,,56,10,11,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Task complexity can induce response error, thereby decreasing the statistical precision of the econometric model. This study explores the link between task complexity and statistical precision as moderated by the level of thoughtful deliberation respondents exert when completing choice tasks. To do this, we make novel use of subjects' certainty of response to DCE tasks as a measure of their deliberation. The distinction between intuitive and deliberate thought (System 1 and System 2, respectively) motivates how task complexity will differentially affect System land System 2 respondents. The principle of utility balance in experimental design theory is used to understand how greater deliberation will increase task complexity, but will also improve statistical precision if respondents are engaging in System 2 processing. Our analyses find that increases in choice task utility balance decreases response certainty, and re-weighting the regression to favor respondents who are more uncertain of their choices increases the statistical precision of the econometric model.

The effects of Tobin's q, sales and cash flows on firm investment rate are also analysed and discussed. Consistent with existing literature, this research finds clear evidence of negative effects of both macroeconomic and firm idiosyncratic uncertainty on Australian firm investment. However, evidence also shows that firm-specific uncertainty is more important in explaining firm investment than macroeconomic uncertainty.","[Thang Long Tran] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Thang Long Tran] Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam",Monash University; National Economics University - Vietnam,"Tran, TL (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",thanglong.tran@monash.edu,,,,,,,35,7,8,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

We develop in this paper a little-known though ethically attractive approach to correcting the flaws of traditional social evaluations, an approach that is sensitive to population sizes and that is based on critical-level generalized utilitarianism (CLGU). Traditional CLGU is extended by considering arbitrary orders of welfare dominance and ranges of poverty lines, as well as values for the critical level of how much a life must be minimally worth to contribute to social welfare.

While the former approaches are well documented in the literature, the latter refers to Bourdieu's idea of objectified cultural capital, which has been revisited and empirically explored. Because the various causal effects interact with each other, this paper tests a theoretical model which matches individual characteristics of the consumer with the properties of the cultural product. Specifically, we discussed the emergence of a new version of a cultural good, which is able to broaden the dimension of the market by gaining rapid success in its audience. This diffusion pattern is a quite rare event, but disruptive for the market and extremely profitable for the producer. The authors label this occurrence a disruptive cultural fad and try to understand the determinants of its adoption. The hypotheses of the model are tested on a unique dataset of microdata of purchasing transactions in Milan in the early nineteenth century, when the music by Gioachino Rossini emerged as a disruptive cultural fad at the dawn of the music industry. Results show that key features of a successful disruptive cultural fad are the role of some specific patterns of personal past consumption, the capabilities of generating positive network externalities in the consumption, and, surprisingly, the lack of negative ones due to any possible hip or snob effect.","[Guerzoni, Marco] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, I-10153 Turin, Italy; [Nuccio, Massimiliano] Univ Luneburg, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",University of Turin; Leuphana University Luneburg,"Guerzoni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Lungo Dora 100A, I-10153 Turin, Italy.",marco.guerzoni@unito.it; nuccio@leuphana.de,"NUCCIO, Massimiliano/N-3165-2019; guerzoni, marco/AAB-3416-2021","NUCCIO, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0751-2143; guerzoni, marco/0000-0001-7415-0771",,,,,68,7,8,0,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Our empirical results indicate that FDI is an important vehicle for achieving economic growth in the Philippines, but only when there is sufficient absorptive capacity created by increased human capital and infrastructure development. The other key factors influencing Philippine economic growth are economic growth in its major trading partners, political climate and prevailing economic conditions within the economy. The relative size of government investment is found to crowd-out private investment, thus suggesting the need for government investment to be directed at human capital and infrastructure development as this has the potential to attract FDI and thus achieve sustained economic growth and development in the Philippines.","Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Econ Discipline, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Agbola, FW (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Econ Discipline, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",Frank.Agbola@newcastle.edu.au,"Agbola, Frank Wogbe/I-4529-2019","Agbola, Frank Wogbe/0000-0002-4351-9553",,,,,73,12,15,1,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Regression results over the past few decades have indicated that the trade-off theory lacks explanatory power, bringing into question the accuracy of the static trade-off theory and the existence of an optimal capital structure. On the other hand, the financial decisions of companies do not always appear consistent with the pecking order theory. Building on the research of Chou et al. (2011), this study sought to verify the signal factor hypothesis, which combines the trade-off theory with the pecking order theory.This study was the first one to employ the panel KPSS test with sharp drifts, developed by Chang and Ranjbar (2012), as well as the Fourier function to verify that an optimal capital structure does exist for companies with more symmetric information, thereby establishing the trade-off theory. Firms with information asymmetry show adverse selection costs, which supports the pecking order theory and rejects the existence of an optimal capital structure.","[Yang, Ginny Ju-Ann; Chueh, Horace; Lee, Chen-Hsun] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Lee, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",leeblade@nkfust.edu.tw,,,,,,,34,7,9,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, an unanticipated tax reform produces an expansion of GDP, labor, and investment, while an anticipated tax reform has opposite effects before the implementation of the labor tax cut. Quantitatively, if the traded sector is more capital intensive, GDP increases by 1.6 percentage points or declines by 2.7 percentage points after three years, depending on whether the tax cut is unanticipated or anticipated. Second, we find that GDP change masks a wide dispersion in sectoral output responses. As long as investment is both traded and non traded, a tax reform substantially raises the relative size of the non-traded sector after three years while traded output always drops. Third, a tax reform improves welfare in all scenarios, more so if the markup is endogenous, but less so if the shock is anticipated. Importantly, we find that welfare gains in a two-sector economy with capital accumulation and perfect access to external borrowing are between 39 % and 89 % higher than those in an economy without physical capital.","[Cardi, Olivier] Univ Paris 02, ERMES, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Restout, Romain] Univ Lorraine, BETA, F-54035 Nancy, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Universite de Lorraine,"Cardi, O (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 02, ERMES, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75230 Paris 05, France.",olivier.cardi@u-paris2.fr; romain.restout@univ-lorraine.fr,,"Cardi, Olivier/0000-0001-6715-394X",,,,,33,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

By introducing appropriate history dependence in policy, Wicksellian rules perform better than optimal Taylor rules in terms of welfare, robustness to alternative shock processes, and are less prone to equilibrium indeterminacy. A simple Wicksellian rule augmented with a high degree of interest rate inertia resembles a robustly optimal rule, i.e., a monetary policy rule that implements the optimal plan and that is also completely robust to the specification of exogenous shock processes.

For instance, in Norway, a high share of high-income recipients provides financial incentives to the local governments (the agencies in charge of the LTC system) to increase reliance on nursing home care relative to community housing and home-based care. This article examines the effects of the Norwegian LTC funding system on the composition of LTC services at the local government level. I use a cross-section from 2009 of 391 local governments to estimate a fractional probit model using quasi-maximum likelihood estimation.

This formulation generates a mathematical model for a consumer decision dynamic process. The byproduct of the dynamic model leads to an agent-based simulation model.

In this model, agents keep inventories of money, despite the fact that money is dominated in rate of return by interest-bearing assets, because they must pay a fixed cost to transfer funds between the asset market and the goods market. In contrast to exogenous segmentation models in the literature, the timing of money transfers is endogenous. As a result, the model endogenizes the degree of market segmentation as well as the magnitudes of liquidity effects, price sluggishness, and the variability of velocity. I first show that the endogenous segmentation model can generate the positive long-run relationship between money growth and velocity observed in the data, which the exogenous segmentation model fails to capture.

Second, it led to the imposition of intense austerity program. We provide empirical evidence for these two effects.

For competitiveness, we explore two different tasks that differ in associated stereotypes. We find no gender difference in competitiveness when comparing performance under competition to that without competition. We further find that boys and girls are equally likely to self-select into competition in a verbal task, but that boys are significantly more likely to choose to compete in a mathematical task. This gender gap diminishes and becomes non-significant when we control for actual performance, beliefs about relative performance, and risk preferences, or for beliefs only. Girls are also more altruistic and less risk taking than boys.","[Dreber, Anna] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [von Essen, Emma] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ranehill, Eva] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",Stockholm School of Economics; Stockholm University; University of Zurich,"Ranehill, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",anna.dreber@hhs.se; emma.vonessen@ne.su.se; eva.ranehill@econ.uzh.ch,"von Essen, Emma/JXX-2272-2024; Ranehill, Eva/JVO-4435-2024","von Essen, Emma/0000-0002-1421-4582;",,,,,59,106,115,4,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Based on a sample of 75 countries, it applies the Fisher Ideal Index to decompose the energy intensity into the relative contributions of energy efficiency and economic structure. Then, the determinants of these energy indexes are examined through panel data regression techniques. Special attention is lent to Latin American countries (LAC) by comparing its performance to that of a similar set of countries chosen through the synthetic control method. When analyzed by income level, energy intensity has decreased in a range between 40 and 54% in low and medium income countries respectively. Efficiency improvements drive these changes, while the structural effect does not represent a clear source of change. The regression analysis shows that per capita income, petroleum prices, fuel-energy mix, and GDP growth are main determinants of energy intensity and efficiency, while there are no clear correlations with the activity component. In the case of LAC the energy intensity decreased around 20% which could be interpreted as an under-performance. However, the counterfactual exercise suggests that LAC has closed the gap with respect to its synthetic control. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In turn, the models' results are used to compute and analyze the optimal weights and hedge ratios for oil-stock portfolio holdings. For comparison purposes and to put the paper more in the perspective of West Africa, the Nigerian stock market is also included in the analysis. Our findings point to the existence of significant volatility spillover and interdependence between oil and the two stock market returns. While spillover effects are stronger for Nigeria, the transmission of volatility is much more apparent from oil to stock than from stock to oil in the case of Ghana. Also, the study demonstrates evidence of short-term predictability in oil and stock price changes through time and reveals that conditional volatility changes more rapidly as result of substantial effects of past volatility rather than past news/shocks for all market returns. Moreover, we show that there is a slightly more effective hedge in the two stock markets under the DCC-GARCH framework (our preferred model) compared to the other two models, although hedging effectiveness is much greater for Ghana. On the whole, our findings for optimal hedge ratios are consistent with other studies and particularly the view that oil assets should be an integral part of a diversified portfolio of stocks and suggest that a better understanding of volatility links is crucial for portfolio management in the presence of oil price risk. Finally, the existence of multivariate asymmetric effects and dynamic conditional correlations as revealed by the VAR-AGARCH and DCC-GARCH models make it clear that the assumptions of symmetric effects and constant conditional correlations are not supported empirically.

These new dynamics in the household sector were already apparent in the 1990s, long before the deterioration in the US government balance or the current account balance and long before the arrival on the international stage of Chinese reserve accumulation. The record low household savings rate in the past decade was the product of two separate trends: a sharp fall in the asset acquisition of American households in the 1990s, and an explosion of mortgage borrowing in the 2000s. The American credit boom of the 2000s had few direct links to reserve accumulation in emerging markets.

The principal needs to decide whether the project should be continued or not after the first-stage outcome is realized. The principal can either keep the decision-making authority regarding the termination policy, or else delegate it to one of the agents. With career concerns, the first-stage agent always wants to continue the project, in which case the sunk cost fallacy occurs. On the contrary, the second-stage agent may prefer to stop it voluntarily to protect his reputation. Therefore, when the career concerns are strong, the principal should delegate the authority to the second-stage agent if an early termination of the project is also the best policy for the principal; while if the career concerns are weak, the principal should keep the authority.

We trace the value added by all labor and capital that is directly and indirectly needed for the production of final manufacturing goods. The production systems of these goods are highly prone to international fragmentation as many stages can be undertaken in any country with little variation in quality. We seek to establish a series of facts concerning the global fragmentation of production that can serve as a starting point for future analysis. We describe four major trends. First, international fragmentation, as measured by the foreign value-added content of production, has rapidly increased since the early 1990s. Second, in most global value chains there is a strong shift towards value being added by capital and high-skilled labor, and away from less-skilled labor. Third, within global value chains, advanced nations increasingly specialize in activities carried out by high-skilled workers. Fourth, emerging economies surprisingly specialize in capital-intensive activities.","[Timmer, Marcel P.] Univ Groningen, GGDC, Groningen, Netherlands; [Erumban, Abdul Azeez] Conf Board, Brussels, Belgium; [Los, Bart] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Stehrer, Robert] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies Wiiw, Vienna, Austria; [de Vries, Gaaitzen J.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen; Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies; University of Groningen,"Timmer, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, GGDC, Groningen, Netherlands.",m.p.timmer@rug.nl; eabdul75@gmail.com; b.los@rug.nl; stehrer@wiiw.ac.at; g.j.de.vries@rug.nl,"Los, Bart/ABE-5900-2020; Erumban, Abdul A/AAS-8167-2020; timmer, marcel p/A-7716-2008","Erumban, Abdul Azeez/0000-0003-2806-6119",,,,,40,429,483,15,249,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

J,"Wilkins, R",,,,"Wilkins, Roger",,,Evaluating the Evidence on Income Inequality in Australia in the 2000s*,ECONOMIC RECORD,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRENDS,"Published ABS data from the Survey of Income and Housing (SIH) show a substantial increase in income inequality between 2001 and 2010. However, almost all of the increase occurred over a period when changes in survey methodology and income concept were occurring. I present results of analysis of the SIH unit record data, as well as independent evidence provided by the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. On the basis of this analysis, I conclude that the SIH overstates the growth in income inequality, even when the income variable examined is notionally consistently defined across surveys.

Although the modern sector may be the source of dynamic growth through learning-by-doing and knowledge spillovers, patterns of labor, land and other natural resources use in the rural economy matter in the overall dynamics of structural change. The concentration of rural populations on marginal land is essentially a barometer of economy-wide development. As long as there is abundant marginal land for cultivation, they serve to absorb rural migrants, increased population, and displaced unskilled labor from elsewhere in the economy. Moreover, the economy is vulnerable to the Dutch disease effects of a booming primary products sector. As a consequence, productivity increases and expansion in the commercial primary production sector will cause manufacturing employment and output to contract, until complete specialization occurs. Avoiding such an outcome and combating the inherent dualism of the economy require both targeted polices for the modern sector and traditional agriculture on marginal land.","[Barbier, Edward B.; Bugas, John S.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Barbier, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",ebarbier@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,66,8,11,1,45,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

Its validity has been investigated in two main ways: first, in simple experiments where subjects were presented with just two decision problems, and second, in experiments where subjects were presented with many problems. In the first set, the hypothesis under test was whether the decisions made on the two problems were connected; in the second set, whether the set of all (previous) decisions affected the current decision. This article combines and extends these two ways by investigating, in experiments with many questions, whether the immediately preceding decision affects the current decision. This is a cognitively less-demanding hypothesis than that all previous decisions are taken into account, but allows for an indirect effect of previous decisions on current ones. Reassuringly, we find little effect and hence our results complement the previous evidence indicating that the RLI mechanism is robust and can safely be used.","[Hey, John; Zhou, Wenting] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Hey, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",john.hey@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In this article, we use Benford's law to compare government social security statistics with deficit related data reported by the EU member states to Eurostat. Unlike deficit related data, social security statistics are not subject to the fiscal monitoring connected with excessive deficit procedures (EDP) and the incentive to manipulate such statistics is therefore lower. Our results show that, across all but one 27 EU member states, the deviations from the Benford distribution in the social security statistics are considerably smaller than those shown by the deficit data. This leads us to conclude that, as would be expected, European governments behave in accordance with the incentives, i.e. while the quality of the social security statistics appears to be higher, there is a widespread tendency to report incorrect deficit data. We therefore consider our results to be evidence of the effectiveness of Benford's law in identifying manipulated data.","[Rauch, Bernhard] Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [Goettsche, Max] Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Dept Controlling & Auditing, D-85049 Ingolstadt, Germany; [Braehler, Gernot; Kronfeld, Thomas] Ilmenau Univ Technol, Dept Taxat Theory & Auditing, D-98693 Ilmenau, Germany",University of Regensburg; Technische Universitat Ilmenau,"Rauch, B (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",rauch@jng.by.lo-net2.de,,,,,,,11,6,7,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We find that the existence of competitive wages and an interaction with the informal economy are statistically significant determinants of wage stickiness. While the role of competitive wages is similar to what has been found in studies of European firms, the latter find a much larger role for turnover, collective bargaining and employment protection. In contrast, in Pakistan we find that firms hiring from the informal sector are significantly more flexible in changing their wages.

Student mobility generates a university competition effect which induces them to overinvest in education, whereas worker mobility generates a free-rider effect for governments, who are not willing to subsidize the education of agents who will work abroad. At equilibrium, the free-rider effect always dominates the competition effect, resulting in underinvestment in human capital. This inefficiency can be corrected under exogenous university budgets if a transnational transfer for mobile students is implemented. With endogenous income taxation, under the non-cooperative equilibrium between governments, the combination of the free-rider effect and fiscal competition leads to underinvestment in both teaching and research. Furthermore, the transnational transfer no longer restores efficiency. Instead, it can reinforce fiscal competition and imposes a tradeoff between research and human capital. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Last-place aversion suggests that low-income individuals might oppose redistribution because it could differentially help the group just beneath them. Using survey data, we show that individuals making just above the minimum wage are the most likely to oppose its increase.

In addition to the efficiency effect considered by the standard model, which leads the smaller country to set a lower capital tax rate, this present paper also takes account of the political effect arising from lobbying. We show that the smaller country may face less downward political pressure. If the political effect outweighs the efficiency effect, then the smaller country sets a higher tax rate than the larger country.

We further investigate the relationship among accounting conservatism, institutional investor shareholdings, and earnings manipulation by using Benford's law. Our results indicate that firms with more conservative financial reporting have less probability of engaging in earnings-manipulative activities.

Numerology forms an important component of Chinese superstitious lore, with the numbers 8 and 6 signifying good luck, and the number 4 bad luck. We find that secondhand apartments located on floors ending with 8 fetch, on average, a 235 RMB higher price (per square meter) than on other floors. For newly constructed apartments, this price premium disappears due to uniform pricing of new housing units, but apartments on floors ending in an 8 are sold, on average, 6.9 days faster than on other floors. Buyers who have a phone number containing more 8's are more likely to purchase apartments in a floor ending with 8; this suggests that at least part of the price premium for lucky apartments arises from the buyers' superstitious beliefs.

This externality is absent when trading is organized via a centralized clearing mechanism that provides transparency of trade positions.

Taking up a conjectural variation approach, it is found that Turkish banks appear to have exercised collusive pricing during the sample period. This result is a reflection of the fines imposed by the Competition Authority on March 8, 2013 after its recent investigation of the banking industry. It was also found that the size distribution of banking institutions is significant in explaining the differences in conduct patterns, and in particular, smaller banks have acted more collusively than larger ones. The estimation results also demonstrated that there has been less collusive behaviour among Turkish banks following the 2008 global financial crisis.","Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Aydemir, R (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",resul.aydemir@gmail.com,"Aydemir, Resul/K-1927-2014; Aydemir, Resul/ABB-4649-2020","Aydemir, Resul/0000-0003-1313-0464",,,,,28,2,2,0,4,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON-RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The most common practice in empirical research for measuring real exchange rate persistence is to estimate univariate autoregressive (AR) time series models and calculate the half-life, defined as the number of periods for a unit shock to a time series to decay by 50%. In the presence of structural change, there are two potential biases in the parameter estimates of AR models: (1) a downward small sample median-bias and (2) an upward bias, which occurs when structural change is present and ignored. We conduct a variety of Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate that the existence of structural change causes a substantial increase in the small sample bias documented in Andrews (1993). We then propose an extension of median-unbiased estimation, which explicitly accounts for structural change, and apply these methods to estimate half-lives of several long-horizon real exchange rates analysed by Lothian and Taylor (1996) and Taylor (2002). The upward bias from neglecting structural change dominates the downward median-bias for these real exchange rates. When structural change is present and accounted for, the median-unbiased half-lives towards a changing mean decrease and the confidence intervals tighten.","[Balli, Hatice Ozer] Massey Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Murray, Christian J.; Papell, David H.] Univ Houston, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77204 USA",Massey University; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Murray, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",cjmurray@uh.edu,"Ozer Balli, Hatice/AAN-6682-2021","Ozer Balli, Hatice/0000-0002-5547-2932",,,,,16,3,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main novelty is that, in so far as a productivity distribution can be identified with an income distribution, we measure productivity mobility in a dynamic context using an indicator inspired in an income mobility index suggested by Fields (2010) for a two-period world. Productivity is measured in terms of publications, weighted by the citation impact of the journals where each article is published in the periodical literature. We study the evolution of average productivity, productivity inequality, the extent of rank reversals, and productivity mobility for seven cohorts, as well as the population as a whole. We offer new evidence confirming previous results about the heterogeneity of the evolution of productivity for top and other researchers. However, the major result is that-contrary to what was expected-for our sample of very highly productive scholars the effect of rank reversals between the two periods on overall productivity mobility offsets the effect of an increase in productivity inequality from the first to the second period in the youngest five out of seven cohorts.","[Carrasco, Raquel; Ruiz-Castillo, Javier] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Ruiz-Castillo, Javier] CEPR Project SCIFI GLOW, London, England",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Carrasco, R (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain.",rcarras@eco.uc3m.es; jrc@eco.uc3m.es,"Ruiz-Castillo, Javier/O-8180-2019; Carrasco, Raquel/H-5596-2015","Carrasco, Raquel/0000-0003-2550-6350",,,,,60,10,10,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

First, well known data patterns, such as output and inflation leads and lags and inflation persistence, are decomposed into forecast horizon components to give a more complete description of the data patterns. These results show that the well-known lead and lag patterns between output and inflation arise mostly in the medium-term forecasts horizons. Second, the data summary method is used to investigate a small-scale New Keynesian model with some important modeling features to see which of these features can reproduce lead, lag and persistence patterns seen in the data. We show that a general equilibrium model with habit formation, persistent IS curve shocks and persistent supply shocks can reproduce the lead, lag and persistence patterns seen in the data.","[Cassou, Steven P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Vazquez, Jesus] Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Bilbao 48015, Spain",Kansas State University; University of Basque Country,"Cassou, SP (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 327 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",scassou@ksu.edu,"Vazquez, Jesus/D-3067-2019","Vazquez, Jesus/0000-0003-4788-4838",,,,,30,1,1,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The evaluation of such policies requires a reliable identification procedure that is hardly achieved in empirical studies. We analyse the impact of a policy instrument - Law 488/92 (L488), the main Italian regional policy - that allocates subsidies to private firms by a multiple ranking system. Thanks to the peculiar L488 selection process that creates the conditions for a local random experiment, we are able to assess the effectiveness of these types of incentives for a relevant subgroup of firms. We propose a nonparametric multiple rankings regression discontinuity design that exploits the sharp discontinuities in the L488 rankings and extends the regression discontinuity design (RDD) approach to a context where the treatment is assigned by multiple rankings with different cut-off points. We find that the impact of the subsidies on employment, investment, and turnover is positive and statistically significant, while the effect on productivity is mostly negligible. The new subsidised capital is additional but non-complementary with the owner-financed investment. The results are robust to different specifications and not due to intertemporal substitution.

It also shows that skill-biased productivity shocks and shocks to workers' taste for equal pay have permanent effects on unemployment and the skill premium. Thus, skill-biased shocks to productivity increase unemployment among the low-skilled while, if high-skilled workers are less inequity-averse, they reduce unemployment among the high-skilled.","[Chouliarakis, George] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Chouliarakis, George] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Correa-Lopezy, Monica] BBVA Res, Econ Res Dept, Madrid 28046, Spain",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Chouliarakis, G (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",monica.correa@bbva.com,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

It finds that lagged values explain between 25% and 36% of decisions on leverage, payout and investment, which gives them strong predictive ability. In regression of these decisions on firm and industry traits, omission of lagged values leads to a change of around one-third in parameter estimates, and so significantly overstates their impact. The influence of lagged values persists, and for most decisions is significant for several years. Given the stickiness in financial decisions, there are potentially significant analytical problems from ignoring their lagged values.","Univ Melbourne, Dept Finance, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Coleman, L (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Finance, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",les.coleman@unimelb.edu.au,,"Coleman, Les/0000-0002-2728-6139",,,,,32,2,2,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By contrast, when the agent is a player in a large population coordination game, and the process is generated by all players' predictions, convergence to a theory is much more likely. This may explain how a large population of players selects an equilibrium in such a game, and how social norms emerge.

This study covers the annual data from 1970 to 2008. Throughout this study, our empirical results indicate that the variables are cointegrated and the Granger causality test reveals evidence of uni-directional causality from oil and non-oil exports to economic growth. Therefore, we confirm that the export-led growth hypothesis is valid in Iran. However, results show that oil export has an inverse effect on economic growth, thus we suggest encouraging non-oil export activities in order to stimulate long-term economic growth in Iran.","[Hosseini, Seyed Mehrshad Parvin] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Econ Programme, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Tang, Chor Foon] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town 11800, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Tang, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Econ Programme, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",tcfoon@usm.my,"Parvin Hosseini, Mehrshad/J-9216-2019; Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011","Parvin Hosseini, Mehrshad/0000-0002-4366-7919; Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222",,,,,56,11,11,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The aim of this article is to examine the direct association between depression status in late-teenage years and adult wages, as well as the indirect association, operating through accumulated education, experience and occupation choice. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 data, we find adolescent depression is associated with a wage penalty of around 10-15%, but its mechanics are very different for males and females. For males, about three quarters of the wage penalty is through the direct channel, whilst for females the indirect effect channel is dominant. The indirect channel is driven by lower accumulated education, mostly because depression discourages further study post high school. These results are important because they imply that the association between adolescent depression and wages is stronger than has been estimated in previous cross-sectional studies.","[Johar, Meliyanni; Truong, Jeffrey] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Johar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Meliyanni.Johar@uts.edu.au,,,,,,,40,12,17,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, on the road from exchange rate (ER) as a nominal anchor to IT, differences between advanced and emerging economies concerning fear of floating have been more or less narrowed. In this paper we are concentrated to selected aspects of ER pass-through to prices and output, as well as (in)direct monetary policy reactions to ER shocks, trying to find out is significant difference observable between advanced and emerging IT countries in pre-crisis period and (post)crisis period. The comparison is made on the basis of forecast error variance decompositions from estimated Vector Autoregression (VAR) / Vector Error Correction (VEC) models. Fear of floating phenomenon should not be exclusively applied to emerging economies, especially in the crisis period burdened with external shocks. The role of ER in IT monetary framework is strengthened with higher internal vulnerability to ER shocks, despite the level of economic development. Advanced countries more use interest rate as an indirect way to withstand ER shocks, while emerging economies more use direct way via foreign exchange interventions to withstand the ER shocks.","[Josifidis, Kosta; Pucar, Emilija Beker; Srdic, Sladana; Ivan, Gabriela] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Dept European Econ & Business, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Josifidis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Dept European Econ & Business, Novi Sad, Serbia.",josifidis@gmail.com; emilijabp@gmail.com; srdicsladja@gmail.com; gabriela@ef.uns.ac.rs,,"Beker Pucar, Emilija/0000-0002-6369-3225",,,,,38,3,3,0,14,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2014,61.0,1,,,SI,,79,106,,10.2298/PAN1401079J,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AC4NZ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332499300006,0

Although both theoretical and empirical studies have been dedicated to these issues, few have been carried out for the service sector. Since the service sector accounts for the lion's share of GDP, the lack of those studies indicates that a large part of the actual economy still remains veiled. Our study fills this gap. We examine whether or not the Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) model remains satisfied in the service sector, using data from Japanese SMEs. From our analysis, we confirm that larger market sizes are associated with higher productivity levels. On the other hand, firms with higher markups tend to develop their business in smaller markets, conditional of the simultaneity between production and consumption. These results reveal that further productivity growth in the service sector also requires markets to be larger and more integrated. In addition, the markup levels become lower in those markets.","[Kato, Atsuyuki] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Kodama, Naomi] Minist Econ Trade & Ind, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University,"Kato, A (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",atsukato@hotmail.com,"Kodama, Naomi/HNB-9949-2023",,,,,,16,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The appropriateness of deploying standard empirical techniques of frontier estimation is then called into question in evaluating the relative effectiveness of individual Departments and their scope for improvements. The empirical results of frontier estimation, here applied to UK university Departments of Economics, are shown to be sensitive to the choice of nonparametric frontier technique deployed, with Free Disposal Hull analysis providing an alternative estimation technique that can allow for both convex and nonconvex regions of the possibility frontier.

We analyze Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru market return and a world market proxy return as a measure of systematic risk. However, instead of traditional covariance, we used the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model of Engle (2002) to measure the volatility correlation between each Latin market and the world market. We based the DCC model on marginal volatilities estimated by the GJR-GARCH model (Glosten et al., 1993), using a copula function. The copula-DCC-GARCH model was proposed with a financial application by (Jondeau & Rockinger, 2006). The univariate volatility and an autoregressive vector were also included as independent variables in the model, which coefficients were estimated by quantile regression. The results reveal a breakthrough because the model can capture relationships that were previously masked by the coefficients steadiness and by the lack of consideration over the differences in extreme quantiles pricing. In the lower quantile, negative risk premium was found, reflecting the leverage effect. Furthermore, we found that the quantile correlation coefficients between each market return proxy and the world return proxy were not significant, i.e, only the market own risk is priced, what indicates that Latin markets may present a good diversification opportunity.","[Milani, Bruno; Ceretta, Paulo Sergio; Muller, Fernanda Maria; Righi, Marcelo Brutti] Univ Santa Maria, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",,"Milani, B (通讯作者)，Univ Santa Maria, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",milani_bruno@yahoo.com.br; ceretta10@gmail.com; nandamuller90@gmail.com; marcelobrutti@hotmail.com,"Ceretta, Paulo/AAK-3382-2020; Müller, Fernanda/AAB-5245-2022; Righi, Marcelo/E-3756-2015","Righi, Marcelo/0000-0002-3753-0705",,,,,35,1,1,0,10,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We encounter social learning in many economically important phenomena, such as the adoption of new products and technologies or job search in labor markets. We review the existing empirical and theoretical literatures and argue that they have evolved largely independently of each other. This suggests several directions for future research that can help bridge the gap between both literatures. For example, the theory literature has come up with several models of social learning, ranging from naive DeGroot models to sophisticated Bayesian models whose assumptions and predictions need to be empirically tested. Alternatively, empiricists have often observed that social learning is more localized than existing theory models assume, and that information can decay along a transmission path. Incorporating these findings into our models might require theorists to look beyond asymptotic convergence in social learning.","[Mobius, Markus] Microsoft Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mobius, Markus; Rosenblat, Tanya] Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mobius, Markus] Natl Bur Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Microsoft; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Mobius, M (通讯作者)，Microsoft Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",markusmobius@gmail.com,,,,,,,66,39,49,3,55,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Under this constraint, inventories and demand are complements in generating sales, and hence the optimal level of inventories increases in expected demand. We show that the inventory to sales ratio is both persistent and countercyclical because the cost of carrying inventories is mainly determined by the interest rate. We use this model to disentangle output and sales, by matching the key inventory moments, and find that preference and productivity shocks are equally important in the data. Finally, we assess whether improvements in inventory management can explain the Great Moderation. We find that, although improvements in inventory management can reduce the need for inventory holdings, which decreases output volatility relative to sales volatility, lower levels of inventories actually increases sales volatility. Because these two effects offset each other, a change in inventory management does not change output volatility to any great extent.","[Shibayama, Katsuyuki] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England; [Chadha, Jagjit S.] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Chair Banking & Finance, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England",University of Kent; University of Kent,"Shibayama, K (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",k.shibayama@kent.ac.uk,,"Chadha, Jagjit/0000-0001-7549-9027; Shibayama, Katsuyuki/0000-0003-3472-398X",,,,,35,0,0,1,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We expect to find no sentimental herding in BIST30 as the investors are closely following the market, given their access to maximum amount of information and high quality of guidance from the world-known intermediaries that reduce information asymmetries. However, as the SNM investors are mostly local investors with smaller assets and with higher level of information asymmetry, we expect to find evidence of sentimental herding. As expected, we find no evidence of herding by the BIST30 investors from 2000 to 2013. In contrast, our findings provide evidence that the SNM investors demonstrate sentimental herding persistently and independently from market fundamentals in three stages: evidence of herding in the first stage (2000-2004), a 4-year (2005-2008) no-herding calm period and finally a volatile adverse herding pattern (2009-2013) where fundamentals about the firm values became more important.","[Solakoglu, M.

This paper proposes decision costs as one explanation: whether a person buys at a price depends on whether she carefully considers the offer, which itself depends on price. A simple model predicts that deliberation costs (1) increase sensitivity to low prices; (2) can prevent cost-sharing from targeting products to buyers with high value: and (3) can have larger effects on poorer people. The principal contribution of this paper is a field experiment that sold hand-washing soap in rural India. Participants were randomly assigned to be offered soap for either a low or very low price, which was experimentally crossed with assignment to a control group or to a treatment that required deliberation. Results matched predictions of the model: the treatment decreased price sensitivity relative to the control group, and increased targeting of product take-up by need. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We use logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition to (1) attribute efficiency changes to either changes in technology or changes in the structure of the economy, (2) study trends in global energy intensity between 1995 and 2007, and (3) highlight sectoral and regional differences. For the country analysis we apply the traditional two factor index decomposition approach, while for the global analysis we use a three factor decomposition which includes the consideration of regional structural changes in the global economy. We first show that heterogeneity within each sector across countries is high. These general trends within sectors are dominated by large economies, first and foremost the United States. In most cases, heterogeneity is lower within each country across the different sectors. Regarding changes of energy intensity at the country level, improvements between 1995 and 2007 are largely attributable to technological change while structural change is less important in most countries. Notable exceptions are Japan, the United States, Australia, Taiwan, Mexico and Brazil where a change in the industry mix was the main driver behind the observed energy intensity reduction. At the global level we find that despite a shift of the global economy to more energy-intensive countries, aggregate energy efficiency improved mostly due to technological change.

We build a sequential game where individuals, who differ in their willingness to pay for a taxed good, vote over the enforcement level. Firms then compete a la Cournot and choose the fraction of sales taxes to evade. We assume in most of the paper that the tax rate is set exogenously. Voters face the following trade-off: more enforcement not only increases tax collection but also increases the consumer price of the goods sold in an imperfectly competitive market. We obtain that the equilibrium enforcement level is the one most preferred by the individual with the median willingness to pay, that it is not affected by the structure of the market (number of firms) and the firms' marginal cost, and that it decreases with the resource cost of evasion and with the tax rate. We also compare the enforcement level chosen by majority voting with the utilitarian level. In the last section, we endogenize the tax rate by assuming that individuals vote simultaneously over tax rate and enforcement level. We prove the existence of a Condorcet winner and show that it entails full enforcement (i.e., no tax evasion at equilibrium). The existence of markets with less than full enforcement then depends crucially on the fact that tax rates are not tailored to each market individually.","[Besfamille, Martin] Univ Torcuato Tella, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [De Donder, Philippe; Lozachmeur, Jean-Marie] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [De Donder, Philippe; Lozachmeur, Jean-Marie] GREMAQ CNRS, Paris, France",Universidad Torcuato Di Tella; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Besfamille, M (通讯作者)，Univ Torcuato Tella, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mbesfamille@utdt.edu; philippe.dedonder@tse-eu.fr; jean-marie.lozachmeur@tse-eu.fr,"Besfamille, Martin/AAE-8235-2020; Besfamille, Martin/GWC-3237-2022","Besfamille, Martin/0000-0002-4073-3466;",,,,,33,6,7,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The optimal redistribution can be attained using a positive unemployment benefit and an increasing and regressive labor income tax. The positive unemployment benefit serves the purpose of lowering the search risk faced by workers.

We construct a balanced panel for 72 countries between 1980 and 2007 and use panel unit-root and cointegration tests. In estimating the long-run relationship between cointegrated variables, we use the dynamic OLS (DOLS) estimation techniques. Empirical results show a causal long-run relationship between high income, high human development and low fertility. The evolution of the developed lifestyle differs significantly, however. In advanced economies, the demographic transition is essentially complete and therefore only changes in human development and income matter. In developing countries, fertility is negatively related with human development, but positively with income and - consistently with Galor and Mountford (2006, 2008) - trade. Moreover, we find no significant impact from human development on income - either for advanced economies or for developing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This paper addresses this issue by providing evidence on the impact of offshoring on the skill structure of manufacturing employment in Belgium between 1995 and 2007. Offshoring is found to significantly lower the employment share of low-skilled workers. Its contribution to the fall in the employment share of low-skilled workers amounts to 35 %. This is mainly driven by offshoring to Central and Eastern European countries. While most of the previous papers on this subject focus on materials offshoring, we show that offshoring of business services also contributes significantly to the fall in the low-skilled employment share. As a complement to the existing literature, we compare the widely used current price measure of offshoring with a constant price measure that is based on a deflation with separate price indices for domestic output and imports. This reveals that the former underestimate the extent of offshoring and its impact on low-skilled employment. Finally, we also find that the impact of offshoring on low-skilled employment is significantly smaller in industries with a higher ICT capital intensity.","[Hertveldt, Bart; Michel, Bernhard] Belgian Fed Planning Bur, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Michel, Bernhard] Univ Libre Bruxelles, CEB, Brussels, Belgium; [Michel, Bernhard] Univ Libre Bruxelles, DULBEA, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Michel, B (通讯作者)，Belgian Fed Planning Bur, Ave Arts 47-49, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",bm@plan.be,,,,,,,36,6,7,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2013,161.0,4,,,,,399,420,,10.1007/s10645-013-9218-0,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,248HV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326690000002,0

Of course, the choice of the methods manipulates the results. Primarily, normalisation methods, weighting schemes and aggregation formulas are fundamental but very subjective. This paper deals with two types of normalisation (z-score and min-max) and four weighting and aggregation schemes (equal weighting with linear aggregation, principal components analysis, benefit of doubt method and multi-criteria analysis). European countries ranking is provided according to the seven different scenarios.","Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Hudrliková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,17,42,51,0,0,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Currently, there are discussions about how to identify systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and how to strengthen regulatory measures for these SIFIs. Against the backdrop, this study aims to identify SIFIs by measuring inter-sectoral financial transactions with the flow of funds (FOF) account as a measure of interconnectedness. The empirical results show that banks or insurance companies can be SIFIs only in terms of size. However, foreign banks' branches (FBB) and credit-specialized institutions can also be SIFIs in terms of interconnectedness. Especially the systemic importance of FBB in Korea has increased considering the fact that financial crisis in Korea resulted mainly from foreign exchange market. Therefore, more specific discussions and regulatory measures for SIFIs will be required from the perspective of capital market development and Korea's situation.","[Hyun, Suk] Korea Capital Market Inst, Int Finance Team, Seoul, South Korea; [Yoshino, Naoyuki] Keio Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Korea Capital Market Institute; Keio University,"Hyun, S (通讯作者)，Korea Capital Market Inst, Int Finance Team, Seoul, South Korea.",hyun@kcmi.re.kr,,"Yoshino, Naoyuki/0000-0001-8060-5314",,,,,17,1,1,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Most previous empirical evidence supports this claim by showing an effect in which increasing exports tilt demand towards firms which export and employ a relatively large proportion of higher-skilled workers from the group of firms which do not export. We find that, in addition to this, there is also an effect whereby, among exporting firms, there is a significant wage premium for high-skilled workers and a wage discount for low-skilled workers. These estimates are based on a matched employer-employee data set of western German manufacturing firms over the period 1993-2007. Our estimates suggest that export activity can be associated with up to 30% of within and between skill group wage inequality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Exporters meet the content rules for the benefit of trade preferences, which is similar to self-selection into treatment. The IV estimation of the treatment effect using OECD data shows that PROOs negatively affect the trade in intermediate inputs and final goods. Estimation results confirm that PROOs are the protectionist instrument, inducing hidden protection through an effect of tariffs on imported intermediate inputs, and causing an indirect protective effect on final goods. Since preferential treatments of FTAs are conditional on compliance with PROOs, the effects of FTAs and PROOs move in the opposite direction. The net change in intermediate inputs trade will be smaller than what it would have been without PROOs. Given an inverse relationship between PROOs and intermediate inputs trade, the presence of PROOs will adversely affect final goods trade because a decrease in intermediate inputs trade distorts final goods trade.","Konkuk Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea",Konkuk University,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea.",honglee@konkuk.ac.kr,,"Lee, Honggue/0000-0003-3375-2711",,,,,24,0,0,1,14,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

For example, the study indicates that the Brong-Ahafo region is the most efficient region but not the most wealthy in Ghana. Generally, urban regions are not found to be among the most efficient regions due to the high expenditures.

Unlike previous analyses, I incorporate the education market and the education price into the analysis, and assume that workers bear the pecuniary cost for receiving education. Given such an assumption, migration possibilities do not necessarily increase education demand since the larger demand for education raises the education price and lowers the net return on education. By modelling an economy where workers in the home country (the labour-sending country) comprise skilled and unskilled workers and they can migrate to the foreign country (the labour-receiving country), I show that brain gain and brain drain occur simultaneously in the home country. In particular, if wage inequality is larger in the foreign country than in the home country, skilled workers experience brain gain and unskilled workers experience brain drain in the home country. On the other hand, if wage inequality is sufficiently larger in the home country, brain drain occurs in skilled workers and brain gain in unskilled workers.","[Shimada, Akira] Nagasaki Univ, Nagasaki 8508506, Japan",Nagasaki University,"Shimada, A (通讯作者)，Nagasaki Univ, Fac Econ, 4-2-1 Katafuchi, Nagasaki 8508506, Japan.",shimada@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22530184] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,30,1,1,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

J,"Bergstrand, JH; Egger, P",,,,"Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.; Egger, Peter",,,Shouldn't Physical Capital Also Matter for Multinational Enterprise Activity?,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MODEL; FDI,"The foreign direct investment (FDI) literature has generally failed to find strong systematic evidence of vertical motivations in bilateral aggregate FDI and foreign affiliate sales (FAS) data, despite recent evidence of vertical FDI in firm-level data. Moreover, a Bayesian analysis of the empirical determinants of FDI (and FAS) flows reveals that the parent country's physical capital per worker has a strong positive effect on FDI alongside typical gravity-equation variables; however, this variable is ignored in the knowledge-capital (KC) model and most empirical work. We address these two puzzles by introducing relative factor endowment differences into the three-factor, three-country knowledge and physical capital extension of the 2x2x2 KC model. Using a numerical version of our model, we show that horizontal and vertical multinational enterprises' (MNEs') headquarters surface in different parts of the Edgeworth box relating the parent country's skilled labor share relative to its physical capital share (of the parent's and host's endowments). The key economic insight is that horizontal MNE headquarters will be relatively more abundant than vertical MNE headquarters in countries that are abundant in physical capital relative to skilled labor, because of the multi-plant (single-plant) structure of horizontal (vertical) MNEsassuming plants (headquarters) use physical capital (skilled labor) relatively intensively in their setups. The theoretical relationships suggest augmenting empirical FAS gravity equations with (polynomials of) the parent's skilled labor share alongside the parent's physical capital share to explain in aggregate bilateral data the coexistence of horizontal and vertical FAS. The theoretical and empirical results shed light on the positive effect of parent's physical capital share on FAS flows, but also suggest that MNE headquarters may be prominent in parent countries with relatively high and low skilled labor sharesonce physical capital is accounted fora result not suggested by the two-factor KC model.","[Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Finance, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] Univ Notre Dame, Kellogg Inst Int Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] CESifo, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Egger, Peter] ETH Univ, Dept Econ, CESifo, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter] Ifo Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame,"Bergstrand, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Finance, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",Bergstrand.1@nd.edu,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",,,,,25,19,20,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Of particular interest is the case when a breach of trust is not profitable if carried out in isolation, but requires an agreement among agents. In such situations the pattern of behaviors is richer than in dyadic games, because even opportunistic trustees who would breach trust when alone may act trustworthily based on what they believe to be the predominant course of action. Anticipating this, trusters may be more inclined to trust. We dub these motivations derived trustworthiness and derived trust. To capture them, we design a Collective Trust Game and study it by means of a laboratory experiment. We report that overall levels of trustworthiness are almost thirty percentage points higher when derived motivations are present, and this generates also higher levels of trust. In our set-up, the effects of derived trustworthiness are comparable in size to positive reciprocity, and more important than concerns for equality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our estimates yield a marginal propensity to consume out of transitory output of around 0.2. To explain this result we show, using instrumental variables techniques, that there is a significant negative effect of transitory output shocks on net current transfers and a significant positive and quantitatively large effect on the trade balance.

Subjects make consumption and saving decisions in an environment with two central features: first, there exists a decreasing probability of survival; and second, in addition to the regular income they get while active, they receive a unique lump-sum payment when retired. The results of this experiment show that rather than consuming too much during their income periods, subjects show a persistent precautionary saving behavior and over-save in the vast majority of periods.

This paper looks at two of such policies: the driving restriction program introduced in Mexico City in November of 1989-Hoy-No-Circula (HNC)-and the public transport reform carried out in Santiago in February of 2007-Transantiago (TS). Based on hourly concentration records of carbon monoxide, which comes primarily from vehicles exhaust, we find that household responses to both HNC and TS have been not only ultimately unfortunate-more cars on the road and higher pollution levels-but also remarkably similar in two important aspects: on how policy responses vary widely among income groups and on how fast households adjust their stock of vehicles, when they do.

To capture the gradual decline in unemployment for young workers as they age, the standard search model is extended so that workers gain experience when employed. Experienced workers have higher average productivity and lower job finding and separation rates that match wage and worker flow data. In this environment, minimum wages can have large effects on unemployment because they interact with a worker's ability to gain job experience. The increase in minimum wages between 2007 and 2009 can account for a 0.8 percentage point increase in the steady state unemployment rate and a 2.8 percentage point increase in unemployment for 15-24 year old workers in the model parameterized to simulate outcomes of high school educated workers. Minimum wages can also help explain the high rates of youth unemployment in France compared to the United States. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Generally an optimal equilibrium does not maximize the number of decisions the principal can credibly retain. Compared to no commitment, limited authority improves the quality of communication from the agent.

CATREG and CART, two data mining techniques, are employed and the implications of the outcomes are discussed. The outcomes confirm that the CFC plays a supplementary role to market information in predicting the market rate of return. In addition to confirmation of lunar calendar effect by the CFC, CATREG outperforms in three markets: Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. According to CART analyses, all the three markets value the funeral category of the CFC advice and this pattern coincides with the traditional wisdom of astrological knowledge. The latter two markets share the same set of CFC items while Taiwan has its own. This contrast indicates the market-dependent observance and different interpretation of the CFC items for determining an auspicious date for equity trading.

Instead of perfect competition and two industries, GRH assume Bertrand competition and a continuum of industries. GRH conclude that the equilibrium is unique if transport costs are low, that there is no trade for high transport costs, and that there is no equilibrium in pure strategies when transport costs are intermediate. In this note we reexamine the equilibrium analysis under different transport costs for a single industry (partial equilibrium) version of GRH's model. We confirm many of GRH's results, but also find that there are circumstances under which there are multiple equilibria, including equilibria in which trade patterns run counter to natural comparative advantage, and also find that there is a profitable deviation to the mixed-strategy equilibrium postulated by GRH for intermediate trading costs. We propose an alternative set of strategies for this case and establish that they constitute an equilibrium.","[Lyn, Gary] Univ Massachusetts, Lowell, MA USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Lowell; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lyn, G (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Lowell, MA USA.",,,,,,,,2,4,6,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The nodal pricing simulations illustrate that congestion and price patterns vary considerably between wind scenarios and within countries, and that a nodal price regime could make better use of existing network capacity, introducing substantial operational cost savings and reducing marginal power prices in the majority of European countries.

The empirical analysis involves the estimation of a theoretical model where log-earnings of children are determined by the log-earnings of parents and two sources of randomness arising from labor market and endowment shocks. An important feature of the model is that it predicts a nonlinear relationship between earnings across generations, thereby providing support for nonlinear specifications adopted previously. Using PSID data on father-son pairs in the US over the period 1968 to 2005, the results show that about one-third of the intergenerational earnings elasticity arises from investments with the remaining two-thirds coming from endowments. The results also show that the relative decomposition varies with log-earnings of fathers, with the investment effect dominating the endowment effect at low incomes and the reverse occurring at high incomes.

The BCA procedure estimates the wedges, and thus the kinds of distortions, that are most relevant in explaining output movements in each episode. Our results make a case for separating East Asian crises, which are mostly driven by the efficiency and investment wedges, from crises elsewhere, which are mostly driven by the efficiency and labor wedges.

In this study, we investigate whether workers close to cities are paid higher nonagricultural wages than workers in outlying rural areas. We find that workers close to urban areas not only benefit from more opportunities to engage in nonagricultural activities, but also from better paid jobs. In addition, we provide evidence on the transmission channels at work. The issue of spatial differences in nonagricultural earnings that we highlight is extremely serious for rural China where, because of the strong institutional restrictions on labour mobility, living conditions in an individual's birthplace still significantly affect his well-being.","[Duvivier, C.; Renard, M. -F.] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Li, S.] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Beijing Normal University,"Duvivier, C (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",chloe.duvivier@u-clermont1.fr,,"Duvivier, Chloe/0000-0001-9647-1285",,,,,30,8,8,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This is due to the fact that vertically integrated firms can shift profits from a high-tax jurisdiction, rendering this organizational type more attractive for more productive firms as compared to outsourcing at arm's length. Using data on intra-firm imports of US multinational firms, we provide empirical support for our theoretical findings. Apart from reduced-form regressions we structurally estimate and calibrate the multi-country model for the US and 27 host countries. We find that the observed increase in the tax gap between the US and the average host country of 3.1 percentage points has led to an increase of intra-firm trade flows by 5.5%. Our calibration suggests that this change was stimulated largely by a 9.8% increase in the number of vertically integrated multinational firms.

We examine how this result changes when the importing region is also endowed with the goods. We use a vertically-differentiated goods model with heterogeneous consumers in which prices are endogenously determined. We show that the importing regions with an endowment have a stronger Alchian-Allen effect than the regions that are not endowed.

We have conducted an experiment with 720 participants to explore whether the theoretical insights are reflected by the behaviour of subjects in the laboratory and to what extent deviations from standard theory can be explained by social preferences. Investigating settings with both exogenous and endogenous information structures, we find that agency theory is indeed useful to qualitatively predict how variations in the degree of uncertainty affect subjects' behaviour. Regarding the quantitative deviations from standard predictions, our analysis based on several control treatments and quantal response estimations shows that agents' behaviour can be explained by social preferences that are less pronounced than in conventional ultimatum games. Principals' own social preferences are not an important determinant of their behaviour. However, when the principals make contract offers, they anticipate that social preferences affect agents' behaviour.","[Hoppe, Eva I.; Schmitz, Patrick W.] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Hoppe, EI (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.",,"Schmitz, Patrick W./ABF-7031-2021","Schmitz, Patrick W./0000-0003-3461-5102",,,,,54,27,30,3,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Yet the relationship between relative wealth and the subjective well-being of children and adolescents remains largely unknown. This study examines the role of relative (peer) wealth in determining youth life satisfaction. Examining this relationship in the young is advantageous as children and adolescents have limited influence on their socio-economic status. Using school fixed effects, peer groups defined at the school-grade level are likely to be partially exogenous as the student's grade is largely determined by year of birth. The results suggest that relative wealth is negatively associated with life satisfaction, though mainly for males. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The agents simultaneously choose paths in the network connecting their demand nodes. A mechanism splits the total cost of the network formed among the participants. We introduce two new properties of implementation. The first property, Pareto Nash implementation (PNI), requires that the efficient outcome always be implemented in a Nash equilibrium and that the efficient outcome Pareto dominates any other Nash equilibrium. The average cost mechanism and other asymmetric variations are the only mechanisms that meet PNI. These mechanisms are also characterized under strong Nash implementation. The second property, weakly Pareto Nash implementation (WPNI), requires that the least inefficient equilibrium Pareto dominates any other equilibrium. The egalitarian mechanism (EG) and other asymmetric variations are the only mechanisms that meet WPNI and individual rationality.

This period coincides with the phenomenal and largely unanticipated performance of New York Knicks' starting point guard Jeremy Lin and the attendant public and media hype known as Linsanity. We employ a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach that includes allowance for an undesirable output, here turnovers per game, with the desirable outputs of points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks per game and an input of minutes per game. The results indicate that depending upon the specification, between 29% and 42% of NBA guards are fully efficient, including Jeremy Lin, with a mean inefficiency of 3.7% and 19.2%. However, while Jeremy Lin is technically efficient, he seldom serves as a benchmark for inefficient players, at least when compared with established players such as Chris Paul and Dwayne Wade. This suggests the uniqueness of Jeremy Lin's productive solution and may explain why his unique style of play, encompassing individual brilliance, unselfish play and team leadership, is of such broad public appeal.","[Lee, Boon L.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Worthington, Andrew C.] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Griffith University,"Lee, BL (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",bl.lee@qut.edu.au,"Lee, Boon/K-5178-2019","Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575; Worthington, Andrew/0000-0003-4113-9036",,,,,41,9,12,2,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It decomposes technical inefficiency among some of its sources and finds that the incentive tier of federal operating subsidies, regulations regarding years of vehicle use, subsidy-induced allocative distortion from labour overuse relative to capital negatively influence technical inefficiency in all transit systems. For the Latent Class 1 transit systems, the sources of lower technical inefficiency are operating speed, purchased transportation and years-of-vehicle-use regulation. For the Latent Class 2 transit systems, these sources are subsidy-induced capital-labour allocative distortion and the incentive tier component of the federal formula grant.","N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Mkt Transportat & Supply Chain, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University,"Obeng, K (通讯作者)，N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Mkt Transportat & Supply Chain, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA.",obengk@ncat.edu,,,,,,,24,10,10,0,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Among Black South Africans the relationship is non-decreasing over virtually the entire range of incomes/wealth. Furthermore in this group other measures of success (e.g., employment and education) are also associated with increases in body mass. This is true in both 1998 (the Demographic and Health Survey) and 2008 (National Income Dynamics Survey). A similar relationship holds among residents of Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Malawi, and Namibia. This suggests that body mass can be used as a crude measure of well-being. This allows us to examine the vexed question in South African labor economics whether there is involuntary unemployment.

We use data from the Family Budget Survey (2006) the first wave of this survey that was collected and compare it with 1990 data. To test the sensitivity of the results, we also use expenditure data from this survey and income data from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions. A regression-based approach is used to account for changes in inequality [Fields (2003), Yun (2006)]. Our findings show that the reduction in inequality has become more modest in the past two decades.

Trade is a vehicle for inter-country technological-knowledge diffusion and human-capital accumulation interacts with the intra-country direction of technological knowledge arising from trade. In contrast with the market-size effect, stressed in the skill-biased technological change literature, the operation of the price channel following openness to trade predicts, in line with the recent trends in developed and developing countries, an increasing technological-knowledge bias towards high-skilled human capital. This, in turn, decreases inter-country gaps of technological knowledge and human capital and increases intra-country wage inequality. Also in line with recent empirical evidence, inter-country wage convergence is induced by the trade-opening level effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This approach relies on tackling the real rather than the nominal interest rate. So if the nominal rate is (close to) zero central banks can influence the inflation expectations via quantitative easing. The unobservable inflation expectations are estimated with a state-space model that additionally generates a time varying series for the equilibrium real interest rate and the potential output both needed for estimations of Taylor reaction functions. We test our approach for the ECB and the Fed within the recent crisis. We add other explanatory variables to this modified Taylor reaction function and show that there are substantial differences between the estimated reaction coefficients in the pre- and crisis era for both central banks. While the central banks on both sides of the Atlantic act less inertially, put a smaller weight on the inflation gap, money growth and the risk spread, the response to asset price inflation becomes more pronounced during the crisis. However, the central banks diverge in their response to the output gap and credit growth.

One of the main policy instruments for redressing the imbalance between the prosperous coastal region and the poorer inland region has been the allocation of investment spending. Yet there is little empirical work evaluating the response of disparities to changes in the regional distribution of investment. We help fill this gap and analyse the two-way relationship between these variables within a VAR/VECM framework. We find, surprisingly, that changes in the regional allocation of investment have only a modest beneficial effect on inter-regional output disparities while the effect in the opposite direction is much larger. We find this conclusion to be robust to numerous variations in variable definition. The effects of investment allocation on output disparities are larger, although, for the post-1978 period they are smaller for SOE investment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A multivariate mixture of normal distributions is used to depict the heavy-tailed market risk factors and accordingly a closed form expression for the moment generating function that can reflect the change in option portfolio value can be derived. Moreover, in order to make use of the correlation between the characteristic function and the moment generating function, Fourier-Inversion method and adaptive Simpson rule with iterative algorithm of numerical integration into the nonlinear VaR model for option portfolio are applied for calculation of VaR values of option portfolio. VaR values of option portfolio obtained from different methods are compared. Numerical results of Fourier-Inversion method and Monte Carlo simulation method show that high accuracy VaR values can be obtained when risk factors have multivariate mixture of normal distributions than when they have normal distributions. Moreover, VaR values obtained by using the Fourier-Inversion method are not obviously different from VaR values obtained by using Monte Carlo simulation when market risk factors have normal distributions or multivariate mixture of normal distributions. However, the speed of computation is obviously faster when using Fourier-Inversion method, than when using Monte Carlo simulation method. Besides, Cornish Fisher method is faster and simpler than Monte Carlo simulation method or Fourier-Inversion method. However, this method does not offer high accuracy and cannot be used to calculate VaR values of option portfolio when market risk factors have heavy-tailed distributions. (C) 2013 The Authors.

By using a broad data set during 1995-2012, we address three key research questions: are there volatility spillovers within commodities? between standard assets and commodities? between commodities and commodity currencies? The main results indicate first that commodities exhibit weaker than other asset classes volatility spillovers. These spillovers have, however, been increasing over the period. Second, agricultural commodities are the commodities exhibiting the lowest spillovers, whereas precious metals and energy are the biggest net contributors. In a diversified portfolio, including commodities - and especially agricultural products - helps decreasing the total spillover index. This stylized fact has, however, been less and less valid over the years.

In fact, this conventional view is heavily shaped by the distinctive and peculiar circumstances of the last three decades, when the influence of international considerations on Fed policy has been limited. In fact, the Federal Reserve paid significant attention to international considerations in its first two decades, followed by relative inattention to such factors in the two-plus decades that followed, then back to renewed attention to international aspects of monetary policy in the 1960s, before the recent period of benign neglect of the international dimension. I argue that in the next few decades, international aspects are likely to play a larger role in Federal Reserve policy making than at present.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Eichengreen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",eichengr@econ.berkeley.edu,,"Eichengreen, Barry/0000-0002-1683-4486",,,,,37,5,6,0,9,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Unfortunately, these lessons are being learned in a highly uneven manner and in some important circles, not at all. In light of this struggle to adopt developmentally friendly financial structures, it is critical that the history and practices of these policies, as well as their costs and benefits, be well understood. There is much rich history of developmental finance and central banking to draw from and many lessons to be found there. In this paper, we survey some of this history, focusing on the late twentieth century, including a discussion of policies undertaken following the Great Financial Crisis. The major lesson we draw is that developmental roles of central banks and related financial institutions have been the dominant approach in many periods since the mid twentieth century at least, and that the neoliberal approach to these policies is much more the exception than the rule. The way forward out of this crisis is to recognize the current policies for what they are - experiments in more developmental policy and to build on them for the longer run, rather than see them as exceptional aberrations that should be abandoned at the first opportunity.","Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Epstein, G (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",,,,,,,,19,9,10,0,5,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In the Aligned treatment, the expert can send a white lie to the receiver, eliminating the negative effects of noise and improving both parties' payoffs. In the Conflict treatment, lies are harmful and the inability to commit to truthtelling destroys all meaningful communication in equilibrium unless there is a cost of lying. In the experiment, receivers are overly trusting and experts learn to take advantage of this. As experts gain experience they tell stronger and more frequent lies in both treatments, consistent with models of reinforcement learning. The findings suggest that neither harmful nor universal lie aversion is a factor when communication is noisy, provided individuals have time to discover their personal benefits of lies.

The key to our characterizations is a new condition, independence of irrelevant rankings (IIR). Intuitively, a mechanism satisfies IIR if whenever an agent's ranking at an object is irrelevant to her assignment, then it is irrelevant to the assignment of all agents. We demonstrate that a mechanism is Pareto efficient, strategy-proof, IIR, and satisfies mutual best if and only if it is top trading cycles. This provides a new insight into what distinguishes top trading cycles from all other efficient and strategy-proof assignment mechanisms. We provide a second characterization in terms of weak Maskin monotonicity. A mechanism satisfies Pareto efficiency, weak Maskin monotonicity, IIR, and mutual best if and only if it is top trading cycles. This allows us to directly compare top trading cycles to known characterizations of the deferred acceptance algorithm in terms of weak Maskin monotonicity.","N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Morrill, T (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",thayer_morrill@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,21,29,34,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Technical solutions are often applied that may impose inefficiencies across the fleet, even in periods or areas when the risk of bycatch is low. These may include gear specifically designed to avoid the bycatch which may also reduce the targeted catch, or designation of marine protected areas that exclude fishing from whole areas. In this article, we examine the effectiveness of a variable penalty system that can provide incentives for fishers to redirect their effort away from problem areas. The system is examined using a case study of fishery, which is currently subjected to gear and closure controls to limit bycatch of turtles and seabirds. An alternative incentive-based management policy using a series of differential hook penalties has been proposed as a flexible tool to discourage vessels operating in certain areas. The effects of various hook penalties and closures in key areas on fishing effort in those areas and elsewhere as well as vessel economic performance are assessed using a location choice model. The results suggest that incentive-based approaches may result in lower costs to industry than closures provided some level of residual bycatch is acceptable.","[Pascoe, Sean; Innes, James; Norman-Lopez, Ana] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, EcoSci Precinct, Wealth Oceans Flagship, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Wilcox, Chris; Dowling, Natalie] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Wealth Oceans Flagship, Castray Esplanade, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Pascoe, S (通讯作者)，CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, EcoSci Precinct, Wealth Oceans Flagship, POB 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",sean.pascoe@csiro.au,"Wilcox, Chris/A-3585-2010; Norman, Ana/K-4501-2012; Dowling, Natalie/D-9376-2014; Innes, James/D-9424-2011; Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011","Norman, Ana/0000-0002-3193-0951; Innes, James/0000-0003-1975-6062; Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649",,,,,47,10,11,0,131,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Increases in commodity price volatility have raised concerns about the usefulness of commodity futures and options as risk management tools. Dynamic hedging strategies have the potential to improve risk management when conditional (co)variances depart significantly from their unconditional, long-run counterparts and may be useful to decision-makers despite their greater complexity and higher transaction costs. We propose a Nonparametric Copula-based Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (NPC-GARCH) approach to estimate time-varying hedge ratios, and evaluate the benefits of dynamic hedging during four sub-periods between 2000 and 2011 using a stylized Texas cattle feedlot management problem. The NPC-GARCH approach allows for a flexible, nonlinear and asymmetric dependence structure between cash and futures prices for different commodities. We find that NPC-GARCH dynamic hedging performs better than either static, GARCH-Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) or GARCH-Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner (BEKK) hedging in terms of lower tail risk (expected shortfall), but that there is no significant difference between hedging approaches in terms of portfolio variance reduction.","[Power, Gabriel J.] Univ Laval, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance & Insurance, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Vedenov, Dmitry V.; Anderson, David P.; Klose, Steven] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Laval University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Power, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance & Insurance, 2325 Rue Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",gabriel.power@fsa.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,50,13,16,0,103,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using meta-frontier data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach, this paper proposes a new method for measuring energy efficiency by considering the technology gap and analyzes it as a discrete source of energy inefficiency. This empirical study has three major findings: Firstly, the energy efficiency and technology gap are significantly different in the east, central and west, and most provinces in the east maintain high energy efficiency and advanced production technology, while energy efficiency in the west is on the contrary. Secondly, both the technology gap and management related to energy utilization are important sources of energy inefficiency in the central and the west provinces, and the effect of the technology gap is more obvious. Finally, though overall energy efficiency in China is not high by relative standards and significant regional difference exists, potential energy-saving strategies have been discovered in recent years.

Second, we develop a model with spatial externalities to investigate how the concentration of the creative class can promote regional productivity. Our analysis confirms the importance of spatial agglomeration of the creative class in stimulating regional productivity. The results also imply that regional productivity is greater in markets with higher levels of innovation, capital stock, manufacturing and urbanization.

We argue that there is a problem of prevention in that this lack of care often stems from agents' rational calculations. Positive experiences lead agents to underestimate the risks of disasters; technological improvements and redundancies designed for safety induce agents to reduce their care. Although lower care increases the chances of an accident, the number of redundancies can be adjusted to offset this. However, the accident probability remains constant even as ostensible improvements in safety are made.

The analysis reveals that the lower level of welfare in the rural areas within any given region is primarily because of differences in characteristics of the population in rural vs. urban areas. Differences in returns generally account for the most part of the welfare differences between urban areas of different regions and Bangkok or rural areas of other regions compared with the rural northeast.

A balanced panel data is constructed for the selected 17 East Asian-Pacific countries, and the cointegration relationship among the variables of the export demand function is verified using Pedroni's heterogeneous panel cointegration tests. The empirical results indicate that the effect of foreign debt on exports is conditional on the magnitude of currency depreciation. The larger the depreciation of a currency, the more its exports are adversely affected by its foreign liability. This finding might be a possible explanation as to why large exchange rate depreciation during the 1997 financial crisis failed to generate the export boom. The results also show different effects of financial shocks on exports in these economies.","[Tang, Kin Boon; Tan, Hui Boon] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia; [Naseem, Niaz Ahmad Mohd] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia",University of Nottingham Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Tang, KB (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Univ Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia.",kinboon.tang@nottingham.edu.my,"ahmad, mohd naseem niaz/AAL-4862-2020","ahmad, mohd naseem niaz/0000-0003-0695-7025",,,,,30,2,2,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Traditionally, STEs have exercised exclusive rights to import the so-called strategic products, to ensure food security, domestic price stabilization, and import mark-ups. However, STE imports have been criticized on the grounds that industries using soybeans as a raw material are unable to obtain a diverse mix of quality material and cannot exercise the right to choose their own ingredients. Under a theoretical framework, a tariff equivalent of the STE is postulated to equate imports by private firms with imports by the STE. An empirical model is constructed and estimated using annual data spanning 1980-2009. The estimated results show that providing exclusive rights to imports has a negative effect on market access. When the STE pursues consumer welfare, the import-reducing effect turns out to be smaller than that in the producer welfare maximization case.","[Yoon, Jung-Hyun] Korea Rural Econ Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Lim, Song Soo] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Lim, SS (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",songsoo@korea.ac.kr,"Lim, Song Soo/AAQ-7712-2020; Lim, Song Soo/Q-1560-2015","Lim, Song Soo/0000-0002-2894-1879",,,,,32,0,0,1,16,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 25,2013,7.0,,,,,,,,201331.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-31,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,188TZ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000322218700001,0

The causality analysis was estimated at aggregated and disaggregated level where the focus of the analysis was on the agricultural sector. The disaggregated causality analysis indicated a bi-directional causality between the agricultural electricity consumption and the agricultural GDP in India, while in Pakistan the causality was found to run from agricultural GDP to agricultural electricity consumption. At the aggregated level, India confirmed conservation hypothesis while Pakistan confirmed feedback hypothesis. From the public policy point of view, it can be inferred that, at the macro level, any electricity conservation measures in India will not have an affect on India's increasing economic growth prospects and hence a policy-favourite supply-enhancement strategy in the form of increasing electricity generation needs to be balanced with a demand-management strategy.

In order to do so, the determinants of carbon dioxide emissions convergence are estimated for a cross-section of 182 countries over the period 1980 to 2008. A propensity score matching approach is combined with difference-in-differences techniques to effectively isolate the effect of the Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) variable. The usual controls for scale, composition and technique effects are added to the estimated model and the endogeneity of income and trade variables is modeled using instruments. The main results indicate that the CO2 emissions of the pairs of countries that belong to an RTA with environmental provisions tend to converge and are lower in absolute terms, whereas this is not the case for RTAs without environmental provisions. As regards specific agreements, we find that emissions converge more rapidly for NAFTA than for EU-27 and Euro-Med countries. We find consistent evidence that only RTAs with environmental harmonization policies affect relative and absolute pollution levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

At the zero bound, this country cannot counter this shock. Then it may be optimal for the partner country to raise interest rates. The partner may set a positive policy interest rate, even though its natural interest rate is below zero.

This paper maintains that economics should be domain focused, with a core of scarcity-based analysis of its domain, integrated into a broader analysis. It also holds that the scarcity-based analysis of realities falling outside the economic domain is not economics, but rather a social science broader in respect to the field but narrower in respect to the analysis, and thus partial in its conclusions. Section 2 introduces these versions of economics, Section 3 links them to specific conceptions of rationality, Section 4 provides arguments for the papers thesis and Section 5 deals with two related versions of maximisation and argues for adopting one of them.","[Crespo, Ricardo F.] Univ Austral, IAE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Crespo, Ricardo F.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Austral University; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Crespo, RF (通讯作者)，Univ Austral, IAE, Paraguay 1114 C1057AAR, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",rcrespo@iae.edu.ar,"Crespo, Ricardo/AAF-3880-2020",,,,,,69,8,10,2,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

A key assumption is that agents' preferences for a location depend on both an intrinsic attractiveness and on the social characteristics of the neighborhood. The stationary space distribution of income is analytically and numerically characterized. The main results are that socio-spatial segregation occurs if - and only if - the social influence is strong enough, but even so, some social diversity is preserved at most locations. Comparison with data on the Paris housing market shows that the results reproduce general trends of price distribution and spatial income segregation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We index the degree of nonignorable selection governing the missing data process by the maximal Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the distributions of missing and observed outcomes across all values of the covariates. Sharp bounds on minimum mean square approximations to conditional quantiles are derived as a function of the nominal level of selection considered in the sensitivity analysis and a weighted bootstrap procedure is developed for conducting inference. Using these techniques, we conduct an empirical assessment of the sensitivity of observed earnings patterns in U.S. Census data to deviations from the MAR assumption. We find that the well documented increase in the returns to schooling between 1980 and 1990 is relatively robust to deviations from the missing at random assumption except at the lowest quantiles of the distribution, but that conclusions regarding heterogeneity in returns and changes in the returns function between 1990 and 2000 are very sensitive to departures from ignorability.","[Kline, Patrick] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kline, Patrick] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Santos, Andres] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Kline, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",pkline@econ.berkeley.edu; a2santos@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,31,20,28,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

According to the authors' estimations, only the interest rate differential plays a role in central banks' decisions. Central banks do not seem to take into account in their foreign exchange interventions any possible negative impacts on the profit and loss statement that may result from an adverse exchange rate trend, the costs of sterilizing foreign exchange interventions, or high exchange rate volatility.","[Mandel, Martin; Tomsik, Vladimir] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Tomsik, Vladimir] Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech National Bank,"Mandel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

This paper revisits this topic employing nonlinear threshold VECM to take into account the nonlinear dynamics of equilibrium adjustment. Our results show that crude oil spot and futures prices are cointegrated only when the price differentials are larger than the threshold value. Moreover, we use a multi-frequency analysis based on low-pass filtering with different cut-off frequencies. The main findings indicate that the relationships between spot and futures prices are different between in the short-term and in the long-term. In the short-term, futures price plays the major role in the formation of long-run equilibrium (error correction mechanism). In the long-term, both spot and futures prices contribute to the dynamics of long-run equilibrium. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The model consists of 11 productive sectors, 3 different labor force categories with unemployment, and 20 households divided by income and location. Changes in wages and migration are estimated using a labor participation model, and a NIDS estimates the demands of the households. Changes in household economic welfare, measured by changes in income and prices (CV and EV measurements), are very sensitive to the reinvestments that the government makes in the economy. By analyzing six different scenarios with different assumptions about changes in drug prices, investments of the government, and the termination of the armed conflict, the results suggest that economic welfare improves when the government reinvests military expenditures in other productive sectors or when the economy of war' continues and the legalization does not end the armed conflict.","[Atuesta, Laura] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Hewings, Geoffrey J.

In this paper, we study the effects of two commonly observed subsidy systems on the strategic behavior of competing firms. We compare a per unit subsidy to a subsidy allocated according to the firms' market shares. We show that, holding the total subsidy budget constant, the per unit subsidy results in lower prices, higher output, lower profits and higher overall welfare as compared to the market-share based alternative. However, we also find that a market-share based subsidy makes collusive behavior between firms much harder. Our results suggest a potential trade-off between short-run and long-run objectives: subsidy systems designed to widen participation may favor collusive behavior. The welfare implications of this trade-off are discussed. Our findings have important policy implications for the design of subsidy systems.","[Bouckaert, Jan; De Borger, Bruno] Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Bouckaert, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",jan.bouckaert@ua.ac.be; bruno.deborger@ua.ac.be,"De Borger, Bruno/K-4690-2015","De Borger, Bruno/0000-0001-8810-0513",,,,,31,3,3,0,17,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

The experimental design made the participants face distributive situations where different moral motives came into play, and based on the observed behavior we estimate a social preference model focusing on how people make trade-offs between entitlements, needs, and self-interest. The study provides four main findings. First, entitlement considerations are crucial in explaining distributive behavior in the experiment; second, needs considerations matter a lot for some participants; third, the participants acted as moral cosmopolitans and did not assign importance to nationality in their distributive choices; and, finally, the participants' choices are consistent with a self-serving bias in their social preferences.","[Moene, Karl O.] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,,alexander.cappelen@nhh.no; k.o.moene@econ.uio.no; erik.sorensen@nhh.no; bertil.tungodden@nhh.no,"CAPPELEN, ALEXANDER/AAY-1676-2021","Sorensen, Erik O./0000-0002-7155-4188",,,,,37,65,70,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Within the context of a three-firm industry, a central union that sets a uniform wage is shown to induce a partial R&D network that includes two firms but excludes the third. In contrast, we find that, under less centralised union structures, firms have incentives to form R&D networks with a larger number of alliances. This result is consistent with the stylised facts for industrialised countries: recent decades have seen an upsurge in R&D alliances along with labour market deregulation towards more flexible wage-setting institutions.","[Ferrett, Ben] Univ Loughborough, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Zikos, Vasileios] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Bangkok, Thailand",Loughborough University; University Thai Chamber Commerce,"Ferrett, B (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",b.e.ferrett@lboro.ac.uk,,"Ferrett, Benjamin/0000-0002-6356-0481",,,,,27,2,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

The country's economic growth has arguably been the fastest among post-conflict societies, driven by the credible restoration of peace and security, large public and private capital inflows, economic openness, reasonably prudent macroeconomic management, and a dynamic, integrating neighborhood. A legacy of history and small size is that the government has limited policy space, although this has not necessarily retarded economic development. We also highlight some key challenges, including rising inequality, uneven spatial development, weak institutions, and high levels of corruption.

This article employs joint maximum likelihood to estimate models of time since last dental visit treating private ancillary health insurance (PAHI) as endogenous. The sensitivity of results to the choice between two different but related types of instrumental variables is examined. We find robust evidence in both 1995 and 2001 that individuals with a PAHI policy make significantly more frequent dental consultations relative to those without such coverage. A comparison of the 1995 and 2001 results, however, suggests that there has been an increasing role of PAHI in terms of the frequency of dental consultations over time. This seems intuitive given the trends in the price of unsubsidised private dental consultations. In terms of policy, our results suggest that while government measures to increase private health insurance coverage in Australia have been successful to a significant degree, that success may have come at some cost in terms of socio-economic inequality as the privately insured are provided much better access to care and financial protection.","[Hopkins, Sandra] Curtin Univ, Ctr Int Hlth, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Kidd, Michael P.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Business, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Ulker, Aydogan] Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Curtin University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Deakin University,"Ulker, A (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",ulker@deakin.edu.au,"kidd, michael/C-4230-2013","kidd, michael/0000-0001-6906-625X",,,,,30,12,12,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

To develop institutions that address this issue, it is critical that we understand the mechanisms through which diversity and public goods are related. A simple model of public good provision is developed to demonstrate that there are potentially measurable differences between existing theories, particularly in the distribution of the public good to minority groups. These differences are then illustrated with respect to the distribution of drinking water, electricity and education across 18 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.

After adjusting for household size, rural incomes in Kosovo are low. For the poorest quartile of sampled households, incomes per household member are below EUR657 per annum. Overall, agricultural sales account for only 27% of total (cash) income and OGAs make a substantial contribution to the livelihoods of rural households. The poorest households are characterised by lower engagement in self-employment, are less likely to receive remittances, have less non-agricultural work experience and the head of the household has low educational attainment. The poorest quartile operates significantly smaller farms and is less likely to sell agricultural output. There is considerable underemployment of family members and, if the economic situation improves, the flow of labour out of agriculture is likely to be substantial. The main self-reported barriers to self-employment are insufficient capital and credit, suggesting a role for mircofinance schemes to enable start-ups and small business expansion. In dealing with its current chronic economic problems in rural areas, Kosovo would be best served by adapting measures from a development agenda, particularly microfinance and policies to support self-employment.","[Osmani, Faton] Consulate Republ Kosovo, London, England; [Gorton, Matthew] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [White, John] Univ Plymouth, Sch Business, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of Plymouth,"White, J (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Sch Business, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",john.white@plymouth.ac.uk,"Gorton, Matthew/A-7653-2009; Gorton, Matthew/GPP-3457-2022","Gorton, Matthew/0000-0002-4579-5092; Gorton, Matthew/0000-0002-4579-5092; White, John/0000-0002-5684-1461",,,,,31,10,10,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUN 1,2013,25.0,2,,,,,241,252,,10.1080/14631377.2013.787756,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,137XY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318472900007,0

In contrast to the hypothesis of a credit crunch, we find that increasing the strength of bank capital requirements does not necessarily reduce the equilibrium quantity of loans, provided that banks have the option to respond to the capital requirements by accumulating more equity instead of cutting back on lending. Accordingly, we show that there is an inverted-U-shaped relationship between CAR and capital accumulation (and consumption). Furthermore, the optimal capital adequacy ratio for social-welfare maximization is lower than that for capital-accumulation maximization. In accordance with general empirical findings, the capital-accumulation maximizing capital adequacy ratio is procyclical with respect to economic conditions. We also find that monetary policy affects the real macroeconomic activities via the so-called bank lending channel, but the effectiveness of monetary policy is weakened by bank capital requirements.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of competitive equilibrium for a warm-glow economy (henceforth, warm-glow equilibrium) and establish both existence and welfare properties. The warm-glow equilibrium concept may prove to be very useful to the normative and positive theory of public goods provision. First, it is a price-based mechanism achieving efficient outcomes. Second, not only could the warm-glow equilibria outcomes serve as a point of reference to measure free-riding and welfare loss but also, as suggested by Bernheim and Rangel (Behavioral Economics and Its Applications, 2007), in large economies they may be approximated by Walrasian equilibria outcomes.","Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Allouch, N (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",n.allouch@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,5,5,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Two interrelated processes interacted to deliver a quite complex idiosyncratic systemic crisis. First, new classical macroeconomics had diffused the belief that market economies are structurally stable, money is neutral, financial markets are efficient and that the only culprit is public finance. The euro crisis was thus inaccurately diagnosed. Second, in the political arena, monetary integration has been used by many governments as a justification for liberalisation reforms opposed by various domestic social groups. At the European level, most governments have been defending national interests, whereas the European Commission and European Parliament had lost most of their expertise and legitimacy in defending a common community in line euro ambitions.

We match data on the Rosenwald Schools Program, an early 20th century initiative aimed at the Southern black-white school quality gap, to newly assembled data on local school districts and measure the impact of Rosenwald gifts on African-American public school resources. Although these gifts increased contemporaneous expenditures on African-American schools, results show that they yielded no lasting change in multiple school quality proxies. Further, because Rosenwald funds were diverted or implicitly matched to favor white schools, we find no evidence that the Fund reduced the black-white gap in superficial school quality. We demonstrate, however, that overall black public education expenditures in this era had a steeper marginal effect on black attendance and literacy measures than white public expenditures had on white outcome measures, which helps to explain why the Rosenwald program led to meaningful human capital gains for black, but not white, individuals despite its failure to impact relative school quality.

The evidence suggests that Chinese monetary policies have significantly asymmetric effects on the stock market in different time periods and market cycles. The effects of shocks from interest rate and reserve rate vary across market cycles but effects from money supply and exchange rate do not. Empirical evidence from the non-linear model shows that monetary policy changes increase stock market volatility, even though these monetary policies are often aimed at stabilizing macro-economic activities.

To explain why these two mechanisms coexist, I estimate a structural model of competing sellers who differ in the value of their outside options. Buyers are allowed to value auctioned and posted-price goods differently but the estimated value distributions suggest that differences across buyers do not explain the mechanism coexistence that I observe. In contrast, differences across sellers' outside options are important: the value of the outside option segments the market with high outside-option sellers choosing to post a fixed price. There are two key forces at work that drive this empirical result. First, competition between sellers favors coexistence over an auction-only or a posted-price-only marketplace because sellers prefer to be in a market with fewer rivals. Second, sellers with more valuable outside options prefer the posted-price mechanism because posted-price goods sell less often than auctioned goods but at a higher price.

The presence of sunk export entry costs and efficiency uncertainty gives rise to hysteresis in export market participation. A firm will enter into the export market once it achieves a given size, reflecting its efficiency, but may keep exporting even after its efficiency has fallen below its initial entry level. Some exporters will not be selling as much in the domestic market as other firms that never entered the foreign market. The model captures the qualitative features of firm birth, growth, export market entry and exit, and death found in the empirical literature. We calibrate the model to match relevant statistics of firms' turnover and export dynamics in the United States, and show that the mode of globalization (a reduction in sunk costs as opposed to overhead costs), matters for a firm's selection and persistence in export status. Trade liberalization via a reduction in sunk export entry costs reduces a firm's export status persistence, while the opposite happens when liberalization takes place through a reduction in overhead export costs.

Program participation was largely determined by whether a county's pre-program income fell below a given poverty line; hence, a regression discontinuity approach is employed to estimate the causal effects of the program. Using a panel data set, we find that the 8-7 Plan resulted in an approximately 38-percent increase in rural income for counties that were treated between 1994 and 2000.

We use country-level panel data from the 1960-2009 period. In order to verify the beta-convergence hypothesis, we use the Bayesian averaging of classical estimates (BACE) approach proposed by Sala-i-Martin et al. (2004). We estimate a convergence model without imposing an a priori assumption regarding the exact set of growth factors used as control variables in the regression. We use twenty potential growth factors (and an initial GDP level as an additional factor) and additional dummy variables (for Central and Eastern European and Commonwealth of Independent States countries) to further reduce the heterogeneity of the considered population. Our research allows us to robustly confirm the existence of beta-convergence at a rate of 1.5 percent to 2 percent per annum. Using the BACE approach, we also identify the most relevant growth factors to be included in the beta-convergence model. Our results are not controversial but in some respects differ from those present in the mainstream literature.","[Prochniak, Mariusz] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 2, Warsaw, Poland; [Witkowski, Bartosz] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Warsaw School of Economics,"Próchniak, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 2, Warsaw, Poland.",,,"Witkowski, Bartosz/0000-0003-0940-0265",,,,,37,13,13,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Although export demand functions have been studied for at least seventy years of time, the issue of nonlinearity in export demand equations has been benignantly neglected in time series econometrics so far. Accordingly, this paper fills this gap and figures out if exports react to exchange rate changes in a nonlinear fashion. To tackle this issue, we apply the newly developed nonlinear ARDL bounds testing approach of Shin et al. (2011) and find that disregarding nonlinearities might be too restrictive. Our evidence points to the fact that exports react differently to appreciations and depreciations. More precisely, it seems as if exports respond stronger to depreciations than to appreciations. Evidence in favor of hysteresis is less robust. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

From policy rule to stop-and-go,OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Prior to and during the first stage of the crisis, the ECB's conduct of monetary policy was consistent with the 'separation principle', which refers to the division between monetary and liquidity management policies. However, it became increasingly difficult to apply as interest rates approached their lower-bound. While it was supposed to guide the ECB's exit strategy, the ECB finally resorted to a 'stop-and-go policy'. The separation principle strongly depends upon the institutional setup in which the central bank operates. We show that the difficulties faced by the ECB are due to an important feature of the monetary union, which economic governance is essentially rule-based. The success of a monetary union crucially depends on the strict compliance to the rules. The breach of the rules forced the ECB to stabilize euro area sovereign debt markets, stretching its mandate and altering the efficacy of the separation principle.","[Bordes, Christian] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Clerc, Laurent] Banque France, Direct Stabilite Financiere, F-75049 Paris 01, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Bordes, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",christian.bordes@univ-paris1.fr; laurent.clerc2@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Our results indicate a positive assortative matching in the political capital market. More productive firms are paired with more powerful politicians. Furthermore, the preference for political capital relative to conventional human capital increases in firms' dependence on external financing and the inefficiency of local governments. Conditional on the endogenous matching, new hires with political capital receive more compensation than their co-workers in the same cohort.

Sunk Cost and Market Structure: Price Competition, Advertising, and the Evolution of Concentration. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1991.). The relevance of the EFC framework to supermarket competition stems from the industry's surprisingly uniform competitive structure: irrespective of the size of the local market, a small number of firms (between three and six) capture the majority of sales. As markets grow, local rivalry drives firms to expand their fixed investments, limiting the number of firms that can profitably enter even the largest markets. Although markets stay concentrated, competition remains fierce, reflecting the inherently rivalrous nature of the underlying competitive mechanism. The goal of this paper is to identify the strategic focus of this rivalry, namely the drive to provide an ever greater variety of consumer products, and to eliminate alternative explanations for the observed structure by highlighting the unique form of firm conduct that characterizes this industry.

The findings show that when the FFD concept is one of the tools available for controlling the merger process, firms can strategically embark on a merger that makes other firms fail and then buy out the exiting outsider firm(s), thereby leading to the monopolization of the industry.

Hufbauer argues that the success of the multilateral approach is at least partly because the GATT departed from the strictly unconditional definition of the most-favored nation (MFN) rule in the late 1970s already. Regional agreements such as NAFTA complemented, rather than hindered, multilateral trade liberalization in the past. The political economy of further multilateral liberalization has become increasingly complicated since countries such as Brazil, China, and India have emerged as relevant players. Against this backdrop, Hufbauer expects regionalism to become the strongest vehicle for delivering liberalization in the future. This could still leave a bright future for the WTO as a house of plurilaterals, i.e., agreements on specific issues such as services liberalization with conditional MFN treatment of varying membership.","Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics,"Hufbauer, GC (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC USA.",ghufbauer@petersoninstitute.org,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,14,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 15,2013,7.0,,,,,,,,20139.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-9,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,185JC,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321962700001,0

A number of policies and market mechanisms aiming for capacity adequacy and market stability exist: in this paper we focus on one of these, mothballing of generation capacity. In electricity markets, mothballing is the possibility for a power generation company to temporarily withdraw generation capacity for a time, often for a year or more. Our hypothesis is that mothballing will help to stabilize markets, but at the same time increase prices. We test this hypothesis using laboratory experiments, with a simplified model of a generic electricity market. We report an experiment with twelve markets, where subjects make investment decisions: half of them had full capacity utilization (T1) and the other half had the option to mothball capacity (T2). The predictions of the effects of mothballing were confirmed in the experimental markets: prices and generation capacity exhibit clear cycles in T1, and damped cycles in the second set of experiments, T2. Furthermore, mothballing leads to higher prices on average. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It appears therefore that both current marriage market conditions and foreseeable improvements in the future marriage market prospects of women influenced fertility behaviour in the immediate aftermath of WWII.","Univ Magdeburg, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany; RWI, Kettering, Northants, England; IZA, Bonn, Germany",Otto von Guericke University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kvasnicka, M (通讯作者)，RWI Berlin Off, Hessische Str 10, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",Michael.Kvasnicka@rwi-essen.de,"Bethmann, Dirk/N-6816-2017","Bethmann, Dirk/0000-0002-1949-4106",,,,,61,24,31,2,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

The same input is produced by another division of the formal sector, which generates less pollution than the informal sector since the former uses a different type of capital that embodies EST. The formal sector has to pay a penalty for using the output of the excessively polluting informal sector. In this scenario, the analysis finds that foreign capital inflow in the formal sector may accentuate pollution, even if it involves transfer of EST. This result can at least question the favorable environmental impact of FDI in a developing economy even if it involves transfer of EST. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Households that invest mainly in safe assets do not need to protect themselves against future and unexpected financial losses. Consequently, once we control for households' sources of risk beside financial ones, the amount of precautionary savings of a household investing exclusively in safe assets should be lower compared to households who detain a non-negligible share of risky assets in their portfolio. Results show that, as expected, a strong and negative correlation exists between the desired amount of precautionary wealth and the ownership of a portfolio made exclusively of safe assets.","Ctr NS Econ Res CRENoS, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy",,"Deidda, M (通讯作者)，Ctr NS Econ Res CRENoS, Via S Giorgio 12, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.",manuela.deidda@crenos.unica.it,,"Deidda, Manuela/0000-0002-0921-6970",,,,,34,4,6,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In contrast, we find little evidence of impacts of other non-drinking aspects of family background on students' drinking. Parental and older sibling drinking appears to affect subjective attitudes of students towards what constitutes problem drinking behavior. We investigated historical origins of drinking behavior including the role of the Church, English cultural influences, the importance of the brewery and distilling industry, and the influence of weather. We find relatively strong influences of the Catholic Church and English colonial settlement patterns on Irish drinking patterns but little influence of Irish weather.

This article first characterises different emigration patterns that may arise in equilibrium, then seeks the conditions that lead a government to promote brain-drain. The model shows that the government may promote skilled emigration among workers with intermediate skills even though the resulting brain drain decreases per capita income. Emigrants remittances outweigh the income they would produce if they did not emigrate. Therefore, the government makes less severe the fall in per capita income that follows the brain drain by encouraging emigration among those skilled workers who are more productive abroad.","Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Romero, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Econ, Av Lib OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile.",gabriel.romero@usach.cl,"Romero, José Gabriel/AAE-1999-2020","Romero, José Gabriel/0000-0002-4142-4331",,,,,24,3,5,0,39,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Understanding energy use in post-2002 China,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Energy; Economy; Structural change,DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS; INTENSITY; EMISSIONS; INDEX,"From 2002 to 2009. China's energy use nearly doubled, making it the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide more than a decade ahead of forecasts. Why did energy use in China rise so rapidly after 20027 Using index decomposition analysis, we find that the vast majority of growth in energy consumption in China over the 2000s was due to GDP growth, with a small but important amount due to structural change as a result of China's emergence as a net metals exporter. Changing prices and data anomalies make energy intensity and structural change appear to be more important drivers of energy consumption than they actually were; the infamous reversal in energy intensity in China from 2002 to 2004 may simply be an artifact of difficulties in accurately deflating value added. About half of the growth in energy consumption in China from 2002 to 2007 was driven by heavy industry. Using structural decomposition analysis, we find that growth in heavy industrial output was due primarily to growth in construction and equipment investment, with a small amount due to an increase in net metal exports. In tandem, these two findings suggest that the primary driver of energy consumption in China after 2002 was an acceleration of the country's investment-dominated model of GDP growth. Without rebalancing the economy toward consumption, there are limits to what improvements in energy conversion efficiency and end use energy efficiency can achieve in moderating growth in China's energy use.

During this period the government implemented a classical rate-cut-cum-base-broadening tax policy for large companies. Tax policy for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is more difficult to characterize: in the first two terms, rates were cut more frequently than for large businesses and the base was narrowed, but in the governments third term, statutory rates for SMEs were increased. Extensive reforms of dividends and capital gains tax at the individual and corporate level have also been implemented: in 1998, the imputation system was abolished and in 2009, foreign dividends became exempt for corporate income tax purposes. A comparison of the statutory and effective rates shows that the UK has lost some ground to the OECD since 20034, fundamental reforms of dividends and capital gains taxation have aligned the UK to its competitors and to EU law. We find that the overall effect of the Labours tax policy on aggregate investment may have been small, for three reasons. Increases in real investment between 1997 and 2007 are largely explained by the economic cycle, while the reduction in the tax component of the user cost of capital was small. Moreover, the increase in aggregate investment was led by an exceptional surge in investment in structures driven by a real estate boom. Finally, we note that most investment was undertaken by large companies, and therefore it was not affected by the large set of tax reforms focusing on SMEs.",,,,giorgia.maffini@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,29,5,6,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

To illustrate the uncertainty associated with citations-based rankings, I compute the standard error of the impact factor for all economics journals with a five-year impact factor in the 2011 Journal Citations Report. I use these to derive confidence intervals for the impact factors as well as ranges of possible rank for a subset of thirty journals. I find that the impact factors of the top two journals are well defined and set these journals apart in a clearly defined group. An elite group of 9-11 mainstream journals can also be fairly reliably distinguished. The four bottom ranked journals are also fairly clearly set apart. For the remainder of the distribution, confidence intervals overlap and rankings are quite uncertain.

In order to achieve the best economic outcomes, the participants in a microgrid can benefit from cooperation in microgrid design and operation. In this paper, a mathematical programming formulation is presented for fair. optimised cost distribution amongst participants in a general microgrid. The proposed formulation is based on the Game-theory Nash bargaining solution approach for finding optimal multi-partner cost levels subject to given upper bounds on the equivalent annual costs. The microgrid planning problem concerning the fair electricity transfer price and unit capacity selection is first formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming model. Then, a separable programming approach is applied to reform the resulting mixed integer non-linear programming model to a mixed integer linear programming form.

On the other hand, a 10% increase in the minimum wage is significantly correlated with a 3%-5% rise in teen birth rates. This finding is explained by further regressions, which reveal that an increase in the minimum wage is significantly associated with (1) higher earnings among male teens, (2) an increase in teen marriage rates, and (3) an increase in fertility among married teens but not among unmarried females. Finally, estimates based on the 2003 and 2005 waves of the Canadian Community Health Surveys demonstrate that married teens are more likely to engage in sex as well as unprotected intercourse in comparison with single teens.

Locations with greater concentration of a particular sector have not experienced faster TFP growth during this period. Rather, local sector diversity was associated with higher long-run TFP growth. However, there is no evidence that the diversity effect was driven by the local interaction with a set of suppliers and/or clients. We interpret this as evidence that agglomeration economies are driven by other factors such as the sharing of access to specialized inputs not provided solely by a single sector, e. g. skills or financing.","[Almeida, Rita; Fernandes, Ana M.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Fernandes, AM (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",afernandes@worldbank.org,,,,,,,40,7,8,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Increasing returns, imperfect competition, and the international economy. MIT Press, Cambridge, 1985) provide a synthesis of the traditional factor proportions theory of international trade and the theory of international trade due to the exploitation of scale economies in imperfectly competitive markets. They derive illuminating results about trade patterns and gains from trade, among other things, leaving unanswered the question of existence of equilibrium, however. The central significance of their characterization of properties of free trade equilibria with inter-industry and intra-industry trade calls for an analysis of existence of equilibrium. This is the object of the present paper. We prove the existence of equilibrium for the integrated multi-sector multi-factor Helpman-Krugman economy without national borders. Well-known conditions ensure that the world economy under free trade reproduces this equilibrium and thus establishes existence of a free trade equilibrium. Since an equilibrium of the integrated economy is not necessarily unique, the same holds true for a free trade equilibrium.","Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Arnold, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",lutz.arnold@wiwi.uni-r.de,,,,,,,50,1,2,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We focus in particular on small island developing states [SIDS] which appear to be highly vulnerable in both economic and environmental dimensions. Hence, our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce some new sustainability components into the standard Human Development Indicator [HDI]. Second, we adopt an endogenous weighting system rather than the more common equal weighting system, determined within the Data Envelopment Analysis framework (Charnes et al., 1978). We apply the recent multiplicative optimization approach of Zhou et al. (2010) to construct composite indicators. Then, by implementing this original composite indicator to a set of developing countries including 32 SIDS and comparing the outcomes with standard HDI, we demonstrate that these small islands are not particularly penalized in terms of sustainable human development.

For firms that innovate and outsource, the probability of future innovation is 49% compared to 8% for those who outsource without innovating. Comparing across firms that innovate, simultaneous outsourcing increases the probability of future innovation by 5%. Innovation-oriented outsourcing is accompanied with firms shifting expenditure to research and development.

But policies are often hard to alter once in place. We argue that this inertia can result in well-intended policies having sizable negative long-run effects on aggregate output and productivity. In our theory, financial frictions provide a rationale for providing subsidized credit to productive entrepreneurs to alleviate the credit constraints they face. In the short run, such targeted subsidies have the intended effect and raise aggregate output and productivity. In the long run, however, individual productivities mean-revert while individual-specific subsidies remain fixed. As a result, entry into entrepreneurship is distorted: The subsidies prop up entrepreneurs that were formerly productive but are now unproductive, while impeding the entry of newly productive individuals. Therefore aggregate Output and productivity are depressed. Our theory provides an explanation for two empirical observations on developing countries: idiosyncratic distortions that disproportionately affect productive establishments, and temporary growth miracles followed by growth failures.

The consortium eliminates the role of an intermediary firm in the developed country. The clustered firms are heterogeneous in expected quality of output. The clustered firms know the quality type of other firms, but the foreign intermediary does not. The foreign intermediary, however, has a lower marketing cost than the clustered firms. Even when making favorable assumptions about the gains from intra-cluster cooperation, the model shows that collective marketing through a consortium can only occur among high quality type firms, and only for limited parameter values. Increasing the quality differential between low and high quality firms widens the range of parameter values for which collective marketing by the high quality cluster firms takes place. It is more socially efficient for the foreign intermediary to market the cluster's output, but the credible threat of a consortium can lead of a redistribution of surplus in favor of the cluster.","Escuela Econ Lahore, Dept Econ, Lahore, Pakistan",,"Chaudhry, TT (通讯作者)，Escuela Econ Lahore, Dept Econ, Lahore, Pakistan.",theresa@lahoreschool.edu.pk,"Chaudhry, Theresa/AAX-9154-2021; Chaudhry, Theresa/JCE-5989-2023","Chaudhry, Theresa/0000-0002-3248-8018; Chaudhry, Theresa/0000-0002-3248-8018",,,,,48,2,2,3,13,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Briefly, this process iteratively eliminates conditionally dominated strategies according to a specific order, which is also the start of an order of elimination of weakly dominated strategies. Since the final set of possible payoff profiles, or terminal nodes, surviving iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies may be order-dependent, one may suspect that the same holds for conditional dominance. We prove that, although the sets of strategy profiles surviving two arbitrary elimination orders of conditional dominance may be very different from each other, they are equivalent in the following sense: for each player i and each pair of elimination orders, there exists a function phi(i) mapping each strategy of i surviving the first order to a strategy of i surviving the second order, such that, for every strategy profile s surviving the first order, the profile (phi(i)(s(i)))(i) induces the same terminal node as s does. To prove our results, we put forward a new notion of dominance and an elementary characterization of extensive-form rationalizability (EFR) that may be of independent interest. We also establish connections between EFR and other existing iterated dominance procedures, using our notion of dominance and our characterization of EFR.","[Chen, Jing] Inst Adv Study, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Chen, Jing] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Comp Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA; [Micali, Silvio] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Institute for Advanced Study - USA; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Chen, J (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Study, Olden Lane, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",jingchen@cs.stonybrook.edu; silvio@csail.mit.edu,"Chen, Jing/AGO-7232-2022",,,,,,25,16,17,0,6,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Social dilemmas are most commonly studied in provision games, such as public goods games and trust games, in which the social dilemma can be manifested in foregone opportunities to create surplus. Appropriation games are sometimes used to study social dilemmas that can be manifested in destruction of surplus, as is typical in common-pool resource extraction games. A central question is whether social dilemmas are more serious for inhibiting creation of surplus or in promoting its destruction. This question is addressed in this study with an experiment involving three pairs of payoff-equivalent provision and appropriation games. Some game pairs are symmetric, whereas others involve asymmetric power relationships. We find that play of symmetric provision and appropriation games produces comparable efficiency. In contrast, power asymmetry leads to significantly lower efficiency in an appropriation game than in a payoff-equivalent provision game. This outcome can be rationalized by reciprocal preference theory but not by models of unconditional social preferences.","[Cox, James C.; Sadiraj, Vjollca] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Expt Econ Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Cox, James C.; Sadiraj, Vjollca] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Walker, James M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Ostrom, Elinor] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Study Inst Div, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Cox, JC (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Expt Econ Ctr, 14 Marietta St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",jccox@gsu.edu; vsadiraj@gsu.edu; walkerj@indiana.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0849590] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,14,49,53,1,74,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Data do not support the assumption that interest rate volatility was generated by inadequate liquidity management in the banking system or by banks' collateral volume and interbank collateral structure. I present a method of identifying a currency crisis and use it to show that the high interest rate volatility was the result of a speculative attack on the Romanian leu. This has altered liquidity flows between credit institutions, thus entailing a higher interest rate. The paper also shows that the central bank tailored its liquidity management to counter the speculative attack and create favorable conditions for the interest rate to return to normal levels. It explains the logic and the reasons behind the speculative attack and shows the role that central bank reputation played during this episode and in the buildup of risks in the run-up to the global financial crisis.","[Croitoru, Lucian] Natl Bank Romania, Bucharest, Romania; [Croitoru, Lucian] Romanian Ctr Econ Policies, Bucharest, Romania",,"Croitoru, L (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Romania, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,9,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The results reveal that a robust ethical foundation on the parts of the company's founder and of its management, as well as their commitment to sharing values and objectives with the entire organization, are keys to Elica's success based on a holistic development (economic, social and environmental development).","Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dept Econ Soc & Polit, Urbino, Italy",University of Urbino,"Del Baldo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dept Econ Soc & Polit, Via Saffi 42, Urbino, Italy.",mara.delbaldo@uniurb.it,"Del Baldo, Mara/ABC-7843-2020","Del Baldo, Mara/0000-0001-7912-8573",,,,,122,3,5,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We develop a two-country stochastic Dynamic New-Keynesian perpetual youth model of the business cycle with incomplete international financial markets. Our OLG structure implies stationary net foreign asset dynamics and allows for a thorough analysis of the interaction of monetary policy with non-balanced budget fiscal policy. We derive the dynamic and cyclical properties of fiscal deficit feedback rules and their implications for net foreign assets dynamics. Our results imply that the degree of fiscal discipline, i.e. the extent to which the fiscal rule responds to debt dynamics, is crucial for the dynamics of net foreign assets. We show that under a counter-cyclical fiscal rule with low fiscal discipline temporary positive productivity shocks may result in substantial deteriorations of the Net Foreign Asset position in the medium run. This result crucially hinges on the interplay among nominal rigidities, non-balanced budget fiscal policy, and the wealth effects on consumption that are implied by our OLG structure.

Considering water utilities as multi-output monopolies providing jointly two goods (billed water and lost water), we estimate a multi-output translog cost fonction using duality between production and cost function. We compute several measures of return to reveal that, at the mean level, Ivorian water utilities operate with constant return to scale. But, ranking our production units by size using various criteria, it clearly appears that it is more profitable for the water operator to increase its production and connection in most small and medium utilities. Moreover, the presence of significant economies of scope reveals that the jointly production of the two goods considered in a certain degree is more beneficial than improving the network return. Finally, the estimated marginal cost at the mean is higher than the marginal prices of the first blocks of the tariff system.","[Diakite, Daouda] Univ Reunion, CEMOI, 15,Av Rene Cassin BP 7151, St Denis 97715 9, Reunion, France; [Thomas, Alban] Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31000 Toulouse, France; Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, UMR LERNA 1081, INRA, F-31000 Toulouse, France",University of La Reunion; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; INRAE,"Diakité, D (通讯作者)，Univ Reunion, CEMOI, 15,Av Rene Cassin BP 7151, St Denis 97715 9, Reunion, France.",ddiakite@univ-reunion.fr; thomas@toulouse.inra.fr,"THOMAS, Alban/AAW-7849-2020; THOMAS, Alban/L-1220-2015; THOMAS, Alban/X-8092-2019","THOMAS, Alban/0000-0002-8730-2487;",,,,,30,2,2,0,7,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

We consider risk neutral bidders who compete for the control of a target firm in which they get initial shareholdings. The bidder's valuation for target firm is correlated with his motivations which determine bidder's strategy. We study bidder's optimal strategy in mixed motivations setting. Since motivations are numerous, hypothesis of affiliated value in auctions allows to study bidder's strategy. The paper shows that the impact of affiliation degree on bidder's optimal strategy depends on their private signal and on the ratio between their initial shareholdings. Particularly, we found that if a potential bidder overbids when he gets toeholds in the target firm, the extent of overbidding is not monotonically increasing with the size of toeholds and the level of private signal. There is a threshold of private signal under which the bidder is more aggressive given the size of his toeholds and above which the bidder is less aggressive. Target firm's expected revenue increases with the degree of affiliation of bidder's valuation. When potential bidders get identical size of toeholds, their bid doesn't depend on valuation's affiliation degree and their optimal offer increases both in their private signal and in toeholds. In this case, the bidder with highest signal wins and competition yields to an efficient allocation.","Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, Ctr Rech Strategies Econ, F-25009 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte,"Didier, HD (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, Ctr Rech Strategies Econ, 30 Ave Observ,BP 1559, F-25009 Besancon, France.",,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,5,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Data comprise all children born before (control group) and after (treatment group) the date of implementation of the reform, in cohorts of up to 27,000 newborns, mothers and fathers. We find strong short-term effects of the incentives on male parental leave, but no behavioral effects in the household.

The primary aim of the current research is to empirically investigate whether the success, that an organization achieves, in managing customer knowledge would affect its service recovery performance; through examining the impact of Customer Knowledge Management (CKM) process on Service Recovery Performance (SRP), based on the perspective of the Egyptian National Railways' employees. It also attempts to measure how employees and customers evaluate the Egyptian National Railways' actual performance of service recovery. The current research developed a conceptual model to examine the impact of CKM process on SRP through integrating the process of CKM provided by Dalkir (2005) and the five-dimension model of SRP presented by Liao (2007). Two questionnaires were formed in order to collect the primary data through personal interviews. The first questionnaire was issued to the employees of the Egyptian National Railways in order to investigate their opinions regarding both of CKM process and SRP dimensions. The second questionnaire was for the Egyptian National Railways' customers to measure their evaluation of SRP. A sample of 203 front-line employees and 333 customers was used to test the conceptual model. Confirmatory factor analysis results supported the modified research model. The research results indicated that CKM process is positively and significantly affecting the service recovery performance of The Egyptian National Railways, and that, each stage of CKM process significantly affects SRP. In addition, there are significant differences between employees' opinions and customers' opinions regarding their evaluation to the ENR's service recovery performance. In summary, this research has demonstrated the value of managing customer knowledge effectively in order to achieve a higher performance on service recovery.","[El-Helaly, Nehal; Ebeid, Ahmad; El-Menbawey, Azza] Mansoura Univ, Fac Commerce, Mansoura, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University,"El-Helaly, N (通讯作者)，Mansoura Univ, Fac Commerce, Mansoura, Egypt.",nal.1987@yahoo.com; a_Yehia75@yahoo.com; azzamenbawey@mans.edu.eg,,,,,,,46,1,2,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,506,515,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000058,0

We allow for standard determinants based on Solow's growth model, as well as financial globalization and trade openness measures for a sample of 56 industrial and emerging market economies over the 1970-2004 period. We find that unanticipated government expenditures have negative and significant effects on output growth, with higher effects in developed economies. Along with savings responses, we interpret these results based on how fiscal policy reacts to business cycles. Anticipated government expenditures have negative but smaller effects on output growth.

Whereas firm export status is highly persistent, firms' destination portfolio is very dynamic: a typical firm-country exporting relationship has a median duration of 2 years. Yet, if a firm manages to export to a country beyond 2 years the risk of exiting that market sharply falls afterwards. The results indicate that not only firm heterogeneity but also destination heterogeneity are crucial to explain survival in export markets. In particular, country (political) risk heavily shapes the effect of firm, product, and other destination characteristics on the length of trade relationships. Whereas firm productivity, comparative advantage, partners' GDP, and proximity enhance duration of trade with low-risk countries, they have no effect on trade survival with high-risk countries. On the contrary, information spillovers are particularly relevant to enhance survival of trade relationships with high-risk countries.

We find that including Google data improves unemployment predictions relative to a competing model that does not employ search data queries. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We examine Responsible Care (RC) in the US chemical manufacturing sub-sector, whose membership codes include pollution prevention, using our author-constructed panel database of 3,278 plants owned by 1,759 firms between 1988 and 2001. We apply two sets of instrumental variables to address a plant's parent firm's self-selection into the program, using: (i) the characteristics of other plants belonging to the same firm in our multi-plant sample; and (ii) firm participation in the industry association before the establishment of RC and industry-level RC participation in our full sample. We find that on average, plants owned by RC participating firms raise their toxicity-weighted pollution by 15.9% relative to statistically-equivalent plants owned by non-RC participating firms. This estimated increase is large relative to the yearly 4% reduction in pollution among all plants in our sample between 1988 and 2001. Moreover, RC raises plant-level pollution intensity by 15.1%. These results caution against reliance on self-regulation programs modeled on the pre-2002 RC program that did not require third party certification and in those sectors that lack independent third party certification.","[Gamper-Rabindran, Shanti] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Pittsburgh, PA 15217 USA; [Finger, Stephen R.] Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Gamper-Rabindran, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 3205 Posvar Hall,230 S Bouquet St, Pittsburgh, PA 15217 USA.",shanti@gspia.pitt.edu; stephen.finger@moore.sc.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1127223] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,63,55,65,1,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

This paper provides evidence of competition aversion in a natural setting somewhere between the simplicity of a laboratory experiment and the full complexity and ambiguity of a labor market. The State Street Mile race offers both male and female participants a choice between two different levels of competition. Large, systematic age and gender differences are observed in the relationship between true ability and the decision to enter the more competitive race. Overall, qualified women and older runners are far less likely than qualified young men to enter a competitive race with prizes. However, the fastest young women unanimously enter the competitive race. Therefore, while we confirm age and gender differences in competitiveness in our field setting, the economic consequences to capable young women are rather small.

It uses a rational expectations storage model with risk-averse consumers and incomplete markets. Government stabilises food prices by carrying public stock and by applying a state-contingent subsidy/tax to production. The policy rules are designed to maximise intertemporal welfare. The optimal policy under commitment crowds out all private stockholding activity by removing the profit opportunity from speculation. The countercyclical subsidy/tax to production helps price stabilisation by subsidising production in periods of scarcity and by taxing it in periods of glut. It contributes little to welfare gains, most of which come from stabilisation achieved through public storage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The article departs from most previous work on FDI and tax competition in a number of ways. First, it incorporates several measures of agglomeration in order to investigate whether agglomeration economies mitigate the downward spiral in tax rates. As the strength of agglomeration economies may vary with the degree of integration, we use a panel of bilateral FDI flows for a highly integrated region including countries with similar economic structure - the EU15 - from 1986 to 2004. Second, the empirical analysis explicitly deals with the problem of selection bias by using the Heckman sample selection approach. Also, by focusing on the EU15, we are able to provide additional information on the determinants of FDI between similar, higher-income countries. The empirical analysis provides some evidence of corporate marginal effective tax rates having an impact on FDI. This result, however, is sensitive to the inclusion of agglomeration economies. In particular, we find both Marshall types of technological externalities and overall concentration of economic activity to have an influence on FDI flows and, moreover, mitigating the negative impact of taxes.","[Hansson, Asa Marie; Olofsdotter, Karin] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Hansson, ÅM (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",asa.hansson@.nek.lu.se,,,,,,,36,13,15,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this article, we explore a generalization of the basic structural time series model in which the time-varying trigonometric terms associated with different seasonal frequencies have different variances for their disturbances. The contribution of the article is two-fold. The first aim is to investigate the dynamic properties of this frequency-specific Basic Structural Model (BSM). The second aim is to relate the model to a comparable generalized version of the Airline model developed at the US Census Bureau. By adopting a quadratic distance metric based on the restricted reduced form moving-average representation of the models, we conclude that the generalized models have properties that are close to each other compared to their default counterparts. In some settings, the distance between the models is almost zero so that the models can be regarded as observationally equivalent. An extensive empirical study on disaggregated monthly shipment and foreign trade series illustrates the improvements of the frequency-specific extension and investigates the relations between the two classes of models.","[Koopman, Siem Jan; Ooms, Marius] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hindrayanto, Irma] Nederlandsche Bank, Dept Econ Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Aston, John A.

When a production cost disruption occurs, the original production plan which is designed based on the initially estimated production cost needs to be revised. It is necessary to explicitly consider possible related deviation costs caused by changes of the original production plan. We consider this problem in the centralized and decentralized dual-channel supply chain, respectively. The optimal prices and production quantity under production cost disruptions are derived. We find that the original production plan has some robustness with production cost disruptions. Only when the production cost disruption exceeds some thresholds will the decision-maker change the production quantity. The production cost disruption robustness region in the centralized dual-channel supply chain is the same as that in the decentralized dual-channel supply chain. In the centralized dual-channel supply chain, it is always beneficial for the central decision-maker to take timely response to the disruptions and utilize the revised strategy under production cost disruptions. In the decentralized dual-channel supply chain we characterize a threshold. If customers' preference for the direct channel is below the threshold, the optimal direct sale price equals the wholesale price; otherwise, the optimal direct sale price and wholesale price equals the optimal direct sale price and retail price in the centralized dual-channel supply chain. The manufacturer always gets better off if he takes timely response to the production cost disruptions, while the retailer gets better off only if the production cost disruption is negative and gets worse off otherwise.

Each household consumes a bundle of commodities and has a preference for consumption variety. We determine the endogenous organization of exchange between firms and shoppers, the means of factor payment (remuneration), and the prices at which these trades occur. We verify that the endogenous linkage of factor payments with the medium of exchange can lead to a monetary equilibrium outcome where only fiat money trades for goods, an ex ante feature of cash-in-advance models. We also examine the long-run effects of money growth on equilibrium exchange patterns. A key finding, consistent with documented hyperinflationary episodes, is that a sufficiently rapid expansion of the money supply leads to the gradual emergence of barter, where sellers accept both goods and cash payments and workers receive part of their remuneration in goods.","[Laing, Derek] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Li, Victor E.] Villanova Univ, Dept Econ, Villanova, PA 19406 USA; [Wang, Ping] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Wang, Ping] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Syracuse University; Villanova University; Washington University (WUSTL); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Li, VE (通讯作者)，Villanova Univ, Dept Econ, Villanova, PA 19406 USA.",victor.li@villanova.edu,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Both problematic issues, recently addressed by Santos Silva and Tenreyro in an influential paper, are re-examined here. We use Monte Carlo simulations to compare the Pseudo Poisson Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator recommended by Santos Silva and Tenreyro, a Gamma Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood (GPML), a Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) estimator and a Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) estimator with more traditional techniques. Additionally, estimates of the gravity equation are obtained for three different data sets with the abovementioned methods. The results of the simulation study indicate that, although the PPML estimator is less affected by heteroscedasticity than others are, its performance is similar, in terms of bias and SEs, to the FGLS estimator performance, in particular for small samples. GPML presents however the lowest bias and SEs in the simulations without zero values. The results of the empirical estimations, using three different samples containing real data, indicate that the choice of estimator has to be made for each specific dataset. It is highly recommended to follow a model selection approach using a number of tests to select the more appropriate estimator for any application.","[Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Gottingen, Inst Econ Res, Dept Econ & Ibero Amer, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Gottingen; Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Martínez-Zarzoso, I (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Inst Econ Res, Dept Econ & Ibero Amer, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany.",martinei@eco.uji.es,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557",,,,,28,94,95,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Hence more democratic countries may receive less Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows if economic freedoms are not guaranteed. One reason could be that democratizing developing economies are often unable to push through the kind of economic reforms that investors desire due to the presence of competing political interests. This could potentially explain why countries like China and Singapore that rank poorly on the democracy index but are relatively high on the property rights index do well in terms of FDI inflows.","[Mathur, Aparna] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Singh, Kartikeya] PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mclean, VA 22102 USA",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Mathur, A (通讯作者)，Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Dept Econ, 1150 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",amathur@aei.org,,,,,,,17,70,87,3,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The modern understanding of CSR is perceived as a necessity of integration of social, environmental, ethical, consumer concerns and human rights Into their business operations and core strategy in close collaboration with their stakeholders. In case of banking institutions this concept can be treated as an opportunity to gain competitive advantage. The main aim of the article is to present the idea of corporate social responsibility as a tool for supporting competitiveness of banking institutions. In this contribution there have been indicated the key areas of CSR influence on banks competitiveness and related benefits. Positive influence of CSR on bank's competitiveness can occur in the following key areas: enhancing public image and reputation, ethical behaviors, improving relations with employees, strengthening community involvement, building environment responsibility image and improving organizational governance. According to Banking of Sustainability Report, 2005 IFC Sustainability Survey of Financial Institutions shows that 68 % of commercial banks indicate improvement of credibility and reputation as the main reason why banks engage in social and environment activity [19]. In several economic studies [33, 10] corporate reputation is directly linked with its competitiveness, while reputational risk is one of the main risks which endanger its stability and financial performance. In this context, CRS strategy occurs as one of the effective solutions allowing to gain many different benefits for banks. It seems that being socially responsible, understood as taking Into account not only own interests (e.g. profit maximization) but also interests of other stakeholders, behaving fair and responsible to them, can be viewed as a significant element of acquiring competitive advantage.","[Ostalecka, Agnieszka; Swacha-Lech, Magdalena] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Management & Tourism, Dept Finance & Accounting, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,,ostalecka@gmail.com; m.swachalech@gmail.com,"Swacha-Lech, Magdalena/U-3227-2018","Swacha-Lech, Magdalena/0000-0003-0129-2968",,,,,32,0,0,0,14,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,425,435,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300044,0

We used next variables for testing the impact on sovereign bond spread: German Bunds' interest, budget balance, debt, difference between members' debt and value of German debt and the fiscal rules index. Correlation analysis identified the strong correlation between sovereign yield spread and budget balance. This is the common trend for all panels. Fiscal rules index is strong correlated with spread too and it is more noticeable in EURO panel. The biggest difference between panels was found for the debt and German interest rate. These variables are strong correlated only in EURO countries. Surprisingly, there is no correlation in nonEURO and EUR024 panels. Next, we used Granger causality methodology. In short-term, there is two-way causality between debt and spread in EURO panel. Findings also confirm one-way causalities between balance and spread and between yield de and spread in EU24 and EURO panels; between spread and debt in EU24 and nonEURO panels. Results confirm differences between panels and there is no common pattern of sovereign yield spread determinants in the EU.","[Szarowska, Irena] Slezska Univ, Obchodne Podnikatelska Fak, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Szarowská, I (通讯作者)，Slezska Univ, Obchodne Podnikatelska Fak, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",szarowska@opf.slu.cz,"Szarowská, Irena/J-6391-2012","Szarowská, Irena/0000-0002-5197-6455","ESF project Innovation of Educational Programs at Silesian University, School of Business Administration in Karvina [CZ.1.07/2.2.00/28.0017]; [GA CR 403/11/2073]","ESF project Innovation of Educational Programs at Silesian University, School of Business Administration in Karvina;","This article ensued thanks to the support of the ESF project Innovation of Educational Programs at Silesian University, School of Business Administration in Karvina (CZ.1.07/2.2.00/28.0017) and grant GA CR 403/11/2073 Procyclicality of financial markets, asset price bubbles and macroprudential regulation.",,23,2,2,1,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-248-3095-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,338,349,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393737200032,0

Simulation results demonstrate that finite-sample distribution of the test depends critically on the lag-order determination rule. The univariate test and its panel counterparts exhibit size distortion when the lag order in the autoregression is optimized but inappropriate distribution is employed in test implementation. Response surface coefficients reported for the finite-sample distribution of the test with lag optimization are therefore useful tools for practitioners in applied research.

Cost recovery rates of these services are typically low, while demand for more reliable services is high and rapidly growing. Most stated preference-based demand studies in the developing world apply the contingent valuation method and focus on rural areas. This study examines household Willingness to Pay (WTP) for improved water supply services in a choice experiment in an urban area in Ethiopia, a country with the lowest water supply coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa. The design of the choice experiment allows estimation of the value of both drinking water supply reliability and safety. The estimated economic values can be used in policy appraisals of improved supply investment decisions. Despite significant income constraints, households are willing to pay up to 80% extra for improved levels of water supply over and above their current water bill. Women and households living in the poorest part of the city with the lowest service levels value the improvement of water quality most. As expected, also averting behaviour and expenditures play an important role.","[Brouwer, Roy] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Tarfasa, Solomon] Hawassa Univ, Dept Econ, Hawassa, Ethiopia",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Hawassa University,"Brouwer, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",roy.brouwer@ivm.vu.nl,"Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050",,,,,36,43,49,0,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our main result is that determinants may differ or have very different impact on welfare outcomes as compared to economic outcomes. Human capital plays a bigger role in determining the former, so that policies targeting human capital might have a greater effect on the welfare of societies than one would think by looking at their impact on economic growth alone. The same goes for health institutions and a number of other factors. Initial income has a greater impact on 'full' income growth than on real income per capita growth, implying even faster convergence than previously found, after conditioning for economic, health-related, institutions-related, and geographic cross-country differences. Overall, we strongly reject the hypothesis that the coefficient estimates for the impact of our set of explanatory variables on 'full' income growth is the same as for income growth.

Using the correlation contagion test and Dungey et al.'s (2005) contagion test, we find contagion effects between the Vietnamese and four other stock markets, namely Japan, Singapore, China, and the US. Second, we show that the Japanese stock market causes stronger contagion risk in the Vietnamese stock market compared to the stock markets of China, Singapore, and the US.

The foundational result is that the maximum level of cooperation can be robustly sustained in grim trigger strategies. If players are equally well monitored, comparative statics on the maximum level of cooperation are highly tractable and depend on the monitoring technology only through a simple statistic, its effective contagiousness. Typically, cooperation in the provision of pure public goods is greater in larger groups, while cooperation in the provision of divisible public goods is greater in smaller groups, and making monitoring less uncertain in the second-order stochastic dominance sense increases cooperation. For fixed monitoring networks, a new notion of network centrality is developed, which determines which players cooperate more in a given network, as well as which networks support greater cooperation.","[Wolitzky, Alexander] Microsoft Res, Cambridge, England; [Wolitzky, Alexander] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Microsoft; Stanford University,"Wolitzky, A (通讯作者)，Microsoft Res, Cambridge, England.",,,,,,,,38,37,44,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

It is found that during the inflation-targeting period, Turkish regional inflation rates have converged to each other in terms of CPI groups with relatively nontradable components, while they have diverged from each other in terms of CPI groups with relatively tradable components. Since a common and sound monetary policy among the regions of a country is supposed to have a convergence effect on regional inflation rates according to the conventional wisdom, the results for CPI groups with relatively tradable components require further attention and have significant policy implications, especially for inflation-targeting countries using flexible exchange rate regimes.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Yilmazkuday, H (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",skuday@gmail.com,"Yilmazkuday, Hakan/GXZ-6757-2022","Yilmazkuday, Hakan/0000-0002-8629-6230",,,,,29,9,9,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Subglobal action impacts emissions in unconstrained countries (carbon leakage) through international trade channels. Consequently, estimates of the efficacy of subglobal action, tariffs on embodied carbon, and the distribution of policy costs will be sensitive to the assumed structure of international trade. While most climate-policy models rely on an Armington (1969) structure of international trade, recent empirical evidence supports a new theory suggested by Melitz (2003). We find significant quantitative and qualitative differences when we consider the Melitz trade structure.

Contrastingly, the literature on corporate governance provides some useful insights for understanding corporate innovation activity, to the extent that such literature examines the economic effects of different modes of coordination between firm members. The process through which individuals integrate their human and physical resources within the firm is central to the dynamics of corporate innovation. This paper provides the first survey of the literature on this issue. We start by discussing how various theoretical approaches to the analysis of the firm deal with technological innovation. We then describe three main channels corporate ownership, corporate finance and labour through which a system of corporate governance shapes a firm's innovation activity. Finally, we examine the relationship between country-level institutional settings, national patterns of corporate governance and the aggregate innovation activity of corporations. We conclude by suggesting that future research should focus more deeply on the interrelation between the various dimensions of corporate governance and on their joint effect on firm innovation.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Belloc, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.",,"Vyacheslav, Gromyko/I-5054-2012",,,,,,161,140,161,18,240,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

A first study found that countries with national initiatives have higher government expenditure and are characterized by more rent-seeking activity, that the effects of direct democratic institutions become stronger if the frequency of their actual use is taken into account, and that effects are stronger in countries with weak democracies. This study sheds more light on these findings by drawing on a new dataset covering more countries and incorporating more institutional detail. The results of the earlier study are largely confirmed: mandatory referendums lower government expenditure and improve government efficiency, initiatives have the opposite effects. The incorporation of more institutional detail into the analysis shows that the increase in government expenditures connected with initiatives is primarily driven by citizen, as opposed to agenda, initiatives. Further, referendums held at both the constitutional and post-constitutional levels are correlated with larger debt. Finally, neither the possibility of a recall nor the degree to which referendum results are binding significantly affect our dependent variables.","[Voigt, Stefan] Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Blume, Lorenz] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Econ & Business Adm, D-353032 Marburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; Philipps University Marburg,"Voigt, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Rothenbaumchaussee 36, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",Stefan.voigt@uni-hamburg.de,,"Voigt, Stefan/0000-0001-5564-3669",,,,,19,11,11,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Alternatives are further reduced when using a more stringent definition of school quality.","[Elacqua, Gregory; Martinez, Matias; Santos, Humberto; Urbina, Daniela] Univ Diego Portales, Inst Polit Publ, Fac Econ & Empresa, Santiago, Chile",University Diego Portales,"Elacqua, G (通讯作者)，Univ Diego Portales, Inst Polit Publ, Fac Econ & Empresa, Santiago, Chile.",,"Martinez, Matias/AAI-9738-2020","Martinez, Matias/0000-0001-9838-1013; Elacqua, Gregory/0000-0003-0066-3640",,,,,28,7,9,0,22,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

Four models corresponding to the usual combination of breaks are considered. The asymptotic distributions of the test are derived under the null hypothesis and are shown to be normally distributed. Their moments for T fixed are derived analytically employing Ghazals corollary 1. The case with unknown breaks is also considered.

The hedonic regression model includes characteristics such as name and living status of the artist, the size and medium of the painting, and the auction house, quarter and year in which the painting was sold. The resulting index indicates that returns on Australian fine-art averaged one per cent in nominal terms over the period from quarter 1 1986 to quarter 4 2009 with a standard deviation of seventeen per cent. During the global financial crisis spanning quarter 1 2008 and quarter 4 2009, the average art returns declined in nominal terms by close to six per cent with a standard deviation of twenty-one per cent. This study also shows that over the entire period the art market only marginally underperformed the stock and housing markets.

Using a sample of large U.S firms in 2005-2009, we find that the degree of insider ownership influences positively firm performance, because it reduces agency problems. The age of the Board of Directors matters, to a certain degree, as well. Younger members are probably willing to bear more risk and to undertake major structural changes to improve firm's future prospects. On the other hand, we find that independent directors reduce firm performance and this negative effect was even more important during the recent financial crisis. We suppose that independent directors prefer overly conservative business strategies in order to protect shareholders, but this goes at the cost of lower firm's performance. All in all, our results suggest that corporate governance is important for firm's financial performance.","[Horvath, Roman] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Spirollari, Persida] Alpha Bank Albania, Tirana, Albania",Charles University Prague,"Horváth, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",roman.horvath@gmail.com,"Horvath, Roman/AAX-8903-2020; Horvath, Roman/AAD-8248-2019; Horvath, Roman/G-7344-2014","Horvath, Roman/0000-0002-9036-9746;",,,,,17,27,29,1,32,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

During March 2009 to January 2010 and October 2011 to May 2012, the Bank completed asset purchases of 200 billion (QE1) and 125 billion (QE2), respectively. The decision to resume purchases in July 2012 will mean that by November 2012 the Bank will have bought a total of 375 billion of assets, equivalent to around 25 per cent of annual GDP.

A naive approach would be comparing the ERB receiving group with the non-receiving group, but the ERB receipt is partly determined by the unemployment duration itself (thus, an endogeneity problem). Interestingly, there were many individuals who did not receive the ERB despite being fully eligible, and this is attributed to being unaware of the ERB scheme. Taking this as a 'pseudo randomization', we construct treatment and control groups using only the eligible. Our data set is an unbalanced panel with the response variable interval-truncated due to eligibility requirement of the ERB. We propose a panel random-effect MLE and a semiparametric 'mode-based' estimator for the interval-truncated response. Our empirical finding is that the effect varies much, depending on individual characteristics. As for the mean effects, whereas the MLE indicates large duration-shortening effects, the semiparametric estimator shows much weaker and mostly insignificant effects.","[Lee, Myoung-jae] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Kim, Hyun Ah] Korea Dev Inst, Dept Macroecon & Financial Policy, Real Assets Res Team, Seoul 130012, South Korea; [Kim, Yong-seong] Korea Dev Inst, Dept Publ Finance & Social Policy, Seoul 130012, South Korea; [Lee, Myoung-jae] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Korea University; Korea Development Institute (KDI); Korea Development Institute (KDI); Australian National University,"Lee, MJ (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",hahkim@kdi.re.kr; yongkim@kdi.re.kr; myoungjae@korea.ac.kr,,"Lee, Myoung-jae/0000-0002-3935-7491",,,,,21,1,2,0,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

Stochastic programming with the TIAM-World model is used for a parametric analysis of hedging strategies, varying the probabilities associated to each of two contrasted technology outlooks. The parametric analysis constitutes an original supplement to the computation of hedging strategies by identifying technologies that are robust under a broad range of probabilities of the two technology outlooks. Natural gas appears to be one of the most appealing robust options in an uncertain technological context, especially in China, given its relatively low emissions and the low capital cost of associated technologies. Natural gas and some other options are in fact considered as super-hedging actions, penetrating more in the hedging solution than in any of the deterministic scenarios. Nuclear power and CCS use are less robust: they depend much more on either the level of the climate target or the probabilities of the technology outlooks. The analysis also shows that technological uncertainty has a greater impact under milder climate targets than under more severe ones. Future research might consider a larger set of possible technology outlooks, as well as specific analyses focused on key characteristics of low-carbon technologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we use Spanish medical graduates residency choices made from 1995 to 2000. We start by estimating a model of medical graduates preferences that controls for hospital, proximity, specialty, and gender effects. We interpret the coefficients on the hospital dummy variables as measures of medical graduates preferences over hospitals. Our results show that graduates do indeed discriminate between hospitals and that their preferences correlate with hospital-specific covariates arguably related to hospital training quality. We then show that preferences from medical graduates are positively and statistically significantly correlated with risk-adjusted hospital rankings based on five alternative outcome measures. Finally, we construct reputation scores for each hospital using news story counts in three media outlets and find that medical graduates preferences are especially valuable for inference of hospital technical quality of care as they do not simply reflect well known reputation.","[Machado, Matilde P.; Mora, Ricardo; Romero-Medina, Antonio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Machado, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",matilde.machado@uc3m.es; ricmora@eco.uc3m.es; aromero@eco.uc3m.es,"Machado, Matilde P./B-5865-2009; ROMERO-MEDINA, ANTONIO/C-7072-2009; MORA, RICARDO/Y-7282-2018","Machado, Matilde P./0000-0002-0055-0665; ROMERO-MEDINA, ANTONIO/0000-0002-4076-350X; MORA, RICARDO/0000-0002-0341-3906",,,,,50,1,1,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

As an empirical study, we estimate optimal weights by using a particular approach for Japanese stock data listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and then compare the forecast performance of weighted and non-weighted RV through an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model. The empirical result indicates that the appropriate use of the optimally weighted RV can lead to remarkably smaller estimation variance compared with the naive RV, in many series. Therefore a more accurate forecasting of daily volatility data is obtained.

First, regional industrial CO2 emissions during the 11th Five-Year Plan period are calculated based on the presented method. Then a two-level perfect decomposition method. LMDI, is used to find the nature of the factors that influence the changes in energy-related industrial CO2 emissions in nine economic regions in China. The changes of industrial CO2 emissions are decomposed into energy emission factor effect, energy structure effect, energy intensity effect, industrial structure effect and economic output effect. As the results suggest, rapid growth of industry is the most important factor responsible for the increase in CO2 emissions. The adjustment of both industrial structure and energy structure contributes to the increase of CO2 emissions slightly. Energy consumption per unit GDP is the most important measure of CO2 emissions and the energy emission factor by itself also makes a weeny contribution to CO2 reduction as a result of electricity generation efficiency enhancement.

In 2008, the ratio of export to GDP was about 76.5 percent. The global economic crisis triggered by the sub-prime loans debacle in the United States has prompted Thailand to rethink its high dependence on export. This paper examines the options for external and internal economic rebalancing strategies for Thailand. External rebalancing will require Thailand to rely more on regional markets and less on the Western markets for its exports. The paper examines the possibility of promoting greater intra-regional trade and Thailand's regional trade strategies. As for internal rebalancing, the paper emphasizes the need to boost domestic public and private investment in terms of both quantity and quality to narrow the current saving-investment gap. bearing in mind the need to ensure fiscal sustainability. Finally, the paper examines broader rebalancing strategies that will help Thailand to become less dependent on exports. These include the need to (1) improve productivity; (2) increase economic efficiency; (3) deepen the production structure and create new dynamic industries; and (4) generate new growth poles.","[Sussangkarn, Chalongphob; Nikomborirak, Deunden] TDRI, Bangkok 10310, Thailand",,"Sussangkarn, C (通讯作者)，TDRI, 565 Soi Ramkhamhaeng 39, Bangkok 10310, Thailand.",chalongp@tdri.or.th; deunden@tdri.or.th,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,17,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1535-3516,,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

We found robust evidence indicating that maritime piracy reduces the volume of trade; the effect of 10 additional vessels hijacked being associated to an 11% decrease in exports.

Considering both strong (with side payments) and weak (without side payments) hard core cartel contracts, we find that (i) both strong and weak welfare-enhancing cartels exist when at least one firm makes a loss on part of its sales in competition, (ii) a welfare-enhancing strong cartel exists whenever there is a difference in unit cost at competitive production levels, and (iii) a welfare-enhancing weak cartel exists when the profit margin on all sales is positive and the cost difference is sufficiently large.","[Bos, Iwan] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Org & Strategy, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Pot, Erik] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Bos, I (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Org & Strategy, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",i.bos@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,,,,,,30,3,5,1,17,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

We show that a higher central bank preference for robustness implies a more aggressive reaction of the nominal interest rate to the expected future inflation rate and inflation shocks. The dynamic stability of the equilibrium is not modified for a sufficiently high preference for robustness. However, the speed of dynamic convergence is lower under robust control compared to a benchmark case without it and implies supplementary economic costs. Finally, an increase in the preference for robustness comes at the cost of higher macroeconomic and financial volatility in the presence of inflation shocks.

One is a conventional Armington trade model with five regions, the US, China, EU, Japan and the Rest of the World. and calibrated to a global 2009 micro consistent data set. The other is a modified version of this model with monetary non-neutrals and including China's trade surplus as an endogenous variable. Who may gain or loss from global trade conflicts spawned by adjustment pressures in the post crisis world is much debated. In a US-China trade conflict, Europe and Japan would seem gainers from preferential access to US and Chinese markets. The loss of markets would hurt the US, but moving closer to an optimal tariff could be the source of terms of trade gains. And the ease of substitution across trading partners' practices would determine costs for China. Results from the conventional model suggest that retaliation between the two countries can be welfare improving for the US as it substitutes expenditures into own goods and improve its terms of trade with non-retaliatory regions, while China and non-retaliatory regions may be adversely affected. Results in the endogenous trade surplus model from the central case model specification, however, suggest that both the US and the EU (the deficit regions) have welfare losses in most cases, while the surplus region, China, and the ROW have welfare gains. In both models, when the bilateral tariff rates are very high, gains accrue to the EU and Japan from trade diversion if the substitutions elasticities of imports are high. Costs are borne by the US and China in lost exports, lowered terms of trade and adjustment costs at home. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although lowering termination charges towards cost leads to more efficient usage, its impact on consumer surplus is ambiguous since it induces an increase in fixed subscription fee through the so-called waterbed effect. We show that a reduction in termination charge below cost has two opposing effects on consumer surplus: it softens competition but also helps to internalize network externalities. Hence, it can decrease or increase penetration, depending on whether or not the first effect dominates the second. We show that the first effect dominates the second when networks are weak substitutes or the penetration rate is high. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the extension of retirement benefits to informal sector workers results in efficiency losses due to adverse effects on capital accumulation and the allocation of resources across formal and informal sectors. Despite these losses recipients of social pensions experience welfare gains as the positive insurance effects attributed to the extension of a social insurance system dominate.

The paper presents a comparative study on shipbuilding policy and the competitiveness of the top three shipbuilders, namely South Korea, Japan and China in a quantitative fashion, coupled with the implicit indication each country's advantages and disadvantages. With the introduction and application of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method into the shipbuilding market, a set of critical success factors identified as criteria and sub-criteria to shipbuilding competitiveness is demonstrated to reveal the ranking orders among the three. Supported by ample official data and a survey feedback summary, the obtained results suggest that South Korea is currently leading the world shipbuilding market, followed by China, with an impressive shipbuilding output. Finally, the paper discusses the way forward for the three competitors. The landscape of the shipbuilding industry continues to evolve.

To do that, an analysis based on the so-called distribution dynamics approach is used as benchmark Therefore, the external shape of the per capita income distribution and movements within it are examined using both continuous and discrete techniques. This first approach reveals that regional disparities across European regions have decreased over time and, based on the computation of a mobility index, also highlights the existence of a medium mobility degree within the distribution. Subsequently, a spatially conditioned distribution dynamics approach is developed to adequately assess the spatial dimension of the convergence process. In this new approach per capita income of each region is doubly conditioned on its per capita income and the per capita income of its neighbours, both in a previous period. Additionally, a novel mobility index on the basis of a spatial Markov chains approach is devised. The results illustrate the importance of geography in explaining regional per capita income evolution; in particular it is shown that poor regions surrounded by rich regions have a much higher probability of escaping the poverty trap than other poor regions.

The central contention of this paper is that while the adoption of an inflation targeting (IT) policy may lead to more flexible exchange rate movements, for various reasons it is possible that the degree of flexibility will be significantly higher on one side of the market. In this study, we demonstrate that four Asian economiesnamely, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines and Thailandwhom were among the first group of emerging markets to embrace the inflation targeting framework of monetary policy, tend to adopt a form of asymmetrical exchange rate behavior, wherein appreciation pressures are restrained more substantially than depreciation pressures.","[Pontines, Victor; Siregar, Reza Y.] SE Asian Cent Banks SEACEN Res & Training Ctr, Bank Negara Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur 50480, Malaysia; [Pontines, Victor] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Business Sch, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Pontines, V (通讯作者)，SE Asian Cent Banks SEACEN Res & Training Ctr, Bank Negara Malaysia, Level 5,2 Jalan Dato Onn, Kuala Lumpur 50480, Malaysia.",victor@seacen.org,,"Pontines, Victor/0000-0002-1709-5523",,,,,23,11,12,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Yet the persistence of corruption, which is present in virtually every form of public governance, suggests that the disparate benefits are difficult to unravel and lead to support for the status quo. In this paper, the authors analyze survey data from over 400 Armenian businesses to study the perceived favorability and impact of corruption on firm-level performance. The research relies on the data from two ordered response survey questions on corruption that were collected as part of a broad survey of issues facing firms pertaining to competition and industry structure. The dual role of the perceived favorability and degree of impact of corruption are modeled in a seemingly unrelated bivariate ordered probit framework. We find that corruption is perceived as more favorable among firms that (1) do not face significant competition, (2) are relatively larger, and (3) younger. Personal characteristics of the respondents, except for the level of education, explain neither the perceived favorability nor impact of corruption. The results show that the model has high predictive power. Our results suggest that enforcement of antitrust policies, encouragement of polices that foster competition, and possibly nonprotectionist trade policies will assist in the battle against corruption.","[Sahakyan, Narek; Stiegert, Kyle W.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Sahakyan, N (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,"Stiegert, Kyle/0000-0001-6835-6132",,,,,47,40,46,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

One major drawback of such data is that countries differ not only with regard to taxes but also with other dimensions which might be hard to capture by means of observable characteristics. We compile a database of more than 11,000 municipalities in Germany to analyze the sensitivity of location decisions of foreign MNEs in Germany with respect to business tax rates which are levied directly by the municipalities. We find that higher business tax rates have a negative effect on three alternative measures of MNE activity, after controlling for other determinants of firm location decisions: the number of foreign MNEs, MNE employment, and MNE fixed assets. Our results suggest that tax competition among regional entities for foreign investors is a game of a few. In cross-section instrumental-variable regressions, a one-percent reduction of the municipal business tax rate (equivalent to a decline by about 0.14 percentage points) leads to an increase in the number of legally independent foreign-owned firms by about 0.45. The average municipality would have to reduce its business tax rate by about 2.2 percentage points (or 15%) from its average level to attract one foreign MNE. Hence, municipalities need to be attractive in other dimensions to be able to use tax instruments to attract foreign firms at the margin. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

On the normative side, price-level targeting delivers large welfare gains and a very low optimal inflation rate consistent with price stability.

First, we show that a binding minimum wage - while leading to unemployment - is nevertheless desirable if the government values redistribution toward low wage workers and if unemployment induced by the minimum wage hits the lowest surplus workers first. Importantly, this result remains true in the presence of optimal nonlinear taxes and transfers. In that context, a binding minimum wage enhances the effectiveness of transfers to low-skilled workers as it prevents low-skilled wages from falling through incidence effects. Second, when labor supply responses are along the extensive margin only, which is the empirically relevant case, the co-existence of a minimum wage with a positive tax rate on low-skilled work is always (second-best) Pareto inefficient. A Pareto improving policy consists of reducing the pre-tax minimum wage while keeping constant the post-tax minimum wage by increasing transfers to low-skilled workers, and financing this reform by increasing taxes on higher paid workers. Those results imply that the minimum wage and subsidies for low-skilled workers are complementary policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using data of regional growth in 1995-2006 for 77 Russian regions, it examines the growth drivers for the phase of economic decline up to 1998 and for the period of strong growth afterwards separately. Looking at forty variables considered to be potentially related to growth, it determines, for each of the two periods, the ones robustly associated with Russian economic performance. Among the variables considered are proxies of politico-institutional features, indicators of economic reform, and measurements of both economic and non-economic initial conditions. The main findings are as follows: during the period of economic decline up to 1998, differences in Russian regional growth were almost entirely driven by initial conditions, with resource and human capital endowments, industrial structure, and geographical location playing the dominant roles. However, after the 1998 crisis, the importance of initial conditions declined and was basically reduced to fuel production, advantageous geographical location, and population structure. There is also some evidence that more reform-oriented policies and better regional leadership made a difference. These results could be seen as pointing to determinants of economic performance in periods of actual economic decline being different from those in normal times of economic growth.

Nearly all experiments, however, study monitoring and punishment in a complete network where all subjects can monitor and punish each other. The architecture of social networks becomes important when subjects can only monitor and punish the other subjects to whom they are connected by the network. We study several incomplete networks and find that they give rise to their own distinctive patterns of behavior. Nevertheless, a number of simple, yet fundamental, properties in graph theory allow us to interpret the variation in the patterns of behavior that arise in the laboratory and to explain the impact of network architecture on the efficiency and dynamics of the experimental outcomes.","[Carpenter, Jeffrey] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; [Kariv, Shachar] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schotter, Andrew] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; New York University,"Carpenter, J (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",jpc@middlebury.edu; kariv@berkeley.edu; andrew.schotter@nyu.edu,,,,,,,11,40,44,0,27,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

We develop a model of patient demand and supplier behavior to explain these parallel trends in technology growth and cost growth. We show that health care productivity depends on the heterogeneity of treatment effects across patients, the shape of the health production function, and the cost structure of procedures such as MRIs with high fixed costs and low marginal costs. The model implies a typology of medical technology productivity: (I) highly cost-effective home run innovations with little chance of overuse, such as anti-retroviral therapy for HIV, (II) treatments highly effective for some but not for all (e.g., stents), and (III) gray area treatments with uncertain clinical value such as ICU days among chronically ill patients. Not surprisingly, countries adopting Category I and effective Category II treatments gain the greatest health improvements, while countries adopting ineffective Category II and Category III treatments experience the most rapid cost growth. Ultimately, economic and political resistance in the United States to ever-rising tax rates will likely slow cost growth, with uncertain effects on technology growth.

The analysis is based on a quarterly vector autoregression (VAR) model. For the German and the UK cases, the VAR is augmented by global factors representing developments in the world economy. By estimating these models on different samples of data, our evidence indicates that fiscal multipliers have substantially changed over time, often in a non-monotonic way. In particular, for Germany, the net tax multiplier is found to follow a humped-shaped curve, peaking in the middle of the 1990s, declining thereafter, before rising again during the recent 2008-2009 crisis. Government spending shocks are found to be more powerful to stimulate output after the reunification. We show that significant crowding-in effects for private investments contribute to explain this finding. For the UK, we observe large variations in fiscal multipliers over the period, with non-Keynesian developments during the fiscal consolidation period of the 1980s. After that, British multipliers are low and only pick up at the very end of the sample, when the 2008-2009 crisis is included in the analysis. For the US, short-run multipliers appear to be broadly stable over the period, but medium-run multipliers tend to decline, in particular in the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s. This can be due to the large fiscal imbalances over this period that may have triggered Ricardian effects, before a fiscal surplus was achieved at the end of the 1990s. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Our results show that prices react differently to appreciations and depreciations over the long-run, an effect that was previously ignored in the literature. In particular, we provide evidence that depreciations are passed through prices more than appreciations, a result that might suggest weak competition structures.

We find a significant listing effect, indicating that the listing of ethanol has had a positive contribution to both price and volatility in the corn market, especially in the spot and the shorter maturity futures contracts, and mostly through its interaction with trading volume in the corn market.

The results show that changes in income and deprivation do not strictly coincide and highlight the importance of employment status and income sources. In countries where deprivation is higher income is more effective in reducing the deprivation differential.

J,"Flavin, MA",,,,"Flavin, Marjorie A.",,,"Housing, Adjustment Costs, and Macro Dynamics",CESIFO ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Housing; adjustment costs; intratemporal substitution; consumption dynamics,CONSUMPTION,"When utility depends on a single, frictionlessly adjustable consumption good, the household's willingness to substitute consumption intertemporally is solely determined by the curvature of the utility function. When the utility specification is generalized from one good to two, however, the curvature parameter then specifies the curvature of the utility function with respect to a composite good. If both goods are frictionlessly adjustable, then each of the individual goods will all have the same dynamics, and the intuition from the one-good case-that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is determined solely by the curvature parameter-remains valid. In this article, however, the two goods are interpreted as housing services and non-housing goods. Non-housing consumption can be adjusted frictionlessly, but housing services are subject to a non-convex adjustment cost. The article explores the dynamic behavior of non-durable consumption by solving numerically for the optimal level of non-housing consumption, conditional on an assumed path for housing consumption and for the marginal utility of wealth. The results indicate that the intertemporal behavior of nonhousing consumption depends crucially on the intratemporal substitutability of the two goods as well as the curvature of the utility function with respect to the composite good.

The key question concerns the observation that-despite high degrees of R&D and marketing-intensity-concentration has been consistently low during the whole evolution of the industry. Standard explanations of this phenomenon refer to the random nature of the innovative process, the patterns of imitation, and the fragmented nature of the market into multiple, independent submarkets. We delve deeper into this issue by using an improved version of our previous history-friendly model of the evolution of pharmaceuticals. Thus, we explore the way in which changes in the technological regime and/or in the structure of demand may generate or not substantially higher degrees of concentration. The main results are that, while technological regimes remain fundamental determinants of the patterns of innovation, the demand structure plays a crucial role in preventing the emergence of concentration through a partially endogenous process of discovery of new submarkets. However, it is not simply market fragmentation as such that produces this result, but rather the entity of the prize that innovators can gain relative to the overall size of the market. Further, the model shows that emerging industry leaders are innovative early entrants in large submarkets.","[Garavaglia, Christian; Malerba, Franco; Orsenigo, Luigi; Pezzoni, Michele] Bocconi Univ, KITeS, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Garavaglia, Christian; Pezzoni, Michele] Univ Milano Bicocca, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Malerba, Franco] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Orsenigo, Luigi] IUSS Univ Inst Adv Studies, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Pezzoni, Michele] Observ Sci & Techn, F-75015 Paris, France",Bocconi University; University of Milano-Bicocca; Bocconi University; IUSS PAVIA,"Malerba, F (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, KITeS, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",franco.malerba@unibocconi.it,,"Pezzoni, Michele/0000-0002-2255-8166",,,,,36,19,21,0,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Descriptive statistics reveal low mobility rates of elder Germans. Also, homeownership rates remain relatively stable in old age. Regression results for movers show that neither aging renters nor homeowners downsize housing consumption more often than younger households. Furthermore, after controlling, e.g., for house characteristics, elder non-moving homeowners do not spend less on maintenance but they are significantly less likely to undertake renovations. Widowhood shows an association with home negligence which suggests some decline in home values and partial decumulation of housing wealth. Since the introduction of the mandatory long-term care insurance, renovation probabilities of elder homeowners have been significantly increasing.

However, private firms and individuals in developing countries now borrow substantially from foreign lenders. It is often asserted that this surge in private sector borrowing generates excessive borrowing and frequent sovereign defaults in developing countries. This paper analyzes the impact of decentralized borrowing using a quantitative model in which private agents decide how much to borrow and the government decides whether to default. Relative to a model in which the government determines both the level of borrowing and whether to default, decentralized borrowing drives up aggregate credit costs and sovereign default risk, and reduces aggregate welfare. Interestingly, decentralized borrowing may lead to either too much or too little debt in equilibrium depending on the severity of default penalties. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although total effort increases if the weak contestant is favored with a head start, the optimal use of handicaps is not as clear-cut. Depending on the nature of the asymmetry, it may or may not be optimal to handicap the strong contestant. Moreover, it is generally optimal to combine the two instruments. For instance, when contestants are sufficiently heterogeneous the weak contestant should be given both a head start and a handicap.

For them, environmental problems arise because of omissing markets' and require the generation of new markets, internalising externalities and allowing agents' preferences to be registered oproperly' in, or through, the market. This paper provides an illustration of how misguided this basic approach to environmental problems can be. Specifically, the focus of the paper is upon the problem of aviation emissions and the policy solution most prominently advocated to mitigate them, emissions trading. Adopting this focus shows the limitations of a pivotal, though largely unacknowledged, assumption of mainstream perspectives on environmental problems, namely, that all emissions (and indeed costs) are assumed to be equivalent. In other words, it does not matter how particular emissions come about or what the long-term structural conditions are that are faced by any particular emitter. However, once a focus upon dynamic interdependencies and trajectories of systems is adopted, rather than the usual preoccupation with short-term maximisation behaviour, it becomes clear that, in the case of aviation at least, emissions trading is most likely to exacerbate an already worrying problem.","[Lawson, Clive] Girton Coll, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Lawson, C (通讯作者)，K2 Harvey Court,West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DS, England.",clive.lawson@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,101,6,6,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The vehemence of the debate may induce readers to wrongly dismiss it as a he said-she said debate, or else to take sides in an unbending way that does not do justice to valid points raised by the other side. This paper aims at a more balanced reading. While Ziliak and McCloskey claim that a substantial majority of economists who use significance tests confuse statistical with substantive significance, or commit the logical error of the transposed conditional, I argue that such errors are much less frequent than they claim, though still much too pervasive. They also argue that since significance tests focus on the existence of an effect rather than on its size, the tests do not answer scientific questions. I respond with counter-examples. Ziliak and McCloskey also complain that significance tests ignore loss functions. I argue that loss functions should be introduced only at a later stage.

We suggest that individuals care about economic status and interpret this behaviour as conspicuous consumption intended to provide a signal about unobserved income. We show that if human capital is observable and correlated with income, then a signalling equilibrium in which poor individuals tend to spend a large fraction of their income on conspicuous consumption can emerge.

Individual preferences, or opinions, agree on the ranking of risky prospects, but are quite general because we do not specify the perception of ambiguity or the attitude toward it. A convexity axiom for the ex ante preference characterizes a (collective) decision rule that can be interpreted as a compromise between the utilitarian and the Rawlsian criteria. The former is characterized by the independence axiom as in Harsanyi (1955). Existing results are special cases of our representation theorems, which also allow us to interpret Segal's (1987) two-stage approach to ambiguity as the ex ante aggregation of (Bayesian) future selves' opinions.","NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Nascimento, L (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",lgn207@nyu.edu,,"Nascimento, Leandro/0000-0003-3832-7570",,,,,48,7,8,0,10,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The answer to this question is of interest given the highly resource-intensive nature of China's growth. and is important for many resource-exporting countries, such as Australia, Brazil, Canada and India. This paper provides evidence that China's (mainly manufacturing) exports have been a significant driver of its demand for resource commodities over recent decades. First, it employs input-output tables to demonstrate that, historically, manufacturing has been at least as important as construction as a driver of China's demand for resource-intensive metal products. Second, it shows that global trade in non-oil resource commodities can be described by the gravity model of trade. Using this model it is found that, controlling for other determinants of resource trade, exports (and the manufacturing sector more generally) are a sizeable and significant determinant of a country's resource imports, and that this has been true for China as well as for other countries.

Although earlier papers generally concluded that investment subsidy dominates tax cut, it is observed that many governments use a combination of subsidy and tax cut. We show that, when the government uses a different discount rate from private firms, and when it has to borrow money to provide an investment subsidy, it is possible to get an internal optimum; that is, it might be optimal for the government to provide an investment subsidy as well as charge a positive tax rate on the profits from the project. Thus, we provide an explanation for the puzzling fact that many governments provide an investment subsidy to a firm while simultaneously taxing its profits. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Economies with current account surpluses need to increase domestic demand, while deficit countries need to reduce their deficits by boosting exports through productivity gains. India falls within the deficit category, having suffered both current account and fiscal deficits that have persisted over recent years. A dearth of adequate structural reform underlies India's macroeconomic imbalances. Analysis reveals that current account surplus economies tend to experience comparative advantage in their goods sector while deficit countries have comparative advantage in the services sector. The question posed is whether liberalizing the services sector would reap dynamic benefits by enhancing services exports and containing India's deficit. Opening up the services sector could, however, have opposing effects. On the one hand, it would support greater export of services, thereby reducing the current account deficit. On the other, the probable rise in foreign participation would translate to an increase in imports. The paper argues that the former effect is likely to prevail since structural reform in the services sector has the potential to reduce inefficiencies created by trade and capital flow restrictions. Reform would improve resource allocation, increase investment opportunities and enhance economic growth. Further, while the initial phase of foreign entrants would imply increased imports, in the medium term, successful joint ventures are likely to spread out internationally with positive ramifications for exports. Solutions in India are to be found in liberalizing, among others, the financialuincluding banking and insuranceusector, as well as retail trade, though its achievement will not be easy.",,,,partho.shome@icrier.res.in,,,,,,,29,4,4,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Funding problems may arise in capital markets when lenders anticipate such revolts and refuse to participate in debt auctions. We provide a stochastic framework to assess whether such problems may arise and argue that the key to fiscal sustainability in a stochastic environment is a feedback rule from debt level shocks back to corresponding adjustments in the primary surplus. We show that such feedback rules narrow future distributions of debt-output ratios and so reduce crisis probabilities. We apply the methodology to Dutch debt and deficit data spanning two centuries.

(2010) to analyse economic well-being and poverty among the elderly. The model focuses on individual preferences, a consumption technology that captures the economies of scale of living in a couple, and a sharing rule that governs the intra-household allocation of resources. The model is applied to a time series of Dutch consumption expenditure surveys. Our empirical results indicate substantial economies of scale and a wife's share that is increasing in total expenditures. We further calculated two sets of poverty rates: one based on the collective consumption model and one based on the traditional approach with a standard equivalence scale. Poverty among widowers is underestimated by the traditional approach. The same is true for women (men) in elderly couples for the first (later) time periods in our analysis. Finally, we analysed the impact of becoming a widow(er). Based on cross-sectional evidence, we find that the drop in material wellbeing following the husband's death is rather substantial for women.

The first data source provides information on the reported severity of financial constraints for 360 firms from 23 countries in 2002, 2005, and 2008. By following the same firms over time, we are able to summarize the gradual easing of financial constraints from 2002 to 2005 and their tightening during the crisis. Key findings are that financial constraints during the crisis were less severe in countries with well-established foreign banks (i.e. entered prior to year 2000), and that changes in the severity of financial constraints were more pronounced for large firms than others during the crisis (though large firms continued to have less severe constraints on average). The second data source provides information on whether firms remained in operation in 2009 in six ECA countries. Controlling for other relevant characteristics, firms were more likely to survive the crisis if they had access to external credit. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (3) (2012) 372-392.
