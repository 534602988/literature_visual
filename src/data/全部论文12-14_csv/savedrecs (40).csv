Using Nasdaq OMX Helsinki tick-by-tick trade data with known investor category, we confirm that SSTT is a robust proxy for uninformed trading. In the short term (1-3 months), stocks with a high proportion of signed small trades outperform, but in the medium (4-6 months) and long term (7-36 months), SSTT by individual investors has a negative correlation to stock returns, while SSTT by institutional investors and foreign nominees is not related to stock returns. Systematic trading behavior appears to better explain the excess return generated by the low SSTT portfolio relative to the high SSTT portfolio when compared to traditional risk factors in the CAPM and Fama-French models. In the aggregate, small trades are noise in the spirit of Kyle (1985) and Black (1986), but small trade behavior impacts the performance of individuals and not the performance of institutions. Large trades by both individuals and institutions perform better in the intermediate and long term, which lends some credibility to the practice of classifying larger trades as informed, but our results show that these trades are not always by institutions.","[Leung, Henry; Rose, Annica; Westerholm, P.

The empirical framework recognizes that when answering survey questions regarding their firm's output, respondents potentially rely on infrequently updated information. The analysis then suggests that their answers reflect notable information lags, on the order of 7(1/2) months on average. Moreover, information stickiness implies that noisy output fluctuations will be attenuated in survey answers and, consequently, helps explain why balance indices successfully track business cycles. Conversely, in an environment populated by fully informed identical firms, as in the standard RBC framework, for example, balance indices instead become degenerate. Finally, information regarding changes in aggregate output tends to be sectorally concentrated. The paper, therefore, illustrates how this feature of the data may be relevant for the construction of balance indices.","Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond,"Sarte, PD (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",Pierre.sarte@rich.frb.org,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Following prior research, we use reversals as a proxy for expected returns market makers demand for providing liquidity. Our findings highlight significant time-series variation in the magnitude of short-term return reversals and suggest that market makers demand higher expected returns prior to earnings announcements because of increased inventory risks that stem from holding net positions through the release of anticipated earnings news. Collectively, our findings suggest that uncertainty regarding anticipated information events elicits predictable increases in the compensation demanded for providing liquidity and that these increases significantly affect the dynamics and information content of market prices.

By examining a sample in which each recipient country has multiple relationships with UK-resident banks, we are able to control for demand effects. We find a negative and statistically significant effect of changes to banks' capital requirements on cross-border lending: a 100 basis point increase in the requirement is associated with a reduction in the growth rate of cross-border credit of 5.5 percentage points. We also find that banks tend to favor their most important country relationships, so that the negative cross-border credit supply response in core countries is significantly less than in others. Banks tend to cut back cross-border credit to other banks (including foreign affiliates) more than to firms and households, consistent with shorter maturity, wholesale lending which is easier to roll off and may be associated with weaker borrowing relationships.

The legal change has led to larger loans with lower spreads and longer maturities. Although the credit reform improved riskier borrowers' access to credit, it also led to increased incidences of delinquency and default.

Gender quotas, however, have also been criticized as an unsuccessful tool in challenging the de facto power of traditional patriarchal elites. The case of Lesotho provides a randomized policy experiment to test for changes in the influence of traditional leaders after quota adoption at the subnational level. Between 2005 and 2011, Lesotho reserved at random 30 percent of all newly formed single-member local electoral divisions for only female candidates. Using a unique data set by merging the 2008 Afro-barometer survey with the reservation status of respondents' villages, I find that having a quota-mandated female leader significantly reduces the perceived influence of traditional leaders. Further, I find that this treatment effect holds across different demographic groups, suggesting a widespread policy impact.","Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Clayton, A (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, 101 Gowen Hall,Box 353530, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",abc24@uw.edu,,,,,,,52,30,38,0,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Stochastic volatility allows oil price uncertainty to vary separately from changes in the level of oil prices, and allows one to incorporate an extraneous indicator of oil price uncertainty such as realized volatility that greatly improves the precision of the estimated uncertainty series. The estimation results show that an oil price uncertainty shock has negative effects on world industrial production all else equal. For example, it is shown that a doubling of oil price volatility is associated with a cumulative decline as high as 0.3 percentage points in world industrial production.","Bank Canada, Toronto, ON, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Jo, S (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Toronto, ON, Canada.",sjo@bankofcanada.ca,"Jo, Soojin/JAC-6258-2023","Jo, Soojin/0000-0001-6850-625X",,,,,38,174,181,1,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Their conclusions have become part of the standard picture of Indian rural society. In this paper, using experimental data we examine the implications of the regional contrast in female autonomy for the efficiency of family decision-making. With a sample of 1200 couples (one rural and one urban area in the North (Uttar Pradesh) and one rural area in the South (Tamil Nadu)), we find continuing significant differences between North and South in the nature of marital behaviour. In our experiments we see large-scale and robust evidence of inefficiency and hiding of assets when possible. Men invest more and are more generous to their partners. Women are more willing to invest in a common pool when their income is earned through working and when assets are publicly observable. There are differences between responses to treatment but the key and striking difference between the North and the South is that in both rural and urban sites in the North household efficiency is considerably greater than in the South.

To this end, we develop a multiple-regime smooth-transition copula GARCH model and address several important questions, including the number of regimes and the existence of increasing asymmetric trends in dependence. Our results suggest that two or three regimes are sufficient for describing the dependence trends in international equity markets over the last 35 years with significant asymmetric increases. In addition, the implied time-series of three dependence measures show a wide variety of dynamics, demonstrating the usefulness of our framework to describe asymmetric increasing dependence trends. Finally, we evaluate the economic significance of our empirical finding based on the 99% Value at Risk and expected shortfall. Our result indicates that both risk measures have increased approximately 20% over the last 35 years in major equity markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When an urban area of a county became classified as a city, it would be politically separated. The province has moved toward regional structures that link urban and rural since the 1950s, but we still know very little about the 18 cities and towns that remain separated from their counties. This article examines the principal method of compensating for institutional gaps between municipalities: the creation of intermunicipal agreements. Overall, it is found that separated cities and counties are scarcely using intermunicipal agreements to ensure service and policy continuity. It is argued that this is principally due to provincial interference.","Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Inst Municipal Finance & Governance, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Spicer, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Inst Municipal Finance & Governance, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,60,4,4,0,4,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Therefore, the following question arouses:, What is the perception of both employers and future employees on the training system for the tourism and hospitality industry domain?. With a view towards obtaining an answer, the authors have chosen a descriptive type of research, i.e. a survey among students enrolled in the professional masters program Business Administration in Tourism, as well as among managers of representative hotels in Bucharest. The results show that the perception of students and professionals, respectively, are distributed comparatively, - on many aspects, such as the vocational character of the profession, the importance of attitude, of the theoretical and practical grounding -, but also that the profile of the graduate of an economic faculty of tourism, in the posture of candidate on the labour market, is quite controversial. Developing the curriculum, accordingly to the needs of the employers, will reduce the gap between the academic environment, as a supplier of professional formation, and the labour market, as a place where the labour force demand and supply meet.","[Lupu, Nicolae; Tanase, Mihail Ovidiu; Nica, Ana-Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Lupu, N (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",nicolae.lupu@com.ase.ro,"Lupu, Nicolae/GXV-2393-2022; Nica, Ana-Maria/IUQ-2106-2023; Tanase, Mihail Ovidiu/Q-2955-2016","Lupu, Nicolae/0000-0002-0999-6874; Tanase, Mihail Ovidiu/0000-0002-7101-2485; Nica, ANA-MARIA/0000-0002-5830-9428",,,,,17,6,7,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,800,810,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400008,0

Using a sample of 95 U.S. bank holding companies from 2002 to 2011, we compare five measures of the banks' contribution to systemic risk and find that the new measure proposed in this study, Net Shapley Value, outperforms the others. Using this measure we find that banks' aggregate holdings of five classes of derivatives do not exhibit a significant effect on the bank's contribution to systemic risk. On the contrary, the banks' holdings of certain specific types of derivatives such as foreign exchange and credit derivatives increase the banks contributions to systemic risk whereas holdings of interest rate derivatives decrease it. Nevertheless, the proportion of non-performing loans over total loans and the leverage ratio have much stronger impact on systemic risk than derivatives holdings. Therefore, the derivatives' impact plays a second fiddle in comparison with traditional banking activities related to the former two items. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using marginal damages, the paper computes Paasche, Laspeyres, Fisher and Tornquist index numbers for five air pollutants spanning the period 1999-2008 for use in computing real environmental accounts. Evidence of time series heterogeneity in the marginal damages is detected: marginal damages for nitrogen oxides increase by a factor of two and marginal damages for NH3 decrease by one-half.

This statement is based on the research conducted by the authors during the last three years on the companies' performance in Romania regarding the results of the innovation process and capitalization on scientific resources in order to improve this vital process. To achieve this, a mechanism should be created, through which key players in the market - companies, universities, research institutes and government - could work together towards the common goal of economic growth. This mechanism would help companies move beyond incremental innovation by using knowledge generated by universities or research institutes. This can be achieved with the support of the governmental environment, by adopting policies and creating a general favourable climate for research and by fostering its integration among companies. This paper presents an analysis of the degree to which companies in Romania use the results of academic research when developing new products or services. Among the identified issues we include the Romanian companies' tendency to perform individual research and development projects, though their frequency is quite low given the difficulties in successfully delivering them to the market. The research shows the importance of using academic research when moving beyond incremental improvements and developing the innovation processes within the company. The prospect of a future model of the university as a knowledge and innovation hub of can significantly contribute to the capitalization of academic research by companies in order to develop sustainable businesses.","[Pamfilie, Rodica; Giusca, Smaranda; Bumbac, Robert] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pamfilie, R (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",rodica.pamfilie@com.ase.ro,"Bumbac, Robert/AAD-3830-2019","Bumbac, Robert/0000-0002-7288-7400",,,,,16,4,4,1,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,759,769,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400005,0

This paper attempts to clarify the conceptual differences and the relatively common parts of inter-, trans-, cross- and multidisciplinarity in general, and in particular in education, focusing on business education. A brief introduction structures the inter-, trans-, cross- and multidisciplinary investigative approach within an educational context in business, and a review of the scientific literature section clarifies both the meaning of those major concepts, extending from simple paradigm of each concept to their multiple aggregative paradigm, and some modern educational trends in economics. A second section is devoted to the method of investigating opinions, based on the volume of a sample determined statistically and from a scientific methodology of observation and recording, by collecting individual data, validating the rigor of research on the diversity in business education approaches, by simply and consistently noting them by the students and graduates of faculties of economics. The study of the graduates' opinions focused on an original questionnaire, presented in the a annexes of the paper, and the resulting databases were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis, made with the software package Eviews, with emphasis on the homogeneity, symmetry, skewness and normality of distributions. The third section is a brief analysis of the research results, supplemented naturally by some clarifying discussions, which outline the current option of the graduates towards early multidisciplinarity as a necessary goal resulting from the content analysis of opinions. The conclusions briefly describe the expected trends of inter-, trans-, cross- and multidisciplinary education in economics, relating to business, approached as any job well done, from several scientific viewpoints.","[Savoiu, Gheorghe] Univ Pitesti, Fac Econ Sci, Pitesti, Romania; [Dinu, Vasile; Tachiciu, Laurentiu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Savoiu, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pitesti, Fac Econ Sci, Pitesti, Romania.",gsavoiu@yahoo.com,"Săvoiu, Gheorghe/C-3569-2013; Dinu, Vasile/L-5051-2017","Săvoiu, Gheorghe/0000-0002-9596-793X; Dinu, Vasile/0000-0003-3606-2548; Tachiciu, Laurentiu/0000-0002-2566-0342",,,,,34,5,5,0,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,707,725,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400002,0

The conventional paradigm suggests that community banks - small, single-market, local institutions - are better able to form strong relationships with informationally opaque small businesses, while megabanks - large, multimarket, nonlocal institutions - tend to serve more transparent firms. Using the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finance (SSBF), we conduct two sets of tests. First, we test for the type of bank serving as the main relationship bank for small businesses with different firm and owner characteristics. Second, we test for the strength of these main relationships by examining the probability of an exclusive relationship and main bank relationship length as functions of main bank type and financial fragility, as well as firm and owner characteristics. The results are often not consistent with the conventional paradigm, perhaps because of changes in lending technologies and deregulation of the banking industry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The RBF interpolation scheme is demonstrated by solving an option pricing formula, a one-dimensional partial integro-differential equation (PIDE). We select the cubic spline radial basis function and adopt a simple numerical algorithm (Briani et al. in Calcolo 44:33-57, 2007) to establish a finite computational range for the improper integral of the PIDE. This algorithm reduces the truncation error of approximating the improper integral. As a result, we are able to achieve a higher approximation accuracy of the integral with the application of any quadrature. Moreover, we a numerical technique termed cubic spline factorisation (Bos and Salkauskas in J Approx Theory 51:81-88, 1987) to solve the inversion of an ill-conditioned RBF interpolant, which is a well-known research problem in the RBF field. Finally, our numerical experiments show that in the European case, our RBF-interpolation solution is second-order accurate for spatial variables, while in the American case, it is second-order accurate for spatial variables and first-order accurate for time variables.","[Chan, Ron Tat Lung] Univ E London, UEL Royal Docks Business Sch, London E16 2RD, England; [Hubbert, Simon] Univ London, Sch Econ Math & Stat, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of East London; University of London,"Chan, RTL (通讯作者)，Univ E London, UEL Royal Docks Business Sch, Docklands Campus 4-6 Univ Way, London E16 2RD, England.",t.l.chan@uel.ac.uk; s.hubbert@bbk.ac.uk,,"Hubbert, Simon/0000-0002-3052-4337; Chan, Tat Lung/0000-0002-4048-6370",,,,,55,22,25,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

In this paper, we show how recent advances in the statistical analysis of extreme events can provide solid methodological fundamentals for modeling extreme events. Our approach uses self-exciting marked point processes for estimating the tail of loss distributions. The main result is that the time between extreme events plays an important role in the statistical analysis of these events and could therefore be useful to forecast the size and intensity of future extreme events in financial markets. We illustrate this point by measuring the impact of the subprime and global financial crisis on the German stock market in extenso, and briefly as a benchmark in the US stock market. With the help of our fitted models, we backtest the Value at Risk at various quantiles to assess the likeliness of different extreme movements on the DAX, S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock market indices during the crisis. The results show that the proposed models provide accurate risk measures according to the Basel Committee and make better use of the available information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

States can let each school district decide, provide standards that must be followed and make available an incomplete listing of books meeting those standards, or allow schools to choose books only from a list provided by the state. I present a model that provides an explanation for state limits on textbook selection by school districts. I examine the roles played by decision making costs, effectiveness of voters, religious composition, power of teachers, and propensity of state governments to interfere with or to help districts in textbook selection policies at the state level. There has been virtually no research on this topic. My findings corroborate the extant literature that addresses interference by state governments in local affairs and extend the morality politics literature by finding a strong link between religious fundamentalism and state-level policies. I also find that state book lists are less likely (1) in more educated states, where voters are better able to select the most appropriate textbook, (2) in states with smaller school districts, where voters are more involved in the schools, and (3) in states with stronger teacher unions, giving teachers more power in textbook selection.","Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Rolla, MO 65409 USA",University of Missouri System; Missouri University of Science & Technology,"Phillips, MA (通讯作者)，Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, 101 Harris Hall,301 W 14th St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.",michellephillips@ufl.edu,,"Phillips, Michelle/0000-0003-0894-3516",,,,,35,2,5,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2014,160.0,1-2,,,,,181,203,,10.1007/s11127-013-0075-9,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AW7ZY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346481600009,0

The primary objective of such TOM strategies is not to improve traffic safety, although their impact on traffic safety should not be neglected. The main purpose of this study is to simulate the traffic safety impact of conducting a teleworking scenario (i.e. 5% of the working population engages in teleworking) in the study area, Flanders, Belgium. Since TDM strategies are usually conducted at a geographically aggregated level, crash prediction models should also be developed at an aggregate level. Given that crash occurrences are often spatially heterogeneous and are affected by many spatial variables, the existence of spatial correlation in the data is also examined. The results indicate the necessity of accounting for the spatial correlation when developing crash prediction models. Therefore, zonal crash prediction models (ZCPMs) within the geographically weighted generalized linear modeling framework are developed to incorporate the spatial variations in association between the number of crashes (including fatal, severe and slight injury crashes recorded between 2004 and 2007) and other explanatory variables. Different exposure, network and socio-demographic variables of 2200 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) are considered as predictors of crashes. An activity-based transportation model framework is adopted to produce detailed exposure metrics. This enables to conduct a more detailed and reliable assessment while TOM strategies are inherently modeled in the activity-based models. In this study, several ZCPMs with different severity levels and crash types are developed to predict crash counts for both the null and the teleworking scenario. The results show a considerable traffic safety benefit of conducting the teleworking scenario due to its impact on the reduction of total vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) by 3.15%. Implementing the teleworking scenario is predicted to reduce the annual VKT by 1.43 billion and the total number of crashes to decline by 2.6%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a time-varying probability regime-switching model and monthly data (2000M9-2012M3), we identify two very distinctive regimes: a low mark-up regime (R-1) and a high mark-up regime (R-2). Without setting any given date a priori, the results from both the regime-switching approach and a sequential search method indicate that the spread exhibits a significant upward shift around early 2008 for all lenders. The estimated switching model controls for the rising wholesale funding costs and changes in global consumer confidence over the sample period. The results show that building societies are generally less inclined to remain in R2 than most banks (particularly foreign subsidiary banks) and some credit unions, and are consequently more likely to offer competitive mortgages to borrowers.

Issuer characteristics do not explain the results: holding fixed the issuer, funds with higher Eurozone exposure cut lending more.

While the one scheme adopts bilateral cumulation, the other scheme does diagonal cumulation. Comparing trade under these two kinds of FTAs, we can examine the effect of diagonal cumulation without relying on not only the variation in cumulation rules across country pairs but also the variation across years. In short, our estimates do not suffer from biases from time-variant elements and country pair-specific elements. As a result, our estimates show around 4% trade creation effect of diagonal cumulation, which is much smaller than the estimates in the previous studies (around 15%). J. Japanese Int.

Even though considerable research examines the housing and mortgage markets during the previous decade, how the expansion in mortgage credit affected the rental market remains unclear; and yet, over 30 percent of all U.S. households reside in the rental market. Our study fills this gap by showing how the multifamily rental market was adversely affected by the development of subprime lending in the single-family market before the advent of the 2007/2008 subprime induced financial crisis. We provide evidence for a fundamentals based linkage by which the effect of an innovation in one market (i.e, the growth in subprime mortgage originations) is propagated through to another market. Using a large database of residential rental lease payment records, our results confirm that the expansion in subprime lending corresponds with an overall decline in the quality of rental payments. Finally, we present evidence showing that the financial performance of multifamily rental properties reflected the increase in rental lease defaults. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Besides the wage discount, another feature of the equilibrium is that low-ability workers informally hired shirk.","[Duran, Miguel A.; Morales, Antonio J.] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Duran, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",,"Morales, Antonio J/A-4426-2013; Duran, Miguel A./K-7896-2014","Morales, Antonio J/0000-0002-2843-8245; Duran, Miguel A./0000-0002-2004-5586",,,,,21,0,2,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The carrying capacity application has the greatest potential in protected areas, in frequently visited cultural and natural attractions, and in relation to sustaining of the lifestyle of the local community and tourism destination potential in general. Despite its importance, partial applications, determination of basic theoretical principles, and specifying connection to the other theoretical concepts in tourism (particularly destination life cycle, LAC concept, visitors management), there still is a rightful opinion of some authors suggesting that there is no consistent theory of tourism carrying capacity. This theory would be the base for sophisticated practical carrying capacity applications.

As a result of their experiences of both forced displacement from their home as well as stasis within camp settings and the refugee determination process, refugees are an example of what some have called a dialectic of movement/moorings (Urry, 2003: 125), both on the move and trapped in place. Their resettlement in the U.S., as this paper illustrates, may represent a further extension of this dialectic placed by government agents in new immigrant reception areas not of their own choosing, forced to commute long distances and into unfamiliar environments for work and limited in their abilities to access healthcare, education and employment (amongst other services) due to a range of transportation barriers. I argue in this paper that refugee mobilities in a new settlement site are about more than inconvenience: barriers to movement may constitute obstacles to acculturation, integration, self-empowerment, and community building.

We employ a recently developed two-country model with recursive preferences, frictionless and complete markets and highly correlated long-run innovations to examine whether full financial integration (i.e. full risk-sharing) affects the US-Canada EMR correlation and the US RER volatility, consistently with existing empirical findings. First, full risk-sharing gives rise to a relatively high RER volatility. Second, it induces very strong positive cross-country EMR correlations. Both quantities are higher than those observed in the US-Canada asset pricing data, and increase as the risk-sharing incentive increases. In contrast, international consumption quantities are weakly sensitive to changes in the level of aversion to consumption and utility risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Comparable studies have tended, firstly, to focus on assets and debt rather than on expenditures and, secondly, on district population rather than on the number of districts as in the original formulation of the law. Both issues are sought to be remedied in this paper. The proposition is examined on Danish municipal expenditures from 1996 to 2006, using municipal mergers towards the end of this period as a quasi-experiment. A difference-in-difference identification strategy and a subsample strategy are used to identify the effect of the availability and size of a common pool on municipal expenditures. The paper finds positive, statistically and economically significant effects of the availability and size of a common pool in the final year of the treatment period. The importance of the number of districts over district population suggests a reappraisal of the law of 1 over n as originally formulated.","[Hansen, Sune Welling] Danish Anal & Res Inst Local Govt, DK-1150 Copenhagen K, Denmark",,"Hansen, SW (通讯作者)，Danish Anal & Res Inst Local Govt, Kobmagergade 22, DK-1150 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",swh@akf.dk,,"Hansen, Sune Welling/0000-0002-9701-3515",,,,,27,36,36,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2014,159.0,1-2,,,,,3,21,,10.1007/s11127-012-0009-y,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AD3OX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333156600001,0

Firstly, it contributes to identifying the specific role of national culture as a variable that helps explain the level of economic development and reinforces the effect of entrepreneurship on the income level. Secondly, a deeper understanding of these relations in the case of the European Union is sought. In this study, data from two different sources have been used. The Schwartz Value Survey measures seven cultural orientations that are then grouped into three bipolar dimensions (embeddedness vs. autonomy, hierarchy vs. egalitarianism and mastery vs. harmony). The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor provides information regarding entrepreneurial activity. Using linear regression analysis, cultural and entrepreneurial variables are able to classify countries according to their development level, explaining over 60 % of the variance in Gross Domestic Product per capita. The role of culture is complex, with geographical elements being significantly relevant. In the case of Europe, some common elements conform what could be called a European culture: autonomy and egalitarianism clearly predominate over embeddedness and hierarchy, while harmony tends to prevail over mastery. Nevertheless, four well-defined groups of countries within the European Union emerge. Central and Northern Europe is closer to this European stereotypical culture, while English-speaking countries, Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area exhibit their own differentiating elements each. These differences also exist with regard to entrepreneurial activity (overall Total Entrepreneurial Activity, necessity and opportunity-driven activity). Each of the four regional entrepreneurial cultures is characterized by a different entrepreneurial dynamics that may be plausibly explained by culture and income.","[Linan, Francisco; Fernandez-Serrano, Jose] Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Liñán, F (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ, Seville, Spain.",flinan@us.es; jfserrano@us.es,"Fernández-Serrano, José/F-2096-2016; Liñán, Francisco/E-9576-2010","Fernández-Serrano, José/0000-0003-4882-2399; Liñán, Francisco/0000-0001-6212-1375",,,,,68,140,152,4,174,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In our laboratory experiment subjects decide on a series of mini-Dictator games while under varying degrees of cognitive load. Cognitive load is intended to decrease deliberation and therefore enhance the influence of affect on behavior. In each game subjects have two options: they can decide between a fair and an unfair allocation. We find that subjects in a high-load condition are more generous - they more often choose the fair allocation than subjects in a low-load condition. The series of mini-Dictator games also allows us to investigate how subjects react to the games' varying levels of advantageous inequality. Low-load subjects react considerably more to the degree of advantageous inequality. Our results underscore the importance of affect for basic altruistic behavior and deliberation in adjusting decisions to a given situation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Some suggest gender inequality is still severe; others report progress. We seek to understand the progress China has made (if any) in reducing gender inequality in education since the 1980s. To meet this goal, we use a meta-analysis approach which provides a new quantitative review of a relatively large volume of empirical literature on gender educational differentials. This article analyzes differences across both time and space, and also across different grade levels and ethnicities. Our results indicate that gender inequality in educational attainment still exists, but it has been narrowing over time. Moreover, it varies by area (rural versus urban) and grade level. There is nearly no significant gender inequality in the case of girls in urban areas or in the case of the 9 years of compulsory education (primary school and junior high school). Girls, however, still face inequality in rural areas (although inequality is falling over time) and when they reach high school or beyond.

This paper addresses this question by examining some of the aspects of the motivational structure of social norm compliance. It argues two claims: First, neither resentment nor pleasure is the ultimate motive of norm compliance; second, caring is necessary, both to feel certain emotions and to comply with norms. According to my proposal, caring is a relatively stable volitional profile, something through which agents steadily orient their behaviors within their environments in pursuit of a good life. Explicating this notion, at both the personal and subpersonal level of explanation, helps to see in what sense we cannot feel certain emotions or comply with social norms unless we possess the capacity to care.","[Colombo, Matteo] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Colombo, M (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Ctr Log & Philosophy Sci, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",m.colombo@uvt.nl,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as part of the priority program New Frameworks of Rationality [SPP 1516],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as part of the priority program New Frameworks of Rationality(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as part of the priority program New Frameworks of Rationality (SPP 1516).,,64,5,5,0,10,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The core ingredients of change have been, in different proportions and timing across countries: privatization of formerly state-owned enterprises, unbundling of networks, market liberalization and regulation. This paper summarizes some empirical findings of a team of researchers at the University of Milan about the impact of the reforms on energy prices (1990-2007) for EU-15 households. Econometric testing of the impact of the reforms (measured by OECD/ECTR scores) on prices of electricity and gas finds that public ownership of the incumbents is correlated with lower prices for households; unbundling per se has no statistically significant effect; the evidence about liberalization is mixed. Price inertia, sources of primary energy in electricity, and oil price in gas are still the core price determinants. Customers' satisfaction with prices confirms these findings. There is some evidence that consumers are subjectively happy with the opportunity to switch their electricity supplier; even if the objective evidence about the actual benefit of doing this is limited.","Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Florio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",massimo.florio@unimi.it,,,,,,,34,9,9,0,14,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Recent research has found no evidence of such convergence. In order to explain non-convergence, the stochastic electoral model is extended by including a competence and sociodemographic valance in a country where regional and national parties compete in the election. That is, the model allows voters to face different sets of parties in different regions. We introduce the notion of a convergence coefficient, c for regional and national parties and show that when c is high there is a significant centrifugal tendency acting on parties. An electoral survey of the 2004 election in Canada is used to construct a stochastic electoral model of the election with two regions: Qu,bec and the rest of Canada. The survey allows us to estimate voter positions in the policy space. The variable choice set logit model is used to built a relationship between party position and vote share. We find that in the local Nash equilibrium for the election the two main parties with high competence valence, the Liberals and Conservatives, locate at the national electoral mean and the Bloc Qu,b,cois, with the highest competence valence, locates at the Qu,bec electoral mean. The New Democratic Party has a low competence valence but remains at the national mean. The Greens, with lowest competence valence, locate away from the national mean to increase its vote share.","[Gallego, Maria] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Gallego, Maria; Schofield, Norman; McAlister, Kevin] Washington Univ, Ctr Polit Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Jeon, Jee Seon] Florida State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Wilfrid Laurier University; Washington University (WUSTL); State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Schofield, N (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Ctr Polit Econ, 1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",mgallego@wlu.ca; schofield.norman@gmail.com; kevinmcalister@wustl.edu; jsjeon@fsu.edu,"Gallego, Maria/AAF-2143-2020",,,,,,43,6,6,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2014,158.0,3-4,,,SI,,427,463,,10.1007/s11127-013-0109-3,0.0,,,37,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AA3GM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330980900007,0
J,"Gyourko, J; Tracy, J",,,,"Gyourko, Joseph; Tracy, Joseph",,,Reconciling theory and empirics on the role of unemployment in mortgage default,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mortgage default; Unemployment; FHA,,"Empirical models of mortgage default typically find that the influence of unemployment is negligible compared to other well known risk factors such as high borrower leverage or low borrower FICO scores. This is at odds with theory, which assigns a critical role to unemployment in the decision to stop payment on a mortgage. We help reconcile this divergence by employing a novel empirical strategy involving simulated unemployment histories to measure the severity of attenuation bias in loan-level estimations of default risk due to a borrower becoming unemployed. Attenuation bias results because individual data on unemployment status is unobserved, requiring that a market-wide unemployment rate be used as a proxy. Attenuation is extreme, with our results suggesting that the use of an aggregate unemployment rate in lieu of actual borrower unemployment status results in default risk from a borrower becoming unemployed being underestimated by a factor more than 100. In addition, our analysis indicates that adding the unemployment rate as a proxy for the missing borrower-specific unemployment indicator does not improve the accuracy of the estimated model over the specification without the proxy variable included. Hence, aggregate portfolio-level risk estimates for mortgage guarantors such as FHA also are not improved. These views represent those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.

To date, the results have been mixed: some authors observe a negative association between remittances and unemployment while others report that remittances increase unemployment. This study empirically examines the impact of remittances on unemployment using macroeconomic data for a sample of 18 Latin American and Caribbean countries. Specifically, the study tests whether there is a nonlinear relationship between the variables. Results suggest that when the remittance-to-GDP ratio is low, remittances have a positive and significant impact on unemployment. However, as they increase, remittances are negatively associated with unemployment. This suggests the possibility that estimations based on the assumption of a linear relationship between remittances and labor may mask the true relationship between the variables.","[Jackman, Mahalia] Univ Manchester, Inst Social Change, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Jackman, Mahalia] Antilles Econ, BB-19018 St George, Barbados",University of Manchester,"Jackman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Inst Social Change, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",mahalia_j@hotmail.com,"Jackman, Mahalia/J-3572-2019","Jackman, Mahalia/0000-0002-4522-664X",,,,,42,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We set up a dynamic model of decision-making in which the individual's mind is composed of a coordinating principal and 2 conflicting agents. We take into account the cognitive dissonance experienced as a result of the conflict between the agents. Each agent (or self) is specialized in perceiving a particular type of signal and performing a task. Dissonance levels in our model are not constant. Instead, the individual's split-selves are open to habituation, which can lead to a reduction in cognitive dissonance. Therefore, motivated habituation appears as a way to avoid dissonance. We prove the existence of an optimal strategy with a threshold structure.

Morgan) from 2005 to 2009, we find persistent mispricings between the CDS and ASP spreads of individual firms, which should be priced similarly, before and during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. These mispricings are more frequent in low credit quality bonds and appear to offer arbitrage opportunities. We also aggregate the firms' CDS and ASP in a portfolio and still find persistent deviations, mainly in the lower rated bonds. In aggregate terms the deviations from the parity relation can be explained from systematic factors such as financing costs, counterparty risk, and global risk. However, after considering realistic estimations of funding and trading costs, all these mispricings are unlikely to provide profitable arbitrage opportunities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, the study decomposes Turkey's export growth into extensive and intensive margins by using two methodologies, the count method and the decomposition method of export growth rates. We further decompose the intensive margin into price and quantity components. Detailed bilateral trade data, BACI, from CEPII are employed to analyze Turkey's export statistics with 211 countries at the HS-6 level over the period 1998-2011. Additionally, we employ these methods for different categories of goods (final goods and intermediate goods exports). The results suggest that the intensive margin plays the most important role (99% of total export growth) in Turkey's export growth. Further, 66% of this intensive export growth results from quantity growth, whereas 33% is driven by price growth. Similarly, the export growth rates of final and intermediate goods are explained by the intensive margin.","[Turkcan, Kemal; Piskin, Erhan] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Econ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Türkcan, K (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Dept Econ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",kturkcan@akdeniz.edu.tr; erhanpiskin@akdeniz.edu.tr,"Türkcan, Kemal/N-3771-2019; Türkcan, Kemal/C-2309-2016","Türkcan, Kemal/0000-0001-9055-7280; Türkcan, Kemal/0000-0001-9055-7280",,,,,60,2,2,0,10,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We calibrate the firm-heterogeneity model of Eaton et al. (Econometrica 79(5):1453-1498, 2011) to match micro-level data on Japanese multinational firms facing fixed and variable costs of foreign production. We demonstrate that the calibrated model can be used to replicate the entry and sales patterns of Japanese multinationals. Counterfactual simulations show that declining FDI barriers lead to a disproportionate expansion of foreign production by more efficient firms relative to less efficient firms. A hypothetical 20 % reduction in FDI barriers is found to generate up to a 26.8 % improvement in industry-level productivity through global market-share reallocations within the industry. Compared with fixed entry barriers, reallocation effects and productivity gains are larger for a reduction of variable costs of foreign production.","[Arita, Shawn] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20520 USA; [Tanaka, Kiyoyasu] Inst Developing Econ, Mihama Ku, Chiba 2618545, Japan",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Arita, S (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave SW,Mailstop 1800, Washington, DC 20520 USA.",ssarita@ers.usda.gov; kiyoyasu_tanaka@ide.go.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330080, 22330087] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,30,8,8,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

CDS insulate lenders against losses from forcing borrowers into default and liquidation. This improves the credibility of foreclosure threats, which can have positive implications for borrower incentives and credit availability ex ante. However, lenders may also abuse their enhanced bargaining power vis-a-vis borrowers and extract excessive rents in debt renegotiations. If this hold up threat becomes severe, borrowers will be reluctant to agree to debt maturity designs or control rights transfers that would have been optimal in the absence of CDS markets. The introduction of CDS markets may then ultimately tighten credit constraints and be detrimental to welfare. Our analysis yields a number of empirical implications, some of which have been tested.

In the past, the implementation of biogas programs has been largely disappointing, in China (and elsewhere). User satisfaction with the new program is high, based on purposively collected data from 2,700 households in five provinces, and the available evidence suggests tangible environmental and economic benefits. There are strong indications of fuel switching away from fuelwood and crop residues. Less time is spent on fuelwood collection and cooking, which benefits women especially. Adopters save on fertilizers by using biogas residues. Finally, problems with suspension and interrupted supply appear lower than in earlier studies. Overall, these initial findings are grounds for optimism about the potential for scaled-up smallholder biogas to deliver safe and clean rural energy, in China and beyond, provided critical conditions are met.","[Christiaensen, Luc] World Bank, Off Chief Economist, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Heltberg, Rasmus] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Christiaensen, L (通讯作者)，World Bank, Off Chief Economist, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",lchristiaensen@worldbank.org; rheltberg@worldbank.org,,,,,,,29,27,31,0,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

In order to illustrate its application, we present a study based on the responses regarding satisfaction elements of 679 companies, the customers of a distribution chain in the field of interior fittings.

To test the relationship we use a two-stage methodology yielding an estimate of a congestion spillover effect. Our data are passenger traffic from 1990 to 2012 containing both intercontinental and European air traffic. For intercontinental air traffic, our results show high congestion spillover effect between Heathrow and Gatwick airports, and significant but lesser effect to Stansted airport. We also find significant congestion spillover effects from Heathrow to the spatially more distant Manchester and Birmingham airports, showing the extensive spatial impact of Heathrow's development constraints. For European air traffic, controlling for low-cost air carrier growth, only two airports show significant congestion spillover effects: Gatwick and London City Airports. Illustrating that low-cost carriers do not operate from Heathrow, so its limitations cannot affect the predominant low-cost air traffic in other airports.

However, in contrast to previous research, we use an inhomogeneous multi-dimensional Ising model where the local degrees of freedom (agents) are subject to a specific social temperature and coupled to external fields which govern their social behavior. This new modeling frame allows for analyzing large societies of four different and interacting agent types. As a second novelty, our model may reproduce results from agent-based models that incorporate standard Allingham and Sandrno tax evasion features as well as results from existing two-dimensional Ising based tax evasion models. In this way, such kind of models may become more relevant and useful in economics as well as social psychology. We finally use our model for analyzing income tax evasion dynamics under different enforcement scenarios and point to some policy implications that may also be of interest for psychological research on tax compliance.

The reason for treating this theme started from the fact that the level of knowledge of the system and its symbols by the consumers is very low. In the introductory part, specification of surveyed topic is given and importance of consumer education and information is highlighted. Empirical research is based on two approaches. First, 1114 product names from DOOR database (Database for agricultural products and foodstuffs in EU countries) were analysed in order to investigate the frequency of labels utilization by country and product classes, cluster analysis was applied to show the labels distribution by countries. Dominant countries in number of labels are Italy, France and Spain having registered over 50 % of all products. The most frequent product class is Fruits, vegetables and cereals for PGI and Cheeses for PDO. The second approach reflects consumer view on the issue; survey of 250 consumers in the Czech Republic was carried out with the purpose to identify awareness and perceived credibility of labels. Findings reveal a low awareness of labels, credibility of labels is influenced by their low familiarity. The main problem is lack of information. Respondents show interest in getting information regarding this topic. Quality labels have potential to communicate with consumers and facilitate their food purchases, but it is necessary to improve their promotion.","[Velcovska, Sarka; Sadilek, Tomas] Tech Univ Ostrava, VSB, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Velcovská, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, VSB, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",sarka.velcovska@vsb.cz,"Sadilek, Tomas/AAL-1507-2020; Velčovská, Šárka/G-3734-2018","Sadilek, Tomas/0000-0001-9358-5797; Velčovská, Šárka/0000-0002-0096-2758",,,,,24,8,8,3,40,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,228,242,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300016,0

Thus, gradual advances in technology development and continuous retraining of farmers are essential for sustainable adoption of agricultural technologies for some crops.","[Ainembabazi, John Herbert] Int Inst Trop Agr, Kampala, Uganda; [Mugisha, Johnny] Makerere Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Nat Resource Econ, Kampala, Uganda",Makerere University,"Ainembabazi, JH (通讯作者)，Int Inst Trop Agr, POB 7878, Kampala, Uganda.",J.Aainembabazi@cgiar.org,,,,,,,50,58,62,2,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

However it is not known whether knowledge sharing via the Internet has had an impact on the health and wellbeing of society. The aim of this research paper is thus to shed some light on the relationship between the Internet and life expectancy by examining if the knowledge that is being shared via the Internet can have an impact on the health and wellbeing of society. A quantitative research approach has been conducted to examine this relationship by analysing a few factors that can impact the relationship and takes on a simple quantitative regression analysis in analysing the relationship. In addition, we found a positive relationship between the usage of Internet and its impact on the life expectancy of individuals.

Consequently, the dynamics of the real exchange rate can be modeled in the context of two regimes: one in which multilateral adjustment to large U.S. external imbalances is an important factor driving movements in the real exchange rate and the second in which the real exchange rate is driven mainly by country-specific macroeconomic fundamentals. We apply this model to the bilateral real Canada-U.S. dollar exchange rate and compare its performance to several other alternative models. All of the models are estimated using a Bayesian approach. Our findings suggest that during periods of large U.S. imbalances, an exchange rate model for the real Canada-U.S. dollar exchange rate should allow for multilateral adjustment effects.

In fact, the main objective of this research is to analyze the impact and effects of formal teaching of entrepreneurial programs on master's degree students at Tunisian university. The study focused on two main aspects of impact when considering: Entrepreneurial intention and profile of participants Life career of these participants by examining how they have transferred their knowledge to their professional work.

Resilience focuses upon positive outcomes and implies a series of risk factors, environmental factors, and interpersonal factors. In this paper, resilience will be read as interpretation capacity and reaction alertness, in relation to a geographical and cultural context. Considering these characterizing factors of resilience, it is proposed as an experimental interdisciplinary and international tool of risk education, where the concept of resilience is revised in relation with landscape, in order to promote a resilientscape. REthinking the landscape is a place-based, bottom-up tool that involves different approaches, taken from geography, arts, history and botany, developed in the context of a museum in Funchal (Madeira island). The hypothesis of this paper is that population has in itself the ability to cope with disasters and risk. Accordingly, the main purposes are to unearth community capacity and to lay the groundwork for community participation in DRR according to PDRA strategies. The first part of the paper discusses the role of participation in building landscape resilience against natural hazards. The second part introduces and discusses the characteristics of the aforementioned tool, its strategies, goals, and experiments, starting with the work on landscape education conducted by Castiglioni (2012).

Maderia is a Portuguese Macaronesian island that is located in the Atlantic Ocean and frequently affected by natural hazards. Here, the concept of resilience is discussed as a dichotomous and place-based concept and as a way of achieving sustainability, sustainability being one of the main solutions for climate change. This paper will discuss the complexity of defining resilience, the contradictions involved in its use and its positive and negative applications. In order to make resilience an operative concept, it is investigated within landscape research, in which landscape is considered to be the result of human and natural actions and their interaction. Here, landscape is considered as a holistic, place-based, bottomup concept that can be used as a unit of measure for community resilience. As a consequence of the kind of relationship that a community builds with the landscape in which it lives, we can encounter different kinds of lansdscapes: riskscapes, hazardscapes, resilientscapes, sustainable landscapes, etc. These landscapes are investigated in the context of the island of Madeira in order to identify the resilient actions of its community. To conclude, today, Madeira is a riskscape and often a hazardscape. The most recent incidents were the fires of 2013 and the flash flood of 2010, which was one of the worst events in the history of the archipelago. However, the first signs of resilience have been identified, which represent interesting examples of increasing awareness in both top-down and bottom-up ways. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We find that learning outcomes are essentially the samethat students in the hybrid format are not harmed by this mode of instruction in terms of pass rates, final exam scores, and performance on a standardized assessment of statistical literacy.

The article presents new evidence on the scale, geography, drivers and features of land deals, relates findings to data from earlier research and international efforts to monitor land deals, and outlines possible ways forward for ongoing monitoring of the deals.","[Cotula, Lorenzo] Int Inst Environm & Dev, Nat Resources Grp, Edinburgh EH2 2EN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Oya, Carlos] Univ London, SOAS, Dev Studies Dept, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Cotula, L (通讯作者)，Int Inst Environm & Dev, Nat Resources Grp, 4 Hanover St, Edinburgh EH2 2EN, Midlothian, Scotland.",lorenzo.cotula@iied.org,,"Oya, Carlos/0000-0003-0379-6377",,,,,32,87,95,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we provide evidence that health care reform in Massachusetts led to better overall self-assessed health. Various robustness checks and placebo tests support a causal interpretation of the results. We also document improvements in several determinants of overall health: physical health, mental health, functional limitations, joint disorders, and body mass index. Next, we show that the effects on overall health were strongest among those with low incomes, nonwhites, near-elderly adults, and women. Finally, we use the reform to instrument for health insurance and estimate a sizeable impact of coverage on health.

Such conditions require efficient and flexible operation and building capacities for the effective use of opportunities that emerge in the environment and neutralize or predict threats. These types of capabilities are based primarily on intangible assets, which are currently a key factor in the success of organisations. Taking this into account, the author of the paper examines the role of intangible resources of an organisation in generating its added value with particular emphasis on specific features of research institutes. Among intangible assets, knowledge plays a special role in the creation of the added value and the competitive advantage of the organisation. The author indicates the need to continually improve the knowledge management processes, which allows its free flow, as well as a steady increase, which will help to develop intelligent organisation. The analysis conducted in this paper also covers key factors that facilitate the accumulation, generation, development, and diffusion of knowledge. An important part of the effective management of knowledge is the measurement and reporting of the intellectual capital of the organisation. For this reason, the main groups of methods of intellectual capital measurement are discussed, with particular emphasis on the scorecard methods, which are most often used in research institutes. The article also shows the influence of a reliable and systematic measurement of intellectual capital on the development of research units. In this paper, the original model of intellectual capital measurement, which was developed at the Institute for Sustainable Technologies - National Research Institute in Radom is also discussed.","Natl Res Inst Radom, Inst Sustainable Technol, Radom, Poland",Institute for Sustainable Technologies,"Czerwiec, M (通讯作者)，Natl Res Inst Radom, Inst Sustainable Technol, Radom, Poland.",marta.czerwiec@itee.radom.pl,"Zhangaliyeva, Kymbat/ABB-8422-2020",,,,,,47,0,0,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,15,23,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000003,0

With panel data from 2001 to 2009, the paper finds that the combined model provides the strongest explanation for the current levels of unfunded liabilities; hence, both median voter preferences and special interest group influence are affecting political outcomes.

Where school commutes are made by private cars there can be a significant contribution to early morning traffic congestion and associated externalities, as well as missed opportunities in regards to benefits that would accrue from higher occupancy and non-motorised modes of travel. This paper considers the challenge of shifting primary school students away from private car drop offs (PCDOs) in a case study area where over 60% of primary school children are driven to school. The paper engages and analyses an array of recent census and transport specific data through econometric and GIS-based methodologies to update and understand the modal choice decision factors involved, and to identify appropriate opportunities for change which may thereafter be trialled, supported and developed. The authors identify distance to travel as the most significant determinant of mode choice, and furthermore, by utilising a blend of GIS and census data, identify 2 km as a guiding 'splitting line' or threshold between the alternative modes of walking and using transit or other motorised modes. This guidance on a distance splitting line is not a rule, but can inform the tailoring of modal shift intervention strategies appropriate to the specific circumstances and current behavioural trends. Above 2 km the paper finds that students rarely walk to school and offers an evidence based recommendation for specific school bus services or coordinated carpooling as part of the solution. Below 2 km, a walking school bus can serve as a functional substitute to PCDOs and is identified as feasible for certain areas given the student densities and school locations. In both cases recent technological innovations can support change. The research further finds that low car ownership rates, students having siblings and living in safe areas encourage the use of substitutive modes over PCDOs. The analytical approach of the paper can be replicated and the full detail of the analysis can offer guidance for community coordinated actions and local authority interventions to support sustainable school travel outcomes.

Literature reviews revealed that more research works are needed in examining the determinants of entrepreneurship intentions of students. This study is to determine the relationship between student's entrepreneurial motivation and entrepreneurship intention. A total of 450 self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the students of the various faculties, races and student seniority at a Public University using the convenient and structured sampling method. Finally, 413 duly completed questionnaires were returned and used in the analyses. Correlation analysis and regression analysis showed that strength of motivation in choosing entrepreneurship as a career option among the students is related with entrepreneurship intention. The entrepreneurial motivation factors affecting career intention to be an entrepreneur are made up of behavioral control, subjective norm, and attitude towards entrepreneurship. Subjective norm (tolerance for risk) and attitude (desirability) of self-employment are significantly related to both student immediate and future intentions to be an entrepreneur. However, behavioral control entrepreneurial motivation is found to be significantly related to student immediate career intention but not significantly related to student future entrepreneurship career intention. Creating of opportunity for practice of key entrepreneurial behaviors is seen as crucial in cultivating entrepreneurial behaviors. Theory of Planned Behavior Model can be used as a tool to identify would be entrepreneur and target them for entrepreneurship career development. This study argued and supported the call that those youths who are really serious to start and own a business as would be entrepreneurs can be identified and targeted to develop through entrepreneurship interventions initiatives.","[Kim-Soon, Ng; Ahmad, Abdul Rahman; Ibrahim, Nurul Nadia] Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Malaysia",University of Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia,"Kim-Soon, N (通讯作者)，Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Malaysia.",ksng@uthm.edu.my; arahman@uthm.edu.my; chenad90@gmail.com,"Ahmad, Abd Rahman/B-4037-2015","Ahmad, Abd Rahman/0000-0001-9493-8224; Kim-Soon, Ng/0000-0001-6247-9561",,,,,35,6,6,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1001,1011,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300103,0

The most important push and pull factors which may influence people in movements include environmental, political, economic and cultural factors. Culture is a complex system of behavior, traditions, beliefs, values and artifacts, which is transmitted through generations. It represents a group or community who shares common experiences. Cultural diversity involves the cultural differences that exist among people and the way communities organize themselves, their understanding of morality and religion. It is also called multiculturalism. With the accession to the European Union, Croatia faces an interesting set of migration challenges and opportunities. The increase of migration leads to a greater diversity of the population. As people move, their cultural characteristics and ideas spread along with them, creating and changing cultural diversity.

Even after controlling for diverse influences, using both ordinary least square and multilevel regression models, this gradient of governance remains significant, imposing a dual penalty.

Thus, this paper mainly focused on whether there are bubbles in excessive urban house selling prices in China, which followed two step analyses. I utilized two unit root tests (Breitung test and Fisher-type test) to find out whether the series of residential house selling prices was stationary in first step. If the tests confirm that the series of residential house selling prices is non-stationary, it implies that there are bubbles in the house prices in cities. In the second step, I considered construction costs as one of my analyses variables normally neglected in the literature about discussion of bubbles of Chinese housing market. Using fix effects regression, random effects regression and AMG methods, I analysed the relationship between residential house selling prices and a set of variables (incomes, populations and construction costs), and further confirmed that there are bubbles in excessive urban residential house prices in China.","[Kuang, Rui-hu] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Kuang, Ju-chi] Foshan Univ, Foshan 528000, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of New South Wales Sydney; Foshan University,"Kuang, RH (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",r.kuang@student.unsw.edu.au; kjc2277@163.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-188-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,207,214,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3SZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351923900035,0

These countries are selected as they experience drastic switch in their exchange rate regime from rigid to flexible regime after the 1997 financial crisis. In particular, our main objective is to investigate the above matter by comparing the results of pre-inflation targeting (IT) and post-IT periods in addition to reveal macroeconomic factors that determine the relationship. For the purpose of analyses, a wide range of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, GARCH-type models and vector autoregressive (VAR) model are applied. Our results reveal significant bi-directional relationship between volatility of exchange rate and stock return in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand. Furthermore, the results shows that interest rate, money supply, international reserves, lagged volatility of exchange rate and lagged stock return volatility have the potentials of causing significant changes in volatility of exchange rate and stock return volatility in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand. In general, the adoption of inflation targeting leads to different significant impacts across the four countries. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The risk of tsunami is ever-present for these small communities, as well as an extreme marginality, the incertitude of fishing, a depletion of hydro-biological resources and so forth. The question hence arises whether it is still possible for these communities to live on the edge and live off the resources of the sea. If a caleta cannot cope resisting in the face of an unforeseeable tsunami, reconstruction would then seem as an opportunity to set new strategies that can guarantee community resilience. The caleta is hence enabled to easily regenerate itself and its productivity. The aim is to develop a strategy of resilience through an architectural project in the village of Curanipe: new scenarios for fishing occupations, together with the development of sport facilities and local trade, will here constitute a new settlement model for the coast.

Among economies, in which the improvement of human capital may contribute to acceleration of economic development are undoubtedly the European countries in transition, as in these countries the collapse of communism enabled migration of human capital and therefore on the one hand contributed to inflow of new knowledge, but on the other to outflow of talented, well-educated people. The new conditions of market economy also enforced the necessity of increase of society's knowledge, as well as effectiveness and innovativeness of enterprises. Particularly interesting research problem is the case of economy of Poland, the country where the events that led to destruction of the Iron Curtain started. The paper aims to present the evolution of human capital since the collapse of communism in Poland. In order to achieve this aim we analyse the level of human capital, measured by the factors most influencing the innovation process i.e., the educational attainment, number of students, and human resources in R&D. Additionally, in order to assess the relevance of human capital for economic development, the paper examines its impact on innovativeness of Polish economy, measured with the number of patents applications to the EPO. The analysis is based on the statistical data provided by The Central Statistical Office of Poland and Eurostat and covers the period 1990-2012. The results of conducted analysis indicate that the transformation of Poland's economic system and new conditions of market economy, especially competition and unemployment, have strengthened the incentives for human capital investment and development. In particular, the transition to market-based economy resulted in positive changes in the educational attainment. The improvement of human capital since the collapse of communism, especially the increase of the share of population with tertiary education attainment, proved to be a significant driver of innovativeness of Polish economy.","[Matras-Bolibok, Anna] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Econ & Management, Lublin, Poland; [Bolibok, Piotr] John Paul II Catholic Univ Lublin, Dept Banking, Lublin, Poland",University of Life Sciences in Lublin; Catholic University of Lublin,"Matras-Bolibok, A (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Econ & Management, Lublin, Poland.",anna.matras@up.lublin.pl; piotr.bolibok@kul.pl,"Bolibok, Piotr Marek/ABC-6834-2021; Bolibok, Piotr/ABC-6842-2021; Matras-Bolibok, Anna/ABG-9608-2021","Bolibok, Piotr Marek/0000-0002-5649-181X; Bolibok, Piotr/0000-0002-5649-181X;",,,,,26,1,1,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,126,134,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000016,0

Not only do the cultural bases of the individuals and the cultures of the organizations change, but the organizations also evolve through modification and innovation of their structures, processes and output, in the attempt to loosen the old restraints while setting new objectives and rewriting the programmes for their achievement. Innovating for change represents the natural approach for dealing with such a dynamic environment made of individuals, social systems and organizations. This paper addresses the endogenous underpinnings of innovation, studying organizational routines as they account for a large share of organizational work and as such provide a relevant source for stability and change. Major stream of literature, while applying a practice perspective, focus on the internal dynamic of one organizational routine. It is argued that routines are conceived as constituted of an ostensive and a performativedimension whose mutual constitutive influence is a source of stability andchange, giving rise to variation (innovation from the inner part) or selective retention of the organizational routine. This paper aims to extend the available existing theory, embracing a typical systemic approach, and proposes that innovation involves accounts for stability and change of an organization, as made of more than the sum of the single organizational internal dynamics of routines. Particularly, the paper develops the idea of systems of organizational interconnected routines in order to explore how the participation of the same actor and/or action in the iteration of more than one organizational routine determines an interconnection, and dynamisms, among the respective organizational routines. The provided analysis reveals that actors inside organizations engage in continuous performance (action) and interpretation of actions. We discuss the propagation of an internal dynamic generated in one organizational routine into the iteration of another, interconnected organizational routine. The results highlight the importance of understanding the interconnection of organizational routines for studying and explaining endogenous sources of innovation in organizations. Overall the paper not only intends to create awareness for the explanatory potential involved in the idea of extending the theory of organizational routines from focusing on one organizational routine to considering whole systems of interconnected organizational routines and particularly the dynamics therein, but also to generate novelty in the field of innovation and change management.

This qualitative study incorporating an open-ended questionnaire included 20 non-user participants in Malaysia. The study was outlined by a Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) approach to examine the hypothetical pathway between beliefs and intentions to use TCM within the context of minor and major medical treatments. The study sample for the qualitative study was chosen by purposive sampling. Research participants for the current study were recruited based on having knowledge about TCM, never seeking treatment from TCM professionals, and being above 18 years of age. Data analysis was undertaken using a Framework Approach and was informed by TPB. All participants were aware of the benefits or advantages of TCM. However the, majority reported seeking TCM merely for treatment of an acute problem whenever the modern treatment failed to heal the disease. Participants reported a wide range of barriers to TCM including both internal (psychology) and external (environment and time). The study participants also lacked support and advice from family members to use TCM. A focus on the effectiveness of TCM to encourage utilization of TCM for treatment of illness should be accompanied by consistent information about the positive effects of TCM for non-users. More research is required on how to overcome the barriers and to understand why positive attitude does not guarantee positive intention. Prioritization of positive images and identities of TCM as contributing factors to attitude may encourage positive intention to use TCM. Involvement of positive coverage from the media comprises one possible approach to improve attitudes about utilization of TCM.","[Omar, Ummi Hana] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Kota Baharu, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Putit, Lennora] Univ Teknol MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Kelantan; Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Omar, UH (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Kota Baharu, Kelantan, Malaysia.",ummihana@umk.edu.my; lennora633@salam.uitm.edu.my,"PUTIT, LENNORA/GRO-6096-2022; PUTIT, LENNORA/AAM-2150-2020","PUTIT, LENNORA/0000-0001-7910-6569",,,,,24,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1740,1752,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300174,0

In Europe the family business sector is dominated by particularly micro enterprises with less than 10 employees and SMEs. Across Europe around 70-80% of all enterprises are family businesses. The current financial crisis has influenced negatively the majority of business activities and many family businesses found themselves in a new turbulent financial environment where uncertainty dominates and the market characteristics are radically reversed. This paper recoatizes the importance of family businesses in both the Finnish and the Greek economy and the need for in-depth research about the dynamics of family businesses, the difficulties they face (strategy, succession, internal conflicts etc.) and factors influencing their survival (endurance) and sustainability. Despite the differences in economic structure and culture both Finland and Greece are small countries in the outskirts of Europe with a high percentage of family businesses. Finland counts on a highly industrialized manufacturing sector and is one of the economically and politically most stable countries in the world, whilst Greece relies on the service sector and in particular on tourism. Currently a cross-cultural study between Greece and Finland is undertaken. It includes an extensive literature review for deeper understanding of the research variables. In addition it incorporates a qualitative and quantitative research methodology. This paper describes mainly the results of a qualitative study carried out in 60 family businesses in the North-western part of Thessaloniki, Greece. The aims of the study were to record the new conditions that prevail concerning business operations in family businesses. The main findings from our study show that family businesses can combine sentiments with business dexterity and create unique dynamics towards business decisions. The financial crisis can be perceived as pushed opportunity' in many functional areas of the business for reformation towards business sustainability and the creation of competitive advantage. It converts into a cause of reorganization of business plans and helps the company to adopt more formal management procedures for decision making. The combination of emotion with entrepreneurship also brings family members around a common goal of survival and due to the two separate systems of family and business resulting in a dynamic growth in the middle of the crisis. The adoption of a lean and flexible budget is an important parameter in responding to the financial crisis. Family firms have the advantage of being motivated and supported by all family members who are involved in the family business (e.g. willingness to work long days under difficult conditions with limitedly rewards), while in non-family businesses such commitment is more difficult to obtain. Other incentives for surviving the financial crisis can be contributed to the considerable consequence that a failure of a family business may have on the leader; there is a high risk regarding the family property, negative publicity of the family's name, and the sense of cancellation of the family's legacy. Managers of a non-family business do not encounter such pressures. (C) 2014 The Authors.

As a result, two methodological strands in economics discord with each other: objectivistic (naturalistic) approach refuses the role of motivations in human behavior, adopting methods of natural science; subjectivistic (interpretative) approach, on the other hand, takes the teleological structure of human action as its corner stone. It is argued that position of the latter (esp. rational choice theory) has been undermined because it builds upon primitive version of human teleological structure. The paper shows that phenomenology offers a promising solution. Phenomenology identifies typical, invariant structures of human action and social world, with various degrees of their anonymity. If economic approach is founded on those structures adequately, then both rational choice theory and bounded rationality theories become compatible, as they differ in their degrees of anonymity only; they both belong to the body of (subjectivistic) economic approach to human behavior.","Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Svoboda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Winston Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",miroslav.svoboda@vse.cz,"Svoboda, Miroslav/AAE-5534-2020",,,,,,24,1,1,1,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

However, less attention is given to the actual image of self-employed. A positive or negative image may contribute to what extent people associate themselves to self-employment. The goal of this paper is to determine the mirror image of Dutch speaking self-employed in Belgium. The image is expressed as personality traits from the Big Five personality trait framework. A quantitative online survey utilizing a five point Likert scale was applied as a methodology to gather the required ratings on various lower-level personality traits. In total 775 Dutch speaking self-employed business owners in Belgium filled out the questionnaire. This data was collected through the Socratos survey system from iVox utilizing the member database of Zenito, a Belgian non-profit service organization aimed at self-employed business owners. The ratings for each personality trait were expressed as a weighted arithmetic mean and expressed as their distance to the mean to determine a positive or negative tendency to the respective trait. These were then attributed to their respective dimension of the Big Five personality trait framework and averaged out to determine which higher-level trait was the most dominant. The main findings of the paper indicate that self-employed assume to be seen as conscientious (distance to the mean 0.55); however, assume not to be seen as agreeable (distance to the mean -0.24).

The runs test and Durbin-Watson values generally did not reject the null of randomness while the unit root tests rejected the null of a unit root in the series.

Only well-prepared projects on national, regional and local level, involvement of potential beneficiaries of European projects in early phases into the programming and planning process of strategic documents based on bottom-up approach and larger investment of budget means through well-elaborated plan of development programs will be vital for successful use of structural and investment funds in new EU financial perspective 2014-2020. As the space for the increase of absorption of capacity of EU means existed even in the pre-accession period, the need for additional improvement of capacities of Croatian stakeholders for realization of financing their projects from EU funds grew significantly with new and more abundant funds. Therefore, one of the most important priorities of Croatian society as a whole is to focus their strengths to making and implementing of high-grade projects that will compete for co-financing from EU funds, equally with projects from other member states. In order to make the Republic of Croatia more competitive in using structural instruments of cohesion policy it is necessary to involve relevant institutions into the process of preparation of strategic documents in the next period, and especially the present and future beneficiaries of the means to include and identify all needs and development priorities of the Republic of Croatia. Those that implement the projects know exactly which investments should be supported. With this kind of bottom-up partnership approach the prioritising of strategic references of future Operational programs and Partnership agreement would be made much easier, and based on that the member states use EU funds. If this should not be the case with the Republic of Croatia as a new member state, the priorities of financing will be general and not sufficiently adjusted to real needs of those that will implement the projects on field, and that will negatively reflect development results we wish to accomplish in the future financial perspective. It is important not to neglect financial aspect of the projects, i.e. to ensure enough means for their pre-financing and co-financing, in order to implement the projects until the end. In major infrastructural projects it is more important to ensure financial sustainability after the end of a project and European financing.","[Zalac, Gabrijela] Dept Int Cooperat & EU Affairs, Osijek, Vukovar Srijem, Croatia; [Banozic, Mario] City Vinkovci, Dept Tourism & Culture, Vinkovci, Croatia",,,gabrijela.zalac@vk.t-com.hr; mario.banozic@vk.t-com.hr,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,379,388,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000028,0

We show that welfare maximization is equivalent to stabilization of four goals: inflation, output gap, the consumption gap between borrowers and savers, and a housing gap that measures the distortion in the distribution of the collateralizable asset between both groups. Collateral constraints create a trade-off between stabilization goals. Following both productivity and financial shocks, and relative to strict inflation targeting, the optimal policy implies sharper movements in the policy rate, aimed primarily at reducing fluctuations in asset prices and hence in borrowers' net worth. The policy trade-offs become amplified as banking competition increases, due to the fall in lending spreads and the resulting increase in borrowers' leverage.","[Andres, Javier] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Arce, Oscar] Banco Espana, Dept Econ Anal & Forecasting, Macroecon Anal & Forecasting Div, Madrid, Spain; [Thomas, Carlos] Banco Espana, Dept Econ Anal & Forecasting, Madrid, Spain",University of Valencia; Banco de Espana; Banco de Espana,"Andrés, J (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Econ, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",javier.andres@uv.es; o.arce@bde.es; carlos.thomas@bde.es,"Andres, Javier/K-7793-2014","Andres, Javier/0000-0003-0980-4833",,,,,45,33,37,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Building on this idea, we propose the use of a highly flexible and tractable model to forecast the volatility of an international equity portfolio. According to the risk management strategy proposed, portfolio risk is seen as a specific combination of daily realized variances and covariances extracted from a high frequency dataset, which includes equities and currencies. In this framework, we focus on the risk spillovers across equities within the same sector (sector spillover), and from currencies to international equities (currency spillover). We compare these specific risk spillovers to a more general framework (full spillover) whereby we allow for lagged dependence across all variances and covariances. The forecasting analysis shows that considering only sector- and currency-risk spillovers, rather than full spillovers, improves performance, both in economic and statistical terms.

To test our model predictions, we first draw on the results of Fochmann et al. (2013) and show that tax misperceptions are lower with a higher tax rate. Second, we conduct a framed field experiment with 118 employees (no students) as subjects and a tax levied on the subjects' income from working in a real-effort experiment. In four treatments employing a direct and an indirect progressive tax scale, we show that a higher tax salience and tax experience level lead to lower tax misperception.

However, a credit scoring model which can reflect changes in firms after a loan has been granted has not yet been developed. In the study reported here, we propose a behavioral credit scoring model that reflects the debt-paying ability of recipient firms, which is observed as a time series of financial ratios of firms via the relationship banking activities. We utilize this time series, as well as missing patterns of financial information, as additional predictors of loan defaults. We compare our proposed behavioral credit scoring models, fitted at different points of elapsed time, to the application credit scoring model.

We find that institutional investors play a central role in the bid process and can protect minority shareholders from being frozen out in the bid. Specifically, tender offers are less likely to succeed when a firm has institutional investors in its ownership structure. When public-to-private offers are accepted, bid premiums are significantly greater if a financial institution (particularly when it is foreign, independent or activist) has a stake in the firm. We explore the effect of a number of hitherto unexplored factors on the takeover premium and find that shareholder agreements facilitate public-to-private acquisitions. Other factors, such as a threat to merge the target if the bid fails, or external validation of the offer price, have no impact on either the likelihood of delisting or the premium paid by the bidder.

To frame the discussion, the author relies on an analysis that emphasizes two possible long-run steady states for the economy: one that is consistent with monetary policy as it has typically been implemented in the United States in recent years and one that is consistent with the low nominal interest rate, deflationary regime observed in Japan during the same period. The data considered seem to be quite consistent with the two steady-state possibilities. The author describes and critiques seven stories that are told in monetary policy circles regarding this analysis and emphasizes two main conclusions: (i) The Federal Open Market Committee's extended period language may be increasing the probability of a Japanese-style outcome for the United States and (ii), on balance, the U.S. quantitative easing program offers the best tool to avoid such an outcome.","Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Bullard, L (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,4,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

In order to avoid the pitfalls of empirically analyzing actual choices made by regulated entities, e.g., measuring entities' beliefs regarding the likelihood and size of future penalties, our study examines behavior associated with a stated choice scenario presented within a survey distributed to the environmental managers of facilities regulated under the US Clean Water Act. This choice of respondents strengthens the external validity of our empirical results. Based on a variety of statistical methods, our empirical results strongly and robustly reject the standard hypothesis that specific deterrence stems solely from upward revisions to punishment parameters while supporting the alternative hypothesis of experiential deterrence, whereby facilities focus on recent experiences to shape their compliance behavior.","[Earnhart, Dietrich] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Friesen, Lana] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Kansas; University of Queensland,"Earnhart, D (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, 435 Snow Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",earnhart@ku.edu; l.friesen@economics.uq.edu.au,"Friesen, Lana/U-2046-2017","Friesen, Lana/0000-0003-0386-4157",,,,,37,15,17,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The mutual fund industry in particular, sole- and team-managed balanced funds-provides an ideal setting to test the specialization versus coordination trade-off, as information on decision structures and fund actions is easily obtained. We show that sole-managed balanced funds, with centralized decision rights, exhibit significant market timing that requires reallocation across asset classes. However, consistent with coordination difficulties between managers specializing in particular asset classes, no market timing is evident in team-managed balanced funds. Team-managed funds exhibit greater returns from specialization, in the form of better security selection performance than sole-managed funds. These results hold cross-sectionally and for funds that switch management structures. The overall returns across different management structures are similar, indicating a market equilibrium. Investor flows reward market-timing performance for sole- but not team-managed funds. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We systematically vary the shape and location of the distribution of climate change damages using the stochastic version of the applied game-theoretical STACO model. Our aim is to identify how changes to the distributional form affect the stability of coalitions and their performance. We find that fatter upper tails increase the likelihood that more ambitious coalitions are stable as well as the performance of these stable coalitions.

J,"Bowring, J",,,,"Bowring, Joseph",,,Capacity Markets in PJM,ECONOMICS OF ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Capacity Market; PJM Interconnection; RPM; Minimum Offer Price Rule,,"The PJM capacity market evolved from a mechanism to support fair and efficient retail competition, to a core market design component implemented to provide adequate revenue to attract sufficient supply and demand side resources to meet PJM's administrative reliability criteria. The lessons learned in the evolution of the PJM capacity market illustrate issues that are shared across all wholesale power markets. An exogenously imposed administrative reliability requirement has generally been interpreted to require the ownership of or contracts for capacity in excess of expected peak loads by a reserve margin. In PJM, the reserve margin requirement resulted in a level of capacity greater than would have been the result of the operation of an energy only market without such a requirement. The result was lower energy prices for all units and a shortfall of net revenues compared to the annualized costs of building a new generating unit. The early wholesale power market designs, including PJM, replicated the efficient dispatch of a tight power pool, but did not address the sources of revenues to cover the costs of investment in new and existing generating capacity and thus did not address the endogenous sustainability of the market design consistent with administrative reliability criteria. The introduction and redesign of a capacity market has largely solved this resource adequacy problem. But the PJM capacity market design continues to be imperfect and the resolution of the remaining design issues is critical to the continued success of the PJM market as demand increases and generating units retire.","Monitoring Analyt LLC, Eagleville, PA 19403 USA",,"Bowring, J (通讯作者)，Monitoring Analyt LLC, 2621 Van Buren Ave,Suite 160, Eagleville, PA 19403 USA.",Joseph.Bowring@monitoringanalytics.com,,,,,,,14,34,38,3,25,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

In particular, the correlation between the iTraxx Financials and Non-Financials sub-indexes is estimated from options on the iTraxx Main Index, which is considered as a basket option with the two sub-indexes being its underlyings. The abrupt changes of the realized correlation anticipated information of the corresponding option prices. The sovereign default risk, funding liquidity risk, level of risk aversion, and equity market performance are identified to be significant determinants of the option-implied correlation, implying interdependence amongst various markets during the European debt crisis.

The different phases of this modeling process highlight two functions of transparency. First, transparency acts indirectly on the incentives the central bank faces and thereby impinges on the inflation bias. Second, and mostly, by exerting a direct influence on private agents expectations, a transparent central bank is able to manage private expectations in order to achieve a better stabilization of both inflation and economic activity. To that respect, the assumption of perfect information has been first removed to assess how the central bank's information may acts as a coordination device of agents' expectations. The assumption of rational expectations has been then released to demonstrate how a public inflation target may make the expectation formation of agents easier. The argument also refers to empirical evidence.","Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, GREThA, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Salle, I (通讯作者)，Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, GREThA, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",isabelle.salle@u-bordeaux4.fr,"Salle, Isabelle/GOP-1243-2022",,,,,,136,1,1,0,22,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

J,"Wing, C; Cook, TD",,,,"Wing, Coady; Cook, Thomas D.",,,STRENGTHENING THE REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGN USING ADDITIONAL DESIGN ELEMENTS: A WITHIN-STUDY COMPARISON,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,REDUCTION; SELECTION; CASH,"The sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD) has three key weaknesses compared to the randomized clinical trial (RCT). It has lower statistical power, it is more dependent on statistical modeling assumptions, and its treatment effect estimates are limited to the narrow subpopulation of cases immediately around the cutoff, which is rarely of direct scientific or policy interest. This paper examines how adding an untreated comparison to the basic RDD structure can mitigate these three problems. In the example we present, pretest observations on the posttest outcome measure are used to form a comparison RDD function. To assess its performance as a supplement to the basic RDD, we designed a within-study comparison that compares causal estimates and their standard errors for (1) the basic posttest-only RDD, (2) a pretest-supplemented RDD, and (3) an RCT chosen to serve as the causal benchmark. The two RDD designs are constructed from the RCT, and all analyses are replicated with three different assignment cutoffs in three American states. The results show that adding the pretest makes functional form assumptions more transparent. It also produces causal estimates that are more precise than in the posttest-only RDD, but that are nonetheless larger than in the RCT. Neither RDD version shows much bias at the cutoff, and the pretest-supplemented RDD produces causal effects in the region beyond the cutoff that are very similar to the RCT estimates for that same region. Thus, the pretest-supplemented RDD improves on the standard RDD in multiple ways that bring causal estimates and their standard errors closer to those of an RCT, not just at the cutoff, but also away from it.","[Wing, Coady] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Cook, Thomas D.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Northwestern University,,,,,Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1228866] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),,,29,58,72,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

The findings illustrate the need to understand water's role in production (industrial, agricultural, and household) and the way changes in unit costs of other inputs (particularly energy and capital) influence innovation.

On average, economic development results in an overall substitution from the use of biomass to energy sourced from fossil fuels, and then increasingly towards nuclear power and certain low-carbon modern renewables such as wind power. The process results in the carbon intensity of energy evolving in an inverse-U manner as per capita incomes increase. Fossil fuel-poor countries climb more quickly to the low-carbon upper rungs of the national-level energy ladder and so typically experience larger reductions in the carbon intensity of energy as they develop. Leapfrogging to low-carbon energy sources on the upper rungs of the national-level energy ladder is one route via which developing countries can reduce the magnitudes of their expected upswings in carbon dioxide emissions.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Burke, PJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",paul.j.burke@anu.edu.au,"Burke, Paul/G-3757-2010","Burke, Paul/0000-0003-2715-2672",,,,,42,46,49,4,60,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Our analysis assumes that investors have no short-sales constraints and a utility function characterized by the minimization of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We examine the efficient frontiers produced by each model and focus on comparing two methods for incorporating scalable asymmetric dependence structures across asset returns using the Archimedean Clayton copula in an out-of-sample, long-run multi-period setting. For portfolios of higher dimensions, we find that modeling asymmetries within the rnarginals and the dependence structure with the Clayton canonical vine copula (CVC) consistently produces the highest-ranked outcomes across a range of statistical and economic metrics when compared to other models incorporating elliptical or symmetric dependence structures. Accordingly, we conclude that CVC copulas are 'worth it' when managing larger portfolios. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We split the returns from the net foreign holdings as receipts (inflows) and payments (outflows) to investigate which of the two sides exhibited the greater resilience for income risk-sharing during the recent crisis. First, we find that debt delivered better risk-sharing than equity, mainly reflecting the deficit deterioration in EMU countries during the post-crisis period. FDI, by contrast, did not correspond to noticeable risk diversification. Second, separating output shocks into positive and negative components reveals that debt holding receipts (equity liability payments) performed better under negative (positive) realizations of the shock variable. Third, the unwinding of capital flows resulted in a sharp fall in income dis-smoothing via the debt liability channel in the new EU countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis, based on 179 study participants, uses socio-demographic information, likert-scale questions about the social environment, and time spent walking for transport as recorded in a 7-day time-use diary. A series of linear regression models examine how components of the social environment (companionship, encouragement, role models, neighborhood social cohesion) influence time spent walking while controlling for individual and physical environments.

Contestants compete in an early round and can use the experience gained to reduce effort cost in a subsequent contest. A contest designer can decide how much of the prize mass to distribute in the early contest and how much to leave for the later one in order to maximize total efforts. We show how this division affects effort at each stage, and present conditions that characterize the optimal split. There is a trade off here, since a large early prize increases first period efforts leading to a substantial reduction in second round effort cost; on the other hand, there is less of the prize mass to fight over in the second round, reducing effort at that stage. The results are indicative of the fact that the designer often prefers to leave most of the prize mass for the second contest to reap the gains from the learning by doing effect.","[Clark, Derek J.] Univ Tromso, Sch Business, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Nilssen, Tore] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of Oslo,"Clark, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Tromso, Sch Business, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",derek.clark@uit.no; tore.nilssen@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,39,18,22,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2013,156.0,1-2,,,,,329,343,,10.1007/s11127-011-9905-9,0.0,,,15,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,164WW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320443600019,0

This study makes an additional assumption that children's mode to school and household adults' travel mode to work are interrelated because of a lifestyle choice made by parents and caregivers. With this assumption, Heckman probit models were used with data from the 2009 US National Household Travel Survey to predict household adults' travel mode to work and children's travel mode to school jointly. It found strong evidence that household adults' decision to drive to work significantly increases the probability of children being dropped off at school and decreases their likelihood of walking and bicycling, but not vice versa. As adults' mode choice is more fundamental in the household decision-making process, the study suggests that children's mode choice studies should not ignore how parents or caregivers travel to work.

Homophily based on age and gender increase the chances of the outsider appointments. Similar educational backgrounds, in contrast, reduce the chance that the appointee is an outsider. Greater social ties also increase the probability of an outside appointment. Results from a duration model show that larger age differences shorten tenure significantly, whereas gender similarities barely affect tenure. Differences in educational backgrounds affect tenure differently across the banking sectors. Maintaining more contacts to the executive board reduces tenure.

This underperformance is partially erased when the returns are adjusted to consider the issuers' high level of investment, and to include the discount granted to private investors. We split the sample by the glamour/value dimension and by the firms' investment activity. Only glamour firms with high investment activity underperform in the long run.

This paper presents findings from in-depth interviews that sought to understand the circumstances and factors that influenced people to start, stop or significantly change their amount of cycling. The interviews were held with residents of 12 towns and cities in England that were experiencing an unprecedented scale of investment in cycling by UK standards. The interviews collected biographical information on travel behaviour life circumstances and probed the reasons for changes in cycling. Theory and preliminary analysis were used to develop a conceptual model which posits that turning points in cycling behaviour are triggered by contextual change and mediated by intrinsic motivations, facilitating conditions and personal history. It is shown that life events were usually the trigger for a change in cycling but external changes to the bicycle environment played a facilitating role in enabling change. The types of life events that were relevant varied over the age span of participants. Practitioners can take advantage of the life events identified as opportunities to promote cycling.

Given the data sample at our disposal of slightly less than 1000 paired data points spread across all Switzerland, we focus on using the most efficient type of repeated-measurement index to evaluate the yearly price development of the rental property market. In the process of building the index, an alternative of the SPAR method (Sale Price Appraisal Ratio) is developed and compared against a structural time series model and the Case-Shiller approach. The newly developed ISPAR (Inverse SPAR) method yields qualitatively similar results to the regression based methodology yet is influenced to. a lesser extent by the sample size. The structural time series model is the version least influenced by the sample size. An interesting finding in our sample is that despite the large time span between successive price measurements, no notable improvement is obtained using the 3SLS method of Case-Shiller instead of the traditional Bailey et al. method.

Unfortunately, the nonlinear portfolio selection formulation using VaR risk measure is in general a computationally intractable optimization problem. We investigate in this paper nonlinear portfolio selection models using approximate parametric Value-at-Risk. More specifically, we use first-order and second-order approximations of VaR for constructing portfolio selection models, and show that the portfolio selection models based on Delta-only, Delta-Gamma-normal and worst-case Delta-Gamma VaR approximations can be reformulated as second-order cone programs, which are polynomially solvable using interior-point methods. Our simulation and empirical results suggest that the model using Delta-Gamma-normal VaR approximation performs the best in terms of a balance between approximation accuracy and computational efficiency.

In the empirical literature, these two variables are often considered independently, although they may have an endogenous relationship in a contractual setting. Using a sample of European M&As over the 2000-2010 decade, we show that these two variables are jointly set in a contractual empirical approach. The relationship between the percentage of cash and the offer premium is positive: higher premiums yield payments with more cash. We highlight that the payment choice is not a continuum between full cash and full share payments. Two different regimes of payment in M&A transactions are empirically characterized. We analyze the major determinants of M&A terms when the offer premium and the means of payment are jointly set. The underlying rationale of an asymmetry of information and a risk-sharing calculus is found to be significant in the setting of the agreement. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The paper introduces heterogeneity of congressional districts into the common agency problem in special interest politics. District heterogeneity implies district-specific electoral constraints on legislators' ability to collect rents from, and cast dissonant votes in support of, special interests. An empirical analysis examines legislative voting on the initial bailout proposal, using campaign contributions to legislators from special interest groups and the importance of financial services for employment within congressional districts as the main explanatory variables. The empirical analysis corrects for possible endogeneity bias, using valid instruments, and considers several intuitive sub-sample estimations as alternative methods for addressing the endogeneity issue.

Our focus on research and development spillovers as a proxy for information leakages to competitors allows an examination of whether or not opacity (low transparency) is employed as a mechanism to attenuate such leakages. We find that when the threat of proprietary information leakage is high, information reported by firms is opaque. This relation appears in regions suffering from weak intellectual property rights protections, but not in those with stronger property rights protections. After taking into account the incentive to protect sensitive information, we also document that firm value is no longer related to accounting transparency. Our focus on accounting opacity to protect proprietary information differs from the agency cost explanation of most prior work. Thus we provide evidence of a cost of enhanced disclosure along with new insights on specific channels through which institutional factors influence the costs and benefits of firm disclosure policies.

This structure potentially protects financial firms during a crisis, when all are performing badly, but during normal times permits a bank performing badly to go bankrupt. I discuss a number of issues associated with the design of a contingent capital claim, including susceptibility to manipulation, whether conversion should be for a fixed dollar amount of shares or a fixed number of shares; uniqueness of the share price when contingent capital is outstanding; the susceptibility of different contingent capital schemes to different kinds of errors (under and over-capitalization); and the losses likely to be incurred by shareholders upon the imposition of a requirement for contingent capital.

The results reveal that a year before and a year after the initiation of the Greek fiscal crisis, the majority of the potential bank M&As under examination were unable to generate short-run operating efficiency gains. In addition, our results for 2011 indicate that the majority of bank M&As can lead to short-run operating efficiency gains.

Unfortunately, there is little research examining the potential moderating effect of firm size or age on the relationship between institutional quality and export performance. In response, we hypothesize that institutional quality will be more important to increasing the export performance of new and small firms compared with their large, established counterparts. We test our hypotheses using data from the World Bank's World Business Environment Survey.

Results based on Euclidean distances are compared to those using network distances, and both allow for strategic spatial interpolation of count values while controlling for each roadway's functional classification, lane count, speed limit, and other site attributes. Both universal kriging and geographically weighted regression (GWR) are found to reduce errors (in practically and statistically significant ways) over non-spatial regression techniques, though errors remain quite high at some sites, particularly those with low counts and/or in less measurement-dense areas. Nearly all tests indicated that the predictive capabilities of kriging exceed those of GWR by average absolute errors of 3-8%. Interestingly, the estimation of kriging parameters by network distances show no enhanced performance over Euclidean distances, which require less data and are much more easily computed.

The portfolio based on representative beliefs of a group of managers investing in similar assets outperforms passive benchmarks, indicating that they reflect informed beliefs. Fund managers who simultaneously arrive at portfolio selections which, in hindsight, are close to those implied by representative beliefs possess ex ante more skill and exhibit future outperformance.

Inadequate clearance of snow and poor gritting of pavements prevent people with even slightly reduced motion capacity from going outdoors, while those who use a walking-stick or a rolling walker are even more vulnerable to the weather. How much does winter weather impact on the activity levels of older people, and what activities are affected? The empirical analysis in this paper is based on results from focus groups of participants carried out in five different communities in Norway and on data from the Norwegian National Travel Survey (NTS) of 2005. The study is concentrated on the daily activities of the groups, especially out-of-home activities, i.e. what these older people do, where their activities take place, with whom they interact, the types of transport mode they use, and the barriers they meet. Winter conditions are mentioned by all groups as one of the barriers they have to contend with. The NTS includes data on transport mode, travel purpose, distance, time-use, date for the interview and socio-demographic data. The results point to lower activity - measured in number of trips taken and kilometres travelled in winter (November-March) compared to summer (April-October) among the older groups. The oldest use the car less in the winter than in the summer, and have fewer trips to the shops and to friends and relatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

While national urbanization levels are not a good indicator of urban transport demand, there is an established negative relationship between urban density and such demand. This paper uses a consistent, well-known population-based framework (the STIRPAT model) and three separate, but highly related, datasets of cities from developed and developing countries (with observations from 1990, 1995, and 2001) to examine the relationship among private transport energy consumption, population, income, urban density, and several variables (e.g., network size and prices) that describe the nature of the public and private transport systems of those cities. The paper confirms the now well-established result that urban density is negatively correlated with urban private transport energy consumption. In terms of policies, improving private vehicle fuel efficiency, in particular, and increasing fuel price as well as other ownership/operating costs for private transport could have a substantial impact on lowering transport energy consumption. On the other hand, there is no evidence that further lowering the cost to riders of public transport would lower private transport energy consumption. For cities in developing countries, demographic variables (population size and urban density) are particularly important in determining private transport energy consumption. Also, private transport energy consumption is considerably less price sensitive in those developing country cities compared to cities in the most developed countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that positive spillovers exist in each period due to the connectivity characteristic of transport infrastructure at the national level. At the regional level, transport infrastructure spillover effects vary considerably over time among China's four macro-regions: the eastern region enjoyed positive spillovers all the time; the northeastern region had no significant spillover effects in 1978-1990, negative spillovers in 1991-2000, and positive spillovers in 2001-2009; the central region had negative spillovers for the three sub-periods; for the western region, negative spillovers can be observed after the 1990s.

Strengthening collective ownership rights improves household welfare as indicated by food consumption, but does not increase monetary income. Income improvements are instead attributable to Nongovernmental organization (NGO) project support. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper simulates the effects on the environment and on the economy of a carbon tax of A$23 per tonne of carbon dioxide proposed by the government with, and without, a compensation policy. We employ a computable general equilibrium model with an environmentally extended Social accounting matrix. According to the simulation results, the carbon tax can cut emissions effectively, but will cause a mild economic contraction. Because the price signal is intact, the proposed compensation plan has little impact on emission cuts while significantly mitigating the negative effect of a carbon tax on the economy.","[Meng, Sam; McNeill, Judith] Univ New England, Inst Rural Futures, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Meng, Sam; Siriwardana, Mahinda] Univ New England, UNE Business Sch, Armidale, NSW, Australia",University of New England; University of New England,"Siriwardana, M (通讯作者)，Univ New England, UNE Business Sch, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",xmeng3@une.edu.au; asiriwar@une.edu.au; jmcneill@une.edu.au,,"Siriwardana, Mahinda/0000-0003-2960-9701; Meng, Sam/0000-0002-3329-5277",,,,,24,115,124,4,133,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Investors can, consequently, diversify natural catastrophe risk by additionally holdings of a market portfolio. However, this does not hold for 9-11.

We find that the cross-country variation in lease duration and building construction is related to the content (common versus civil law) and efficiency (integrity and enforceability) of the legal system in the respective countries. First, we find that countries with a common law system and lower levels of corruption tend to have longer leases. Second, we find that in the United States, high-rise Class A office buildings tend to have tenants with longer term leases, suggesting that the advantages associated with being able to write and enforce a long term lease is particularly important for the development of high-rise office buildings. Finally, we find that there are in fact more high-rise office buildings in countries with more efficient legal systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We examine the effects of the risk return trade-off and the volatility feedback in a model where both the return and its volatility are influenced by news arrivals. Our empirical analysis shows that the two effects have approximately the same size with opposite signs for the daily excess returns of seven major developed markets. For the same data set, we also find that a linear relationship between the expected return and the conditional standard deviation is preferable to polynomial-type nonlinear specifications.

In order to integrate the commercial and economic activities at the supply chain level there is a need of developing tight relationships between the customer and the supplier. Thus, it is justified to approach the supply chain from a strategic perspective and the strategic marketing tools are perfectly applicable on the business-to-business market. Our research, has led us to the conclusion that, especially on business to business markets, organizations focus their marketing activities not only on the relationship with their customers, but on the relationship with their suppliers as well. In the supply chain, companies appear as buyers and as clients for the suppliers of goods, financial resources and of work force. Starting from this, we have developed a quantitative marketing research, interviewing 60 organizations from the business-to-business Romanian market, with the purpose of identifying the way in which companies from the B2b market integrate strategic marketing in their supply-chain.","[Dumitru, Ionel; Caescu, Stefan Claudiu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dumitru, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ionel.dumitru@gmail.com,"Dumitru, Ionel/AFR-7489-2022; Caescu, Stefan Claudiu/C-5519-2014","Dumitru, Ionel/0000-0003-0152-3885;",,,,,27,4,4,0,27,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2013,15.0,33,,,,,116,127,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,087FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314746900009,0

In this kind of world solutions like Supply Chain Management (SCM) are increasingly appearing. The business success depends on how effective the information system works. Any interruption of the information system will inevitably lead to business loss. To ensure the successful implementation of a SCM project it is necessary to study even from the early stages which are the possible actions / risks / obstacles which might damage in one way or another the execution of the project. The role of the literature and case studies review in the field of interest is undeniable because it provides us with access to the so-called lessons-learned. By using this approach, in this paper, we present the most common risks and risk sources encountered in the implementation projects of SCM type information systems. We also propose a risk identification framework that can be used in the early stages of the implementation project of a Supply Chain Management information system.","Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Mazareanu, VP (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",vali.mazareanu@feaa.uaic.ro,,,,,,,52,1,1,0,47,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2013,15.0,33,,,,,128,139,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,087FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314746900010,0

The advantages to holding concurrent portfolios that exploit heterogeneity are well known. The same advantages may be achieved in the serial context through contagion. Our model exploits an observation due to William Feller on the near equivalence of the two, statistically speaking.

The paper's main result is that the endogenous movement in interest rates implied under general equilibrium enhances the effects of competitive storage on commodity prices.

A key mechanism driving this result is a link between the ability of the household to smooth consumption over time and the level of storage in the stochastic equilibrium. Finally, the model is used to examine the macroeconomic effects of biofuel subsidies for ethanol producers.

Using computer simulation three possible strategies to control the jobs waiting in front of the workstation to be processed are compared in this paper - FIFO, priority according to production delay and group scheduling policy. Values obtained from the simulation runs are compared in term of average lead times and deadline achievement.

Finding new market opportunities in that connection can improve the situation of the state, business, and also aged consumers and the whole society. This can contribute to structural changes, higher employment, higher output, new income and profit possibilities. A very important thing to overcome isolation, feeling of exclusion and connected with them deteriorating health state is to run an active life style, for instance in the form of travelling, tourism, sports and wellness programmes. The question is how business is ready to satisfy aged people specific needs connected with those activities. A short survey was done in some hotels in Beskydy region to find to which extent they are able to satisfy needs of aged people. The objective is to show the hotels how such activities can bring them higher and more stabile revenues, and so to reach higher profits.","[Brezinova, Olga] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, FAME, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,olgabrezinova@email.cz,"Brezinova, Olga/E-4395-2012",,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,206,214,,,,,,9,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100021,0

This is a mathematical model designed to represent the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment in a simplified version. Financial modelling is a general term that means different things to different users; the reference usually relates either to accounting and corporate finance applications, or to quantitative finance applications. It is necessary to model the financial assets development in continuous time to derive relations and perform relevant econometric calculations such as data simulation for different financial scenarios. Continuous time is a prerequisite for financial model that simulate changes in prices of financial assets, despite the fact that these prices are observed in discrete time moments. The random process is defined as a set of random variables on the same likelihood level indexed by time values from a set of real time line. Random development in time is often described as a stochastic process. For models in continuous time, the additions are in form of Wiener process, which belongs to Markov processes and represents an essential element of all stochastic processes of financial models.","[Buc, Daniel; Kliestik, Tomas] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,,daniel.buc@fpedas.uniza.sk; tomas.kliestik@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Buc, Daniel/A-8953-2016; Kliestik, Tomas/O-8070-2015","Kliestik, Tomas/0000-0002-3815-5409",,,,,10,66,66,0,11,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,215,224,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100022,0

(1995) and Carr et al. (1998) to price and hedge American knock-in put options under the Black-Scholes model and the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model. We use standard European calls (puts) to construct the SHPs for American up-and-in (down-and-in) puts. We also use theta-matching condition to improve the performance of the SHP approach. Numerical results indicate that the hedging effectiveness of a hi-monthly SHP is far less risky than that of a delta-hedging portfolio with daily rebalance. The numerical accuracy of the proposed method is comparable to the trinomial tree methods of Ritchken (1995) and Boyle and Tian (1999). Furthermore, the recalculation time (the term is explained in Section 1) of the option prices is much easier and quicker than the tree method when the stock price and/or time to maturity are changed.

This paper presented a framework that aims to contribute to a sustainable organizational information security-processes support, based on the ability to describe the allowed business process interactions among cooperative partners; furthermore, the framework presents a cooperative security perspective among partners basis on the idea that, if organizations have business cooperation, they should also have active security cooperation and regulation. If organizations, that need to cooperate, do not feel secure when they interconnect their information systems, the all cooperative perspective can fall down. Trust being one basic need for cooperation, impulse the need of a new security approach for cooperative scenarios.","[Cunha, Carlos R.; Gomes, Joao Pedro; Morais, Elisabete Paulo] Polytech Inst Braganca, Mirandela, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico de Braganca,,crc@ipb.pt; jpgomes@ipb.pt; beta@ipb.pt,"cunha, carlos/AAA-5734-2020; Cunha, Carlos Rompante/H-2678-2014; Paulo Morais, Elisabete/W-1757-2017","Cunha, Carlos Rompante/0000-0003-3085-1562; Paulo Morais, Elisabete/0000-0002-1923-2341; Gomes, Joao/0000-0001-9308-0027",,,,,13,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,902,907,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200088,0

We specify a flexible hedonic land pricing model that allows for non-uniform valuation of land characteristics among buyers. Data on 579 land sale contracts from five districts of the Czech Republic from 2008-2010 are utilised in the study. The results provide strong evidence of buyer-specific valuation of land's productive and site characteristics as well as systemic differences in land market conditions among groups of buyers, both of which affect the land price. Non-agricultural buyers are observed to significantly overbid agricultural buyers on land location and site characteristics rather than productive qualities. Among agricultural buyers, joint stock companies and cooperatives enjoy major land price discounts, while individual private farms and limited liability companies face land market access constraints that are surmountable only through paying high price premiums. These observations have important implications for future land ownership structure and land use efficiency.","[Curtiss, Jarmila; Jelinek, Ladislav] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Hruska, Martin; Medonos, Tomas; Vilhelm, Vaclav] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague, Czech Republic",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Curtiss, J (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Dept Struct Dev Farms & Rural Areas, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",curtiss@iamo.de,"Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Buchenrieder, Gertrud/S-1035-2016","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; Buchenrieder, Gertrud/0000-0003-2995-867X",,,,,31,16,16,0,15,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Different models for an innovation system, as described in literature, were evaluated against findings of empirical studies in literature. Subsequently, a conceptual, descriptive framework for an innovation system model was developed. The participants that play a role in the innovation system were found to include, primarily, the innovative firms that are at the centre of the innovation system due to their importance in the contribution to innovative activities. Innovative firms were found to be operating in a complex matrix of other participants or actors. It was further indicated that the strength of the linkages amongst participants has a positive effect on the innovative performance of the system and so is important for the transfer of finances, knowledge and technology. Although an ideal innovation system does not exist due to the complexity of the system, the conceptual model serves as a point of departure for the evaluation of innovation systems.","[Eggink, Maria] Tshwane Univ Technol, Nelspruit, South Africa",Tshwane University of Technology,,egginkme@tut.ac.za,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,241,251,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100024,0

Did social media cause, the Egyptian revolution? Did Face book and Twitter sparked and accelerated Egypt's revolutionary fire? Was that the sheer speed with which the Egyptian Political regime fell in 18 days, where modern communications technology has had the most potent impact?

The first study explored the specific experiences of young Egyptian Internet users and their interaction through social media during and after the Egyptian protest in 25 January 2011 (El Said, 2013). The results of the two studies suggest differences in the online behavior of Egyptians users in 2011 as they were before that date. The current paper suggests an important effect of social network tools on Egyptian users' communication, empowering, and mobilization.

I argue that individuals are attracted to lottery stocks because they are risk-seeking and sentiment-prone. Because risk preferences are not directly observable, I use a model-free approach based on stochastic dominance to infer aggregate risk preferences. I also use a direct measure of individual investor sentiment, the bull-bear spread, to test whether sentiment affects the returns of lottery stocks. My results show that lottery stock investors are indeed risk seekers. Sentiment also plays an important role in explaining the demand and returns of lottery versus nonlottery stocks.

Their purpose is to increase store traffic and strengthen customer loyalty. It is hypothesized that other marketing tools, like psychological pricing can add to the positive impact of price promotions on sales. Thus, we investigate the joint impact of price promotions and different pricing points on sales. Our empirical analysis shows that just-below prices tend neither to raise sales of regularly priced products nor of price promoted products. The only exception is significant price reductions combined with 99 ending prices (especially of private labels). While our results show no alternatives to regular 9 ending prices, price promotions should rather end in a 99 or be round. Moreover, repdigits (eye-catching price figures) can significantly increase sales of price promoted manufacturers' labels when other cues of price promotions exist. However, German retailers, particularly discount stores, do rarely make use of such combined marketing tools. The results indicate that consumers pay less attention to the size of price reductions than to other cues of price promotions or displays, whereby psychological pricing can intensify the impact of other marketing tools on sales.","[Hoffmann, Angela; Hackelbusch, Kerstin] Univ Kiel, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Hoffmann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Agrarokon, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 6-7, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",angela_hoffmann@gmx.de,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,30,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

We find that the differences are, first. lagged idiosyncratic volatility is a better proxy for expected idiosyncratic risk in the country-level data. Second, idiosyncratic skewness is not a significant factor determining country-level index returns.

The challenges the seed industry is facing are lack of basic seed, poor production infrastructure, lack of skill in seed production, challenges to access and multiply seeds of varieties released from public institutions, lack of purchasing power among smallholder farmers, high transaction cost of seed marketing, market-distorting interventions by governments, lack and misuse of market information, free-riding, lack of working capital financing, and breaching of contract by seed growers. Important policy implications have been drawn from this study, which include strengthening national research systems, strategic capacity building along the maize seed value chain, improving the access to financial services, developing and implementation of agreed protocols of SADC for seed policy harmonization.","[Kassie, G.

Early studies employing return-based timing measures typically provided evidence of limited or no market-timing ability for mutual fund managers in the U.S., the U.K., Australia, among others. On the contrary, recent studies that employ measures based on portfolio holdings, most notably Jiang et al. (2007), have suggested that U.S. mutual fund managers have such ability. In line with this result, we test this evidence in Korean fund market. We think that this is the first study to provide an in-depth analysis of the performance of Korean fund managers by considering a comprehensive sample of fund holdings and using tests based on fund holdings and those based on returns, as in Jiang et al. (2007). Our empirical results indicate that on average, active managers of equity funds have a positive market-timing ability for long forecast horizons These results are consistent with the findings of Jiang et al. (2007). The implications of these empirical results suggest that Korean fund managers utilize market timing to enhance the performance of their actively managed equity funds. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Ratio estimators are commonly used to obtain more efficient estimates for the population mean if the study variable is highly correlated with the auxiliary variable. It is well known that the use of the population information of auxiliary variable x improves the precision of the estimate(s) of the parameter(s). Ratio estimators are based on a sample whose distribution is not considered. However, there are situations in which Poisson distributed population may be appropriate. This paper proposes generalized class of ratio estimators from Poisson distributed population. The mean square error (MSE) equations of proposed estimators are compared in application with usual ratio estimator. By these comparisons, we find that ratio estimators using Poisson distribution characteristics as auxiliary variable information is better than usual ratio estimators. The conditions are also found that proposed estimators are more efficient.

The aim of this paper is to analyze relationships between sport clubs and municipalities/sport federations and discuss economic consequences of these relations for the efficiency of public resources allocation. These relationships are important for the evaluation of the system of sport support. Both public authorities and sport unions are partners for sport clubs in the area of financial and non-financial support. We gathered data from sport clubs and performed an analysis especially for three selected sport branches (athletics, basketball, karate). We discovered a significant failure in the relationship between sport clubs and their own sport federations.

Short-term programmatic efforts to build administrative capability in these countries are thus unlikely to be able to demonstrate actual success, yet billions of dollars continue to be spent on such activities. What techniques enable states to buy time' to enable reforms to work, to mask non-accomplishment, or actively to resist or deflect the internal and external pressures for improvement? How do donor and recipient countries manage to engage in the logics of development' for so long and yet consistently acquire so little administrative capability? We document two such techniques: (a) systemic isomorphic mimicry, wherein the outward forms (appearances, structures) of functional states and organisations elsewhere are adopted to camouflage a persistent lack of function; and (b) premature load bearing, in which indigenous learning, the legitimacy of change and the support of key political constituencies are undercut by the routine placement of highly unrealistic expectations on fledging systems.

This has resulted into growing demand for business schools to incorporate these skills in future graduates (Smith, Hart and Jo McCloskey, 1994; Pesonen, 2003; Demoss and Nicholson, 2005). As a primary response to these demands, sustainability related topics were incorporated in the curriculum (Bridges and Wilhelm, 2008). The efforts to incorporate sustainability vary from inclusion of sustainability in full degree program to including sustainability issues as one of the topic in some courses (Holt, 2003; Amran et al, 2010; Rusinko, 2010). Marketing curriculum was identified to play pivot role in this process (Bonn and Metcalf, 2010; Wilhelm, 2008). However, these efforts still fall short in equipping students with strategic and tactical skills in the area of sustainability (Wilhelm, 2008). Moreover, there is little clarity about the range of activities and the way to incorporate these themes in marketing curriculum (Bonin and Metcalf, 2010). Literature indicates that decision about these issues often depends on strategic focus of business schools and on the context. This paper examines the literature in the area of sustainability in higher education, and management education. This paper also attempts to explore sustainability issues in management and marketing education to find emerging pertinent research questions for further exploration.

It regards mostly the creative communities and urban economics & policies. The paper is aimed at describing the state of creative communities & creative cities in Romania. City-regions and urban policies need a more relational understanding about internal and external dynamics. Hence there is a need for a relational, constructivist understanding of space. E.g. cross-border regions: cannot be taken for granted, outcome of a process of social construction. Furthermore, in the case of remote and sparsely populated areas triple and quadruple helix partnerships may play a key role in mobilizing the local resources and connecting different networks in a productive manner for regional development allowing for sustainable development (Aldea-Partanen. A., 2011). One of the main challenges for the creative communities and for the creative industry sector is how to encourage a long-term and sustainable development of the new type of innovative and creative businesses, mostly within creative cities and creative communities. Quality of life, atmosphere, culture and heritage increasingly determine the competitiveness of metropolitan areas. There is difficult to identifying creative workers, called by Richard Florida as creative class (Florida, 2004) due to their diversity (understood in a complex sense, in terms of cultural diversity that is more relevant for creative communities than ethnic, religion or other way to look traditionally for diversity). The topics of urban economics and especially ones dedicated to creative communities are more and more relevant to the policy development not only on the regional (mezzo) level but also at the microeconomics and macroeconomic levels. This paper will focus on the regional level, highlighting the importance of urban economics for an emergent country like Romania.","[Suciu, Christina] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Suciu, Nicolae] Bucharest Politech Univ, Bucharest, Romania; [Schawlowski, Dan-Michael] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Suciu, C (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",suciu31@gmail.com; nsuciu07@yahoo.com; d.schawlowski@gmaiI.com,,,,,,,54,5,6,0,22,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1595,+,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100169,0

Dynamic correlations and VAR-based spillover index results suggest significant return co-movements and volatility spillovers, however, their extend is, on average, lower in the post-euro period. Co-movements and spillovers are positively associated with extreme episodes and US dollar appreciations. The euro (Deutsche mark) is the dominant net transmitter of volatility, while the British pound the dominant net receiver of volatility in both periods. Nevertheless, cross-market volatility spillovers are bidirectional, and the highest spillovers occur between European markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

High-frequency log-returns feature important kurtosis (fat tails) and volatility clustering (extreme log-returns appear in clusters) that VaR models should take into account. We propose a marked point process model for the excesses of the time series over a high threshold that combines Hawkes processes for the exceedances with a generalized Pareto distribution model for the marks (exceedance sizes). The conditional approach features intraday clustering of extremes and is used to calculate instantaneous conditional VaR. The models are backtested on real data and compared to a competitor approach that proposes a nonparametric extension of the classical peaks-over-threshold method. Maximum likelihood estimation is computationally intensive; we use a differential evolution genetic algorithm to find adequate starting values for the optimization process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis focuses on the manufacturing sector of Belgium, using data for 82 NACE 3-digit industries, over the time span 1996-2002. I find that real exchange rate changes do have a significant impact on job flows, and that this impact is magnified by increasing levels of trade exposure. In particular, a real appreciation is found to lower net employment growth through higher job destruction, while job creation is not significantly affected. These results are in line with previous empirical evidence on the United States, and differ from earlier findings for France and Germany, where the adjustment to real exchange rate shocks has been found to occur mainly through the job creation margin. I suggest that these differences may be explained by the fact that Belgium is a small open economy.","Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Colantone, I (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",colantone@ese.eur.nl,,"COLANTONE, ITALO/0000-0001-7609-6131",,,,,40,6,8,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We find that the size of capital flows is positively correlated with country's income level. In addition, capital flight has a non-linear relationship with the income level. Using the Hansen threshold estimation, we identify a three-stage threshold effect: for low-income countries (GDP per capita below US$ 3,000), capital flight increases as the income level rises; and only after the economy passes a threshold level (GDP per capita above US$ 5,000), capital flight declines with income. We conclude with a case study of Brazil and Korea, observing that the decisions to implement capital control measures tend to be pushed around by the feedbacks among economic growth, currency appreciation, and the global financial conditions.

Relative agricultural income exerts a significant negative effect on intersectoral labor mobility in the long run. Deforestation is influenced positively by population pressure, the price of fertilizer and rainfall, whereas access to irrigation infrastructure exerts a negative effect in the long run. In the short run, real producer prices of cocoa and maize exert significant positive effects on deforestation whereas access to irrigation infrastructure exerts a negative significant effect.

This distinction implies that stronger protection of intellectual property rights has an inverted U-shaped effect on economic growth. Intellectual property rights protection attributes part of the rents of commercial exploitation to the inventor that would otherwise accrue to the entrepreneur. Stronger patent protection will therefore increase the incentive to do research and development (R&D) and generate new knowledge. This new knowledge has a positive effect on entrepreneurship, innovation, and growth. However, after some point, further strengthening of patent protection will reduce the returns to entrepreneurship sufficiently to reduce the overall growth rate.","[Sanders, Mark] Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Acs, Zoltan J.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Acs, Zoltan J.; Sanders, Mark] Max Planck Inst Econ, Jena, Germany",Utrecht University; George Mason University; Max Planck Society,"Sanders, M (通讯作者)，Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands.",zacs@gmu.edu; m.w.j.l.sanders@uu.nl,"acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013",,,,,,68,49,54,9,94,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

A large firm level dataset is used across 63 countries and within country variation in the enforcement of the labor codes in countries with very different de jure firing regulations is explored. The findings strongly suggest that firms facing a stricter enforcement of firing regulations are on average smaller. This finding is interpreted as supportive of the fact that more stringent de facto firing regulations tend to reduce average employment. Robust evidence is found that this effect is stronger for more labor intensive manufacturing firms, especially those operating in low-technology sectors. Evidence also shows that this negative correlation does not hold in countries with a very weak rule of law.","[Almeida, Rita K.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Susanli, Z.

It follows that vested option holdings should be positively associated with credit quality. In support of this, we find that vested option holdings have a strong negative association with loan pricing, especially for informationally sensitive loans, and also predict higher cash flows and credit ratings, a greater distance to default, and lower equity volatility.

Methodology starts with a literature revision of the factors conforming social entrepreneurship and focuses on networking. Then, social entrepreneurship presence and its promotion is analyzed both in the practices and services provided by the Madrid Development Agency in its Madrid Emprende incubation program and also through a survey addressed to the 113 firms hosted in its network of business incubators. Results of the survey show that social entrepreneurship is present as the main purpose of their activity in a majority of the firms, in their social products and services, in their social legal form supported by the public network and in some forms of public-private partnership promoted by the Madrid Business Incubators Network. Services provided by the public network show the quality, the added value and the know-how of the practices of the public program and have an impact in the efficient performance of the firms regarding social entrepreneurship and in the public-private alliances established for some social purposes.","[Fernandez Fernandez, M.

The effects persist after controlling for bank capitalization, although bank equity compression is also associated with tighter contracts.

The evidence shows that, relative to industrial firms, REITs are driven more by cash flow risk. However, the difference in cash flow risk is insignificant after controlling for leverage. Furthermore, in poor market conditions the valuation of REITs is closer to that of non-REITs, a result we interpret as evidence of a leverage effect.

Although Basmati rice is not yet an official GI, its long standing reputation for quality and GI-like protection by major importing countries except the United States (US) has rendered it a mirror image of a GI good. The analysis is based on a survey of 299 Basmati and nonBasmati rice farmers in Uttarakhand, one of the Northern states(1) of India. The empirical strategy of the paper is three-pronged. First, a net income analysis has been carried out to elicit the net benefits of Basmati rice as opposed to nonBasmati rice and another competing crop in that region such as sugarcane. The findings show that Basmati rice is more profitable than the nonBasmati varieties but less so than sugarcane. In the second stage, the endogeneity-corrected Heckman selection model reveals that Basmati adoption has increased welfare of the households. Finally, a Tobit model is estimated to investigate the determining factors of Basmati adoption among the farmer households. The determining factors are found to be access to extension training facilities, a credible hedge against risk, and the availability of household labor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that if one player's information about the profitability of new markets is only modestly superior, the possibility of foreclosing the market can lead to a first-mover advantage. On the other hand, more extreme information superiority can reverse this, leading to a second-mover advantage. Knowing more surely what is the best choice, the better-informed player wants to delay to keep his information private and the less-informed player wants to delay to learn. Because of this, more accurate information can actually lead to inefficiency by increasing the incentive to delay, and exogenous costs of delay can aid efficiency by neutralizing that strategic incentive. In fact, in some circumstances a player may purposely coarsen his information to deter imitation.","[Rasmusen, Eric] Indiana Univ, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Yoon, Young-Ro] Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business; Wayne State University,"Rasmusen, E (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Kelley Sch Business, 1309 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",Erasmuse@indiana.edu; yoonyr@wayne.edu,,,,,,,24,17,19,0,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,,,J IND ECON,J.

This passage of time and the recent economic downturn afford researchers the opportunity to evaluate the success of these regulations in encouraging fiscal responsibility. This paper provides both a quantitative analysis of the impact of BBL on expenditure growth and a qualitative assessment of BBL in Western Canada as these four western provinces confronted the Great Recession of 2008-09. On both accounts, our analysis suggests that BBL did not fare particularly well in terms of its original objectives. Our empirical analysis shows that BBL had no discernible effect in restraining expenditure growth relative to revenue growth in most provinces, leaving them in a vulnerable fiscal position to avert deficits during economic recession. We illustrate this vulnerability among Western Canadian governments when confronted with the Great Recession. In other words, BBL was neither strong enough to limit expenditure growth during the good times nor adequate to prevent governments from choosing to run deficits during the bad times. Our analysis suggests that, like any piece of legislation, BBL is only as effective as the political will and public support surrounding it.","[Simpson, Wayne] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Wesley, Jared J.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Polit Studies, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba; University of Manitoba,"Simpson, W (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",,,,,,,,65,11,11,0,8,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

In particular, we examine how the presence of a highly able agent affects the effort levels of other agents as well as the effects of the total and the marginal prizes. Using panel data from the Japan Golf Tour, we estimate the effects of the presence of a superstar, and the size of the total and marginal prizes on the scores of professional golfers. We find that the presence of a superstar adversely affects the scores of the other players; that the larger the size of the total prize, the better are the scores; and that the larger the marginal prizes that players face at the end of the third round, the better the scores they achieve in the final round.

Households' decisions to move depend not only on job prospects but also on the relative cost of housing. I investigate how the housing market affects the flow of workers across cities. This occurs through at least two channels: the relative mobility of homeowners versus renters, and the relative cost of housing across markets. I use homeownership rates to measure the former, and use an index that measures house prices across metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and the price elasticity of housing supply to capture the latter. To show how variation in the these housing market factors not only affects cross-city migration but also the housing and labor markets, I estimate a VAR model of migration, employment, wages, house prices, and new housing supply using annual data from 277 US MSAs for 1990-2006. The response functions based on labor supply and demand shocks show substantial variation when evaluated at different values of the homeownership rate, the price elasticity of housing supply, and relative housing prices. I also allow for spillover effects in the model that reflect the impact of a labor demand shock in the nearest city. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The size-distribution of fish stocks is often severely truncated, even when the overall biomass is reasonably well managed. In a first part of this article, I show how the race to fish extends to the dimension of size: Akin to the classical Bertrand competition in prices, each agent has an incentive to target fish at a smaller size. In fact, for perfect selectivity, competition between two agents is sufficient to dissipate all rents. In a second part of this article, I explore the implications of size-differentiated harvesting for ITQ regulation.

Among the countries that are falling short, the average gap for the top half is about 10 percent. For those that are on target, or close to it, solid economic growth, policies, and institutions have been the key factors in their success.

Using the 'die-under-the-cup' paradigm participants over-reported high numbers on the roll of a die when there were financial incentives to do so and no chance of detection for lying. Participants generally did not maximise income, instead making moral compromises. In an adaptation of this procedure in a single die experiment 9% of participants lied that they had rolled a '6' when they had not compared to 2.5% in the Shalvi et al. study suggesting that when the incentive is donation to charity this encourages more dishonesty than direct personal gain. In a follow-up questionnaire study where sequences of three rolls were presented, lying increased where counterfactuals became available as predicted by Shalvi et al. A novel finding is reported where 'justified' lying is more common when comparative gains are higher.

Findings are reported from two controlled experiments in which participants have a monetary incentive to learn from experience making investments to protect against hurricane risks. A central finding is that investments display a short-term forgetting effect consistent with the use of reinforcement learning rules, where a significant driver of investments in a given period is whether storm losses were incurred in the precious period. Given the relative rarity of such losses, this reinforcement process produces a mean investment level below that which would be optimal for most storm threats. Investments are also found to be insensitive to the censoring effect of protection itself, implying that the size of experienced losses-rather than losses that are avoided-is the primary driver of investment decisions.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Meyer, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3730 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",meyerr@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,30,27,31,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Using 10 climate projections, it is found that future anthropogenic climate change damages until 2050 are, on average, one-fifth of those from historical climate variability.

The article also develops our understanding of the underlying legitimacy of financial liberalization. We debate e.g. Abiad and Mody (2005) and others who have found political factors to have little impact on financial openness. Using the same data undergirding such conclusions we argue, in contrast, that even a slight broadening of the political variables employed in the model and much closer attention to input and output aspects of the political legitimacy of financial liberalization over time reveal a more central role for politics in shaping liberalization. Input legitimacy involves the representation of stakeholders in initial and ongoing decisions to liberalize, while output legitimacy concerns liberalization's distributional consequences and management thereof over time. Several empirical measures of domestic-national and international political factors plausibly influence such aspects of legitimacy and are found to play a significant role in shaping liberalization, suggesting legitimation politics to be more important to financial openness than existing studies have typically acknowledged.

Two surveys were conducted to examine the financial risk perception of German individual investors (N= 119 in study 1; N= 171 in study 2). Participants were asked to rate the risk and several aspects of different types of investment products (e.g. shares and bank savings books). Study 1 analyzed the specificity of risk perception of various common investment products. Separate regression analyses showed only minor differences in the composition of the risk perception models between the types of investment. A factor analysis revealed two dimensions of perceived investment risk, where one factor consists of aspects of loss and variability (factor risk), while the other comprises aspects of transparency and liquidity (factor manageability). The dimensions were used to classify the types of investment with regard to perceived risk. Study 2 focused on effects of individual characteristics on financial risk perception. Only financial literacy (measured by means of a knowledge test) proved to be relevant in a regression analysis where perceived investment risk was explained by using gender, age, investment experience, and financial literacy as predictors. Implications for an appropriate investment risk communication in financial consultancy were derived from the results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Competing banks prefer to pay their banking staff in bonuses and not in fixed wages as risk sharing on the remuneration bill is valuable. Competition for bankers generates a negative externality, driving up market levels of banker remuneration and hence rival banks default risk. Optimal financial regulation involves an appropriately structured limit on the proportion of the balance sheet used for bonuses. However, stringent bonus caps are value destroying, default risk enhancing, and suboptimal for regulators who control only a small number of banks.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Thanassoulis, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,ESRC [ES/G037566/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G037566/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,52,57,60,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Thus, it prevents a fraction of individuals from acquiring human capital. Therefore, even if all individuals who acquired education remain in the home country, the actual number of educated workers in the source economy decreases, and the aggregate level of human capital in this economy would thus be negatively affected.","[Azarnert, Leonid V.] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Azarnert, Leonid V.] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Bar Ilan University; Ifo Institut,"Azarnert, LV (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",Leonid.Azarnert@biu.ac.il,,,,,,,33,8,9,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We identify the degree to and conditions under which High-Speed Rail is a viable substitute for airline travel. Using pooled cross-sectional data we estimate multinomial and mixed logit models to examine actual travel behaviour. Our model allows us to analyse the reaction of passenger behaviour on the withdrawal of aviation alternatives and the completion of the High-Speed Rail link between the two cities in November 2007. The results show that travel time and frequency are the main determinants of travel behaviour. The valuation of total travel times changes over the years following the opening of the High-Speed Rail link. Furthermore, we show that the direct elasticity of market share with respect to frequency for a number of aviation alternatives is above 1, indicating that these alternatives are not able to maximise profits. These alternatives subsequently left the market in our sample period. For the remaining aviation alternatives, except for easyJet, we find elasticities of market share with respect to frequency close to 1. Therefore, we conjecture that competition in this market will decline in the long run. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Research has shown that foreign born residents and recent immigrants to the US exhibit significantly different travel behavior than native born populations in the same regions. This paper expands on that existing research by examining the travel behavior data of 662 students from Brigham Young University (52.1% of whom have lived outside the United States for more than 60 consecutive days). First the paper identifies if an individual's experience living abroad results in a change in travel behavior upon their return to the,United States; second, if the foreign location where the experience was gained influences any behavioral change, and if so which regions of the world produce the greatest influence?: and third, if the duration of an individual's residence abroad affects their travel behavior and transportation perceptions upon returning to the United States. The analysis revealed that individuals who have lived abroad do exhibit a significant change in travel behavior upon returning to the United States, and the continent where the individual lived does significantly affect their change in travel behavior. However it appears that this change in behavior upon their return to the United States may be a regression to the mean, manifested by individuals adopting travel behavior similar to the transportation culture of their domestic environment. The location and duration of foreign experience does not have a significant impact on the current travel behavior of the individuals represented in this sample. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The firm characteristics suggest that the capital structure decision is consistent with the pecking-order theory: Dutch SMEs use profits to reduce their debt level, and growing firms increase their debt position since they need more funds. We further document that profits reduce in particular short-term debt, whereas growth increases long-term debt. We also find that inter- and intra-industry effects are important in explaining small firms' capital structure. Industries exhibit different average debt levels, which is in line with the trade-off theory. Furthermore, there is substantial intra-industry heterogeneity, showing that the degree of industry competition, the degree of agency conflicts, and the heterogeneity in employed technology are also important drivers of capital structure.","[Degryse, Hans; de Goeij, Peter] Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands; [Kappert, Peter] Corp Clients Nederland, Rabobank Int, NL-6800 AG Arnhem, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"de Goeij, P (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, Warandelaan 2, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands.",p.c.degoeij@tilburguniversity.nl,,"Degryse, Hans/0000-0002-0130-057X",,,,,40,146,195,4,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The local government has an incentive to enhance the labor quality and share that information with the MNC because it increases both its net tax revenue and profit of the MNC.

To date, however, it is unclear whether these plans are being implemented or have any causal effects on emissions. Using data from California, I provide the first quantitative analysis of the impacts of climate plans. I find that cities with climate plans have had far greater success in implementing strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than their counterparts without such plans. For example, they have more green buildings, spend more on pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, and have implemented more programs to divert waste from methane-generating landfills. I find little evidence, however, that climate plans play any causal role in this success. Rather, citizens' environmental preferences appear to be a more important driver of both the adoption of climate plans and the pursuit of specific emission reduction measures. Thus, climate plans are largely codifying outcomes that would have been achieved in any case. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea requires countries to sign partnership agreements with distant water fishing nations to exploit offshore stocks. However, for migratory stocks, the offshore may serve as a natural marine reserve (i.e., a source) to the inshore (i.e., sink); hence these partnership agreements generate a spatial externality. In this paper, we present a bioeconomic model in which a social planner uses a landing tax (ad valorem tax) to internalize this spatial externality. We found that the tax must reflect the biological connectivity between the two patches, intrinsic growth rate, the price of fish and cost per unit effort.

Fisheries, whether saltwater or freshwater, are an important source of animal protein, livelihoods and exchange value in international trade, and are presently undergoing rapid socio-ecological change. To explore the political economy and ecology of capture fisheries around the world, this paper synthesizes the insights of 11 empirical studies and places fisheries in the broader context of the capitalist relations of production through which they operate. The competitive market dynamics of fisheries production and consumption are examined, as well as the forms of social-property relations, social differentiation, labour exploitation and resistance that occur within them. This paper highlights some of the ways in which the unique combination of characteristics associated with fish and fisheries complement and complicate familiar questions in agrarian political economy. It concludes by identifying future research directions.","[Campling, Liam] Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London E1 4NS, England; [Havice, Elizabeth] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of London; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Campling, L (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",l.campling@qmul.ac.uk; havice@email.unc.edu; suilven2@yahoo.com,"Vyacheslav, Gromyko/I-5054-2012","Havice, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0760-2082",,,,,162,106,113,2,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Empirical evidence for this claim is provided, and the results suggest that lower opposition to financial development leads to an effective increase in credit markets' development only in those countries that have high government capabilities. Moreover, improvements in government capabilities have a significant impact on credit market development only in those countries where credit dependency is high (thus, opposition is low). This paper therefore contributes to this rich literature by providing a unified account of credit market development that includes two of its main determinants, traditionally considered in isolation.

It argues that bubble conditions in the housing market are likely to spur subprime lending, with favorable price expectations easing the default concerns of lenders and thus increasing their willingness to extend loans to risky borrowers. Since the demand created by subprime lending feeds back onto house prices, such lending also helps to fuel an emerging housing bubble. These ideas are illustrated in a theoretical model, and tentative support is found in empirical work exploring the connection between price expectations and the extent of subprime lending.

Although this development was generally benign, it had latent implications for triggering spikes in volatility since domestic stresses could rapidly spillover across borders.

However, a distinct literature exists that shows that nonlinear econometric frameworks, such as Markov switching (MS), are also natural tools to compute optimal portfolios in the presence of stochastic good and bad market states. In this paper we examine whether simple VARs can produce portfolio rules similar to those obtained under MS, by studying the effects of expanding both the order of the VAR and the number/selection of predictor variables included. In a typical stock-bond strategic asset allocation problem, we compute the out-of-sample certainty equivalent returns for a wide range of VARs and compare these measures of performance with those typical of nonlinear models for a long-horizon investor with constant relative risk aversion. We conclude that most VARs cannot produce portfolio rules, hedging demands, or (net of transaction costs) out-of-sample performances that approximate those obtained from equally simple nonlinear frameworks. We also compute the improvement in realized performance that may be achieved adopting more complex MS models and report this may be substantial in the case of regime switching ARCH.

We begin with a discussion of the but for baseline and the much discussed nuclear renaissance. Our pre-Fukushima benchmark for growth in nuclear generation in the US. and other developed countries is much more modest than many bullish forecasts of a big renaissance in new capacity may have suggested. For at least the next decade in developed countries, it is composed primarily of life extensions for many existing reactors, modest uprates of existing reactors as their licenses are extended, and modest levels of new construction. The majority of forecasted new construction is centered in China, Russia and the former states of the FSU, India and South Korea. In analyzing the impact of Fukushima, we break the effect down into two categories: the impact on existing plants, and the impact on the construction of new units. In both cases, we argue that the accident at Fukushima will contribute to a reduction in future trends in the expansion of nuclear energy, but at this time these effects appear to be quite modest at the global level.","[Joskow, Paul L.] Alfred P Sloan Fdn, New York, NY 10111 USA; [Joskow, Paul L.; Parsons, John E.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Joskow, PL (通讯作者)，Alfred P Sloan Fdn, New York, NY 10111 USA.",,,,,,,,13,24,26,2,23,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

We contribute new evidence to the debate by studying how payday credit access affects bank overdrafts (such as returned checks), bankruptcy, and household complaints against lenders and debt collectors. We find some evidence that Chapter 13 bankruptcy rates decrease after payday credit bans, but where we find that, we also find that complaints against lenders and debt collectors increase. The welfare implications of these offsetting movements are unclear. Our most robust finding is that returned check numbers and overdraft fee income at banks increase after payday credit bans. Bouncing a check may cost more than a payday loan, so this finding suggests that payday credit access helps households avoid costlier alternatives. While our findings obviously do not settle the welfare debate over payday lending, we hope they resolve it to some extent it by illuminating how households rearrange their financial affairs when payday loan supply changes.","[Morgan, Donald P.] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Morgan, DP (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA.",don.morgan@ny.frb.org,,,,,,,23,66,87,0,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

By 2006, the ATP trade deficit reached US$43.7 billion. This is primarily due to China's increasing importance as an ATP import source and does not indicate a wholesale loss of US competitiveness in ATPs. Mostly, China's market share gain came at the expense of other Asian countries. This geographical shift in China's favor is due to her greater integration with Asian supply chains. Trade gravity regressions show that the USA exports more advanced technology parts and accessories to lower income countries but advanced technology capital and consumer goods imports by the USA are not correlated with the income of the import source countries.

For noninvestment-grade borrowers, capital raising tends to be procyclical, while for investment-grade borrowers, it is countercyclical.

The study offers a reliable and valid measurement scale of consumer competitive arousal by testing it in three pre-purchase and one post-purchase situation.

(2010) find evidence of abnormal short activity prior to analyst downgrades and argue that short sellers may be violating SEC insider-trading laws by trading on information obtained from analysts about upcoming downgrades. However, observing abnormal shorting prior to downgrades is not tantamount to determining that short sellers are trading on tips from analysts unless shorting is abnormally low prior to upgrades. This paper revisits this issue. While we observe abnormal shorting prior to downgrades, we also find markedly higher shorting prior to upgrades. In fact, the short-selling patterns surrounding both downgrades and upgrades are remarkably symmetric indicating that short sellers during the pre-recommendation period are not unusually informed about the direction of upcoming recommendation changes. If anything, our findings indicate that short selling prior to analyst recommendations is more likely speculative than informed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to motivation, organizational culture facilitates the crucial aspects of organizational life, such as unity among employees and the general welfare. The literature defines different types of traditional motivational practices that are seen as connected to the system of rewards such as promotion, holidays, pay-for-performance and personal achievements. Innovative motivational practices are, on the other hand, described as improvements of the working environment, work organization and the job itself. The reason why these new practices were introduced is that they are related to productivity and employee satisfaction. Most employees of the hospitality companies do not have a higher education, this being not required by most of the jobs in this field. If education is not a competitive advantage, and Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2011 - World Economic Forum ranked Romania regarding the quality of the education system, specialized research and training and investment in staff training on 84, respectively 95 and 72 place out of 139 countries analyzed, we believe that employee motivation can be an asset when it comes to sustainable tourism. And the crucial point is that without motivation employees are inefficient and expensive. In the study we used a questionnaire-based survey, analyzing the views and opinions of respondents in the investigated hospitality companies from Mures region regarding motivational factors, criteria of payment determination as well as positive and negative incentives, elements that determine performance.

We argue that this suggests that emotion regulation may be an important facet of trader expertise, and that learning effects demonstrated in financial markets may include improved emotion regulation as an important component of that learning.

The financial information which is produced in all of the accounting processes is related with a lot of users particularly as the customers. A customer focused management approach became very important in today's enterprises. Because the quality of the products which are produced by the company is evaluated by the customers. The performance of the enterprise is measured by means of using the indicators such as service quality, error rate, rate of performing the services in time. What kind of arrangements should be performed in order to cover the customer expectations in a customer focused management system form the internal processes, namely introverted accounting dimension. The in-enterprise process dimension is focused on the internal processes which make the most important influence on the financial purposes of the organization as well as the customer satisfaction. Each enterprise has a unique transaction process with regard to creating values for the customers and obtaining fmancial profits.The customers and recognizing in-enterprise process dimension are the most important factors in terms of current and future success. It is not possible for the enterprises to meet the internal processes and long term needs of the target audience by means of using the today's technology and capabilities. In addition to this, intensive global competition require the companies, shareholders and customers to improve their capabilities continuously with regard to creating values Financial, customer and in-enterprise process purposes ensure closing the gaps between the capabilities to be brought by the targeted performance with the present capabilities of the people, systems and processes.

However, there is a concern that the uptake of these technologies has been slower in the sheep and beef sectors in comparison to the dairy, pig and poultry sectors. This is rather paradoxical given the fact that Scotland's research outputs in farm animal genetics are widely perceived to be excellent. A growing body of literature, popularly known as Innovation Systems theories, suggests that technological transformations require a much broader approach that transcends formal research establishments. Accordingly, this paper reports on preliminary work exploring whether and how an agricultural innovation systems perspective could help identify the dynamics of technology uptake in the livestock sectors in Scotland. Although the work has been undertaken in dairy, sheep, and beef sectors, in this paper, we provide the preliminary results obtained from a case study of the sheep sector only. The key objectives of this work were to map the sheep genetics innovation system in Scotland and identify the barriers prevailing within the system with regard to the uptake of genetic selection technologies. Although the sheep innovation system was characterised by the presence of all key domains and actors, it was found to suffer from some crucial weaknesses relating to network integration, technological infrastructure, and policies and institutional frameworks.

The resulting model specifically accounts for the volatility clustering and leverage effect, however, it is over-parameterized and provides only an ex post filter for the probability of large price movements occurring. This study proposes and calibrates a more informative and parsimonious model, the VG NGARCH model. Being an extension of the variance-gamma model developed by Madan. Carr, and Chang (1998), the proposed VG NGARCH model imposes an autoregressive structure on the conditional shape parameters, which describes the arrival rates for news with different degrees of impact on price movements, and provides an ex ante probability for the occurrences of large price movements. The performance of the proposed VG NGARCH model is compared with that of the GARJI model using daily stock prices of five financial companies contained in the S&P 500, namely, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase, CitiGroup, and AIG, from January 3, 2006 to December 31, 2009. The goodness of fit of the VG NGARCH model and its ability to predict the probabilities of large price movements are demonstrated by comparison with the benchmark GARP model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This relationship is stronger in industries that rely more on information technology and in areas with lower population densities. Instrumenting for broadband expansion with slope of terrain leans in the direction of a causal relationship, though not definitively. The economic benefits of broadband expansion for local residents appear to be limited. Broadband expansion is associated with population growth as well as employment growth, and both the average wage and the employment rate-the share of working-age adults that is employed-are unaffected by broadband expansion. Furthermore, expanding broadband availability does not change the prevalence of telecommuting or other home-based work. Like other place-based policies, expanding broadband availability could raise property values and the local tax base, but without more direct benefits for residents in the form of higher wages or improved access to jobs. The analysis relies on the uneven diffusion of broadband throughout the United States, allowing comparisons between areas with greater and less growth in broadband availability. I combine broadband data from the Federal Communications Commission, employment data from the National Establishment Time-Series database, and other economic data from the US Census and BLS to examine broadband availability and economic activity in the US between 1999 and 2006.

Respondents are assumed to evaluate each option based on the levels of the attributes, which vary across alternatives and choice sets. The way in which attributes are described to respondents is likely to affect their choices. In this study, the impacts of two attribute level descriptions are assessed: describing non-market attributes as absolute levels or in relative terms; and using positive versus negative contextual descriptions of attribute levels. These tests were performed using data from a choice experiment on catchment management in Tasmania, Australia. Contrary to a priori expectations, including explicit information cues about relative attribute levels in the choice sets is not found to affect stated preferences. The data do reveal significant differences in value estimates when attribute levels are described as a 'loss', compared to a 'presence'.","[Kragt, Marit E.; Bennett, Jeffrey W.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Kragt, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, M089 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",marit.kragt@uwa.edu.au,"Kragt, Marit E./D-3185-2011; Bennett, Jeff W/A-1084-2008","Kragt, Marit E./0000-0001-6847-4817;",,,,,77,37,43,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

These changes occurred earlier for NASDAQ stocks (primarily between 1994 and 2004) and later for NYSE-listed stocks (mostly following Reg NMS and the 2006 introduction of the NYSE hybrid market). This paper surveys the evidence of how these changes impacted market quality and shows that overall market quality has improved significantly, including bid-ask spreads, liquidity, and transitory price impacts (measured by short-term variance ratios). The greater improvement in market quality for NYSE-listed stocks relative to NASDAQ stocks beginning in 2006 suggests causal links between the staggered market structure changes and market quality. Using proprietary data sets, provided by two exchanges, that identify the activity of high frequency trading firms, studies show these firms contributed directly to narrowing bid-ask spreads, increasing liquidity, and reducing intraday transitory pricing errors and intraday volatility.","[Litzenberger, Robert] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Litzenberger, Robert; Castura, Jeff; Gorelick, Richard] RGM Advisors LLC, Austin, TX 78701 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Litzenberger, R (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jcastura@rgmadvisors.com,,,,,,,60,10,12,4,37,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4804-5,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

The paper analyses the relations between the banking sector fluctuations and taxation and public spending during 2008-2011. Our research is based upon market values of performance assessment - Residual Income, Market Value Added, Earnings per Share, and Price to Earnings ratio - which offer a more realistic view regarding the evolution of banking institutions value reflecting investor's decisions and anticipations. Connecting the theory to Romanian banking system data we find that some of the bad financial performance associated with this period is to be explained by the contraction of the demand and not necessary with the earnings obtained by the Romanian listed banking institutions. According to our study, the evidence supports claims that Romanian fiscal policy is pro-cyclical and hence destabilizing over the analysing period. The aim of the paper is to provide some empirical basis for the argument that pro-cyclical fiscal policy does not assist in repairing the financial system. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We show that the trade-off between country size as a locational advantage and country risk as a locational disadvantage affects the location choice of a foreign firm. Given the circumstance in which the foreign firm faces the same probabilities of country risk in both potential host countries when deciding investment location, our analysis shows that if the market size of the high-risk country is sufficiently large relative to the low-risk country, the foreign firm benefits from choosing the high-risk larger country even if the host country's government imposes a lump-sum tax. Given the situation in which the foreign firm faces different probabilities of country risk in each host country, our results show that the important matter for the foreign firm is whether the host country is high-cost or low-cost, rather than whether the host country is high-risk.

This paper examines the efficiency and productivity of enterprises (more than 250 employees) in machinery industry which are part of a emerging markets. In the machinery industry there are companies that deal with the cars manufacture, machinery and equipment and the manufacture of motor vehicles and their components. Techniques selected for evaluation of progress efficiency and changing productivity studied are Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist productivity index (MPI). This methodology allows a direct comparison between firms within the same industry and shows how intense inputs are used in a production system from which we want to realize a high level of output. The used program to calculate indicators of productivity and efficiency frontier was DEAP 2.1. (Data Envelopment Analysis Computer) developed by the Centre for Efficiency and Productivity Analysis of the University of New England. Analysis of positive or negative trends in the efficiency and productivity of enterprises in the studied period reveals information about the sources of existing inefficient. This paper is mainly aimed at measuring the technical efficiency and productivity change in the machinery industry in Romania between 2001-2010 and as secondary objective to determine the inefficient sources in industry. The results of the study show that the tendency of growth of total factor productivity (TFP) is due in particular to the efficiency progress and not to the technological change, what demonstrates that human resource quality has had a positive impact on the industry. Productivity is viewed as a competitive advantage, so companies that have increased productivity, even in a time of crisis, are based on modern management and performance.

Such techniques are known to improve supply chain coordination, but they do not adequately consider major aspects of local organic food supply chains such as ethics, sustainability and human values. Supply chain design and management approaches suitable to small-scale, local organic food enterprises are lacking and need to be developed. The aim of this paper is to suggest Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) as a new and suitable approach to design and manage local organic food supply chains. We illustrate how SSM can be used to reduce uncertainties within local organic food supply chains based on a German case. This illustration serves to identify the benefits of using SSM, compared with ad hoc, pragmatic and less structured approaches. The major benefits are of thought, intervention and change, as well as action-oriented, meaningful and participatory decision making.","[Tavella, Elena; Hjortso, Carsten Nico] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Copenhagen C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Tavella, E (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Copenhagen C, Denmark.",eta@foi.ku.dk; cnh@foi.ku.dk,"Hjortsø, Carsten N/I-5548-2013; Hjortsø, Carsten N/IZE-4157-2023; Tavella, Elena/A-8361-2015","Hjortsø, Carsten N/0000-0002-2365-8740; Hjortsø, Carsten N/0000-0002-2365-8740; Tavella, Elena/0000-0001-7511-7199",,,,,69,17,19,1,37,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

This enables us to formally analyze the impact of a (speculative) storage demand shock and to assess how the effects of various demand and supply shocks change in the presence of oil storage facility. The paper finds that business-cycle-driven oil demand shocks are the most important drivers of U.S. oil price fluctuations during 1982-2007. Disregarding the storage facility in the model causes a considerable upward bias in the estimated role of oil supply shocks in driving oil price fluctuations. The results also confirm that a change in the composition of shocks helps explain the resilience of the macroeconomic environment to the oil price surge after 2003. Finally, speculative storage is shown to have a mitigating or amplifying role depending on the nature of the shock.

Recently, an increasing amount of the literature makes reference to the vital role played by a small number of young firms in generating jobs and increasing efficiency levels. However, not all new firms invest in R&D. Departing from the definition of Young Innovative Companies (YICs, firms younger than 6 years old, fewer than 250 employees and with more than 15 % of their revenues invested in R&D activities), and with an extensive sample of the Spanish Community Innovation Survey between 2004 and 2010, we try to determine: (1) those factors that cause firms to become YICs (innovative young small firms) or Young Non-Innovative Companies (YNICs, moderately innovative young small firms), and (2) what is the difference in the impact of those factors between YICs and YNICs. Our results show that factors such as initial innovation capacity and cooperation in R&D projects enhance the probability of becoming a YIC. Nevertheless, factors such as export potential and market uncertainty may influence the decision to invest moderately and become a YNIC.","[Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Inst Dev Strategies, Bloomington, IN USA; [Segarra, Agusti; Teruel, Mercedes] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Res Grp Ind & Terr, Dept Econ CREIP, Reus 43204, Spain",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Segarra, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Res Grp Ind & Terr, Dept Econ CREIP, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.",agusti.segarra@urv.cat,"Teruel, Mercedes/K-1355-2017","Teruel, Mercedes/0000-0002-4104-7679; Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762; Segarra, Agusti/0000-0001-6316-3171",,,,,54,43,45,0,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The next set of research challenges has the objective to encourage efficient operations in IWT: development of a system wide model for IWT, integration of operational planning systems and analysis of bundling networks. A third group of research efforts is directed towards shippers and consignees who use the intermodal transport chain to send or receive their goods: further development of models that integrate intermodal transport decisions with supply chain decisions and creation of green supply chains. A fourth cluster of research challenges concerns the problem domain of external cost calculations.

Losses attributed to senior debt holders would, on aggregate, have been proportionally small, while no losses would have been imposed on depositors.

Since in the soft-budget regime the government cannot commit itself to the deficit ceiling ex ante, the present generation exerts intense political efforts for personal fiscal privileges.

(2011), we decompose the fluctuations of Japan's industrial production (IP) into sectoral shocks and aggregate shocks, taking input-output relationships between sectors into account. Our results show that, except for the global financial crisis period, sectoral shocks explain, on an average, nearly half of the quarterly variations in Japan's IP. Although the relative importance of sectoral shocks declined during the global financial crisis period, it increased again in the recent post-crisis period and, at this time, it contributes to the increased volatility of Japan's IP. Specifically, our analysis suggests that the intersectoral spillovers brought about by disruptions of supply chain networks in the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake, the declines in domestic production (or production capacity) in some sectors, as a result of a deterioration in global competitiveness, and a shift to overseas production have contributed to the recent increase in fluctuations of Japan's IP.

The SEC altered the fee rate 15 times between 2001 and 2010, creating a series of natural experiments with which to measure the effect of transaction costs on trading volume and volatility. The main finding is a negative relationship between the SEC fee and the price volatility of stocks in the S&P 500 index. As in most previous studies, a negative relationship is also found between the fee rate and trading volume. The SEC levy's dampening effect on both trading volume and volatility is particularly strong for more heavily traded stocks within the S&P 500, and in the years after 2007, which witnessed the rise of high-frequency trading.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Matheson, T (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",tmatheson2@imf.org,,,,,,,42,4,5,0,13,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,DEC,2014,70.0,4,,,,,487,510,,10.1628/001522114X685456,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AZ5NQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348267900001,0

A geographical analysis in terms of traffic energy use,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Winter maintenance; Energy efficiency; Fuel consumption; Winter model; Sweden,FUEL CONSUMPTION MODEL; WEATHER FORECASTS; EMISSIONS; IMPACT,"Snow removal and anti-slip measures on roads are necessary to maintain road safety and a free-flowing transportation system. This is also interesting from an energy perspective as a free-flowing transportation system will use less energy than a congested one. These road maintenance measures focus, however, only on safety and not on energy use at all. This study will try to quantify the need for winter road maintenance in terms of energy in order to determine when, from an energy perspective, it would be best to remove snow or apply anti-icing agents. To explore this, parts of the VTI (Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute) winter model were used. Several scenarios were set in different areas in Sweden in order to investigate a geographical divergence. It is possible to reduce 10.7% of traffic energy use if the starting criterion for snow removal is changed from 1 cm to 2 cm before action needs to be taken. If the speed limit is also reduced from 90 km/h to 70 km/h, the saving could be up to 17.2%. This paper aims to focus on the energy perspective of the winter maintenance operations in Sweden as well as on proposing other aspects of use for the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose an exact import price index by extending the analysis of Broda and Weinstein (Q J Econ 121(2):541-585, 2006), who include growth in product variety in their calculations of import prices. While still relying on Armington's (Int Monet Fund Staff Pap 16(1):159-178, 1969) definition of variety, we relax two assumptions, allowing the set of products and unobserved taste and quality parameter to vary. Our modified import price index shows that gains from variety in European G7 countries, although positive, are small compared with gains from taste and quality. Using food and tobacco products as a benchmark with unchanged taste and quality, we find significant gains from shifts in consumer preferences and improving quality for Germany, France, Italy and the UK between 1995 and 2012. By comparing results based on different benchmark groups we further flag the importance of consumer taste in international trade.","[Benkovskis, Konstantins] Latvijas Banka, Monetary Policy Dept, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia; [Woerz, Julia] Oesterreich Nationalbank, Foreign Res Div, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"Benkovskis, K (通讯作者)，Latvijas Banka, Monetary Policy Dept, Kr Valdemara Iela 2A, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia.",Konstantins.Benkovskis@bank.lv,,"Benkovskis, Konstantins/0000-0003-1935-6843",,,,,30,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Because recognition of operating cash flows does not reflect differential verification thresholds for recognizing unrealized gains versus losses, CFO asymmetry adds noise or bias to tests of conditional conservatism. We show that CFO asymmetry is predictable in the cross-section, and varies systematically with life-cycle characteristics. Removing CFO from earnings and using accruals-based measures of asymmetric timeliness eliminates several biases that prior studies have attributed to other sources. Moreover, accrual asymmetric timeliness varies in the cross-section as theory predicts. Going forward, we recommend researchers use accruals-based asymmetric timeliness measures when testing for conditional conservatism. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The increase in remittances causally accounts for 32 per cent and 37 per cent of the decline in child and infant mortality, respectively.

We consider an equilibrium model in which a representative developer may choose to redevelop existing centrally located housing or to develop new housing at the periphery of the city. We show that as the city grows, the land leasehold system results in the city center being developed less intensely and more land being used on the outskirts of the city when compared to a fee simple environment. Thus, cities in China are likely to be relatively more spread out, with city centers relatively older than would be the case with fee simple ownership. Our model suggests that excess residential land use is about 6 percent. In addition, compared with the ownership case, housing supply will grow more quickly in the near future, but more slowly later on during the transition of the Chinese economy.

We also evaluate the biases that arise when spatial effects are not accounted for. Given that the dependent variable is interval-coded, controlling for spatial dependence in this context is challenging. We address this problem with two alternative strategies. Firstly, we use the Gibbs Sampling algorithm to estimate spatial econometric models which extends the interval regression model. A major drawback of this approach is that the implied estimation is proned to the endogeneity biases inherent to our hedonic regression model. To circumvent the endogeneity issues triggered by the first estimation strategy, we also use a two-stage estimation procedure with locational fixed effects. In all specifications, results are sensitive to the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and to the choice of the delineation of the study area. Moreover, they confirm the existence of substantive spatial dependence. Conversely to the previous results with a negative elasticity for the percentage of the area covered by agriculture and a positive elasticity for the potential accessibility to jobs, the second approach implies opposite effects for those two variables. This indicates that dwellings close to agricultural areas and with a lower accessibility to the main employment centers are highly demanded and that endogeneity biases are not negligible.

But, in a liberalised market, since investments are made by competitive, profit-maximising companies, the increased intervention of government policy in the trading arrangements creates uncertain responses to incentives. Industry may perceive policy risks to be high, and major companies may choose to act more cautiously than governments expect. This presents a modelling challenge, and we propose an extension to the use of real options in this context. We model several features of the low-carbon investment context, viz., irreversibility, delay, and competition, which impinge upon the radical policy imperatives for structural change in electricity markets to meet ambitious sustainability targets.","[Chronopoulos, Michail] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Bunn, Derek] London Business Sch, Management Sci & Operat Subject Area, London NW1 4SA, England; [Siddiqui, Afzal] UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London, England; [Siddiqui, Afzal] Stockholm Univ, Dept Comp & Syst Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of London; London Business School; University of London; University College London; Stockholm University,"Bunn, D (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, Management Sci & Operat Subject Area, London NW1 4SA, England.",dbunn@london.edu,"Bunn, Derek W/P-5247-2016","Siddiqui, Afzal/0000-0003-1841-1310; chronopoulos, michail/0000-0002-3858-2021; Bunn, Derek/0000-0003-1770-4488",UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) under the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/GOO7748/1]; ESRC [ES/F032536/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F032536/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) under the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are grateful for the support by the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) under the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Grant NE/GOO7748/1.

Electricity generators in NSW are subject to environmental taxation on air pollution through the Load Based Licensing (LBL) scheme. This paper evaluates whether this environmental policy, after ten years of operation, has led to a reduction in the emissions intensity of these air pollutants. The econometric estimation, based on a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model with fixed effects, shows that except for SOx, there is no evidence of emissions reduction that can be attributed to the LBL in NSW In terms of enabling low-cost abatement through specific monitoring methods, there is no evidence of reduction in NOx or SOx emission intensities due to generators implementing continuous monitoring. By contrast, generators using periodic monitoring methods have lower emission intensities of CPM and FPM The findings suggest that environmental taxes in NSW have been too low compared with marginal abatement cost estimates and so, they have not created sufficient incentives for generators to reduce their emission intensities across air pollutants.","[Contreras, Zaida; Betz, Regina] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Energy & Environm Markets, Sch Econ, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Ancev, Tihomir] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Betz, Regina] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Sch Management & Law, Winterthur, Switzerland",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney; Zurich University of Applied Sciences,"Contreras, Z (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Ctr Energy & Environm Markets, Sch Econ, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia.",z.contreras@unsw.edu.au; tiho.ancev@sydney.edu.au; betz@zhaw.ch,,"Ancev, Tihomir/0000-0002-3521-7782",Environmental Economics Research Hub - Australian Commonwealth Environmental Research Facilities (CERF) programme,Environmental Economics Research Hub - Australian Commonwealth Environmental Research Facilities (CERF) programme,The corresponding author would like to thank Professor Denzil Fiebig for his supervision on this research paper.

Following the identification of periods characterized by low, medium and high volatility in financial markets, we analyze the behavior of spreads from three different angles. First, we demonstrate that the cross-country correlation of spreads increases in high-volatility regimes, implying that countries cannot fully decouple from developments in other emerging markets during periods of distress. Second, using the interactions of several domestic and global variables with the probabilities of each regime prevailing in a given period as the explanatory variables of spreads, the fixed effects panel estimation shows that while country-specific fundamentals are important determinants of spreads in each regime, the importance of global financial conditions increases in high-volatility periods. Third, we show that countries can benefit from stronger fundamentals in the form of lower exposure of their sovereign spreads to unfavorable regime shifts in global market sentiment.

In particular, three different approaches of deriving solvency capital requirements are analyzed: the Solvency II standard model, a partial internal model, and a full internal model. This analysis is not only of relevance for Solvency II, but also regarding an insurer's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) that is not only planned in Solvency II, but also by the NAIC in the United States.

Second, we test whether there is a relationship between progressivity and average tax level, the two building stones of the redistributive effect of taxes.","[Verbist, Gerlinde] Univ Antwerp, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Figari, Francesco] Univ Insubria, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Figari, Francesco] Univ Essex, I-21100 Varese, Italy",University of Antwerp; University of Insubria,"Verbist, G (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Stadscampus S-M179, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",gerlinde.verbist@uantwerpen.be; francesco.figari@uninsubria.it,"Verbist, Gerlinde/AAC-4935-2019","Verbist, Gerlinde/0000-0001-9253-3477; FIGARI, FRANCESCO/0000-0003-0735-1076",ESRC [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,50,24,25,1,21,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,SEP,2014,70.0,3,,,,,405,429,,10.1628/001522114X684529,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AR4AD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343529500004,0

This paper examines a model of subjective wealth that controls attitudes toward money and objective wealth. Subjective wealth has been operationalized as a combination of the assessment of financial situation, the ability to make ends meet and perceived adequacy of income to fulfill needs and wants. Objective wealth has been captured by personal net income as well as household income. Results show that two dimensions of money attitudes affect the subjective perception of objective wealth. Individuals' perceived financial control (the ability to budget, monitor, and control their money) serves as a moderator for the relationship between objective and subjective wealth: The relationship between the two is stronger for individuals high in financial control and planning than for those low. Furthermore, money anxiety (worry and indecisiveness regarding moneyrelated issues) is negatively related to objective measures of wealth and its subjective evaluation, and partially mediates the objective-subjective wealth relationship.

In this paper we separate out the credit risk component by examining bonds that are issued by the same firm and that trade on the same day, allowing us to examine the effects of liquidity in a sample of bond pairs. We examine standard liquidity measures to determine how well they explain the differences in the two bonds' yield spreads and find that the proxies do a poor job of measuring liquidity effects. Incorporating liquidity proxies related to other bonds issued by the firm and those for bonds of other firms can significantly improve the explanatory power. Still, a significant portion of the spread is left unexplained and it is largely driven by a common unknown factor. We conclude that good proxies for the liquidity component of corporate bond spreads remain elusive. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The research was divided into four main phases. An overview of all institutionalised clusters in the Czech Republic, including innate clusters, was compiled in the first phase. Location quotients were used to identify innate clusters. For institutionalised clusters the main declared field specialisation, membership basis and cluster age were established. In the second phase, 5 most important branches were defined per each region by number of employees. Subsequently, the hypotheses that innovation characteristics of the regions depend on the number of clusters, their average age and the number of members were tested. Innovations were characterised by patent applications, utility models, total R&D expenditure and export of technology services. All values were examined as incremental for the period of 2009 to 2012 per one full-time researcher. None of the determined hypotheses were confirmed. There is no systematic dependence between the innovation outputs in the regions and clusters. The possible reasons for this fact are discussed in the article, such as the short time clusters have been operating in the CR, the impact of the economic crisis or underestimating the existence of innate clusters. In the last phase of the research, innovation outputs were evaluated for the branches with operating clusters in respective regions and compared with total innovations per branch in the CR. Two regions were selected to serve as an example. The analysis showed that innate non-institutionalised clusters can also have a major impact on innovation outputs in regions.","[Zizka, Miroslav; Rydvalova, Petra] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Zizka, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Liberec, Czech Republic.",miroslav.zizka@tul.cz,"Zizka, Miroslav/I-5624-2016; Rydvalová, Petra/HLP-4991-2023","Zizka, Miroslav/0000-0002-7804-3954; Rydvalová, Petra/0000-0002-4816-208X",,,,,49,9,9,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,994,1012,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400021,0

However, not all road links equally affect the travel conditions in a given network; typically some links are more critical to the network functioning than the others. It is noted that the majority of the existing indices designed to measure vulnerability offer a good measure of network-wide accessibility in sparse regional networks, but they rarely consider the extent of serviceability of critical links in dense urban road networks. This paper describes a number of vulnerability indices from the literature, applies them to the case of urban network of York and discusses the results. It proposes a new vulnerability index considering the serviceability of road links and illustrates its computation. Finally, this paper uses the results of the new vulnerability index and outlines a traffic diversion plan in the event of flooding in York using traffic network modelling techniques combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) application.

Nevertheless, improvements in ICT performances will probably be positively impacted, in some years, by large technological developments as for example the productive use, in computers, of the 3D chip. The lag of ICT diffusion in non-US developed countries, mainly Europe and Japan, compare to the US, is explained by institutional aspects: a lower education level, on average, of the working-age population and more regulations on labour and product markets. By implementing structural reforms, these countries could benefit from a productivity acceleration linked to a catch-up of the US ICT diffusion level. And they could benefit, without any delay with the US, from the possible ICT productivity growth second wave.","[Cette, Gilbert] Banque France, Paris, France; [Cette, Gilbert] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Cette, Gilbert] EHESS, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Cette, G (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",Gilbert.cette@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,29,7,7,1,10,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We find that term structure anomalies can largely be accounted for by peso problems, probably along with a small time-varying risk premium for the full sample. However, peso problem explanations cannot resolve term structure anomalies for the postcrisis sample.

While previous research found that the labor supply of older workers is significantly affected by the Social Security earnings test, we find little evidence of a response to benefit taxation in a large panel of data compiled from individual income tax and information returns. Similarly, while taxation of benefits provides an incentive for many to delay claiming, we find no evidence of such an effect. Overall, the findings suggest that older taxpayers have little understanding of the rules governing Social Security benefit taxation.","[Burman, Leonard E.] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Burman, Leonard E.; Tian, Liu] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY USA; [Burman, Leonard E.; Coe, Norma B.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Coe, Norma B.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Pierce, Kevin] Internal Revenue Serv, Washington, DC USA",Urban Institute; Syracuse University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Burman, LE (通讯作者)，Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",lburman@urban.org; nbcoe@uw.edu; Kevin.K.Pierce@irs.gov; ltian@maxwell.syr.edu,,,,,,,27,3,6,2,8,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

J,"Evans, L; Schwartz, J",,,,"Evans, Lawrance, Jr.; Schwartz, Jeremy",,,The effect of concentration and regulation on audit fees: An application of panel data techniques,JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Audit fees; Panel data; Market power; Market concentration; Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX); Dodd-Frank,COMPETITION; SELECTION; SERVICES; DEMAND; MARKET; FIRMS; BIAS,"The financial audit - which is mandatory for publically traded companies - plays an important role in the transparency and efficiency of global capital markets. Yet, the cost of complying with the laws and regulations requiring financial statement review by external auditors can be substantial. Moreover, the supply-side of the audit market is dominated by a few firms. As a result, policymakers in many countries have an interest in considering the cost of additional regulation as well as ensuring that the concentrated nature of the audit market does not result in anti-competitive pricing. The goal of this paper is to provide new estimates of the extent to which regulation and market concentration have contributed to higher audit fees using a panel data approach. To accomplish this we use U.S. data from 2000 to 2010, a period that includes a large change in market concentration as a result of the collapse of the third largest auditor in 2002. In addition, the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002 in response to a series of accounting scandals, allows us to exploit an abrupt change in the regulatory environment. We find that the cost of additional regulation has been substantial and persistent. In addition, our results support the notion that the burden is larger for smaller firms. This was the rationale for exempting the smallest firms from the most costly provisions of SOX by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank). However, our results suggest that greater market concentration has only a very small impact on the fees of large clients, suggesting that fears that market power would generate higher fees are largely unwarranted.

We document repeated and large deviations from the standard IT framework: exchange market interventions have been widespread; the real exchange rate has often become a target of policy; and other non-conventional policy tools, especially changes in reserve requirements, but occasionally also taxes and restrictions on international capital movements, have come into common use. As in developed nations, during the 2008-2009 crisis, issues of liquidity provision took centre stage.

Using nationally representative individual-level data, I examine the association between child health and parental income in Japan. Japan has a child poverty rate that is similar to the rate of many countries that have been studied previously, but Japan outperforms those countries on most health indicators. I find that an income gradient exists in child health in Japan, but that it is limited to specific health measures and symptoms, and that it is weaker overall in that respect than the gradient found in other countries or among Japanese adults. Moreover, I find no evidence that the gradient increases with child age. The fact that children in low-income families have relatively modest and non-accumulating health disadvantages may contribute to the overall health of the Japanese population. Nevertheless, there is a statistically significant negative association between parental income and the incidences of asthma, hearing problems, and dental symptoms in children, implying that future efforts to improve the health of underprivileged children should focus on the prevention and control of these diseases.

After accounting for selection using propensity score matching, estimating effects using nonlinear GLM, and performing sensitivity tests, we find that child enrichment expenditures have an inverted U-shaped relationship with housing cost burden, our measure of housing affordability. This result is similar to the concave pattern of the association between housing cost burden and measures of children's cognitive achievement in reading and math. Thus, child expenditures, particularly for enrichment, may be one mechanism by which housing affordability affects children's cognitive outcomes. The inflection point for enrichment spending occurs at roughly the 30% housing cost-to-income ratio, the longstanding rule-of-thumb for defining housing affordability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Reducing maturity can increase or decrease overhang even when shorter term debt's value depends less on firm value. Future overhang is more volatile for shorter term debt, making future investment incentives volatile and influencing immediate investment incentives. With immediate investment, shorter term debt typically imposes lower overhang; longer term debt can impose less if asset volatility is higher in bad times. For future investments, reduced correlation between assets-in-place and investment opportunities increases the shorter term debt overhang.","[Diamond, Douglas W.; He, Zhiguo] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Diamond, Douglas W.; He, Zhiguo] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Diamond, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0962321] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,35,124,143,4,128,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

This paper documents the impact of these two trends on the composition of school groups by ability and the importance of these composition effects for wages. The main finding is that there is a growing gap between the abilities of high school and college-educated workers that accounts for one-half of the college wage premium for recent cohorts and for the entire rise of the college wage premium between the 1910 and 1960 birth cohorts.

Tightness in the market for liquidity leads banks to engage in what we term liquidity pull-back, which involves selling financial assets either by banks directly or by levered investors. Empirical tests on the stock market are supportive. Tighter interbank markets are associated with relatively more volume in more liquid stocks; selling pressure, especially in more liquid stocks; and transitory negative returns. We control for market-wide uncertainty and in the process also contribute to the literature on portfolio rebalancing. Our general point is that money matters in financial markets.

The flight to liquidity premium, which is estimated by constructing the spread between a German state guaranteed agency bond and the Bund, is behind the pricing of all euro area spreads and, specifically, is the only factor explaining the sovereign spreads for Finland and the Netherlands. The spillover effect from Greece, which is identified using complementary approaches, has contributed to developments in spreads of countries with weaker fiscal fundamentals, a lower degree of competitiveness and a higher need of foreign financing. However, a large fraction of the spillover across countries remains unexplained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that the crisis significantly changed banks' pricing behavior and its impact varied across banks, depending on their asset sizes, deposit sources and liquidity profiles. Big banks led in price setting and responded promptly to both upward and downward adjustments of the cash target rate before and during the GFC. Albeit cutting their prices sluggishly after the GFC, they still enjoy greater market power and are expanding faster. Banks with solid deposit support became slower in responding to policy shocks during the GFC and sold more than their counterparts. Interestingly, banks in a better liquidity position tended to be more conservative in pricing during the GFC, i.e. reacting quickly when the cash rate moved up but slowly if it fell, but became more aggressive thereafter.

Using a unique dataset containing 4423 political candidates from recent elections in Germany, we show that candidates' occupations do play an important role in their electoral success. The occupational impact is far greater than gender or doctoral degree effects for a large number of occupations. We discuss three possible explanations for these occupational effects: (a) an occupation's public reputation, (b) the extent to which individuals carrying out certain occupations are known within their communities, and (c) occupation specific competence related to issues relevant for local politics. Looking at polls on the reputation/prestige of certain jobs, we find a strong correlation between an occupation's reputation and the electoral success of a candidate carrying out this occupation. Therefore, voters appear to use occupational reputation as a cue in low-information elections. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate that a non-linear relation exists between the public float and post-IPO returns. Specifically, as public float increases, long-run returns decrease for low levels of public float and increase for high levels of public float. This relation persists even after controlling for various firm characteristics. The best long-term performers are firms that sell either very little or sell most of their stock in the IPO. We suggest that the choice of public float level creates a trade-off between incentives to insiders and power granted to outsiders.

In a scenario of large-scale deployment of CCS in Europe by 2050, the optimal (cost-minimising) CO2 transport network would consist of large international bulk pipelines from the main CO2 source regions to the CO2 sinks in hydrocarbon fields and saline aquifers, which are mostly located in the North Sea. In this paper, we use a Shapley value approach to analyse the multilateral negotiation process that would be required to develop such jointly optimised CO2 infrastructure. First, we find that countries with excess storage capacity capture 38-45 % of the benefits of multilateral coordination, implying that the resource rent of a depleted hydrocarbon field (when used for CO2 storage) is roughly per barrel of original recoverable oil reserves, or per boe (barrel of oil equivalent) of original recoverable gas reserves. This adds 25-600 % to current estimates of CO2 storage cost. Second, countries with a strategic transit location capture 19 % of the rent in the case of national pipeline monopolies. Liberalisation of CO2 pipeline construction at EU level could eliminate the transit rent and is shown to reduce by two-thirds the differences between countries in terms of cost per tonne of CO2 exported. Reaching agreement on such liberalisation may be politically challenging, since the payoffs are shown to be strongly divergent across countries.","European Commiss, DG JRC, Inst Energy & Transport, NL-1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Energy & Transport (IET),"Morbee, J (通讯作者)，European Commiss, DG JRC, Inst Energy & Transport, POB 2, NL-1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands.",joris.morbee@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,2,3,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Commercial airports in the United States are chosen to demonstrate such impacts of corruption. We first develop a theory which predicts the impacts of corruption on productivity and variable input allocation of airports. We then test the predictions by estimating a stochastic variable cost frontier model which incorporates both technical and allocative efficiency of airports. The empirical evidence confirms the theoretical predictions by revealing the following: (1) airports are less productive in more corrupt environments; and (2) airports tend to use more contracting-out to replace in-house labor in more corrupt environments. The findings can be applied to the context of other public goods and have important policy implications for reforming governance structure of public good provision. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, exchanges are more attractive to informed traders, and dark pools are more attractive to uninformed traders. Under certain conditions, adding a dark pool alongside an exchange concentrates price-relevant information into the exchange and improves price discovery.

The instrumental variable estimates are that a one standard deviation increase in R&D intensity is associated with an increase in the hourly wage rate between 5.5% and 11.4%. The wage elasticity with respect to R&D intensity is found to be higher in larger firms as well as for better educated workers and workers with technical skills.

It is therefore important to understand the resulting potential changes in bicycle flows in order to accommodate adaptation planning for cycling. We propose a framework to model the changes in bicycle flow in London by developing a negative binomial count-data model and by incorporating future projected weather data from downscaled global climate models, a first such approach in this area. High temporal resolution (hourly) of our model allows us to decipher changes not only on an annual basis, but also on a seasonal and daily basis. We find that there will be a modest 0.5% increase in the average annual hourly bicycle flows in London's network due to a changed climate. The increase is primarily driven by a higher temperature due to a changed climate, although the increase is tempered due to a higher rainfall. The annual average masks the differences of impacts between seasons though - bicycle flows are expected to increase during the summer and winter months (by 1.6%), decrease during the spring (by 2%) and remain nearly unchanged during the autumn. Leisure cycling will be more affected by a changed climate, with an increase of around 7% during the weekend and holiday cycle flows in the summer months. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that the parallel imports and the authorized products differ not only in the warranty duration offered by the sellers, but also in the formats in which they are listed, both of which substantially affect trade probability and transaction price. We show that, after taking into account the endogenous choice of listing formats and the characteristics of the sellers and the items, an authorized product has a 7% higher trade probability than that of a parallel import and, if there is a sale, the transaction price as a ratio of the manufacturer's suggested retail price is 0.093 higher. A small number of less-experienced parallel import sellers, in an attempt to maintain a price comparable to the authorized product, list their items in pure auction with unusually high starting bids. This accounts for the overall lower trade probability for the parallel imports. If we disregard these sellers who adopt pure auction, the authorized product has higher transaction price than, but about the same trade probability as, the parallel import.","[Chen, Kong-Pin] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lai, Hung-pin] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Chiayi County, Taiwan; [Yu, Ya-Ting] Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Jhongli, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chung Cheng University; National Central University,"Chen, KP (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",kongpin@gate.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Much of the literature refers to two major problems that these countries face when managing disaster: the role of government and financial restrictions. As a result, it is difficult for these countries to develop a comprehensive disaster management framework and programs. Public-private partnerships (PPP) have become a popular way for governments to engage private actors in the delivery of government infrastructure and services with the aim of increasing quality and providing better value for money. This study will explore whether Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) can be used as a strategic approach to overcome or at least to minimise the negative impacts of disasters in developing countries. Based on a study of previous literature, this paper develops a conceptual framework that describes how the partnership between public and private actors, with certain characteristics, can establish a platform for all actors to contribute towards the objectives of disaster management in developing and least developed countries.

Primary data were collected using a structured questionnaire from a representative sample of 300 rural households in Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal. The study used a logistic regression model to examine the effect of social capital on household poverty, testing the hypothesis that the possession of social capital reduces household poverty. The result of the logistic regression model indicated that, in addition to the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of some households, social capital endowments have a statistically significant negative effect on the probability of a household being poor. The study concluded that, among other factors, social capital is very important to reduce household poverty.

Firstly to find out which economic sector and which company size are the most tax neutral in the Czech Republic. The analysis is based on the effective corporate tax rate calculation. Secondly based on the correlation analyze find out whether there is significant relationship between effective corporate taxation (evaluated for individual economic sectors) and macroeconomic output. Our assumption states that effective corporate tax rates based on the backward looking micro-view are sensible on the business cycle. The calculation of the effective tax rates is based on the backward looking micro-view approach; this attitude enables to clarify differences in the tax burden between individual economic sectors. Effective corporate tax rates are calculated for individual economic sectors (based on NACE classification) in 2002-2012 period. In the following part of the paper the effective corporate tax rates are calculated reflecting the company size as well. The data necessary for the effective tax rates calculation are obtained from the BACH database. The results suggest that there are significant differences between effective corporate tax rates between individual economic sectors and between different sized companies. This result suggest that the taxation is not neutral in the Czech Republic. It is also confirmed that effective corporate tax rates are sensible on the business cycle.,"[Baranova, Veronika; Janickova, Lenka] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava 72100, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Baranová, V (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 72100, Czech Republic.",veronica.baranova@vsb.cz; lenka.janickova@vsb.cz,"Dimitriou Janickova, Lenka/HTL-8390-2023; Nálepová, Veronika/S-3472-2019","Dimitriou Janickova, Lenka/0009-0000-5059-8272; Nálepová, Veronika/0000-0002-9881-885X",,,,,19,0,0,0,2,EUROPEAN ASSOC COMENIUS-EACO,BRNO,"PEKARSKA 18, BRNO, 602 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-905405-0-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,21,30,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2MJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358899700003,0

This paper focuses on how we could motivate the affected population to develop new capacities for emergency preparedness, response and recovery. It is based on ongoing research on temporary shelters in the cities affected by floods in Ribeira Valley, Brazil; the research is conducted under an agreement between Architecture for Humanity and the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism of the University of Sao Paulo, FAUUSP. It proposes a participatory experience including residents of former quilombos - Brazilian maroon communities - and the population affected by the disasters, as well as researchers, local authorities and non-governmental organizations. It presents the results of the third NOAH workshop: Participatory Activities for the Experimentation with Vegetable Fibres, in which the group developed constructive components made from vegetable fibres. This paper aims to produce partitions for improvised shelters using local techniques, combined with waterproofing additives. The benefits go beyond the disaster relief phase since empowering those affected by the floods to engage in a new trade improves their financial condition, aiding in their post-disaster recovery. This initiative promotes participant awareness and engagement, encouraging a culture of resilience to disasters. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

The continued growth of ERP adoption in developing countries is accompanied by high failure rates which makes it impossible for these organizations to enjoy the full realization of benefits. Many ERP systems' failures are associated with the misalignment between the ERP requirements and the expectations of the client. Until academics, organizations, vendors and consultants understand better the phenomenon of misfit, the realization of benefits from ERP systems is likely to remain difficult and unpredictable on practical perspective This paper seeks to investigate the complexities inherent in the ERP systems, which subsequently result in misalignment and this will equip decision makers to better prepare strategies that will increase the probability of realizing the desired results.

A Panel Bootstrap Method is conducted to indicate statistical exactness of Panel Data Envelopment Analysis. Bootstrapping DEA panel data approach was used in empirical analysis despite being an important statistical tool for improving the estimation accuracy. Technical efficiency is modelled as a function of sugarcane yield and production factors. The results from the deterministic, indicate that the statistical properties, technical efficiency in term of sugarcane yield per rai* is significantly influenced by Area planted per rai and Rainfall (mm Lilit) as rainfall regional factors. In addition, scale efficiency analysis shows that for two ordinarily long years, the technical efficiency analysis of farm households involved in sugarcane production can be adopted for policy recommendation based on bootstrapping DEA panel data approaches because the mean of bootstrapping Panel DEA approach equal to the mean of DEA approach in the panel data setting in both 2008 and 2011 only.

Using a national representative dataset of elementary schoolchildren, we estimate a mixed multinomial logit model to cope with the potential endogeneity issue, and examine how different types of food preparations for school meal programs may affect children's weight in different ways. The results indicate that children who go to schools which serve lunch meals prepared by school kitchens tend to have lower weight on average. In contrast, children who go to schools offering lunch boxes purchased from outside restaurants tend to have higher weight on average. From a policy standard point of view, our findings could shed some light on how school lunch policy can be designed to help prevent children's obesity.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 1 Roosevelt Rd,Sec 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,"chang, hung-hao/0000-0003-2296-134X",National Science Council in Taiwan,"National Science Council in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The author thanks four anonymous reviewers and the journal editor for valuable comments, as well as the Department of Health in Taiwan for making the data available.

We develop an overlapping generations model in which fertility decisions and capital accumulation are endogenously determined in the presence of social security. In our model, children are an alternative savings technology as they transfer resources to their retired parents. Important feedback links arise between fertility and social security variables: an expansion of social security benefits reduces fertility partially offsetting the effects of relaxing the one-child policy. The feedback loop between social security variables and fertility suggests that abandoning fertility restrictions may not be as effective in helping to finance China's intended pension reform, especially if children are an important source of old-age support. The sustainability of the pension system is particularly at risk in the event of a growth slowdown. The objective of pension reforms may also be incongruent with other reforms, such as financial liberalization and financial integration.","[Coeurdacier, Nicolas] Essec Business Sch, Paris, France; [Coeurdacier, Nicolas] London Business Sch, London, England; [Coeurdacier, Nicolas] SciencesPo, Dept Econ, Paris, France; [Guibaud, Stephane] Ecole Normale Super, Ulm, Germany; [Guibaud, Stephane] SciencesPo, Paris, France; [Guibaud, Stephane; Jin, Keyu] London Sch Econ, London, England",ESSEC Business School; University of London; London Business School; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Coeurdacier, N (通讯作者)，SciencesPo, Dept Econ, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,26,15,17,7,65,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

In these conditions, it is a widespread belief that the increase of employment represents an incentive of return to economic growth. Consequently, the alleviation of the labour taxation is very important to stimulate the employment rate growth. In this paper we made an analysis of the evolution of some macroeconomic indicators (labour taxation, GDP, FDI, trade openness, inflation) for the E.U. member states. Further on, using a panel date model we investigated the influence of the macroeconomic indicators upon the employment rate. The econometric results revealed that the GDP and FDI have a positive influence and the factors with a negative influence are labour taxation, trade openness and inflation, reflecting a normal economic situation.","[Cristescu, Amalia; Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania; [Stanila, Larisa] Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Cristescu, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania.",cristescuamalia@gmail.com; madalina.andreica@gmail.com; larisa.stanila@incsmps.ro,"Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/AAK-8233-2020; Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/F-8696-2011","Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/0000-0002-0589-4010; Stanila, Larisa/0000-0002-5069-8756",,,,,21,0,0,0,11,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1039,1046,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300107,0

The paper focuses on how do human rights address the most vulnerable in society, with the view of assessing if and how they can enhance the resilience of individuals also when confronted with natural disasters. As put by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies: 'a disaster occurs when a hazard impacts on vulnerable people'. The paper focuses on both governments and individuals. In relation to governments it discusses the notion of responsibility to protect from human rights violations. In relation to individuals, it looks at how to enhance their agency in society through the observance of human rights. It considers among other factors the access of individuals to relevant information, participation in decision-making and education. The conclusion is that human rights can enhance individuals' resilience to face natural disasters, hence the article argues that human rights shall inform disaster-related programs and studies.

The paper analyses the manner The Bank of England and The European Central Bank have reconsidered the architecture of the regulatory and supervisory system to meet the challenges raised by the recent crisis. The main conclusion of the study is that there is no one size fits all supervising system and that its architecture depends on the specific financial history of a country, its economic development, culture, the concentration and openness of their financial systems, etc.","[Donath, Liliana; Cerna, Veronica Mihutescu; Oprea, Ionela] West Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,,liliana.donath@e-uvt.ro; veracerna@yahoo.com; oprea.ione@yahoo.ro,"Donath, Liliana Eva/AAI-8631-2020",,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-020-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,280,285,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346751900039,0

The study found that the Altman Z' Score (1983) can serve as a barometer for classifying Lebanese manufacturing companies within the same sub-business sector. This finding can be used by banks for classifying their clients, by companies for evaluating their performance, and by investors for selecting stocks. First, small banks that cannot afford buying those expensive rating systems can employ the Z' score to quantify the risk of the customers applying for a loan. Second, companies can set up for a manufacturing industry benchmark, make self-evaluation to track their ranking, and take necessary corrective actions ahead of time.

Therefore, this paper modifies the procedure of Kilian and Park (2009) and investigates how explicit structural shocks that characterize the endogenous character of changes in oil prices affect three large NIEs' stock-market returns, in order to fill this gap. From the empirical analysis, we find that the impact of oil price shocks on stock prices in these large NIEs is mixed, partly in contrast to the effects on the U.S. and developed countries' stock markets. This result is also consistent with the previous empirical findings that the NIEs' stock markets are partially integrated with the other stock markets and oil price shocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

(2013) is applied to the aggregated agri-food exports of eleven European countries to the US, which is currently the major partner of the EU in agricultural trade. The outcomes suggest, that the exchange rate nonlinearities are even more pronounced in agri-food than in total exports. European exporters seem to benefit more from Euro depreciation, than its appreciation harms them.

Using images, the participants were asked to evaluate different car interiors, in which the colours and materials of certain components were systematically changed. The study has shown some initial indications of the relationship between design features and certain aspects of brand personality.

This orientation challenges a separation between the market and development, situating fair trade within global processes that incorporate agrarian histories of social change and conflict. Reframing crisis as a condition of agrarian life, rather than emphasizing its cyclical manifestation within the global economy, reveals how market-driven development encompasses the material conditions of peoples' existence in ambiguous and contradictory ways. Drawing on the case of coffee production in Nicaragua, experiences of crisis demonstrate that greater attention needs to be paid to the socioeconomic and political dimensions of development within regional commodity assemblages to address entrenched power relations and unequal access to land and resources. This questions moral certainties when examining the paradox of working in and against the market, and suggests that a better understanding of specific trajectories of development could improve fair trade's objective of enhancing producer livelihoods.","[Fraser, James] Univ Sussex, Dept Anthropol, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Fisher, Eleanor] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Arce, Alberto] Wageningen Univ, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Sussex; University of Reading; Wageningen University & Research,"Fisher, E (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",j.a.fraser@sussex.ac.uk; e.fisher@reading.ac.uk; Alberto.arce@wur.nl,"Fraser, James A/E-6119-2014","Fisher, Eleanor/0000-0001-6042-6706; Fraser, James/0000-0003-0718-6832",,,,,83,17,23,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The container, like any technical innovation, has a functional (within transport chains) and geographical diffusion potential where a phase of maturity is eventually reached. Evidence from the global container port system suggests five main successive waves of containerization with a shift of the momentum from advanced economies to developing economies, but also within specific regions. These waves are illustrative of major macroeconomic, technological and sometimes political shifts within the global economy. They do not explain the causes, but simply the consequences in the distribution in container traffic and growth (or decline). Yet, they provide strong evidence that containerization has a cyclic behavior and that inflection points are eventually reached, marking the end of the diffusion of containerization in a specific port or port range. Future expectations about the growth of containerization thus need to be assessed within an economic cycle perspective instead of the rather linear perspectives. (C) 2013 Elsevier. Ltd.

Recent research has overturned many widely accepted beliefs about corporate governance during this period. In particular, the evolution of American corporate governance has not followed a simple, linear trajectory, beginning with small, well-governed firms and ending with large, poorly governed ones. Over time, economic and institutional changes have given rise to successive generations of corporations with their own governance problems and their own mechanisms to address those problems. When existing governance mechanisms failed, the United States experienced corporate governance crises-episodes that shattered investors' faith in corporate management and the legal institutions intended to protect their rights. The resolutions of these crises have sometimes been found in legal innovations and, in other cases, in institutional or market-based solutions.","[Hilt, Eric] Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA; [Hilt, Eric] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Wellesley College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hilt, E (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA.",ehilt@wellesley.edu,,,,,,,91,14,17,1,31,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4806-9,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

An important and indispensable part of the intellectual capital is human capital, which is a necessary factor for the existence of an organization and for the enterprise's functioning. Knowledge, skills, experiences and the loyalty of employees to the organization, such as competencies, are the greatest capital of the organization, and that's the reason for the increasing role and function of the competency approach as an effort to develop intellectual capital. Within intellectual capital it is necessary to address the quality of current or future employees also (in sustainable development strategy of industrial enterprise), respectively of competencies, which employees have.

The main aim of the article is to point out the importance of personnel selection and suitability application Multi-Criteria Decision Making method, specifically Analytic Hierarchy Process in the personnel selection. Selecting personnel is an important issue, yet often difficult task. It is complicated because of more than one criteria. This article considers a real application of personnel selection using the opinion of experts by one of the group decision making models, it is called AHP method. The effort of a system approach for evaluating competencies in each process creates assumption for the application of multi-criteria evaluation of options methods.

The vulnerability of all elements of the intercity transportation system (i.e., roads, bridges, abutments, retaining walls, and tunnels) is assessed considering the interdependency among the structural, transportational and geotechnical components of the network under different seismic scenarios. Both the direct earthquake-induced damage, as well as the indirect socio-economic loss attributed to reduced network functionality are taken into account in an explicit and transparent formulation that is then displayed in space through an ad-hoc developed GIS-based software. The methodology and the decision-making tools developed are adequately modular, for them to be utilized after appropriate adaptation by local authorities in identifying, prior to a major earthquake event, those vulnerable components of their network whose failure may have a disproportional socio-economic impact. In this way, a rational and effective emergency plan can be deployed to minimize potential human, social and financial loss after a future earthquake. The outline of a foreseen application is also presented for the case of the road network of the Region of Western Macedonia in Greece. Through this pilot application, the methodology is to be optimized in real conditions before being cast in the form of a fully parameterised seismic risk tool, to be used in other earthquake prone areas as well.

This paper analyses a very specific case, comparing the impacts of transportation generated by the logistics of two brands of Italian canned tomato purchased in Sassari (Sardinia, Italy), one extending over the whole continental Italian territory, the other mainly located in the island of Sardinia. Different sale (supermarket chain vs. independent retailers) and shopping (foot vs. car) modalities are also considered. The contributions to global warming, local pollution and traffic congestion are considered. The case study shows that the logistics of the national brand is much more polluting than the regional, not only because of the longer distance between origin and destination, but also because the additional distance that is needed to reach logistic hubs is not compensated by higher load factors. Instead, the logistics of the regional brand is based on a very efficient point-to-point organization. This result is generalizable to all regional supply chains featuring high volumes of product. Results of the case study also depend on: a) the high impact of packaging transportation, because of the very low weight/volume ratio of empty cans; b) the high CO2 emission coefficient of lorries and trailers transportation by ferry (Ro-Ro). The case study also stresses the very high impact of shopping by car. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the most complete studies on this subject, we find the work of Carol Yeh-Yun Lin and Leif Edvinsson (2011) who presented a study on this subject, applied to 40 countries. Aiming to help to increase the knowledge in this area, we used the Biplot methodology, applied to the data studied by these authors and we have identified natural groupings in the 40 countries studied. Constructing a Biplot in which countries and variables are represented simultaneously, it appears that the variable most closely related to Intellectual Capital is PC (Processes Capital), having maximum association with data first principal component. Using the coordinates of the countries in a Biplot graphic, we have obtained a classification of countries into homogeneous groups respecting five variables - Human Capital, Renovation Capital, Financial Capital, Market Capital and Processes Capital - depending only from the scores of those variables that differ in some important points from country clusters, obtained by the geographical criteria and used in the publication referred above.

Within this context, the aim of this research is to investigate (based on econometric regression models) the impact of 5 corporate governance characteristics related to board remuneration on the contemporaneous and next year's performance (measured as ROA/ROE) using a sample of large groups listed on the London Stock Exchange between 2010 and 2011. Through this study we intend to make a contribution to the academic literature on the unsettled issue concerning the relationship between corporate governance and corporate performance. The empirical results proved a significant relationship between non-executive directors' basic fee, fees paid in shares and additional remuneration for board committee membership (as corporate board compensation characteristics) and both contemporaneous and subsequent financial firm performance.

The EU Member States individually committed to support the financial sector for a total about EUR 4.6 trillion (i.e. 39% of EU-27 GDP in 2009). Those public interventions have significant budgetary consequences (strongly felt in Greece, Spain or Italy) and imposed a heavy burden on the present and future generations. Therefore there is a strong consensus not only on the level of the European Union but also internationally, that financial sector should contribute to the public finance more fairly. Moreover, with respect to the fact, that the crises was the result of complex interaction of market failures, global monetary and financial imbalances and weak supervision, it has been argued, that taxes could be used as regulatory tools. However, the imposition of FTT on financial sector is very sensitive issue. Due to this fact it will not be implemented through the directive (requiring the unanimity of all EU Member States) but rather through enhanced cooperation (i.e. only by countries willing to do that - by EU-11). The aim of the paper is to research, whether the revenues from the imposition of financial transaction tax through enhanced cooperation could be used as a new own resource of EU budget and whether it would enable to replace GNI contribution of EU-11 as announced by the European Commission.

However, Gastro Diplomacy is capable to brand a state via social convention culinary--arising warfare approach to stimulate resilient nationalism spirit amid citizenry, simultaneously perpetuating and intensifying identity for economic benefits.

These effects, commonly known as territorial cohesion effects, are receiving increasing attention in the research literature. However, there is little empirical research into the sensitivity of these cohesion results to methodological issues such as the definition of the limits of the study area or the zoning system. In a previous paper (Ortega et al., 2012), we investigated the influence of scale issues, comparing the cohesion results obtained at four different planning levels. This paper makes an additional contribution to our research with the investigation of the influence of zoning issues. We analyze the extent to which changes in the size of the units of analysis influence the measurement of spatial inequalities. The methodology is tested by application to the Galician (north-western) HSR corridor, with a length of nearly 670 km, included in the Spanish PEIT (Strategic Transport and Infrastructure Plan) 2005-2020. We calculated the accessibility indicators for the Galician HSR corridor and assessed their corresponding territorial distribution. We used five alternative zoning systems depending on the method of data representation used (vector or raster), and the level of detail (cartographic accuracy or cell size). Our results suggest that the choice between a vector-based and raster-based system has important implications. The vector system produces a higher mean accessibility value and a more polarized accessibility distribution than raster systems. The increased pixel size of raster-based systems tends to give rise to higher mean accessibility values and a more balanced accessibility distribution. Our findings strongly encourage spatial analysts to acknowledge that the results of their analyses may vary widely according to the definition of the units of analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The reform was part of the restructuring of the social security system and was aimed at rising private long-term saving by making pension funds more attractive and convenient. We control for unobserved saver heterogeneity and a central focus is on substitution across saving instruments. We find that the pension fund legislation had a strong effect on the allocation of saving and triggered substantial substitution of non-tax-favored non-retirement wealth for tax-favored pension funds. In contrast, we find that it had little, if any effect on household saving flows.

In the Czech Republic, as elsewhere, there are still stereotypical beliefs about older workers. These stereotypes emphasize the health and social aspects of workers age 50+ in the labour market, resulting in the fact that this age group of workers becomes unpopular and unattractive to the organizations which prefer youth. The research presented in this paper promotes a positive view of older workers based on their knowledge and qualifications, which are still often overlooked and undervalued. Knowledge and skills as important parts of older workers' qualifications represent their main work potential. Thanks to years of experience, workers over age50possess knowledge and skills which are often crucial to the organization's development and success. Considering the fact that older workers generally possess a company's essential knowledge, practices of knowledge management should be focused also on these workers. With respect to this fact, inasmuch as knowledge management has a human (social) dimension, it may be seen as a part of strategic human resource management within a company. Human resource management strategies focusing on workers over age 50 and an appreciation of their knowledge and skills are rarely evinced. The organization either does not identify this potential at all (because it is not considered important) or works with this potential insufficiently and unsystematically. For this paper, a questionnaire was prepared and data were collected from employees under age 50 within personnel departments, management positions as well as administrative staff and production workers. The aim of this paper is to present the survey results and to determine how younger employees perceive older workers' knowledge in terms of organizational value, what they think about the possibility of older workers' training and development, and how they view retirement. Several additional topics are discussed as well, e.g., the possibility of older workers' career progression or their willingness to learn from younger ones. Results of the survey show that younger workers consider older workers to be valuable company resources. However, their opinion about older workers' training and development is not so positive. The survey results break down the stereotypes against older workers in society and also represent a useful part of a pilot study within one of the author's dissertation focusing on knowledge management (as a part of human resource management) among workers age 50+.

These consequences deserve more attention as financial markets are incomplete, imperfect, and economic agents' access to them is often limited. This limits households' ability to insure against household-specific (or sector-specific) shocks and magnifies the distributional effects of aggregate macroeconomic fluctuations and associated policy responses. These effects are likely to be even larger in emerging market and low-income economies beset by financial frictions. The political economy surrounding distributional consequences can sometimes lead to policy measures that reduce aggregate welfare. I argue that it is important to take better account of distributional rather than just aggregate consequences when evaluating specific policy interventions as well as the mix of different policies.","[Prasad, Eswar S.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Prasad, Eswar S.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Prasad, Eswar S.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Cornell University; Brookings Institution; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Prasad, ES (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,,57,6,8,0,8,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

In terms of the common electricity and natural gas market through the Directivesof the European Union (2009/72/EC and 2009/731EC),large progress has been made. Transmission/transportation and distribution networks have become associated entity which provides access to all producers and customers within a single market of the European Union, with the aim of competitive production and supply of energy. Increased number of bidders has forced companies to be more competitive in production and to offer more innovative solutions. Due to the liberalization of the market,it is necessary to protect end users as well as companies that have network (regulated) activity.In this case the national regulator has the essential role to ensure safe and inexpensive transmission and distribution of energy to end users through optimal investment costs, and in the same time to ensure return of investments for energy operators. There is a large number of examples of bad praxiswhich influenced on the lack of competitiveness of individual energy systems, and it is the reason why the national regulator is so important in protection of both participants. The European Union did not deal with the district heating through the Directives, due to the fact that the transfer of thermal energy among Member States is not expected because of the large loss of the thermal energy over a long distances.Therefore, the district heating is left at the legislation of the Member States, so that the intensity of development district heating, especially liberalization, depends on the strategic development and knowledge of the country. Most transitionment of the country, so they had bad experiences.However, district heating with a well defined legal framework and of course, with a good awareness of the citizens themselves, has great advantages. The most important thing is that one network can receive thermal energy from different energy sources enabling diversification of sourceswhich may have an impact onthe price of primary energy, and consequently the price of thermal energy. In Croatia, as well as in the most transition countries, there are huge problems related to district heating.Almost all companies dealing with district heating and central supply of thermal energy have had a loss in the amount of over 200 million in last six years. On the other hand, consumers are dissatisfied with the price of the service. Because of that, most of themhave disconnected from the central production system and switched to use combi boilers that caused significant investment costs. The aim of this study is to investigate the causes that have led to difficulties in the business of energy operators and to point out the deficiencies of the existing district heating systems. Also, we wantedtomake an overview of new measures needed to be done in order to give encouragement to the development of district heating systems as a competitive, safe and efficient system.","[Pudic, Dalibor] Croatian Energy Regulatory Agcy, Zagreb, Croatia; [Candrlic-Dankos, Ivana] Osijek-Baranja county, Osijek Baranja, Croatia",,"Pudic, D (通讯作者)，Croatian Energy Regulatory Agcy, Zagreb, Croatia.",dpudic@hera.hr; ivana.candrlic-dankos@obz.hr,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,7,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,841,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000064,0

It is argued that Fried's counterfactual analysis conducted to invalidate Quesada's conclusion relies on untenable presumptions: (i) that the rules to identify the values of a social welfare function say something about how these values must have been obtained; and (ii) that counterfactual analysis can be conducted in an environment where causes and effects cannot be unequivocally established.","Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Quesada, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Avinguda Univ 1, Reus, Spain.",aqa@urv.cat,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2014,158.0,1-2,,,,,253,259,,10.1007/s11127-013-0114-6,0.0,,,7,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AA3FZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330979600019,0

Second, we ask whether energy efficiency in private plants was affected by the presence of MNEs or SOEs in high-energy-consuming industries. In 1996, private energy intensities were often positively correlated with the presence of SOEs and majority-foreign MNEs and negatively correlated with the presence of wholly foreign or minority-foreign MNEs, but in 2006 the corresponding results differed substantially. This suggests that ownership-related differentials in energy intensity and intra-industry energy-intensity spillovers are not pronounced. If policymakers are concerned with improving energy efficiency in Indonesian manufacturing, plant ownership should not be a major consideration.","[Ramstetter, Eric D.] Kyushu Univ, Int Ctr Study East Asian Dev, Fukuoka 812, Japan; [Narjoko, Dionisius] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Senayan, Dki Jakarta, Indonesia",Kyushu University; Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia,"Ramstetter, ED (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Int Ctr Study East Asian Dev, Fukuoka 812, Japan.",,,,,,,,53,9,9,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The company's liquidity position is especially important in today's globalized and highly competitive business environment, as well as in times of economic and financial hardships characterized by decreasing cash inflows and deteriorating market conditions. In order to predict, manage, and evaluate the liquidity position, the company utilizes specific analytical tools and measures. Apart from usual static measures of liquidity such as liquidity ratios (e.g. current and quick liquidity ratios), the cash conversion cycle (or cash gap cycle) represents dynamic measure, which incorporates the element of time in the consideration. The cash conversion cycle is defined as a number of days between actual cash outflows on a company's purchase of needed productive resources and actual cash inflows resulting from product sales. It measures the time between outlay of cash and cash recovery from a company's regular course of operation. During that period of time, the financial funds are tied up in the current assets, such as payables, inventories, and receivables. The shorter cash conversion cycle, stated in a number of days, indicates better liquidity and working capital position of a company. Quick cash recovery is a permanent business consideration, especially in the short term and in smaller firms. A successful management of the cash conversion cycle implies the effective management of individual components of current assets. The company management undertakes a different set of activities to decrease inventory and receivables conversion periods, as well as to increase payables deferral period in order to shorten the cash cycle and quickly release the funds that are invested in a working capital. The concept of cash gap is closely related to the net working capital management and it is regarded as a method for cash flow management. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present an overview of the cash conversion cycle concept and its importance in relation to the measurement of the liquidity position of a company. The relations between the cash gap and net working capital management will be explained, as well as basic financial management implications of the concept for the company's business operations. Additionally, the concept will be illustrated with a sample of companies that makes the index CROBEX10 of the Zagreb Stock Exchange.","[Stojanovic, Slobodan] Polytech Lavoslav Ruzicka, Vukovar, Croatia",,,stojanovic@vevu.hr,"Stojanović, Slobodan/HGA-8337-2022",,,,,,8,0,2,1,14,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,358,368,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000026,0

It firstly appraises similarities and discrepancies observed in this development in China when compared to India, for which the experience has been more widely reported to the international community. It then examines the data obtained in Hebei Province. The results reveal strong competition with a large number of cultivars, including a substantial share of illegal cultivars, and, paradoxically, show high seed prices. In return, this competition is heightened by growers' strategies for adapting to uncertainty when buying seeds. The future of commercial seeds and the use of biotech cultivars are at stake. Competition without some form of control and regulation could be detrimental to both growers and operators in the cultivar and seed sector and could jeopardise investment in breeding and biotechnology.","[Wang, Guiyan] Hebei Agr Univ, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Fok, Michel] CIRAD, UR SCA, F-34398 Montpellier, France",Hebei Agricultural University; CIRAD,"Fok, M (通讯作者)，CIRAD, UR SCA, Ave Agropolis,TA B102-02, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",Michel.fok@cirad.fr,"Yang, Min/JPY-3791-2023","FOK, Michel/0000-0001-8709-5687",,,,,52,2,2,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Using a unique data set of monthly loan payments remitted to investors combined with administrative data from a national counseling agency, this study estimates the effects of default counseling on the probability that troubled mortgage borrowers will lose their homes to foreclosure. Borrowers are actually more likely to miss loan payments after receiving counseling, but the probability of losing a home to foreclosure drops after counseling, suggesting that counseling policies may be beneficial during housing crises.","[Collins, J.

The key point is that we do not impose any dependence structure, but let the data select it. To do so, we model the dependence between commodity (metal, agriculture and energy) and stock markets using a flexible approach that allows us to investigate whether the co-movement is: (i) symmetrical and frequent, (ii) (a) symmetrical and mostly present during extreme events and (iii) asymmetrical and mostly present during extreme events. We also allow for this dependence to be time-varying from January 1990 to February 2012. Our analysis uncovers three major stylised facts. First, we find that the dependence between commodity and stock markets is time-varying, symmetrical and occurs most of the time (as opposed to mostly during extreme events). Second, not allowing for time-varying parameters in the dependence distribution generates a bias towards an evidence of tail dependence. Similarly, considering only tail dependence may lead to false evidence of asymmetry. Third, a growing co-movement between industrial metals and equity markets is identified as early as 2003; this co-movement spreads to all commodity classes and becomes unambiguously stronger with the global financial crisis after Fall 2008.

In this paper we analyze a new channel through which institutions influence aggregate savings and economic development. Whereas research in the field of savings decisions concentrates largely on the level of the individual, the literature on institutions and growth as well as on aggregate savings formation focuses on the aggregate, national level. First, we develop a framework that brings together both lines of reasoning, arguing that institutions may influence the individual savings decision as well as national savings in aggregate. This potential for institutional quality to influence economic performance has been neglected so far.

This paper uses quotes on these derivatives to construct probability densities for inflation. We study how these probability density functions respond to news announcements and find that the implied odds of deflation are sensitive to certain macroeconomic news releases. We also estimate empirical pricing kernels using these option prices along with time series models fitted to inflation. The options-implied densities assign considerably more mass to extreme inflation outcomes (either deflation or high inflation) than do their time series counterparts. This yields a U-shaped empirical pricing kernel, with investors having high marginal utility in states of the world characterized by either deflation or high inflation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Simulation results show a tendency toward rising relative real wages between skilled and unskilled workers. However, GDP and social welfare in major East Asian economies have tended to rise with China's openness and growth. Outputs of almost all non-agricultural industries but the moderately human capital (unskilled labor)-intensive manufacturing groups have declined. It seems that income effects from China's growth overpower factor substitution effects, so that a larger China has made all the other economies, and the agents within them, better off. On an elemental level, this stands to reason since China's expansion confers on the rest of the world a large term of trade gain.","[Lin, Kuo-Jung] Chihlee Inst Technol, Dept Int Trade, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hsu, Sheng-Ming; Chang, Ching-Cheng; Hsu, Shih-Hsun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Ching-Cheng] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Hsu, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",m577@ntu.edu.tw,,"HSU, SHIH-HSUN/0000-0002-1758-3746",,,,,30,0,0,1,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

This is partially due to continuous-time setup which makes it difficult to incorporate heterogeneous beliefs in the second moment. In a two-period exponential-normal model with Bayesian learning, I demonstrate that heterogeneous prior variances give rise to the economic value of option markets. Investors speculate in option market and public information improves allocation efficiency of markets only when there is heterogeneity in prior variances. Heterogeneity in mean is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for generating speculations in option markets. With heterogeneous beliefs, options are non-redundant assets which can facilitate side-betting and enable investors to take advantage of the disagreements and the differences in confidence. This fact leads to a higher growth rate in the investors' certainty equivalents and, thus, a higher equilibrium interest rate. Furthermore, option exhibits a unique feature of enabling signal precision to affect the ex ante risk premium of underlying asset, which quadratic derivative and stock do not have.

Year 2030 household energy demands and GHG emissions estimates are compared under five different land use and transport policy scenarios. Application of an urban growth boundary provided the lowest increase in overall vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and GHG emissions, while network additions resulted in the highest rates of increase. Average energy consumption per household are estimated to fall over time (by 11-19% depending on the scenario), but the region's overall energy consumption is estimated to increase dramatically - by nearly 88% in terms of home energy consumption (in the base scenario) and 108% in the transport sector, relative to the 2005 base-year scenario. Such increases are considerably higher than proposed GHG targets, presenting a serious energy and emissions challenge for Austin as well as other U.S. regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The conditional LCAPM allows for a time-varying decomposition of the total illiquidity premium into a level component and three risk components. The estimated average annual total illiquidity premium for US stocks 19272010 is 1.74-2.08%, which is substantially lower than in most previous studies. The contributions from illiquidity level and illiquidity risk are 1.25-1.28% and 0.46-0.83%, respectively. Of the three illiquidity risk components, risk related to the hedging of wealth shocks is the most important, while commonality risk is the least important. The illiquidity premia are clearly time-varying, with peaks in downturns and crises, but with no general tendency to decrease over time. The level premium and the risk premium are significantly positively correlated, at around 0.35; indicating that in periods of turbulence both illiquidity cost and illiquidity risk premia tend to be high.

Large loans continued to flow to many of Brazil's historic large firms and industrial sectors - as reported widely - but the data also show significant numbers of smaller loans to firms in all sectors, as well as renewed support for internationalisation and innovation.

The analysis reveals that a lack of trust in banks, memories of past banking crises and weak tax enforcement are important factors.

We find strong evidence of switching cointegration between PCA-defined ratios and default risk. This occurs in 1993 and coincides with the adoption of PCA legislation. We conclude that PCA is effective in reducing default risk. In contrast, there is no clear evidence of cointegration between the PCA-defined ratios and credit risk.

However, Red Queen-type responses by competing organizations in the form of rapid imitation and escalating of technology investments erode the ability of the investing organizations to sustain gains in profitability. Productivity gains from these investments may persist, but they may not translate into sustained profitability gains owing to declining prices brought about by a hypercompetitive environment. The emergence and erosion of benefits attributable to capital investments is examined by decomposing profitability into productivity, price recovery, product mix, and capacity utilization, and by regressing each performance measure on past technology investments. A polynomial distributed lag model is estimated with quarterly data for 30 firms in the mobile telecommunications services sector from 1996 to 2005. The results indicate that capital investments are positively associated with productivity of current and future periods, and their association with profitability is only positive in the future (after six quarters). These results highlight a unique outcome of the Red Queen hypothesis: simply by imitating, learning, and investing in technology due to competition is beneficial to all firms in the industry.","[Banker, Rajiv] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Dept Accounting & Informat Technol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Cao, Zhanwei] China Merchants Secur, Fixed Income Sales & Trading Dept, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Menon, Nirup M.] George Mason Univ, Informat Syst & Operat Management Sch Management, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Mudambi, Ram] Temple Univ, Dept Strateg Management, Fox Sch Business, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; George Mason University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Menon, NM (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Informat Syst & Operat Management Sch Management, 4400 Univ Dr,MS 5F4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",banker@temple.edu; zhanwei.cao@gmail.com; nmenon@gmu.edu; ram.mudambi@temple.edu,"Mudambi, Ram/A-8580-2008; Mudambi, Ram/N-1145-2019","Mudambi, Ram/0000-0002-5396-5602",,,,,67,22,22,1,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In either case, it is always assumed that the nature of the special interest groups remains constant over time. The hypothesis of this paper is that a dynamic relationship exists between politicians and lobbyists, i.e., that opportunities for rent extraction for special interest groups can evolve over time. In the short run politicians may support projects proposed to them by lobbies, because they yield clear economic benefits. However, continued governmental support may imply a cost to society and yield rents to the lobbies. A theoretical framework in which established and new lobbies overlap is developed to model a government's incentives to behave in a manner consistent with the hypothesis. In this framework, voters can still rationally reelect politicians even if the latter support lobbies for an inefficiently long period of time, because if they did not, then the quality of the pool of new projects would deteriorate.","Ifo Inst, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut,"Friedrich, S (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",friedrich@ifo.de,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2013,157.0,1-2,,,,,287,304,,10.1007/s11127-012-9945-9,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,213WI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324090700017,0

Though there is a strongly held view that the system of private car use may be impossible to shift, in this paper we consider one mode of car-based mobility - carsharing - through which subtle challenges to the dominant regime are made. Carsharing is an emerging transportation industry in which drivers access a fleet of shared vehicles for short-term use. This paper pursues a conceptual and investigative exploration of the emergence and endurance of carsharing as an alternative mode and offers a number of novel insights into ways the private car system might be challenged. Using a practice based framework of analysis, we focus not on the various structures or agents influential in carsharing's relative success, but on the way carsharing endures as a routinely performed social practice. It reveals a wide range of mundane footholds for behavioural change, as well as demonstrates the profound complexity implied by any attempt to challenge, and change, deeply entrenched practices of day-to-day mobility.

However, a number of well-documented concerns with the use of self-reported headship as an analytical category have suggested that headship is often a relatively blunt unit of analysis. Against the backdrop of a large and growing difference in income poverty rates between self-reported female- and male-headed households in post-apartheid South Africa, this study considers several alternative definitions of headship that have been proposed in the development literature. The findings suggest that there is an association between self-reported female headship and a female household member being identified as the main breadwinner. However, the conventional definition of headship is likely to underestimate the growing risk of income poverty in female-headed households (relative to male-headed households) compared with several alternative definitions. The findings also suggest that alternative definitions of female headship may be more appropriate given the narrow way in which the household is defined in most national surveys. The article concludes with a discussion of the methodological and policy implications for alternative headship based studies of poverty.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Built Environm & Dev Studies, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Rogan, M (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Built Environm & Dev Studies, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa.",rogan@ukzn.ac.za,"Rogan, Michael/D-2275-2017","Rogan, Michael/0000-0003-1695-8179",,,,,63,17,18,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Competing theories also suggest opposite predictions about TOM's impact on selling price. The article examines the price-TOM relationship against the background of varying market conditions and highlights the impact of these conditions on the relationship. The theoretical analysis extends search theory and Lazear's model to changing market conditions and reconciles their predictions on the relationship. The empirical analysis refines the investigation of the price-TOM relationship by revealing the cross-effect of market conditions and TOM on price. The findings confirm that the price-TOM relationship can indeed be positive or negative depending on these conditions. However, except for the case of an extremely bad market, the relationship is generally positive. This outcome occurs because search effort (indicated by TOM) brings significant price benefit that is large enough to offset all but the worst market price declines. Additional analysis confirms that the findings are not altered by the potential endogeneity between price and TOM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Based on literature findings, we decompose the CSR effect into four factors: accounting opacity, corporate governance, stakeholder risk, and overinvestment. We find that all of them significantly affect both the absolute forecast error on EPS and its standard deviation controlling for forecast horizon: number of analysts and forecasts: and year, industry, and broker house effects. Consistently with our ex ante hypotheses, overinvestment, stakeholder risk, and accounting opacity have a positive effect, increasing both dependent variables, while corporate governance quality has a negative effect. A crucial aspect of our findings is that high CSR quality in terms of the four factors (i.e., accounting transparency, high corporate governance quality, stakeholder risk mitigation, and absence of overinvestment) contributes to making earnings forecasts unbiased as unbiasedness is generally met in the subsample of the Top CSR quality companies and markedly violated in the subsample of the Bottom CSR companies.

The average corporate tax rate in the new member states has always been considerably lower than the average in the EU15 countries. The new members' entry into the EU eliminated capital barriers, allowing firms to locate in one of the new member states with full access to the European Market. We use a spatial regression framework to test the hypothesis that tax reactions among European countries are asymmetric. Our results only find significant tax interaction between EU15 countries and new member states.

These insights derive from econometric analysis, when possible, and case studies of country experiences. Broadly, booms financed through credit and involving leverage are more likely to warrant a policy response. In that context, macroprudential measures can be targeted more precisely to specific sources of risk, but they may prove ineffective because of circumvention.

If developed, a future generation could deploy them to limit the damages caused by the atmospheric carbon stock inherited from the current generation, despite their negative side effects. Should the current generation develop these geoengineering capabilities for a future generation? And how would a decision to develop SRM impact on the current generation's abatement efforts? Natural scientists, ethicists, and other scholars argue that future generations could be more sanguine about the side effects of SRM deployment than the current generation. In this paper, we add economic rigor to this important debate on the intergenerational transfer of technological capabilities and pollution stocks. We identify three conjectures that constitute potentially rational courses of action for current society, including a ban on the development of SRM. However, the same premises that underpin these conjectures also allow for a novel possibility: If the development of SRM capabilities is sufficiently cheap, the current generation may for reasons of intergenerational strategy decide not just to develop SRM technologies, but also to abate more than in the absence of SRM.","[Goeschl, Timo; Heyen, Daniel] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Moreno-Cruz, Juan] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Goeschl, T (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Bergheimer Str 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",goeschl@eco.uni-heidelberg.de; heyen@eco.uni-heidelberg.de; juan.moreno-cruz@econ.gatech.edu,,,,,,,38,24,26,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Conversion factors required to estimate the pressure on these currencies are computed using a time-varying coefficient regression. We then use our measures of currency pressures to assess deviations of exchange rates from their market-equilibrium levels. For the yen, our measure of currency pressure suggests undervaluation during the initial part of our estimation period, a period during which the Bank of Japan sold yen in the foreign exchange market. We find persistent undervaluation of the yuan throughout the estimation period, with the undervaluation peaking at about 20% in 2004 and 2007. For the pound, the results indicate low pressure - suggesting a mainly free-floating currency - throughout the sample period. These results appear consistent with the policies pursued by the central banks of the currencies in question. J. Japanese Int. Economies 29 (2013) 1-20.

This paper studies the effects of strategic patenting on R&D, patenting and market value in the computer software industry. We focus on two key aspects: patent portfolio size, which affects bargaining power in patent disputes, and the fragmentation of patent rights ('patent thickets') which increases the transaction costs of enforcement. We develop a model that incorporates both effects, as well as knowledge spillovers. Using panel data for 121 firms covering the period 1980-99, we show that strategic patenting and spillovers affect innovation and market value of software firms, that there is a patent premium accounting for 20 per cent of the returns to R&D, and that software firms do not appear to be trapped in a prisoners' dilemma of 'excessive patenting.'","[Schankerman, Mark] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Lubbock, TX USA; [Noel, Michael] London Sch Econ & CEPR, St,London, Houghton WC2A 2AE, England",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Schankerman, M (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Lubbock, TX USA.;Noel, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & CEPR, St,London, Houghton WC2A 2AE, England.",michael.noel@ttu.edu; m.schankerman@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,72,82,7,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

That justification is that future generations may not exist. In an earlier article published here, I explained this view, and criticized economists who deviate from it: the practical aspect of this deviation is to choose discount rates which are far too high, thus relegating future generations to lower utility than they a priori have a right to. As well, many economists continue to rely upon a utilitarian ethic, a reliance which is independent of the discounting issue, but which I also criticize. Dasgupta responded to my article; the present article is a response to Dasgupta.","Yale Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Roemer, JE (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",john.roemer@yale.edu,,,,,,,11,5,7,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

To make this comparison, we use loan-level data to determine how borrower balance sheets and bank liquidity are related to bank lending decisions and how monetary policy can affect these relationships. The key innovation in this paper is the use of loan-level data. This enables us to measure the independent effects of the two channels and directly account for borrower balance sheets and lender liquidity instead of using proxies. Our results show that the balance sheet channel is the main mechanism through which monetary policy shocks are transmitted to the economy and that the lending channel does not play a significant role.

Subjects decide how many boxes to collect out of 100, one of which contains a bomb. Earnings increase linearly with the number of boxes accumulated but are zero if the bomb is also collected. The BRET requires minimal numeracy skills, avoids truncation of the data, allows the precise estimation of both risk aversion and risk seeking, and is not affected by the degree of loss aversion or by violations of the Reduction Axiom. We validate the BRET, test its robustness in a large-scale experiment, and compare it to three popular risk elicitation tasks.

In addition to the roles played by rating agencies and complicated financial engineering, speculative short sales have been put into question. However, laypeople's moral judgments about this type of financial speculation have rarely been investigated in economic psychology. The present study aims to fill this gap. Across four studies, we find that laypeople's moral judgments of short selling are significantly harsher than their judgments of long positions. Both successful (Study 1) and unsuccessful (Study 2) short selling receives harsher moral judgments. In addition, studies which manipulate the moral character of the shorted asset (Study 3) or the time horizon of the investment strategy (Study 4) support the conclusion that short selling is considered less moral than taking a similar long position. The results present consistent support for a judgment bias of economic laypeople in the domain of financial economics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

All latitudinal analyses show the characteristic consumption cliff and affluent uplands shape: e.g. at low per capita GDP, life satisfaction increases sharply up the cliff with rising GDP; after a threshold, well-being is independent of GDP across the affluent uplands. Longitudinal analyses of Japan, UK and USA since the 1950s show per capita GDP has grown between 3- and 8-fold, but mean levels of well-being remained unchanged. Consumption patterns are now converging on those typical in affluent countries. Indicators for seven baskets of countries: Affluent North America-Europe-Oceania, Affluent Asia, fast developing BRICs and CIVETS, high income Resource Extractors, Poor with Green Peaks, and the Poorest show the factors of consumption between the poorest and affluent (5- to 100-fold) and the fast developing and affluent (2- to 10-fold). A finite planet cannot resource such convergence. One indicator, climate change, grows more of a concern as evidence emerges, yet denial remains strong. A priority is to create opportunities for divergent ways of living. Although material culture has been sought as the means to meet personal well-being, it has failed both the affluent and poorest. A green economy will require human attachments to both place and possessions, thus reducing disposal and damage. Such entanglement produces high affiliation that improves life satisfaction, as does much non-material consumption. As yet, most political and economic systems are far from recognising these imperatives, though there have been notable policy innovations. A shift to a green economy is inevitable. It is simply whether it occurs before or after the world becomes locked into severe climate change and other consequences of harm to natural capital.","Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Pretty, J (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",jpretty@essex.ac.uk,"Pretty, Jules/D-4071-2012","Pretty, Jules/0000-0002-3897-6581",,,,,143,67,71,2,148,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We describe the key design characteristics of these policies and analyse them against the criteria of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, economic efficiency, administrative feasibility, and public acceptance. We find that the clean electricity standard is estimated to reduce four to six times more emissions per year by 2020 than the carbon tax, but at an average cost per tonne of CO2 reduced that is significantly higher than the carbon tax at its current level. Interestingly, the clean electricity standard achieves higher and steadier levels of public acceptance, which might be attributed to its lack of visibility, relative to the carbon tax.","[Rhodes, Ekaterina; Jaccard, Mark] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Rhodes, E (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",,,"Rhodes, Ekaterina/0000-0001-7722-422X",,,,,47,14,16,1,30,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Our estimates of this program's impact on deforestation, between 1997 and 2000, range from zero to one-fifth of 1% per year (i.e., deforestation is avoided on, at most, 2 out of every 1,000 enrolled hectares). The main explanation for such a low impact is an already low national deforestation rate. We also consider the effect of enrollment. Predicted deforestation on enrolled versus nonenrolled hectares, and matching analyses suggest an enrollment bias toward lower clearing threat. Enrolling land facing higher threat could raise payments' impact on deforestation.","[Robalino, Juan] CATIE, Environm Dev Initiat, Cartago, Costa Rica; [Pfaff, Alexander] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC USA",CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; Duke University,"Robalino, J (通讯作者)，CATIE, Environm Dev Initiat, Cartago, Costa Rica.",,,"Robalino, Juan/0000-0003-1450-7382",,,,,56,94,112,0,55,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0023-7639,1543-8325,,LAND ECON,Land Econ.,AUG,2013,89.0,3,,,,,432,448,,10.3368/le.89.3.432,0.0,,,17,Economics; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,245QO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326479100003,0

To find the rates, however, we need to know in advance the path of efficient permit prices, which is difficult to obtain. This study intends to solve this problem in two ways. First, we analyze a special case in which the permit interest rates are given by a simple rule. For example, if the marginal abatement cost of pollution emission is constant, then the appropriate rate is to equal the monetary interest rate. As is the case for global warming, if the damage is caused in the future far beyond the planning period of the environmental program, the appropriate rate coincides with the marginal self-recovery of environmental stock under certain conditions. As a second approach, we propose a tradable permit system with a permit bank, as a mechanism by which the permit interest rates are generated endogenously without governmental intervention other than the issuance of permits. However, we also show that this approach raises the problem of indeterminacy of the equilibrium.","[Akao, Ken-Ichi] Waseda Univ, Sch Social Sci, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan",Waseda University; Tohoku University,"Akao, KI (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Sch Social Sci, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda Shinjuku, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",akao@waseda.jp; managi.s@gmail.com,"Akao, Ken-Ichi/AAD-7903-2021; Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23330065, 24651034, 23380126] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,23,2,2,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper models the relative route level within three multiple-airport regions (MARs) in the United States: Boston, Washington, and San Francisco. Although passenger-level surveys provide the researcher with the most detailed information on how travelers choose between airports and airlines, as well as geographic information about both the start and end of a journey, such data are often difficult or expensive to obtain. Here, we use freely available aggregate data from the U.S. Department of Transportation and linear models to assess whether passenger levels on routes involving airports within the three cities vary in relation to known correlates of airport choice. The results show that they do, and that variables such as the Southwest effect, fare, and market size, among others, help explain the complexity of air-travel pat-. terns within MARs. Importantly, the results point to the difficulty in easily classifying cities or airport pairs into simple groups. We conclude that aggregate data can be used to establish initial evidence of the strength of a functional multi-airport region and, as such, may prove useful in informing individual traveler-based research and as inputs to policy decisions.

In this article, the Spanish HSR high-speed rail network is used as an argument against certain HSR investments. Several of the data presented by the author are misleading and some of the information given in connection with Spain is incomplete. As the Journal of Transport Geography is widely read by policymakers and the scientific community, Button's misrepresentation could cause serious damage. We therefore set out to clarify the data used by Kenneth Button and to explore some points in greater detail, although in no case eschewing criticism of Spain. Although excessive Spanish investment in public infrastructure over the last twenty years has probably had a negative impact on the real estate bubble, investments in HSR infrastructure in Spain have specifically been accompanied by two particular facts that need to be distinguished from other countries' experience. These facts cannot be overlooked and will be discussed in this paper. They relate firstly to the total amount of European funds used in HSR construction and secondly to the technological and scientific innovations developed in Spain linked to the HSR market.

Past research is almost unanimous in finding that as the number of parties in a country's legislature or government grows, so does its probability of overspending. However, this finding is based largely on parliamentary systems, and there is no reason to believe that it should hold when executives are independent. In this article, I develop a theory for the impact of legislative fragmentation on budgetary politics in presidential democracies. I argue that unified presidential systems should tend most toward fiscal solvency but that increasing fragmentation should actually facilitate budget balancing when government is divided. The logic is that presidents, who are likely to prefer balanced budgets due to their broad constituencies, will be better able to craft acceptable governing coalitions from divided legislatures than from ones controlled by a single opposing party. They will also be better able to circumvent such fragmented legislatures should a coalition prove impossible. I test these propositions quantitatively in all presidential democracies from 1976 to 2007. The results provide support for the theory and highlight the contrasting impact of legislative fragmentation on public policy in presidential vs. parliamentary systems.","[Hankla, Charles R.] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Hankla, CR (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 4069, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",chankla@gsu.edu,,,,,,,53,4,5,1,21,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

When they are trained, workers can value part of the skills on the labour market. This general effect of training should theoretically impact the wage in the firm. Employees may find it also valuable to train in specific technologies if they are able to capture a share of the firm's rents (Oosterbeek, Sloof and Sonnemans [2007]; McDonald and Solow [1981]). Using a simple model, it is possible to isolate each of these two effects on wages, given that fixed capital investments themselves generate a specific effect of rent sharing. Estimations are based on panel of firms over the 2000-2007 period. On-the-job training productivity gain sharing would be around 30 to 50 % for employees. Results suggest that the main, if not only, sharing channel would be the specific effect. The latter would operate at the collective rather than individual level, which would explain why surveys highlight only a small impact of on-the-job training on wages.","Minist Travail, F-75902 Paris 15, France",,"Lê, J (通讯作者)，Minist Travail, 39-43 Quai Andre Citroen, F-75902 Paris 15, France.",jerome.le@travail.gouv.fr,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,24,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

In particular, we examine 157 major tenant bankruptcy announcements of retail real estate firms over the 2000 to 2010 period. The contracting mechanism associated with retail leases provides several unique features such as percentage rents and co-tenancy clauses that are absent in other type of leases. We find that in a good economy, a tenant bankruptcy has a less negative or more positive effect on a landlord's stock return, which is consistent with the growth option hypothesis. We also find that landlords who have properties located in markets with a highly diversified economic base are more likely to exercise the growth option given a tenant departure and thus realize higher stock returns.","[Liu, Crocker; Liu, Peng] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Liu, C (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",chl62@cornell.edu; peng.liu@cornell.edu,,,,,,,39,19,23,0,17,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

We estimate that reducing water consumption by 25 % would require imposition of a price on water consumption of around . Similarly, introduction of a water abstraction charge of about would be sufficient to reduce water abstraction by 25 %. We find that if revenues from water pricing are returned in lump sum to households, the introduction of water pricing would result in a modest welfare loss. When revenues from water pricing are used to offset existing taxes, we find a gain in welfare corresponding to a 'strong double dividend.'.","[Rivers, Nicholas] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Groves, Steven] Simon Fraser Univ, Energy & Mat Res Grp, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Ottawa; Simon Fraser University,"Rivers, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Desmarais Bldg,11th Floor,55 Laurier East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",nrivers@uottawa.ca; slgroves.work@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,18,20,1,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The system of airline hubs, namely hub classification and spatial allocation, has been necessarily affected by the era of airline mergers in the first 13 years of the 2000s. However, existing two-to-three-tier hub classifications and the set of metrics that define these tiers may not be sufficient to capture the changes in airline hub practices due to mergers. In this study, we seek to broaden the existing method of establishing a hub hierarchy by including operational metrics along with the classic accessibility and passenger metrics, and to utilize this re-defined hierarchy to examine airline hubbing practices before and after an era of mergers. Using k-means clustering on data from 2004 (pre-merger) and 2012 (post-merger) comprising the entire-U.S. airline network, we find that hubs fall into more than three tiers and that flight frequency at a hub is a key variable in defining hub hierarchy. We find that the exclusion of frequency from hub hierarchy definition has geographic consequences, as we overstate the importance of small coastal hubs when frequency is not included as a metric. In addition, we find that hub hierarchies are well-defined post-merger, in contrast with pre-merger, such that the tier level implies a consistent, commensurate level of all metrics. This finding has implications for hub definitions across research and practice, including broadening the federal hub definition and including tiered hierarchies in the field of hub location modeling.

We develop and test the claim that government partisanship influences the security of business firms' property rights: the perceived security of property rights increases when right-wing parties take power and declines with the election of left-leaning parties. Unlike research that uses country-level aggregates to draw inferences about the determinants of secure property rights, we analyze survey responses of over 7,400 firm owners from 73 countries using a novel difference-in-differences approach. We find that the political partisanship of the government in power strongly affects individual perceptions of property rights: firm owners are more likely to perceive that their property rights are secure under right-leaning governments. Our results are robust to firm- and country-level economic performance as well as controls for political institutions that might induce more stability to property rights, such as the number of checks and balances (veto players) in a system. Overall, our results indicate that business owners' beliefs about the security of property rights are highly responsive to changes in government partisanship.","[Weymouth, Stephen] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Broz, J.

The Finnish co-operative wave that began in the mid-1990s provides a useful setting for testing the hypothesis that co-operative formation rates are higher in depressed economic conditions. The empirical results support this hypothesis. Co-operatives are formed more often in regions with high unemployment; in contrast, conventional firms are formed more often when unemployment is low and demand growth is high. Furthermore, the existence of dedicated advisory services boosts the formation of co-operatives.

As argued in the new structural economics, the factor endowment structure in an economy determines its optimal industrial structure. Firms operating in different industries and applying different technologies have different characteristics in firm size and risk. Since various financial institutions have their own strengths and weaknesses in providing financial services, there is an appropriate financial structure for the economy at its particular development level. As the economy develops, the appropriate financial structure for the economy evolves correspondingly. The basic patterns of actual financial structure in the real world are consistent with these predictions.","[Lin, Justin Yifu] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xifang] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Jiang, Ye] Ind & Commercial Bank China, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Seoul National University (SNU); Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),"Lin, JY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",justinlin@ccer.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,67,35,38,7,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

However, these positive correlations are attributed to the sorting effect in which workers with some specific features choose to find jobs in industries with rapid technological change and higher job risk.

We compare startups that locate into one of these zones with startups on the outside, while controlling for self-selection using treatment evaluation methods. The results indicate that firms locating in an ETDZ achieve much higher export values, driven by higher volumes of trade and numbers of destinations.

Our paper suggests a novel approach to distinguish between these long-term growth trends and short-term fluctuations. Based on provincial data from 1978 to 2009, our results indicate that China's provinces only diverge over the short-term. Over the long term, provinces cluster into two converging growth clubs.

But are self-employed individuals also happier, more satisfied with their lives as a whole? High job satisfaction might cause them to neglect other important domains of life, such that the fulfilling job crowds out other pleasures, leaving the individual on the whole not happier than others. Moreover, self-employment is often chosen to escape unemployment, not for the associated autonomy that seems to account for the high job satisfaction. We apply matching estimators that allow us to better take into account the above-mentioned considerations and construct an appropriate control group (in terms of balanced covariates). Using the BHPS dataset that comprises a large nationally representative sample of the British populace, we find that individuals who move from regular employment into self-employment experience an increase in life satisfaction (up to 2 years later), while individuals moving from unemployment to self-employment are not more satisfied than their counterparts moving from unemployment to regular employment. We argue that these groups correspond to opportunity and necessity entrepreneurship, respectively. These findings are robust with regard to different measures of subjective well-being as well as choice of matching variables, and also robustness exercises involving simulated confounders.","[Binder, Martin; Coad, Alex] Max Planck Inst Econ, Evolutionary Econ Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Coad, Alex] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England",Max Planck Society; University of Sussex,"Binder, M (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Evolutionary Econ Grp, Kahlaische Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",binder@econ.mpg.de,"Binder, Martin/AAF-6448-2020; Coad, Alex/H-8938-2012","Binder, Martin/0000-0002-5053-3804; Coad, Alex/0000-0002-5706-0528","ESRC [ES/J008427/1, ES/H008705/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H008705/1, ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,83,193,218,5,137,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Bank stability may respond differently to house price changes or deviations from fundamental values in an economic boom environment than in a bust circumstance. A threshold estimation technique developed by Hansen (1999) is applied to a panel of 286 U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) over the period 1990Q1-2010Q4. We consider two house price indicators: the house price changes and the house price deviations from long-run equilibrium. The results suggest the existence of income growth threshold effects in the relationship between house prices and bank instability. Specifically, there are two income growth thresholds when using the house price changes and one income growth threshold when the house price deviations are applied. Robustness results using the non-MSAs sample from 1995Q1 to 2010Q4 provide further evidence of income growth threshold effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the presence of dual distribution arrangements, wherein consumers can purchase products either from traditional retail firms or directly from suppliers, can notably alter disclosure incentives. As under prevailing views, a retailer disclosing positive news risks entry by competitors. However, entry shifts the incumbent supplier-retailer relationship: the presence of new competitors leads the supplier to treat its retailer more as a strategic partner, translating into lower wholesale prices. This, in turn, can lead the retailer to willingly share favorable news, since such disclosure invites entry precisely when the retailer stands to benefit most from price concessions. Our results suggest that as dual distribution continues to increase in prominence, firms may be more willing to voluntarily disclose sensitive financial information particularly that which points to high demand for its products.

This result cannot be explained by standard risk factors. It is distinct from existing anomalies in the stock market or volatility-related option mispricing. It is consistent with market imperfections and constrained financial intermediaries.

Controlling for limits to arbitrage proxies reduces the strength of the negative relation between delta-hedged option return and idiosyncratic volatility by about 40%.

In this study, we use time geography to provide a theoretical framework for examining the effects of time-varying fluctuations in gasoline prices and their relationship to traffic safety in a case study of Mississippi from April 2004 to December 2010. Application of time geography theory suggests that gasoline prices act as one type of capability constraint of the space-time path. As gasoline prices increase (that is, as the capability constraint becomes stronger), we hypothesize traffic crash rates decrease, and they decrease more for groups for whom the constraint is stronger. The results corroborate the hypotheses and suggest that gasoline prices have stronger effects on reducing less severe crashes and negligible effects on reducing fatal crashes. Gasoline price effects on reducing crashes start at a 9-month lag, peak at a 12-month lag, and diminish after an 18-month lag. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The politically powerful use earmarking as a means of resolving uncertainty and insulating preferred policy from the reach of future government. Tax revenue will be earmarked more often when political power is unified under one party or when a party has the legislative majority needed to overturn a gubernatorial veto. An empirical test of the theoretical predictions are conducted using a panel of data for US states. A state with a legislature controlled by a single party with a large enough majority to overturn a gubernatorial veto will earmark 5% more of its tax revenue than other states and a state with a unified government will earmark 6.5% more.

The main emphasis is on a generalization of the dual lower and upper bounds to the case of mixed buyer and seller exercise, along with a detailed analysis of the sharpness of the bounds. As it turns out, the method as well as the convergence analysis can even be extended to conditional exercise rights and autotrigger strategies. These theoretical results are accompanied by a detailed description of the algorithmic implementation, including a robust regression method and the choice of suitable basis functions. Detailed numerical examples show that the algorithm leads to surprisingly tight bounds even for the case of high-dimensional callable Bermudan pricing problems.","[Mair, Maximilian L.; Maruhn, Jan H.] Markets, Quantitat Prod Grp, UniCredit Grp, D-81925 Munich, Germany",UniCredit Group,"Maruhn, JH (通讯作者)，Markets, Quantitat Prod Grp, UniCredit Grp, Arabellastr 12, D-81925 Munich, Germany.",maximilian.mair@unicreditgroup.de; jan.maruhn@unicreditgroup.de,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

An application to recent consumer credit data shows that our procedure yields parameter estimates which are significantly different (both statistically and economically) from the case where customers who were refused credit are ignored. This has obvious implications for commercial banks as it shows that refused customers should not be ignored when developing scorecards for the retail business. We also show that forecasts of defaults derived from the method proposed in this paper improve upon the standard ones when refused customers do not enter the estimation data set.

However, central bankers can only protect their independence by compromising with the elected officials who grant them their independence. Policy, therefore, is likely to be a weighted average of the preferences of the central bank and the government. Consequently, central bankers may be eager to help right-wing governments stay in power and oppose the election of left-wing governments. We show evidence from the United States that interest rates (a) decline as elections approach when Republicans control the White House, but rise when Democrats do; and (b) are sensitive to the inflation rate (output gap) when Democrats (Republicans) are in the White House. Thus, the Federal Reserve is a conditional inflation hawk. Since the Fed became operationally independent in 1951, the Republicans have exhibited a decided electoral advantage in presidential politics.","[Clark, William Roberts; Arel-Bundock, Vincent] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Clark, WR (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, 505 S State St,5700 Haven Hall, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",wrclark@umich.edu,,,,,,,24,18,21,0,18,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

This paper investigates which motives shape the support for a minimum corporate tax among politicians. We make use of a unique data base: a survey among members of the European parliament. Our results confirm that the politicians ideology as well as individual characteristics such as educational background exert a major influence. Moreover, several predictions regarding national interests are derived from various standard tax competition models. These hypotheses are partly supported by the data; in particular, different national preferences towards social equality shape the support. A comparison with survey results from the German Bundestag reveals that German politicians on the national level do not show different attitudes towards tax rate harmonization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our results suggest that business cycle peaks lead federal elections rather than the other way around. Such a finding reinforces the hypothesis of strategic election timing for such countries and is insightful in helping to explain why the presence of a political business cycle is harder to establish for parliamentary governments where the date of the next election is under the control of the incumbent governing party than in democratic systems where governing durations and election dates are fixed.

We extend the LM-type test of Ma and Nelson (2010) that remains valid under weak identification to the bivariate VARMA-GARCH model of consumption and dividend growth. The results cast doubt on the validity of long-run risk as an explanation for the equity premium puzzle. We also evaluate the approach of Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2007a), which extracts long-run risk by regressing consumption growth and its volatility on predictive variables. The results using the Bonferroni Q-test of Campbell and Yogo (2006) suggest that consumption and dividend growth are generally unpredictable by the price-dividend ratio and risk-free rate.

The considered private attributes include product attributes, process attributes and source attributes, as well as consumers' confidence in product and process quality. The considered public attributes are the two source attributes of supporting local farmers and transportation distance. By carrying out standardized face-to-face interviews with pedestrians in 2011 and 2012, a total of n=550 consumers were interviewed. The target regions of the study were the former Eastern German federal states. Study employs an ordered logit regression model and investigated weekly markets and farm shops as two direct marketing channels. Results show that in addition to socio-demographic characteristics, public and private attributes of food products significantly influence the likelihood of buying from direct marketing channels. If consumers perceive that food sold directly by farmers is fresh or they think that their purchase supports local producers, consumers are more likely to buy from weekly markets. Consumers who find it important to know where food is produced and those who do not find it difficult to reach farm shops are more likely to buy at these direct marketing outlets. Moreover, the study finds that frequent farm shop buyers do not perceive direct marketing products as being too expensive. The study results imply that considering consumer behavior separately for the different direct food marketing channels, rather than considering all direct buyers at once as done in some studies, would be fruitful.","[Bavorova, Miroslava; Lehberger, Mira] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, Karl Freiherr von Fritsch Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Lehberger, Mira] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Bavorová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, Karl Freiherr von Fritsch Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",miroslava.bavorova@landw.uni-halle.de; unaygailhard@iamo.de; mira.lehberger@landw.uni-halle.de,"Lehberger, Mira/ADE-6096-2022",,,,,,42,0,0,1,14,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,180,198,,,,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300017,0

To evaluate the interconnectedness between agriculture and energy sectors, the input-output analysis was used. The input-output model was constructed for four sectors of the Czech economy: Agriculture; Manufacture of coke, refined petroleum products; Production, collection and distribution of electricity, gas and heat; and Collection, purification and distribution of water. The analysis gave the following results. If an agricultural output increases by 1 million CZK, the sector Agriculture has to purchase energy in the amount of 0.074 million CZK from monitored sectors. The final demand multiplier which shows the indirect effect of energy consumption in backward linked sectors caused by changes in inputs of directly affected sectors, is relatively high for agriculture because this sector is strongly interrelated with the energy-intensive fertilizer sector. However, the highest multiplier is for the sector of production, collection and distribution of electricity, gas and heat. This is because this sector is strongly interrelated with raw materials production whose production and transport are highly energy demand.","Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Dept Rural Dev, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Bednaríková, Z (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Dept Rural Dev, Manesova 75, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic.",bednarikova.zuzana@uzei.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,13,19,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300001,0

The first type of academic degree in land surveying was organized at the universities of Ghent and Liege and led to the degree of Licence in Geography, option Land Surveying.

Since the introduction of these degrees, they were subject to a series of changes which differ for the Flemish (Dutch speaking) Region and the Walloon (French speaking) Region of Belgium.

Furthermore, due to a recent decree on higher education in Flanders (Dutch speaking part of Belgium), the Master in Applied Engineering Sciences in Land Surveying will be integrated into the universities of Ghent and Leuven as of October 2013 and will lead to a Master of Science in the Industrial Sciences: Land Surveying. The paper focuses on the implications of the changes in the legislation on education in Land Surveying and Geomatics at University Colleges and discusses the impact of the integration of the Master in Applied Engineering Sciences in Land Surveying in the Flemish universities.","[Deruyter, Greta; Vandedrinck, Frank] Univ Ghent, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Ind Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Deruyter, Greta; Nuttens, Timothy; Stal, Cornelis; De Wulf, Alain] Univ Ghent, Fac Sci, Dept Geog, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Deruyter, Greta; Vandedrinck, Frank] Univ Coll Ghent, Fac Appl Engn Sci, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; HOGENT University College of Applied Sciences & Arts,,,"Deruyter, Greta/C-6389-2015; Stal, Cornelis/ABE-9028-2020","Deruyter, Greta/0000-0002-7258-125X; Stal, Cornelis/0000-0002-4704-8330",,,,,4,0,0,0,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,557,564,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400074,0

The attention of our philologists focused more on linguistic aspects on loans, predominantly of a descriptive perspective. All these included: the etymology, the means of ingression for technical terminology into Romanian, the areas of words circulation, their graphic adaptation, the phonetic and morphological adaptation, and also the way the words or expressions in the dictionaries were recorded. First, the main purpose of this study was to research the relation among loans, loan translations and translations in the evolution of Romanian Scientific language. Implicitly, we referred to the times of their ingress in Romanian, and the stage of development and their usage in the specialized registry or in the common language. Then, we tried to examine the adapting process of computer vs. geographical terms to the specific of Romanian language, their integration into various styles of language, i.e., phonetic, morphological, lexical and semantic problems of these words. Finally, we did an inventory and a statistics of the corpus selected from working material for the present research, and we found out that the terminology of IT language reached an impressive number, greater than Geographical one. Therefore, we may affirm that most of the Romanian IT vocabulary, nowadays, comes from the English language, about 90%, compared to the Romanian geographical lexicon of French origin which is about 51.66%.","[Diaconu, Dana Camelia] Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Romania",Valahia University of Targoviste,,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,573,579,,,,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400076,0

It will be increasingly important to have the best idea about mortality in individual matters. In our study we are focussing on the analysis of the development of the life expectancy at an exact age x. The life expectancy is not the sole characteristic of length of life. The second indicator is the normal length of life, which is also a very frequently used indicator. For the equalisation of specific mortality rates we use what is so far the most-used Gompertz-Makeham model.

The issue of the quality of data sources and individual indicators entering the analysis is discussed in detail. While in the period between the years 1995 and 2003 the influence of ICT services prevails in the period 2003 and 2011 the influence of ICT using sectors grew much stronger in comparison. In both periods the importance of ICT manufacturing industry is negligible, which is also caused by the methodology of estimation of gross value added and recalculation into constant prices, as well as the low share of value added on production in that sector.

Specifically, there are changes in sectoral employment, demographic changes and changes in the social structure of the population. Rural restructuring is understood as a process that affects different levels of individual sites, thus leading to an increase in the heterogeneity of rural areas. The aim of this paper is to describe the existing heterogeneity in the Czech countryside. In our research, we find whether there is a dependence of selected socio-economic indicators on the size groups of municipalities and the character of settlements in typological regions. As an indicator of the character of settlements OECD typology is used. This typology divides regions according to population density into significantly rural regions, predominantly rural regions and predominantly urban regions. The methodology of this paper is based on the evaluation of municipalities in relation to the OECD typology and size groups of municipalities. For each category of typology selected socio -economic characteristics (migration balance, sectoral employment, education structure and the unemployment rate) are observed. Furthermore, the differentiation of these indicators by size of municipality and district is analyzed. On the basis of indicators, it can be demonstrated that the smallest municipalities in rural areas have worse socioeconomic characteristics. The analysis also shows considerable diversification of selected indicators, depending on the geographical location of the region, which plays an important role in the process of rural restructuring.","[Hrabak, Jiri; Capkovicova, Andrea] Ustav Zemedelske Ekon & Informaci, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Hrabák, J (通讯作者)，Ustav Zemedelske Ekon & Informaci, Manesova 75, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic.",Hrabak.Jiri@uzei.cz; Capkovicova.Andrea@uzei.cz,"Hrabák, Jiří/ABH-5712-2020","Hrabák, Jiří/0000-0003-2639-4485",,,,,26,0,0,1,8,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,261,273,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300023,0

Peer review has been determined to have multiple benefits in the learning process (Sondergard and Mulder, 2012) and there is continued interest in student engagement and involvement in the educational process (Falchikov and Goldfinch, 2000; Goldberg et al, 2010). This research was conducted to determine if there were consistent differentials, or patterns in the peer grading that could be utilized to further understand the potential impact on student grades with the use of summative peer evaluations in this type of interactive assessment activity. The data was reviewed in aggregate, and then on individual, booth by booth comparison. The evaluation grades from the peer or 'novice' evaluators were within the same range as those provided by the faculty or 'expert' evaluators. The research also introduced a variant on peer evaluation as the peer evaluators were senior year students three years ahead of their 'peers'. The available information on peer assessment studies targeting year one students is limited (Nulty, 2011) and this case study provides further evidence of the use of peer evaluation in first year of post-secondary.","[Humby, Ross] Higher Coll Technol, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",Higher Colleges of Technology - United Arab Emirates,,ross.humby@hct.ac.ae,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,943,951,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100101,0

With some simplification is possible to evaluate the flexibility of the labour market of the country on the basis of the proportion of positions offered part-time. The issue of labour market is a complex mechanism that can have a serious impact on the whole economic process. The experience of Western Europe shows that the more flexible is the labour market; the unemployment is lower and productivity higher. The situation in the Czech Republic is at this moment completely different. The Czech Republic is one of the states with the lowest proportion of part-time workers in the EU. Low diversity of the labour market and the lack of part-time jobs disqualify not only parents, but also young and people over 50 years old. Czech labour market is therefore still a little flexible enough and also less focused on work and life balance.","[Langhamrova, Jana] Univ Econ Prague, Prague 13000 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,xlanj18@vse.cz,"Vrabcová, Jana/G-6312-2015","Vrabcová, Jana/0000-0001-7086-5024",,,,,4,1,1,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,741,747,,,,,,7,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100074,0

It is focused both on entrepreneurs owning and managing a young firm and on nascent entrepreneurs who do steps towards launching a new venture. Demographic, socioeconomic, psychological and other factors influencing early entrepreneurial activity were analyzed based on data gathered from representative samples of adult population in the Czech Republic in 2006 (n = 2 001) and 2011 (n = 2005). Unlike some earlier work on the subject, binary choice models were used in order to quantify the ceteris paribus effects of individual factors. Results showed that, ceteris paribus, men, people with higher entrepreneurial self-efficacy and people who know somebody else, who has launched a new business recently, more often involved in early entrepreneurial activity. The probability of such involvement grew, depending on the utilized model, till 36 to 46 years of age and decreased onwards. For both the phase of nascent entrepreneurship and that of start-up management, entrepreneurial status in society and the level of education were insignificant. Region and fear of failure played a larger role in nascent entrepreneurship, while gender and household income were significant factors related to the next phase of launching and managing a new business. Gender inequality related to start-up early management in between 2006 and 2011 increased. Overall, the study (1) shows robust findings concerning entrepreneurial entry in the Czech Republic, (2) differentiates between factors influencing nascent entrepreneurs and start-up owner-managers, and (3) provides policy recommendations for mitigating the negative role of entrepreneurial activity inhibiting factors.","[Lukes, Martin; Zouhar, Jan] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Ocko, Petr] Minist Ind & Trade Czech Republ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Lukes, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",lukesm@vse.cz; jan.zouhar@vse.cz,"Zouhar, Jan/E-9659-2013; Lukes, Martin/G-2677-2019","Zouhar, Jan/0000-0002-1164-7948; Lukes, Martin/0000-0001-9063-9251",,,,,39,26,27,1,45,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In this paper, labour market flexibility is associated with the Employment Protection Index, which is regularly published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. High protection of employment may result in a reluctance of employers to increase the number of their employees. After a brief explanation of the composition of the summary Employment Protection Index and a short description current situation of employment protection in Member states of the European Union, the article devotes its attention to the more detailed assessments of employment protection in the Czech Republic and its neighbours in the last few years. For this purpose sub-indexes of the Employment Protection Index are used. It is believed that the flexibility of the labour market is connected with the level of unemployment and its duration. The last part of the article tries to find possible relationships between strictness of labour market protection (measured by the Employment Protection Index), the unemployment rate and the incidence of the long-term unemployment in the European Union.","[Pavelka, Tomas; Loester, Tomas] Univ Econ Prague, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,pavelkat@vse.cz; losterto@vse.cz,"Löster, Tomáš/N-2754-2017",,,,,,9,16,16,0,13,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1090,1099,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100109,0

The basic objectives of Fair Trade are defined since 2002, when it first appeared in the report of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Currently, fair trade is regulated by several international organizations that influence their business processes, create standards and help to promote it in individual countries. Substantial role in the Fair Trade have rules under which production and trade are conducted. One of the main rules is equitable distribution of retail price that allows producers to cover the cost of production itself, while it provides sufficient funds for their own livelihood. One of the tools used is to set minimum prices below which an agreement between the producer and the customer cannot drop. By a request, customers are provided with the option to get a favorable loan and allow their suppliers to develop their business. In many cases, this includes also advance payments granted a few months before the harvest. Fair Trade shops in the Czech Republic are not since their emergence accurately monitored, but the Association of Fair Trade provides estimates of number of these stores. Since 2007, the Fair Trade shops are accurately recorded. Development of retail trade turnover with fair trade products in the Czech Republic has an upward trend. Based on this, it can be concluded that the total volume of products traded within the Fair Trade also increases. In comparison to other European countries, the overall turnover of fair trade products remains, however, still relatively low. Total number of fair trade outlets does not change but the structure of these outlets is changing. In the Czech Republic, Fair Trade shops focus mainly on food items. These products are also known through Fairtrades (R) certification marks. However, there are products that are not labeled with Fairtrades (R) trademark, but are traded on the principle of Fair Trade shops. This applies in particular to craft products. Among most traded products with the certification marks belong in the Czech Republic mainly coffee, chocolate, tea, nuts and oilseeds, etc. On a global scale, the most traded are nuts and oil seeds, dried fruits, herbs and spices, followed by flowers, bananas and sugar cane. Since in the Czech Republic only 5 % of the total products traded are traded on the principle of Fair Trade there is a need to increase awareness and interest of retailers and consumers. This publicity and media campaign should be of interest to the government of the Czech Republic, as i tis in the case in other European countries. It is in the interest of the Czech Republic that a sale of quality products which respect fundamental human rights and improved working conditions of workers directly involved in the production of food, is supported.","[Regnerova, Olga; Navratilova, Miroslava; Stafek, Pavel] Ceska Zemedelska Univ Praze, PEF, Katedra Obchodu & Financi, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Regnerová, O (通讯作者)，Ceska Zemedelska Univ Praze, PEF, Katedra Obchodu & Financi, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",oregnerova@pef.czu.cz; navratilovam@pef.czu.cz; stafek@pef.czu.cz,"Regnerova, Olga/B-6291-2018; Navratilova, Miroslava/H-3769-2018","Regnerova, Olga/0000-0003-1085-6219; Navratilova, Miroslava/0000-0002-8528-1109",,,,,16,2,2,1,23,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,361,368,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300033,0

The economic literature suggests that in some contexts voluntary approaches can be effective if carefully designed but are not likely to be effective otherwise. This article provides an overview of the economics of voluntary approaches, with a particular focus on issues related to design. It seeks to highlight the features that are important determinants of both their success in improving environmental outcomes and their efficiency.

We examine several aspects of this problem, but consider the main problem to be the fact that entrepreneurial subjects enter into insolvency proceedings with a very small amount of assets compared to their liabilities. In such a situation, however, willingness on the part of creditors to enable reorganisation cannot be assumed especially given that attempts to revive such a business are in the majority of cases clearly mistaken. Insufficient debtor property is also reflected in the fact that creditors receive satisfaction only to an insufficient degree; in comparison to OECD countries, the Czech Republic most of the time significantly behind the OECD country average when comparing insolvency proceedings. One of the possible ways of improving the prognosis for using the financial rehabilitation principle and the prognosis for investors to achieve adequate fulfilment during insolvency proceedings would be to tighten present regulations regarding the possibilities of indebting a business. This is presently done by the definition of over-indebtedness, according to which the liabilities of an entrepreneurial subject may not exceed the value of his property.","[Smrcka, Lubos; Arltova, Marketa; Schoenfeld, Jaroslav] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Smrcka, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",arltova@vse.cz,"Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018","Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171; Arltova, Marketa/0000-0001-7313-6927",,,,,12,15,15,3,19,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This is but only the refinement of the rifts that have been ever deepening within the ETAA and beyond it over the last two decades or so. Since decision making has been unilaterally dominated by Washington, the logic of finding a unifying common threat that is not just self-serving has now become difficult between those in the ETAA as well as between the ETAA and those beyond it. This puts a friendly global political decision making capacity at risk, while obstructing efforts that lead towards cooperative and inclusive approaches. Contemporary security concerns belong among the most pressing global issues of our time; they require inclusive global decision making capacity that anchors itself in democratic politics than in the dwindling threat logic.

I find that when state contingent contracting is allowed adding the moral hazard friction improves the model's predictions along several dimensions. First, it justifies why non-contingent debt is an optimal way to finance an emerging economy. Second, it explains the limited consumption risk-sharing and high, volatile and counter-cyclical interest rates. Third, it generates realistic crisis-like dynamics in which capital inflows are brought to a halt and interest rates sky-rocket. The model also has a strong internal propagation mechanism.

The empirical analysis is conducted using a panel of 24 developed countries and 78 developing countries spanning 1980-2005. Our estimates highlight the importance of the technology development regime variables in driving the growth of gross domestic product per capita. In particular, the IPR regime stands out for its direct impact on growth and as a channel through which trade interacts to impact growth. The results support the view that a country's graduating into the ranks of higher income status may require that both IPR and trade regimes, particularly the former, be well developed.","[Wu, Kai; Cai, Hong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Renai] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Jefferson, Gary H.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA USA; [Jefferson, Gary H.] Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Waltham, MA USA",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Brandeis University; Brandeis University,"Jiang, RA (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jra820615@stu.xjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Each index is reviewed to determine what aspect of state tax systems are being measured and how. The article begins with a theoretical framework that informs the question of what tax rates should be measured, depending on the purpose of the intended index. It is important to distinguish, for example, whether lax rates are measured as average tax rates, marginal tax rates, statutory tax rates, or effective marginal tax rates. After analysis of the way several prototypical indices are constructed, this study also considers whether the indices actually have economic explanatory power The Tax Foundation's State Business Tax Climate Index is used as an explanatory variable in several estimated state GDP growth models. While the index has a statistically significant effect on state GDP growth in simple models, once more state-specific factors are included in the growth models the significance of the index disappears. Research suggestions are made for techniques that can be used to more effectively assess the explanatory power of state tax rankings. The conclusion of the analysis is that caution on the use and interpretation of such indices is warranted.","Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Anderson, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",janderson4@unl.edu,"Anderson, John/AAN-1893-2020","Anderson, John/0000-0002-4944-7300",,,,,27,6,7,0,10,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

To extend previous research, four online surveys examined the Big Five personality traits and material values of those who manage their money and determined the independent effects of money management on wealth, debt, and compulsive buying. Results suggest that (a) individuals who believe that material possessions can provide happiness manage their money less and (b) highly conscientious individuals manage their money more because they have positive financial attitudes as well as a future orientation. Further, money management is significantly related to increased savings, decreased debt, and less compulsive buying even after controlling for numerous socio-demographic and dispositional variables.

This period provides a unique institutional setting when interest rates may rise but not decline, thereby constraining both endogenous policy reactions to news and private market expectations. Asymmetric responses to news, to the extent that they are important in exchange rate markets as they are in equity markets, would seem particularly likely to be evident during this period. We consider several ways asymmetric responses may be manifested and linked to macroeconomic news during this unusual period. We assess whether the intraday exchange rate responds differently depending on whether the news is emanating from Japan or the US; we consider the state of the business cycle; and we distinguish between good and bad news.

In this experimental study using a within-subject design and an asset allocation problem, we detail this relationship by introducing a stage of judgment (initial knowledge about the assets to invest in) and valuation (forecasts to be made) before the investment decision. We also examine the role of expertise by comparing a group of bankers (20 loan officers) and a group of students (64), control in the role of risk aversion, and implement different measures of overconfidence (miscalibration in two formats - the BTA effect and the illusion of control). Our results show that no differences were observed between bankers and students in the degree of overconfidence. However, overconfidence seems to determine decision-making in a different way across the two groups. Concerning students, we observed that overconfidence influenced general tasks such as global knowledge of the assets but when it came to investing, risk aversion had a major effect. In contrast, bankers were strongly influenced by their overconfidence. For them, it mainly affected specific tasks (valuation and investment choices) but, surprisingly, risk aversion had no effect on investment decision. Our results suggest that introducing an assessment stage in the decision process is an aid to understanding the differences between experts and novices.

If her earnings are limited to only six months of the year she may retain transfer benefits for the remaining six months, lowering her marginal rate over the same income range to between 66.0 percent and-17.7 percent for those additional earnings.

In this study, we determine how they destroy that value. Overall, we find that value destruction by entrenched managers comes from a combination of factors. First, they disproportionately avoid private targets, which have been shown to be generally associated with value creation. Second, when they do buy private targets or public targets with blockholders, they tend not to use all-equity offers, which has the effect of avoiding the transfer of a valuable blockholder to the bidder. We further test whether entrenched managers simply overpay for good targets or choose targets with lower synergies. We find that while they overpay, they also choose low synergy targets in the first place, as shown by combined announcement returns and post-merger operating performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a novel methodology to assess the size of airport catchment areas and the airport's market shares therein using a MNL passenger choice model. The methodology is applied to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The results show that the size of its catchment area differs considerably by destination. Schiphol's market share within its catchment area declined between 2005 and 2011 due to increased competition from airports located to the south and southeast. Airports may use the presented methodology to evaluate the spatial nature of their catchment areas to understand passenger airport choice and the competitive forces in their respective hinterland regions. In addition, the methodology shows airports the effects of changes to service level offerings (in terms of frequencies and fares) on their catchment area and the market shares therein. Furthermore, the methodology may be of use to policymakers to estimate the competitive position of airports in the OD-markets served and to assess the effects of infrastructure investments on catchment area size and airport market shares.

Investments in transport thus need to seek new paradigms to solve these problems. Accessibility is a pivotal element in this context because it may induce increases in land value whereby some or all of these increments in land value resultant from the increase in accessibility can be captured to recover the capital costs of a transport investment. From this perspective the present paper reviews the main land value capture finance (LVC) mechanisms (betterment tax, accessibility increment contribution, and joint development) in relation to increased transport accessibility. The three financing instruments retain common features such as the ability to achieve wider public goals and private objectives, and they are flexible and can be implemented through different forms of financial instruments. We conclude that, for the successful implementation of a land value capture finance programme to take place, we must always consider the context (the urban area and the transport mode) in addition to the economic relationship between the life cycle of the transport system, its profitability and the property market.

This environment enables us to circumvent the main problems of observational studies on reciprocity because there is substantial transparency in individual player values and performance. Our main finding is that workers exhibit both positive and negative reciprocity toward employers who deviate from a player's perception of a fair market wage. This perception of a fair wage follows from a Mincer-type wage equation that incorporates a worker's past performance. The different results between changing and non-changing players are in line with theories of fairness perception but cannot be explained by private information from the employers or the personal career concerns of the players. Altogether, our findings provide strong evidence for the external validity of previous laboratory results on gift exchange in the labor market. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Having global operations insulates banks from changes in monetary policy, while banks without global operations are more affected by monetary policy than previously found.

Our simulations are based on a representative sample of the Italian population consisting of individuals born between 1975 and 2000. We identify three channels of redistribution: between genders (from men to women), along educational lines (from the less-well-educated to the highly educated) and between diverse lifetime-earnings quintiles (from the poor to the rich). This happens because certain groups of individuals systematically live shorter-than-average lives (men, the less well-educated and the poor), whereas others live longer-than-average lives (women, the highly educated and the rich) and, at the same time, the NDC system does not take into account such differences. Comparison between the old defined benefit system and the reformed NDC one shows that intergenerational fairness has improved sensibly but differences between gender and educational levels remained nearly the same.

Based on a detailed analysis of livelihoods across 400 households at 16 sites, the paper offers a detailed typology of livelihood strategies, linked to a class-based analysis of emerging agrarian dynamics. The paper identifies a significant and successful middle farmer group, reliant on accumulation from below through petty commodity production, existing alongside other worker-peasants and the semi-peasantry, whose livelihoods remain vulnerable, with prospects for accumulation currently limited. In addition, there are others who are accumulating from above, through patronage and corruption. While small in number, this group has significant political and economic influence, and is embedded in powerful alliances that have fundamental impacts on the wider politicaleconomic dynamics.

The purpose of this paper is to assess whether inefficiency of local governments is really affected by the degree of VFI, relying on a sample of Italian municipalities to study the determinants of spending performance.

Regarding railways, our investigation shows that the area traditionally targeted for regional policy received in 2008 slightly more government procured traffic in personal kilometers per population share than in 1989. As for civil aviation, the number of passengers travelling between the Stockholm-Arlanda airport and airports in the regional development area had increased substantially during the same period. This continuity of territorial cohesion suggests that while the new procurement policies were based on a general ambition to deregulate and liberalize the markets, they still allowed for a reproduction and assimilation of certain elements in the previous policy.

We analyze the implications of some of these actual and potential transformations, whose impact may not be homogeneous across workers of different ages. We first develop a life-cycle search and matching model which incorporates random match quality as well as elements capturing important institutional features of the Japanese economy. Our model is consistent with the life-cycle properties of Japan's labor market, namely that the job separation and unemployment rates are U-shaped, whereas the job finding rate declines with age. We then conduct three experiments that are relevant to Japan: a decline in productivity, a removal of the firing costs, and a decline in the population growth. In the first two experiments, we find substantial changes to these three rates, where young workers tend to be the most affected. We observe, however, a very small labor market impact in the third experiment. J. Japanese Int. Economies 26 (3) (2012) 326-350.

We conservatively define managerial ability as the manager's capacity to deploy the firm's resources. We verify the validity of our metric using a managerfirm matched panel data set that allows us to track managers (CEOs) across different firms over time. We find managerial ability is inversely related to the amount of time a firm spends in distress, the likelihood of a firm's failure, and the cost of failure. These results suggest that the managers of failed firms are less skilled than their counterparts. But even within failed firms there is heterogeneity in the talents of managers.","[Leverty, J.

In this framework, liquidation and verification, both of which are inefficient and. consequently the objectives of renegotiation, are devices to implement repayments. While the number of creditors affects the outcomes in the liquidation-deterrence renegotiation, the share structure affects the creditors' incentive for verification activity and consequently the outcomes in the verification-deterrence renegotiations. The optimal borrowing structure balances these effects. It is shown that borrowing structures with multiple differentiated large-share creditors can be optimal. J. Japanese Int.

Participation in the project also increased the mean income of beneficiaries by about 40-60% but the impact of the project on income of the poorest beneficiaries was not statistically significant. Additionally, sustainability of this achievement is uncertain since the project did not involve rural credit services.

The behaviors are motivated by cognitive limitations and psychological bias. In boom times, households' extrapolation bias and groupthink lead to chasing and extending asset bubbles (like tech stocks and real estate). Increasing use of debt spurs the economy and eventually overburdens households. In bust times, the biases and fear lead to selling previously popular assets at low prices. Households generally respond to bust times by spending less, repaying debt and saving more, which drags on an already slow economy. In addition, households influence businesses and governments into actions during the cycle. In the recent boom, predatory lenders preyed on cognitive limitations and biases of subprime borrowers to sell them high cost mortgages that they would not be able to repay. Another contributing factor is that during boom times, household attention is not focused on financial regulation. This is when business influences the political process and laws are enacted to loosen market regulation. These changes may extend the boom period into bubble territory. During bust times, public outcry influences politicians to tighten business regulation, likely inhibiting the economic rebound. Thus, household behavior plays an important role in economic boom/bust cycles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To what extent such campaigns affect charitable behavior is mostly unknown, however. Using giving and volunteering surveys conducted biennially from 1988 to 1996, I investigate the effect of a national fundraising campaign, Give Five, on charitable giving and volunteering patterns. The widely advertised Give Five campaign was aimed to encourage people to give 5 percent of their income and volunteer 5 hours a week. After controlling for selection into being informed about the Give Five, I find that people who were informed about the campaign increased their weekly volunteering activity on average by almost half an hour, but their giving behavior was not significantly affected. I discuss the policy implications associated with this result and argue that although the Give Five campaign did not achieve its goal, its impact on volunteering was considerable.

Yet, the process of transforming worker skills unfolded differently across industrial clusters. The paper explains this variation by highlighting formal political dynamics at the sub-national level. It finds that when local politicians have limited fiscal capacities, they are compelled to build partisan coalitions to advance industrial reform policies. Evidence from Bursa (Turkey), Istanbul (Turkey), and Cordoba (Argentina) shows that under these circumstances, governors who mobilize partisan loyalties can resolve disputes between business and labor, while others who are unable to do so cannot implement the proposed changes.

We use this variation to evaluate the importance of factors that have been put forth as having contributed to the poor performance of banks during the credit crisis. The evidence is supportive of theories that emphasize the fragility of banks financed with short-term capital market funding. The better-performing banks had less leverage and lower returns immediately before the crisis. Differences in banking regulations across countries are generally uncorrelated with the performance of banks during the crisis, except that large banks from countries with more restrictions on bank activities performed better and decreased loans less. Our evidence poses a substantial challenge to those who argue that poor bank governance was a major cause of the crisis because we find that banks with more shareholder-friendly boards performed significantly worse during the crisis than other banks, were not less risky before the crisis, and reduced loans more during the crisis.

J,"Bianchi, J; Boz, E; Mendoza, EG",,,,"Bianchi, Javier; Boz, Emine; Mendoza, Enrique Gabriel",,,Macroprudential Policy in a Fisherian Model of Financial Innovation,IMF ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRICE,"The interaction between credit frictions, financial innovation, and a switch from optimistic to pessimistic beliefs played a central role in the 2008 financial crisis. This paper develops a quantitative general equilibrium framework in which this interaction drives the financial amplification mechanism to study the effects of macroprudential policy. Financial innovation enhances the ability of agents to collateralize assets into debt, but the riskiness of this new regime can only be learned over time. Beliefs about transition probabilities across states with high and low ability to borrow change as agents learn from observed realizations of financial conditions. At the same time, the collateral constraint introduces a pecuniary externality, because agents fail to internalize the effect of their borrowing decisions on asset prices. Quantitative analysis shows that the effectiveness of macroprudential policy in this environment depends on the government's information set, the tightness of credit constraints, and the pace at which optimism surges in the early stages of financial innovation. The policy is least effective when the government is as uninformed as private agents, credit constraints are tight, and optimism builds quickly.

At the same time, difficulties in inference regarding both the likelihood and severity of disasters, as well as agency problems, can lead to significant disagreements among investors about disaster risk. We show that such disagreements generate strong risk-sharing motives, such that just a small number of optimists in the economy will significantly reduce the disaster risk premium. Our model highlights the latent nature of disaster risk. The disaster risk premium will likely be low and smooth during normal times but increases dramatically when the risk-sharing capacity of the optimists is reduced, e.g., following a disaster. The model also helps reconcile the difference in the amount of disaster risk implied by financial markets and international macroeconomic data, and provides caution to the approach of extracting disaster probabilities from asset prices, which will disproportionately reflect the beliefs of a small group of optimists. Finally, our model predicts an inverse U-shaped relation between the equity premium and the size of the disaster insurance market.","[Chen, Hui; Ngoc-Khanh Tran] MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chen, Hui] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Joslin, Scott] USC Marshall Sch Business, Marshall, AL USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Chen, H (通讯作者)，MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E62-637, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",huichen@mit.edu,,,,,,,46,60,71,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Self-assessments influenced judgment when the applications were judged by novices and experts, and regardless of whether the participants were warned about the unreliability of self-assessments. The effect was reduced but not eliminated if a second set of assessments was available. A similar influence was found when an arbitrary set of ratings was substituted for the self-assessments, and consider-the-opposite arguments to counter the self-assessments functioned in a similar way to that found in previous studies of anchoring. Overall, the effect of self-assessments seems similar to that of anchoring, when information that is known to be unreliable or unrelated to a target variable still affects estimates of the target variable. Practically, including self-assessments as a component of performance appraisal is likely to bias the results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Substantial attention has been paid to the way in which preferences vary across individuals, and there is a realisation that such differences are at least in part due to underlying attitudes and convictions. While this has been confirmed in empirical work, the methods typically employed are based on the arguably misguided use of responses to attitudinal questions as direct measures of underlying attitudes. As discussed in other literature, especially in transport research, this potentially leads to measurement error and endogeneity bias, and attitudes should rather be treated as latent variables. In this paper, we illustrate the use of such an Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model in the context of beach visitors' willingness-to-pay for improvements in water quality. We show how a latent attitudinal variable, which we refer to as a pro-intervention attitude, helps explain both the responses from the stated choice exercise as well as answers to various rating questions related to respondent attitudes. The incorporation of the latent variable leads to important gains in model fit and substantially different willingness-to-pay patterns.","[Hess, Stephane] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Beharry-Borg, Nesha] Univ Leeds, Sustainable Resources Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.hess@its.leeds.ac.uk; N.C.Beharry-Borg@leeds.ac.uk,"Hess, Stephane/AAX-2672-2020; Hess, Stephane/A-3393-2011","Hess, Stephane/0000-0002-3650-2518;",,,,,36,101,105,0,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Analysis of data from a nationwide survey of rural households shows that GMAs are positively associated with household income and crop damage from wildlife conflicts. Gains and damages were greatest among households in GMAs with greater wildlife diversity, with net gains relatively greater for wealthier households. Households in prime (well stocked) GMAs were more likely to participate in off-farm wage and self-employment compared to other rural households, but they were also more likely to suffer crop losses related to wildlife conflicts.

Hence we use modern ambiguity theories to analyze belief aggregation, thus obtaining more refined and empirically more valid results than traditional theories can provide. We can now confirm more reliably that conflicting (heterogeneous) beliefs where some agents express certainty are processed differently than informationally equivalent imprecise homogeneous beliefs. We can also investigate new phenomena related to ambiguity. For instance, agents who express certainty receive extra weight (a cognitive effect related to ambiguity-generated insensitivity) and generate extra preference value (source preference; a motivational effect related to ambiguity aversion). Hence, incentive compatible belief elicitations that prevent manipulation are especially warranted when agents express certainty. For multiple prior theories of ambiguity, our findings imply that the same prior probabilities can be treated differently in different contexts, suggesting an interest of corresponding generalizations.","[Baillon, Aurelien; Wakker, Peter P.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Cabantous, Laure] ESCP Europe, F-75543 Paris 2, France",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Wakker, PP (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",lcabantous@escpeurope.eu; wakker@ese.eur.nl,"Baillon, Aurélien/E-6961-2012","Baillon, Aurélien/0000-0002-0169-9760",,,,,93,27,30,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

One recent analysis identifies the New England lay share system as a form of non-capitalism because of the way that surpluses are shared (St Martin 2007). Through ethnographic, historical and economic analysis of Scottish commercial nephrops trawler fisheries, this paper demonstrates that fishing share systems are adaptable to the exploitation of labour. While share systems seem to have their origins in shared ownership of fishing boats and gear, it is the present lack of this link in Scotland that has created the conditions for labour itself to become a commodity and share systems to function as a variable and casual wage. This paper argues that the dependence of the fishery on commodity production and its reliance on labour as a commodity makes it fully capitalist, even in the presence of a share system, and explores the social and ecological consequences of the development of these more conventionally capitalist class relations.",,,"Howard, PM (通讯作者)，Level 2,365 Sussex St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.",suilven2@yahoo.com,,,,,,,60,29,32,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The paper provides results that differ significantly from the standard lumped parameter (also surplus production, or biomass) model.","[Skonhoft, Anders] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Econ, N-7491 Dragvoll, Norway; [Vestergaard, Niels] Univ So Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Esbjerg, Denmark; [Quaas, Martin] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Southern Denmark; University of Kiel,"Skonhoft, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Econ, Dragvoll Univ Campus, N-7491 Dragvoll, Norway.",Anders.skonhoft@svt.ntnu.no,"Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012","Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829; Vestergaard, Niels/0000-0001-9270-2461",,,,,20,60,61,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Given the potential significance of citizen's economic understanding in delimiting government responses to globalisation (Davies, 2006) this topic is worthy of further study. This study paper investigates conceptions about the provision of free goods and services, drawing on evidence from students in different age groups. In contrast to previous work we focus on the question 'Should this product or service be made available for free?' We compare the reasoning of students at different ages across a range of products and services and we explore the ways that they attempt to resolve conflicts within their reasoning.

In this article, we search for a minimal set of assumptions needed to expand the range of dynamic behaviors of the ecological model of density dependence to admit extinction while preserving its original insight. The revised version of the model builds on two core assumptions. The first is that organizational populations are linked to their environments through feedback processes of resource generation and consumption. As a consequence, the carrying capacity for an organizational population changes systematically with its density. The second assumption is that organizational vital rates respond with delay to changes in the level of available resources. As a consequence, organizational founding and mortality rates are affected by expectations that decision makers form about the future state of their environment. Using computer simulation, we test these assumptions and show that the relative speed at which processes of resource regeneration and consumption happen, and the speed at which expectations about future levels of resources are revised jointly determine a wide range of evolutionary trajectories that admit population extinction as one distinct possibility. The model is validated using multivariate sensitivity analysis techniques. We discuss the implications of our findings in the broader context of the current debate on the implications of selective sampling in the study of organizational populations.","[Larsen, Erik R.; Lomi, Alessandro] Univ Lugano, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland; [Freeman, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lomi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lugano, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.",erik.larsen@usi.ch; alessandro.lomi@usi.ch,"Lomi, Alessandro/AFR-0469-2022","lomi, alessandro/0000-0002-2858-0022",,,,,67,10,10,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Participants are more risk averse when they can earn at most as much as their referent (loss situation) than when they are ensured they will earn at least as much as their referent (gain situation).

However, the degree of interdependence and the extent of convergence among the largest property markets have intensified substantially after the launch of the Euro as the common currency in January, 1999. Moreover, each of the property markets under consideration is endogenous in that none is found to dominate the others toward long-run equilibrium. Short-run results indicate substantial interrelationships among the markets after the adoption of the Euro.

Findings highlight the importance of conceptualising remittances as a process influenced by the developmental contexts within receiving countries, and question previous assumptions concerning development pathways.","[Buckley, Cynthia] Eurasia, Social Sci Res Council, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Buckley, Cynthia] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Hofmann, Erin Trouth] Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol Anthropol & Social Work, Logan, UT 84322 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Buckley, C (通讯作者)，Eurasia, Social Sci Res Council, 1 Pierrepont Plaza,15th Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",buckley@ssrc.org,,,"Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1105875] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,65,19,23,3,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

These are, first, the discovery of cheap technologies that can dramatically improve outcomes and, second, the adoption of these technologies thanks to the spread of knowledge. Other factors have played a role. Increased income not only allows for improved nutrition, but also helps to improve access to more complex preventative technologies. Institutional development is a second key to the spread of such complex technologies. Nonetheless, evidence of dramatic health improvements even in environments of weak institutions and stagnant incomes suggests that the role of these factors may be secondary. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Additional reservations about the reliability of the results arise from the fact that most studies are based on convenience groups, such as students or business-men in developing countries. With this in mind, we systematically compare different measuring methods to answer the question how the choice of method affects the results. Moreover, we compare the risk preferences of German farmers to those of students and Kazakhstani farmers in order to investigate whether farmers' risk preferences can be approximated through those of convenience groups. The methods applied comprise an incentive-compatible Holt and Laury lottery, as well as two psychometric methods, namely self-assessment and the selection of a business-related contextualized statement, with which the test persons are most likely to agree. Results show that the risk preferences determined by applying the aforementioned methods exhibit slightly positive but significant correlations across all three elicitation methods. Significant differences, however, only exist between the responses of students and those of German farmers, implying that it is not possible to draw conclusions from the risk attitudes of students to those of farmers. The comparison of the risk preferences of German and Kazakhstani farmers, however, reveals significant similarities with respect to the self-assessment and the business-related contextualized statements.","[Ewald, Joern; Maart, Syster Christin; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Musshoff, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fak Agr Wissensch, Dept Agr Okon & Rurale Entwicklung, Arbeitsbereich Landwirtschaftliche Betriebslehre, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,37,7,7,0,18,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

We argue that convertible securities can resolve the information asymmetry about the bidder's value while at the same time mitigating the information asymmetry about the target's value. In contrast, deals with cash or stock can only address one information asymmetry or the other but not both. Empirically, we find that a bidder is more likely to offer convertible securities, rather than all cash or all stock, when both the bidder and its target face large asymmetric information problems. We also find that both bidders and targets in convertible deals enjoy positive abnormal stock returns around takeover announcements. These findings provide empirical support for the use of convertible securities to resolve the double-sided asymmetric information problem. Finally, we find that bidder returns in convertible deals are larger than in all-cash and all-stock deals, but that target returns in convertible deals are smaller than in all-cash and all-stock deals.

One theory of how shared social norms evolve is that they arise from mutually rewarding conventions which, through repeated execution, acquire a normative value that sustains social cohesion even when individual self-interest is not served. The authors report an fMRI study of a 2-player coordination game in which players must coordinate on an arbitrary convention (a left or right button press) to obtain monetary rewards. Once this convention has been established, one of the participants is incentivized to deviate from the equilibrium with the offer of extra reward. During the period prior to decisions to violate the convention, activity was observed in regions associated with reward processing, such as the midbrain, caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex. Activations in advance of decisions to continue coordinating included the amygdala and anterior insula inferior frontal gyms.

In this study, descriptive method is used and the data were obtained through literature review. This study demonstrates that the relationship between records management and ECM applications is linear, and that there is a tendency for integrated systems oriented towards content management in the digital environment, which eventually lead to the convergence of independent enterprise information systems.

Since 2009, payments made to insured employees during the period of their illness have been shared by their respective employers in the form of wage compensation and by the government in the form of sickness insurance benefits.

This article establishes a general equilibrium model to study the economic impact of governmental policies aimed at promoting modern agriculture. The main conclusions of this article are that interest subsidies implemented by the government to promote modern agriculture can reduce the transfer of labor from the rural areas to the cities, but encourage the movement of rural labor to the modern agricultural sector. Conversely, wage rate subsidies for the modern agricultural sector will lead to rises in the urban unemployment rate and a decrease in the quantity of labor in the traditional agricultural sector.","[Li, Xiaochun; Shen, Qin] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Li, XC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiaochun@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,16,11,12,4,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The material used was a Mo-Cr-Ni S.G. cast iron, which it was elaborated in an induction furnace. Nodular changes were obtained with the In mold method, with the help of prealloy FeSiCuMg with 10-16% Mg, added into the reaction chamber in a proportion of 1.1% of the treated cast iron. After elaboration, it was made a heat treatment and then a maintaining on a low temperature (-70 degrees C). Cryogenic treatment is methodology of ultra-low temperature processing of materials to enhance their properties to the desired levels. Material subjected to deep cryogenic temperature develops a more uniform, redefined microstructure with greater density. Austenite, the softer molecules in the microstructure is transformed to harder martensite. The experimental tests at low temperature (-70 degrees C), were done in a specific cryogenic installation attached to an impact strength resistance tester. This installation used carbon dioxide solid like a cooling agent and ethylic alcohol as a cryogenic liquids. It is pointed out the influence of some factors (the temperature and the maintained time at the isothermal level and low temperature - 70 degrees C) on the phase transformation and the KCV & KCU properties of the studied cast iron.

This article compares firms' capital structure adjustments across countries and investigates whether institutional differences help explain the variance in estimated adjustment speeds. We find that legal and financial traditions significantly correlate with firm adjustment speeds. More narrowly, institutional features also relate to adjustment speeds, consistent with the hypothesis that better institutions lower the transaction costs associated with adjusting a firm's leverage. Such associations between institutional arrangements and leverage adjustment speeds are consistent with the dynamic trade-off theory of capital structure choice. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
