However, these approaches fail to accurately take into account the regional differences in Europe. This research takes a look at the entrepreneurial phenomenon from the territorial perspective and provides some evidences on European convergence to be raised.

However, there have been concerns that this type of reimbursement might have a negative impact on the cost efficiency of hospitals that converted to CAH status. This study examines the impact of Medicare cost-based reimbursement, length of participation in the CAH program and other environmental variables on the cost efficiency of CAHs using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, data envelopment analysis is used to estimate cost efficiency of CAHs. In the second stage, cost efficiency is regressed on environmental variables using a parametric bootstrap of a truncated regression. The estimated results suggest that Medicare cost-based reimbursement may increase the cost inefficiency of CAHs and that longer participation in the CAH program increases hospital cost inefficiency but the extent of this inefficiency increase is lower than what previous literature showed.

In this sense, we know that these firms pay attention to structural and human capital, especially focusing their efforts on structural capital. However, relational capital is overlooked by Spanish managers in this sector. This contribution is very important in a country in which the economic situation is very difficult. We contribute to the Spanish situation by identifying an important action (invest more in relational capital) that enterprises can do if they want to improve their situation. For this analysis, we use data obtained by Spanish National Institute of Statistics (INE) in 2010. In this sense, we use variables linked with the most common classification of intellectual capital: structural capital, human capital and relational capital. Also we include a variable linked with the general results. Using factor analysis technique, we identify eleven underlying factors that explain more than 70 percent of data variability. The paper is structured as follows: first, we realize a short introduction to the topic. In the second section, we review the concept of intellectual capital and others related terms.

Governments collect lump-sum taxes and subsidize these sunk entry costs for the domestic entrepreneurs. One motive for this policy, valid already in autarky, is to tighten market selection. This selection effect leads to better firms that produce and sell more output at lower prices. In the open economy there is another, strategic motive for entry subsidies as the tightening of market selection leads to a competitive advantage for domestic producers in international trade. Our analysis shows that entry subsidies in the Nash equilibrium are first increasing, then decreasing in the level of trade freeness. Comparing the non-cooperative and the cooperative policies, we furthermore show that there is first too much and then too little entry subsidization in the course of trade integration.

Yet, agricultural historians have largely praised the performance of these early markets, which they contend were shaped by commercial interests who sought successfully to mitigate price risk. In any case, our understanding of how early futures markets performed is fragmented, and so such claims remain largely unsubstantiated in a quantifiable sense. Even so, futures-price data are available for the late-nineteenth century, thanks to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT), which pioneered grain-futures trading in the 1860s. In this article, I test and compare the performance of wheat, corn, and oats futures prices on the CBT from 1880 to 1890 and from 1997 to 2007. My results indicate that grain-futures markets in both periods are efficient in the long run. Short-run performance is mixed, and inefficiency is more evident in the nineteenth century. On balance, my results support the notion that early grain-futures exchanges benefited commercial interests and the grain trade more generally.","S Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA",South Dakota State University,"Santos, JM (通讯作者)，S Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Box 504, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",joseph.santos@sdstate.edu,,,,,,,29,6,6,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Recovery rates are often treated as an afterthought; they are modelled independently, in many cases they are even assumed to be constant. This despite their pronounced effect on the tail of the loss distribution. Here, we take a step back, historically, and start again from the Merton model, where defaults and recoveries are both determined by an underlying process. Hence, they are intrinsically connected. For the diffusion process, we can derive the functional relation between expected recovery rate and default probability. This relation depends on a single parameter only. In Monte Carlo simulations we find that the same functional dependence also holds for jump-diffusion and GARCH processes. We discuss how to incorporate this structural recovery rate into reduced-form models, in order to restore essential structural information which is usually neglected in the reduced-form approach.

J,"Sun, RY",,,,"Sun, Ruoyan",,,Kinetics of jobs in multi-link cities with migration-driven aggregation process,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Job market; Migration; Aggregation process; Multilink,GROWTH,"Immigration has long been a hotly debated issue. The core of this debate is immigrants' impact on local job markets. Some people insist that instead of creating more jobs, immigrants actually take away more jobs thus decrease the living standard of natives. Others argue that the presence of immigrants benefits the society as a whole since they enlarge the labor force and lower the production cost. In this paper, we propose a model describing the migration-driven aggregation behaviors in job markets with foreign immigration, and introduce the method of network and aggregation to look at this issue from a new perspective. We divide the job market in each city into two groups: native and immigrant. And we view each city as a node with l links; each link represents a way of transportation to other cities. Then it is not hard to see that cities with more links tend to be more job concentrated with larger flows of jobs. We assume that both native and immigrant job markets have a migration of jobs within themselves and the native ones have birth rate and death rate of jobs as well. Through analyzing different rates: K-1 and K-2, initial conditions, and the combined effect of birth rate and death rate, we are able to predict the changes of some variables in the long run. These changes indicate the impact of immigrants on native job markets. Thus provide some helpful information to this issue. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, in the initial stage of any research an analysed concept should be clearly defined an explained. A plenty of competing definitions is offered by different authors. Thus, the main goal of the current research was to provide a deep understanding of the concept of financial literacy, specifying its key elements. To achieve the established goal, an analysis of the textual information was performed, using software AQUAD 6.0 and Hamlet II. Information data base included 52 definitions of the term financial literacy and the related terms proposed by individual researchers and organizations, such as OECD, EIOPA. ACIS and others. Completing the procedure of open-coding, the main directions of the research are detected: (1) analysis of key domains of financial literacy, which are knowledge, ability, attitude, and behaviour; (2) analysis of key aspects of financial literacy, e.g. numeracy, debt literacy etc. Analysis of frequencies within the framework of content analysis assisted authors to detect main elements of financial literacy and to define the most important competencies for financially literate behaviour.

It does so by combining insights from micro-economics, sociology and psychology. Basis is the standard utility function of a worker that includes income and hours of work and is elaborated with job characteristics. In this way it is possible to answer whether part-time workers are happier than full-time workers. The utility function is estimated on basis of the European Social Survey 2004 which contains all necessary information. The results show that workers optimize income and hours of work as predicted by micro-economics, but also that part-time workers are happier than full-time workers. Challenging work with a high level of autonomy makes the workers happy, work pressure makes workers unhappy. Higher educated workers are unhappier than lower educated workers, we find a negative effect of education, but this is compensated by the type of jobs these higher educated hold.","[van der Meer, Peter H.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Wielers, Rudi] Univ Groningen, Dept Sociol ICS, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"van der Meer, PH (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands.",p.h.van.der.meer@rug.nl,"Wielers, Rudi/E-3544-2013","Wielers, Rudi/0000-0002-8394-4757",,,,,41,27,32,4,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Comprehensive concepts of theory of human capital appeared in the early Sixties of 20th century. In the last two decades, the influence of human capital, more precisely influence of education on economic growth and productivity was confirmed by many economic studies. Human capital as an additional production factor is included in the new theories of economic growth. On the contrary, some experts criticize this unambiguous and inconclusive relation and some of them even disprove this hypothesis, publishing their studies. A lot of researchers expressed human capital as investment or expenditure in education, schooling enrollments or average length of education. In authors' opinion, these variables do not seem to be appropriate indicators of human capital. This paper deals with the relationship of human capital and economic growth in Visegrad group countries during the period 1999-2010. We consider Increasing in human capital will tend to economic growth and thus will contribute to improvement of national competitiveness. Because of the lack of observations the importance of human capital in the economic growth of these countries is being proven by using panel data analysis. The value of human capital is expressed by the graduates' groups at the educational level, while economic growth is expressed by gross domestic product per capita. Annual data collected from Eurostat and converted into logs were employed. We found out the positive relationship between tertiary graduates and economic growth, on the other hand negative link between secondary graduates and economic growth.","[Verner, Tomas; Chudarkova, Silvie] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Econ, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,verner@opf.slu.cz; chudarkova@opf.slu.cz,"Verner, Tomas/GRJ-3425-2022","Verner, Tomas/0000-0003-4011-0549",,,,,30,1,1,0,6,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,610,617,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300064,0

However, portfolio diversification provides an obvious means toward the reduction of risk. Moreover, it is widely believed that the wealthier the household, the more diversification it practices: the larger tends to be the proportion of its total portfolio allocated to publicly traded stock, and the larger tends to be the number of individual stock issues included in its portfolio. Using a simple 'homogeneous securities' model, explicit functional forms are obtained for both the optimal proportion of the portfolio allocated to stocks, and the optimal number of individual stock issues in the portfolio. Empirical evaluation of these theoretical results, using a dataset derived from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), lends substantial support to the model. Applying these empirical results, it is found that as household capital wealth increases, expected capital income increases while simultaneously a reasonable risk indicator (the probability of incurring a negative return on the capital portfolio) decreases owing to the higher level of portfolio diversification. This indication casts significant doubt on the 'return to risk-taking' justification for capital property income received by wealthy private households.","[Yunker, James A.; Melkumian, Alice] Western Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Macomb, IL 61455 USA",Western Illinois University,"Yunker, JA (通讯作者)，Western Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, 442 Stipes Hall,1 Univ Circle, Macomb, IL 61455 USA.",JA-Yunker@wiu.edu,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The framework of analysis is an overlapping generations model with physical and human capital. We first show that, when the social welfare function is a discounted sum of individual utilities defined over consumption per unit of natural labor, the precise cardinalization of the individual utility function becomes crucial for both the characterization of the social optimum and the policies that support it. Also, decentralizing the social optimum requires an education subsidy that is definitely positive, but its size depends in a determinant way on the aforementioned cardinalization. In contrast, when the social welfare function is a discounted sum of individual utilities defined over consumption per unit of efficient labor, the precise cardinalization of preferences becomes irrelevant. More strikingly, along the optimal growth path, the education subsidy is negative, i.e., the planner should tax rather than subsidize investments in human capital.","[Del Rey, Elena] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona 17071, Spain; [Lopez-Garcia, Miguel-Angel] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Appl Econ Dept, Bellaterra 01893, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de Girona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Del Rey, E (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Campus Montilivi, Girona 17071, Spain.",elena.delrey@udg.edu; miguelangel.lopez@uab.es,"Del Rey, Elena/F-2563-2016; Lopez-Garcia, Miguel-Angel/H-7294-2015","Del Rey, Elena/0000-0001-7644-4490; Lopez-Garcia, Miguel-Angel/0000-0002-5012-1869",,,,,17,5,5,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

A large literature advocates the use of CO2 pricing and recycling the revenues to lower distorting taxes as a way to minimize costs. In this paper, we explore the implications of labor tax interactions for cost-effectiveness of border adjustments and other measures to cope with leakage. We find that, for plausible values of labor supply elasticities, the cost savings from revenue recycling are significant from 15 to 25%. The cost savings from anti-leakage measures are generally smaller, but also significant, particularly for small coalitions or more binding reduction targets. Tax interactions further enhance the cost savings from border adjustments, but make other measures like rebates or exemptions less attractive. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

I model how children are educated to a specific ideological trait that later in life will influence the well-being of the family. Compared to the existing literature, my model yields two new results. First, paternalistic preferences in childrens education at time t are a necessary but not a sufficient condition to ensure the preservation of heterogeneity in the long-run distribution of traits. Second, my model is able to reproduce historical events in which a reversal of parents evaluation of traits has been observed. Assuming myopic agents does not change the qualitative results of the model.","Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Econ & Social Res, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Ghidi, PM (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Econ & Social Res, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",paolo.melindi@uclouvain.be,,"melindi-ghidi, paolo/0000-0002-0708-9621",,,,,30,6,6,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

Using a large panel of more than 190,000 Czech firm/years we study whether firms fully utilize their resources, how firm efficiency evolves over time, and how firm efficiency is determined by ownership structure. We employ a panel version of a stochastic production frontier model for the period 1996-2007 with time-varying efficiency. We differentiate among various degrees of ownership concentration and domestic or foreign origin. In a two-stage set-up we first estimate the degree of firm inefficiency and then the effect of ownership structure on the distance from the efficiency frontier. Our results support the hypothesis that concentrated ownership is positively related to efficiency. FDI has beneficial effects at the microeconomic level. However, we show that a simple majority is not necessarily the best structure to improve efficiency. We further analyze the effects of ownership coalitions and shed light on many other subtleties of how ownership and the specific industry affect firm efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For a substantial proportion of the population, the degree of first-mover unkindness determines the severity of punishment actions even when marginal costs are absent. The proportion of these participants strongly depends on a treatment variation: higher fixed costs of punishment more frequently lead to extreme responses. The fractions of purely selfish and inequity-averse participants are small and stable. Among the variety of reciprocity models, only one accommodates (rather than predicts) parts of our findings.

It is one of the main tools for improvement of relationship with customers, especially in the demanding world of services. Therefore, the electronic customer relationship management system (e-CRM) as upgraded version of CRM represents today not an option but an obligation for efficient and profitable customer relationship management. The use of e-CRM leads to increased profitability through attraction of new and retention of old customers. Thus, understanding the impact CRM and e-CRM have on efficiency of service industry; in particular tourism industry is of crucial importance for companies and managers. The aim of this paper is to provide the theoretical background and present discussions on implementation of CRM and e-CRM system particularly in tourism industry relating it to rent-a-car sector as part of the tourism industry. Furthermore, the paper explores the implementation and impact of e-CRM system in rent-a-car agencies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This paper provides insight into the level of incorporation of e-CRM in rent-a-car agencies and their everyday business activities. Additionally, it proves that e-CRM leads to increase of profitability through the higher level of customer retention and attraction particularly in those rent-a-car agencies that have recognized the significance of e-CRM and have incorporated it into their business strategies. The paper is backed up with field research through structured personal interviews conducted with major rent-a-car agencies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The research findings indicate that those rent-a-car agencies that have their everyday business through increased level have benefited from it implemented (e)CRM in of customer retention and attraction.","[Pestek, Almir] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business Sarajevo, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Lalovic, Andela] Univ Sarajevo, Human Rights Ctr, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo; University of Sarajevo,"Pestek, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business Sarajevo, Trg Oslobodenja Alija Izetbegovic 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg.",almir.pestek@efsa.unsa.ba; andjela.lalovic@gmail.com,"Pestek, Almir/AAJ-7437-2020","Pestek, Almir/0000-0001-5958-4993",,,,,23,2,2,4,30,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

According to this principle, a society might institute policies that secure an equal distribution of the means to reach a valuable outcome among its members. Once the set of opportunities have been equalized, which particular opportunity, the individual chooses from those open to her, is outside the scope of justice. Ex ante inequalities, and only those inequalities, should be eliminated or compensated for by public intervention. The recent literature on the opportunity egalitarianism often merges these questions introducing two different economic issues. On one side the design of a public policy intended to implement the equality of opportunity view and on the other side the problem of measuring the degree of opportunity inequality in a society. We describe the basic setting and assumptions of some different approaches derived by Roemers algorithm for public policy and then we discuss some theoretical and empirical studies to separate and test alternative paradigms on the measurement of inequality of opportunity. Accordingly, an extended critique on the causality issue on policies and measurements is taken into account.","Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Pignataro, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",,"Pignataro, Giuseppe/AAI-5145-2020",,,,,,64,19,26,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We assume that projects can be grouped into two categories based on their information characteristics of soft and hard information. We consider a case in which the manager faces competition for appointment at the end of term. We consider several cases in which the competitor's ability is known, or proxied by the performance of other managers, or is uncertain. We find that hard information projects are preferred to soft information projects and that the efficiency in project selection critically depends on the competitor's ability. Interestingly, information asymmetry may be socially beneficial, because it can provide the manager with incentives to select high-quality hard-information projects. Welfare improvement can be made by a budget change that is in the opposite direction to the optimum. Several empirical implications of the theory are discussed.","[Seog, S.

However, a growing criticism has been focused on the manipulation of Chinese Yuan (RMB) exchange rate by the Chinese government. While China implemented the exchange rate reform policy in July 2005, the question, whether its currency is undervalued remains as a debatable issue. Different from previous studies by focusing on individual trading partners, this paper tests the short-run J-Curve hypothesis and long-run trade balance effect of real exchange rate between China and its eighteen major trading partners using a panel dataset over the 2005-2009 period. We adopt the methodologies of panel cointegration test, fully modified 015 for heterogeneous cointegrated panel (panel FMOLS) and panel error correction model (panel ECM) to investigate the above examination. Our empirical results lend support to the inverted J-curve hypothesis between China and its trading partners. However, we find that a real appreciation of RMB has a decreasing long-run effect on China's trade balance in only three of the eighteen trading partners, while it has an increasing long-run effect in five of the eighteen trading partners. These mixed findings, therefore, lead to the empirical evidence that the real appreciation of RMB has no overall long-run impact on China's trade balance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Also, it is expected to be affordable and environmentally friendly. Ensuring this is a challenge, yet strategic to maintain economies running under a sustainable pattern. Energy security is neither a new concept, nor a new concern. However, because of new issues, it requires a novel, broader approach. Such an approach should address both demand (security of supply) and supply (security of demand) sides, as well as take into account energy scarcity situations and surplus opportunities. In addition, it should allow for both private (markets) and public (policies and regulations) initiatives. This paper presents a theoretical and practical basis for the economics of energy security. Energy security is defined, in this context, as the ability of an economy to provide sufficient, affordable and environmentally sustainable energy services so as to maintain a maximum welfare state, even when issues would press it otherwise. We introduce the notion of energy security gap to represent the economy's failure to show such ability. Additionally, we also propose a framework to support the evaluation, planning and implementation of energy security in an economy. This framework relies on the concepts of resilience, adaptability and transformability (Walker et al, 2004) to prescribe indicators to assess the energy security of an economy. Furthermore, it proposes mechanisms to enhance energy security, as well as a continuous process to increasingly achieve this. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We first use optimal bid functions and market data to retrieve time-varying marginal cost functions, price-cost margins and Lerner Indexes of market power for a sample of Italian companies. Then, we use estimated costs and actual equilibrium prices to evaluate the elasticity of these series to fuel price variations and estimate a possible differential impact of the dynamics of input expenditures (fuel price above all) on generation costs and final electricity prices. Our estimates suggest that the elasticities of costs and equilibrium prices with respect to oil price are virtually the same and, therefore, that the auction mechanism per se does not limit the extent to which cost increases are transferred to prices.

Government investment increases wealth inequality over time, regardless of its financing. The time path of income inequality is, however, highly sensitive to financing policies, and is often characterized by sharp intertemporal tradeoffs, with income inequality declining in the short run but increasing in the long run. Public investment generates a positive correlation between growth and income inequality along the transition path, but their short-run and long-run relationship depends critically on (i) how externalities impinge on allocation decisions, (ii) financing policies, and (iii) the time period of consideration. Finally, these policies also generate sharp trade-offs between average welfare and its distribution, with government investment improving average welfare, but also increasing its dispersion.

EEO models are a critical tool for decision-makers who must make near-term decisions with long-term effects in the face of large future uncertainties. While the number of model-based analyses proliferates, insufficient attention is paid to transparency in model development and application. Given the complex, data-intensive nature of EEO models and the general lack of access to source code and data, many of the assumptions underlying model-based analysis are hidden from external observers. This paper discusses the simplifications and subjective judgments involved in the model building process, which cannot be fully articulated in journal papers, reports, or model documentation. In addition, we argue that for all practical purposes, EEO model-based insights cannot be validated through comparison to real world outcomes. As a result. modelers are left without credible metrics to assess a model's ability to deliver reliable insight. We assert that EEO models should be discoverable through interrogation of publicly available source code and data. In addition, third parties should be able to run a specific model instance in order to independently verify published results. Yet a review of twelve EEO models suggests that in most cases, replication of model results is currently impossible. We provide several recommendations to help develop and sustain a software framework for repeatable model analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model has a tight theoretical structure which allows for non-unitary elasticity of substitution, non-constant augmenting technical progress and heterogeneous sectors with differentiated price and income elasticities of demand across sectors. Furthermore, it has the explicit inclusion of expectations on the basis of three optimising private sector decision making units: i.e. firms, trade unions and households, where output is in the short run demand-determined and monopolistically competing firms set prices and factor demands. Labour is indivisible and monopoly-unions set wages and households make consumption/saving decisions. We assume that agents optimise under limited information where each agent knows only the parameters related to his/her optimisation problem. Therefore we estimate with GMM, which implicitly assumes limited information boundedly rational expectations. In this paper we provide some simulation results under the assumption of model-consistent rational expectations, we show that there is some heterogeneity across countries and that the reactions of the economies to shocks depend strongly on whether the shocks are pre-announced, announced and credible or unannounced and uncredible.

Based on a variant of the Antras-Helpman (2004) model, we show theoretically that control over imported components for assembly can affect firm integration decisions. Our empirical results show that when Chinese plants control the use of components, the export share of foreign-owned plants is positively correlated with the intensity of inputs provided by the headquarter (capital, skill, and R&D). These results are consistent with the property-rights theory of intra-firm trade. However, when foreign firms own and control the components, there is no evidence of a positive relationship between the intensity of headquarters' inputs and the prevalence of vertical integration. The results are consistent with our model that considers control over imported components as an alternative to asset ownership to alleviate hold-up by export-processing plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Job creation appears to lower the average output. As firms do not internalize this effect, there are too many jobs in a laissez-faire equilibrium under the Hosios condition. By contrast, job rejection is efficient for the equilibrium value of market tightness. Consequently, introducing unemployment compensation raises the aggregate income by lowering market tightness.

In this paper we study an alternative approach - justifiable choice: each agent has several preference relations (justifications), and she can use each justification in every choice problem. We present a new behavioral property that requires an alternative to be chosen if it is not inferior to all mixtures of chosen alternatives, and show that this property characterizes justifiable choice. The main application of this property yields a multiple-utility representation, which substantially differs from existing related representations.

For a small open economy in such a setting, welfare gains are associated with higher trade volumes within the PTA. However, welfare losses are induced by declining tariff revenues on trade with non-member countries. We show that both effects are concave, while one is a non-monotonic and the other a potentially non-monotonic function of pre-PTA partner trade shares. Therefore, the relationship between initial partner import shares and direct static welfare impacts of a PTA are theoretically ambiguous. This finding contrasts with conventional results in the homogeneous-goods case, whereby the smaller is the pre-agreement trade volume with a potential partner the more beneficial is a PTA.","[Konan, Denise Eby] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Maskus, Keith E.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Konan, DE (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",Konan@hawaii.edu; maskus@colorado.edu,,,,,,,19,1,2,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We find that across countries energy intensity levels tend to decrease in most Manufacturing sectors. In the Service sector, energy intensity decreases at a relatively slow rate, with diverse trends across sub-sectors. A decomposition analysis reveals that changes in the sectoral composition of the economy explain a considerable and increasing part of aggregate energy intensity dynamics. A convergence analysis reveals that only after 1995 cross-country variation in aggregate energy intensity levels clearly tends to decrease, driven by a strong and robust trend break in Manufacturing and enhanced convergence in Services. Moreover, we find evidence for the hypothesis that across sectors lagging countries are catching-up with leading countries, with rates of convergence that are on average higher in Services than in Manufacturing. Aggregate convergence patterns are almost exclusively caused by convergence of within-sector energy intensity levels, and not by convergence of the sectoral composition of economies.

On average, non-farm income accounts for more than 60 per cent of total household income. However, the average masks the substantial heterogeneity of non-farm employment. We account for this heterogeneity and find significant differences in non-farm participation and incomes across segments of the income distribution. The poor and the less well-educated participate less in the non-farm sector, and when they do work in the non-farm sector, they work in low-paid jobs and earn lower incomes. Accounting for endogeneity and sample selection issues, we conduct an empirical enquiry of the determinants of participation in non-farm activities and of non-farm incomes. As expected, we find that education plays a major role in accessing more remunerative non-farm employment. Interestingly, we do not find evidence that women, ethnic minorities, or the land-poor are disadvantaged in access to the non-farm sector. Geographical location plays a role in access to and income from non-farm employment, indicating the importance of local context.","[Rahut, Dil Bahadur] S Asian Univ, New Delhi, India; [Micevska Scharf, Maja] Univ Utrecht, Roosevelt Acad, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Micevska Scharf, Maja] Webster Univ, Leiden, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Rahut, DB (通讯作者)，S Asian Univ, New Delhi, India.",,"Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022","Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271; Micevska, Maja/0000-0001-7943-8504",,,,,39,14,15,5,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach to cointegration was employed for this purpose. Also, causality among energy consumption and economic growth was investigated by employing a recently developed causality test by Hatemi-J (2012). The long-run estimates showed that either renewable or non-renewable energy consumption matters for economic growth and augmented production function is more effective on explaining the considered relationship.

We find that male and female labor supply decreases with higher levels of remittance income. Additionally, increases in remittance income volatility raise the employment likelihood of men and women, as well as the hours worked by employed women. Since men are more likely than women to be employed full-time, women may be better suited to respond to increased volatility in remittance income by raising the number of hours worked.

In addition, our theory answers some open questions concerning the data on partners-strangers experiments. One interesting feature of the theory is that being a conditional cooperator is not a type but arises endogenously as a behavior. The data generated by our model are quantitatively similar to data from a variety of experiments, and experimenters, and are insensitive to moderate variations in the parameters of the model.

Axiomatic models of cooperative bargaining presume that the status quo in such cases will have no effect on the negotiated outcome, especially if it is Pareto inferior to the backstop. Recent literatures on equity and entitlement, however, suggest that the status quo may establish a focal point that acts as an anchor in current negotiations, affecting any ultimate agreement. In a two-party, two-attribute experiment, in which subjects jointly select from up to 200 options, we find evidence (1) that the status quo matters, perhaps because of entitlement effects and (2) that parties prefer egalitarian outcomes to the Nash bargain.

Essentially, different theories expect different impacts of the financial crisis on people's social engagement. The present study thereby clarifies the effect by examining the experienced impact of the crisis on social engagement, in terms of participation in voluntary association and caring for acquaintances. Data for the study came from a survey of 1170 Hong Kong Chinese adults. Results show that the experienced impact tended to raise the participation, which in turn appeared to encourage the caring. These results support the functional explanation, which holds that the fiscal crisis generates a need for functions of voluntary associations. Meanwhile, the results are at odds with the resource thesis, which expects that the crisis would deprive resources required for social engagement. The results imply that the financial crisis can be a lever to strengthen social engagement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The evidence, from a rich firm-level survey on wage and price-setting procedures in 15 European Union countries, suggests that external labour market conditions are less important than internal pay structures in determining hiring pay, with internal pay structures binding even more often when there is labour market slack. When explaining their choice firms allude to fairness considerations and the need to prevent a potential negative impact on effort. Cross-country differences are found to depend on institutional factors: countries in which collective agreements are more prevalent and collective agreement coverage is higher report more often internal pay structures as the main determinant of hiring pay. Within-country differences are found to depend on firm and workforce characteristics: there is a strong association between the use of external factors in hiring pay, on the one hand, and skills (positive) and tenure (negative) on the other.

We find that growth is sustainable only if the tax rate on the polluting input increases over time. The long-term rate of economic growth follows an inverted V-shaped curve relative to the growth rate of the environmental tax, and it is maximized by the least aggressive tax policy of those that asymptotically eliminate the use of polluting inputs. Unavailability of insurance can accelerate or decelerate the growth-maximizing speed of the tax increase depending on the relative significance of the risk premium and precautionary savings effects. Welfare is maximized under a milder environmental tax policy, especially when the pollutants accumulate gradually. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We apply three econometric techniques that have been widely tested and applied in the cross hedging literature on foreign exchange and stock index futures markets. Using quotes from the financial industry on forward contracts, we can show that the optimal cross hedging instrument depends on the maturity of the instrument's forwards contract. The results highlight that the standard approach in the literature to use crude oil as a cross hedge is not optimal for time horizons of three months or less. By contrast, for short hedging horizons our results indicate that gasoil forwards contracts represent the highest cross hedging efficiency for jet-fuel spot price exposure, while for maturities of more than three months, the predominance of gasoil diminishes in comparison to WTI and Brent.

We apply a new approach based on a dynamic coherence function (DCF) to study these interactions bringing together different real estate markets (the securitized market, the commercial market and the residential market). The results suggest that there is a common trend that drives the different real estate markets in the UK and the US, particularly in the long run, since they have a similar shape of the DCF. We also find that, in the US, wealth and housing expenditure channels are very conductive during real estate crises. However, in the UK, only the wealth effect is significant as a transmission channel during real estate market downturns. In addition, real estate markets in the UK and the US react differently to institutional shocks. This brings some insights on the conduct of monetary policy in order to avoid disturbances in real estate markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier By.

Yet the effect of team decision-making in a market environment has never been studied in a controlled experiment. In this paper, we investigate the effect of team decision-making in an asset market experiment that has long been known to reliably generate price bubbles and crashes in markets populated by individuals. We find that this tendency is substantially reduced when each decision-making unit is instead a team of two. This holds across a broad spectrum of measures of the severity of mispricing, both under a continuous double-auction institution and in a call market. The result is not driven by reduced turnover due to time required for deliberation by teams, and continues to hold even when subjects are experienced. Our result also holds not only when our teams treatments are compared to the 'narrow' baseline provided by the corresponding individuals treatments, but also when compared more broadly to the results of the large body of previous research on markets of this kind.","[Cheung, Stephen L.] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Palan, Stefan] Graz Univ, Inst Banking & Finance, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Sydney; University of Graz,"Cheung, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",Stephen.Cheung@sydney.edu.au; Stefan.Palan@uni-graz.at,"Palan, Stefan/I-8886-2014","Palan, Stefan/0000-0002-6650-1452; Cheung, Stephen/0000-0001-9374-8357",,,,,33,16,19,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The proposed framework combines the directional distance function and a meta-frontier analysis. It can be used to measure efficiency improvements brought about by enhanced technical management and technological advances. For demonstration purposes, we used the framework to measure the environmental efficiency in 90 countries worldwide for the 2003-2007 period. The results showed that when the meta-technology set is used as the evaluation basis, the average environmental efficiency of high competitiveness countries is greater than that of lower-middle, low, and upper-middle competitiveness countries. The upper-middle competitiveness countries perform worse than the lower-middle and low competitiveness countries because of the excessive labor force usage and carbon dioxide emissions in these countries. We also found that the environmental inefficiency of the meta-frontier for high competitiveness countries can be attributed to managerial failure in the production process, whereas that for upper-middle, lower-middle, and low competitiveness countries can be attributed to technological differences.

In this paper, we examine how relatively mild temporal variations in cognition affect reasoning in the Beauty Contest. The source of temporal cognition variation that we explore is the time-of-day that decisions are made. Our first result is that circadian mismatched subjects (i.e., those making decisions at off-peak time of day) display lower levels of strategic reasoning in the p < 1 Beauty Contest but not in the p > 1 game. This suggests that a cognitively more challenging environment is required for circadian mismatch to harm strategic reasoning. A second result is that choice adaptation or mimicry (i.e., a more automatic type of responding than what is typically considered to be learning) during repeated play is not significantly affected by circadian mismatch. This is consistent with the hypothesis that automatic thought is more resilient to cognitive resource depletion than controlled-thought decision making.","[Dickinson, David L.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [McElroy, Todd] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Psychol, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Dickinson, DL (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",dickinsondl@appstate.edu,,"Dickinson, David/0000-0003-3899-0276",,,,,43,23,23,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

We use publicly available data of key reservoir properties to produce geo-referenced rasters of estimated storage capacity and cost for regions within 15 deep-saline sandstone aquifers in the United States. The rasters reveal the reservoir quality of these aquifers to be so variable that the cost estimates for storage span three orders of magnitude and average > $100/tonne CO2. However, when the cost and corresponding capacity estimates in the rasters are assembled into a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC), we find that similar to 75% of the estimated storage capacity could be available for < $2/tonne. Furthermore, similar to 80% of the total estimated storage capacity in the rasters is concentrated within just two of the aquifers-the Frio Formation along the Texas Gulf Coast, and the Mt. Simon Formation in the Michigan Basin, which together make up only similar to 20% of the areas analyzed. While our assessment is not comprehensive, the results suggest there should be an abundance of low-cost storage for CO2 in deep-saline aquifers, but a majority of this storage is likely to be concentrated within specific regions of a smaller number of these aquifers.

Calibration of the model for the EU-15 member states provides the following results: i) the maximum tax revenue level is relatively far from the current tax levels for most countries; ii) the cases of Sweden, Denmark and Finland are anomalous, as productive efficiency can be gained by lowering tax rates without affecting fiscal revenues; iii) in general, countries would obtain efficiency gains without changing fiscal revenues by reducing the capital tax and increasing the labor tax; and iv) capital tax harmonization to the average capital tax rate can be done with quite small changes in both fiscal revenues and output for most countries.

That is a provocative result that runs counter to what many earlier econometric studies indicate. Given that, it makes sense to examine how electricity consumption behaves in different regional service areas. Even if residential electricity is an inferior good whose usage declines as income rises, there is no guarantee that this will be the case across all service areas. This study examines residential electricity consumption for Seattle, Washington, the largest metropolitan economy in the northwestern region of the United States. Results from a dynamic error correction modeling approach indicate that residential electricity consumption reacts in statistically significant manners to changes in real price, real income, and cold weather. In the short-run, residential electricity is a normal good in this metropolitan economy. In the long-run, residential electricity appears to be an inferior good in Seattle. All else equal, whenever real per capita income growth exceeds 1.2%, per capita residential electricity usage declines in Seattle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It examines how enterprise ownership restructuring, marketization and state politics have resulted in greater wealth inequality between cadres and ordinary workers, between public sectors/organizations and private sectors/organizations. Mainly drawing on data from the Chinese Household Income Project conducted in 1995 and 2002, we find that the property transformation process has created greater wealth disparity among different occupational groups and among those working in different work organizations since the mid-1990s. However, it is inconclusive whether non-housing wealth or total household wealth are increasing at the same pace across different occupations and work organizations with the growing market penetration and the spread of privatization.","[Huang, Zhuo] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [He, Xiaobin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Peking University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Huang, Z (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",hexiaobin@mail.hust.edu.cn; zhuohuang@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"huang, zhuo/B-5281-2018",,,,,,47,2,3,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2012,20.0,5,,,,,37,62,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01301.x,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,014SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309395400003,0

We show that, as long as individuals take their personal signals into account in a Bayesian way, repeated interactions lead them to successfully aggregate information and learn the true parameter.

The programs might increase social welfare to individuals but they pose both an unnecessary burden on the public budget and are economically inefficient because their benefits are often not received by the poor. Furthermore, due to improper targeting, a large part of food subsidies is leaked to high-income people. This study aims to investigate the effects of alternative food subsidy reforms on households' welfare and government expenditure in Iran. For this purpose, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model was applied. The scenarios consist of. gradual omission of subsidy during 3 and 5 years period and instant complete omission of food subsidy. The results indicated that in these polices government expenditure decreases by 5.8%, and resulting to decrease in import and export of agricultural and non-agricultural goods, but decreases in import exceeds the export reduction. In addition, results showed that the welfare of households' decreases for all scenarios, since decreases in urban households is greater than as rural households. Furthermore, between quintiles groups, decreases among welfare in high income quintiles are greater than the lower income ones groups. Based on the result, it is recommended to implement the food subsidy reform in 5 years period and targeted to lower income segments of the society. The most important policy implication of this study is the reallocation of food subsidy gradually among lower income quintiles groups. (C) 2011 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The high demand rate of oil makes this sector the main and major oil consumer in the world. The vehicle ownership or intensity of vehicles is one of the main factors which determines the development of oil demand in this major sector. Vehicle ownership (in 1000 population) is estimated using the nonlinear Gompertz model on the basis of pooled time series (1972-2020) and cross-sections data for 154 countries. Different saturation levels for the selected countries and over time horizon is calculated by adding specific demographic and geographic variables. Then, under two different scenarios - business as usual and policy scenario - we make projections of oil demand in the road transportation sector across 154 countries by using available data up to 2020. According to the results of the model, it is predicted that the number of world total vehicles will be approximately 1.5 times higher in 2020 than in 2008. Moreover, oil demand projections for road transportation over 2009-2020 show that under business as usual scenario, world oil demand will increase to 14,748 million barrel of oil equivalent until 2020 while under the policy scenario, which is based on the fuel efficiency improvement by 20% during a period of 10 years until 2020, world oil demand in the aforementioned sector will increase only to 11601 mboe until 2020.

If the conflicts of interest between the principal and the agent are different on each dimension, then delegation is always strictly valuable. The principal can better extract information from the agent by using the spread between the two decisions as a costly screening device. Delegation sets no longer trade off pooling intervals and intervals of full discretion but instead take more complex shapes. We use advanced results from the calculus of variations to ensure existence of a solution and derive sufficient and necessary conditions for optimality. The optimal mechanism is continuous and deterministic. The agent's informational rent, the average decision and its spread are strictly monotonic in the agent's type. The comparison of the optimal mechanism with standard one-dimensional mechanisms shows how cooperation between different principals controlling various dimensions of the agent's activities facilitates information revelation.

The article offers an algorithm for displaying the quality of train travel. The ranks assigned to the criteria by train passengers (category K), service staff (category P) and administrative staff (category A) are calculated establishing the differences between the ranks of criteria. The opinions of the respondents and experts belonging to categories K, P and A are compared considering the significance of the adopted criteria. The paper provides the results obtained from the surveyed respondents and experts and presents the ranks given to criterion groups A, B, C, D describing the quality of train travel. Finally, the conclusions based on the performed research are presented.","[Maskeliunaite, Lijana; Sivilevicius, Henrikas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Transport Technol Equipment, LT-10105 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Sivilevicius, H (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Transport Technol Equipment, Plytines G 27, LT-10105 Vilnius, Lithuania.",lijana.maskeliunaite@vgtu.lt; henrikas.sivilevicius@vgtu.lt,,"Maskeliunaite, Lijana/0000-0001-7764-9199",,,,,45,17,17,1,35,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Drawing on a wide range of recent empirical research, we find the following: (1) The Fed's full history (1914 to present) has been characterized by more rather than fewer symptoms of monetary and macroeconomic instability than the decades leading to the Fed's establishment. (2) While the Fed's performance has undoubtedly improved since World War II, even its postwar performance has not clearly surpassed that of its undoubtedly flawed predecessor, the National Banking system, before World War I. (3) Some proposed alternative arrangements might plausibly do better than the Fed as presently constituted.

However, in this paper we show that they may also have incentives to divert traffic away from their hubs. More precisely, we examine how the optimal distribution of traffic of network carriers can be affected by the two major recent innovations in the airline industry: the regional jet technology and the low-cost business model. On the one hand, we show that a network airline may find it profitable to serve thin point-to-point routes with regional jets when the distance between endpoints is sufficiently short and there is a high proportion of business travelers. On the other hand, we observe that a network airline may be interested in serving thin point-to-point routes by means of a low-cost subsidiary when the distance between endpoints is longer and there is a high proportion of leisure travelers. We conclude that network airlines are using those innovations to provide services on thin routes out of the hubs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our cross-country calibration of the growth model predicts that countries with a greater government involvement in education experience lower schooling efforts and lower growth.","[Basu, Parantap] Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham DH1 3HY, England; [Bhattarai, Keshab] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",Durham University; University of Hull,"Basu, P (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham DH1 3HY, England.",parantap.basu@durham.ac.uk; k.r.bhattarai@hull.ac.uk,"Bhattarai, Keshab/AAM-8733-2020; Bhattarai, Keshab/AFH-7332-2022","Bhattarai, Keshab/0000-0002-5398-984X",,,,,25,3,5,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The statistical properties of Markov Regime-Switching time series models are more desirable than those of conventional time series or panel regression models. Through these properties of MSMs, i) one can observe structural changes, if they exist, in FDI equations through time, ii) if, in fact, the true FDI regression equation follows a nonlinear relationship, MSMs fit data better than the linear models. This paper eventually follows maximum likelihood methodology of Markov Regime-Switching Model (MSM) to search for the possible structural changes in level and/or trends and possible changes in parameters of independent variables of FDI-MSM equations through the transition probabilities. In conclusion, this paper yields the outcome that Turkish FDI growth equation has significant structural changes in level and trend and that has significant coefficient shifts in explanatory variables. These explanatory variables are Turkish GDP Growth, Labor Cost, the Electricity Price Growth, the growth in average prices of High Sulphur Fuel Oil, Cooking Coal, Steam Coal and Natural Gas, Export Growth, Import Growth, Discount Rate and Country Risk Indexes for Turkey.

If all firms have the same marginal cost of production we obtain that for some value of parameters the government does not privatize the public firm regardless of how many private firms are competing in the product market.

Several reduced-form model specifications are estimated to study tax incidence, using wholesale equilibrium prices for both gasoline and motor diesel in the Italian fuel industry over the period 1996-2007 as dependent variables. We then assess the impact on fuel prices stemming from the creation of an automatic fiscal mechanism consisting of reductions in specific taxes matching the rise in oil prices. Our evidence supports the idea that flexible taxation mechanisms focused only on excise taxes could not be a viable policy for stabilizing the price level in fuel markets and more complex policies (based also on ad valorem taxes) are needed. Alternative interventions to control prices can be designed focusing on the market structure of these industries, where Antitrust Authority could play a significant role. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we use a gravity model to examine the relationship between bilateral trade flows and trade facilitation. We also estimate the gains in trade derived from improvements in trade facilitation for the Central Asian countries. Trade facilitation is measured through the World Bank's Logistic Performance Index (LPI). Our results show that there have been significant gains in trade as a result of improving trade facilitation in the Central Asian countries. These gains in trade vary from 28 percent in the case of Azerbaijan to as much as 63 percent in the case of Tajikistan. Furthermore, intraregional trade has increased by 100 percent. Among the different components of the LPI, we find that the greatest increase in total trade comes from improvement in infrastructure, followed by logistics and efficiency of customs and other border agencies.","[Felipe, Jesus] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Felipe, J (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines.",,"wassie, mengistu/ABT-3222-2022",,,,,,14,32,34,2,62,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

In recent years, the export performance of France relative to its own past and relative to a major trading partner, Germany, deteriorated. That deterioration seems related to the trend growth of exports (both by geographical destination and by product composition). Using a structural generalized dynamic factor model, this study shows that faced with an increase in unit labor costs or in its terms of trade, France adjusts relatively less via price and wage changes, and more via employment changes. French exports benefit relatively less than German exports from positive shocks either in a geographical or in the Standard International Trade Classification product classification. Given that the convergence of the French guaranteed minimum wage (SMIC) operated between 2003 and 2006 resulted in a significant increase in unit labor costs, the study supports the view that the foreign sector difficulties might be structural. The importance of trade flows as well as the policy constraints imposed by the euro area, highlights the relevance of structural reforms that increase markets flexibility. In addition, the analysis stresses the importance of policy measures that increase productivity, and the desirability of avoiding SMIC adjustments unrelated to productivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Because of this households also choose to invest less in a female child's education relative her male sibling.","[Rammohan, Anu; Robertson, Peter E.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Rammohan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, M251,35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",peter.robertson@uwa.edu.au,,"Robertson, peter/0000-0002-0424-6732; Rammohan, Anu/0000-0002-9062-4508",,,,,72,7,8,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We use different oil price specifications and use dynamic VAR models and multivariate regression to investigate how 38 different industries respond to oil price shocks. We pay specific attention to the asymmetry of the industries responses regarding oil price increases and decreases. We find that the impact of oil price shocks substantially differs along the different industries. We find that the significance of this result also differs along the various oil price specifications. The results are quite robust to the way in which we model the problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A theoretical framework shows that the combination of a label and a per-unit tax is socially optimal. Alternatively, if the label is unavailable, the theory cannot directly conclude which instrument should be socially preferred. Estimations of willingness-to-pay (WTP) are useful for completing the theoretical analysis and evaluating policies ex ante on case-by-case basis. Using hypothetical WTP for shrimp, we confirm that the combination of a label and a tax is socially optimal.

We find that rural-urban immigration does not contribute to urban unemployment in China.

It examines how a regulator can control emission reductions by emitters by setting two policy parameters: emission targets and trigger prices. I demonstrate that the capabilities of these two policy parameters are greatly affected by uncertainty regarding unconstrained aggregate emissions. I also show that there exists a specific combination of target and trigger-price settings that eliminates the need to consider uncertainty regarding unconstrained aggregate emissions when regulators set emission reduction goals. The model and its findings identify a rule for setting trigger prices with respect to the total design of tradable permit systems and thus offer practical guidance in designing a permit market.,"Univ Tokyo, Coll Arts & Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Maeda, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Coll Arts & Sci, Meguro Ku, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538902, Japan.",maeda@global.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23241019, 21330054] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,35,4,7,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Thus, the Taylor curve necessitates that the correlation between the volatilities of inflation and the output gap be non-positive for optimal monetary policy. Friedman (2006) challenged Chatterjee (2002) and Taylor's (2006) view that the Taylor curve may be used as a policy menu from which the central bank may choose the level of inflation and output gap volatilities. To better understand the issue, we take an in depth look at the correlation between the second moments of inflation and the output gap through the lens of the Taylor curve. Our results reveal that macroeconomic performance is superior in time periods in which the Taylor curve relationship holds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

One popular view attributes the high saving rate to fast-rising housing prices in China. However, cross-sectional data do not show a significant relationship between housing prices and household saving rates. This article uses a simple consumption-saving model to explain why rising housing prices per se cannot explain China's high household saving rate. Although borrowing constraints and demographic changes can translate housing prices to the aggregate saving rate, quantitative simulations of our model using Chinese time-series data on household income, housing prices, and demographics indicate that rising mortgage costs can increase the aggregate saving rate by at most 2 to 4 percentage points in the best down-payment structure.

Correlations are particularly high within Europe. Prior research focused on first-difference correlations, which are typically quite low. We argue that this reflects measurement error.

The data show that sectors characterized by a higher degree of competition tend to lobby more together (through a sector-wide trade association), while sectors with higher concentration and more differentiated products lobby more individually. The paper proposes a theoretical model to interpret the empirical evidence. In an oligopolistic market, firms can benefit from an increase in their product-specific protection measure, if they can raise prices and profits. They find it less profitable to do so in a competitive market where attempts to raise prices are more likely to reduce profits. In competitive markets firms are therefore more likely to lobby together, thereby simultaneously raising tariffs on all products in the sector. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of envy on the optimal pricing of quality varies depending on whether consumers are concerned about envy in payments or in rents. If consumers compare their payments with those of other consumers, the firm has an incentive to produce lower quality than the first-best level for the high valuation consumer and higher quality than the second-best level for the low valuation consumer.

We first show that narrative shocks are orthogonal to the relevant information set a fiscal VAR. We then derive impulse responses to these shocks. The use of narrative shocks does not require the inversion of the moving-average representation of a VAR for the identification of the relevant shocks. Therefore, within this framework, fiscal multipliers can be identified and estimated even when, in the presence of fiscal foresight, the MA representation of the VARs is not invertible.

To achieve this, many countries have invested to develop into 'knowledge economies'. Universities have a role to play in this transformation, both as generators of new knowledge as well as actors that can interact with the local industry and contribute to its innovativeness. This paper explores, using two case studies in the Chilean and South African wine industry, how universities connect international science to domestic industry. It finds that this connection occurs through a few 'bridging researchers', who display particular characteristics compared with their colleagues. Bridging researchers are more 'talented' than average researchers, both because they publish more in international journals and/or because they have received awards for their academic work. This finding may have significant policy implications, as policies aimed at strengthening the skills of these researchers should be welcomed in catching-up industries.","[Giuliani, Elisa; Rabellotti, Roberta] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Pavia,"Giuliani, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Econ Aziendale, Fac Econ, Via Ridolfi10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",giulel@ec.unipi.it,"Rabellotti, Roberta/AAX-1086-2020","Rabellotti, Roberta/0000-0001-7637-3645; Giuliani, Elisa/0000-0002-3813-1861",,,,,62,24,25,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

However, the corresponding literature assumes that agents who veto a mechanism can enforce a situation in which the public good is never provided. This paper instead considers majority voting with uniform cost-sharing as the relevant status quo. Efficient mechanisms may then exist, which also satisfy all agents' interim participation constraints. In this case, ex post inefficient voting mechanisms can be replaced by efficient ones without reducing any individual's expected utility. Intuitively, agents with a low willingness to pay have to contribute more under majority rule than under an efficient mechanism with a balanced budget. Although this possibility theorem is not universal in the sense of Schweizer (2006), an asymptotic possibility is obtained for certain type distributions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We show that the latter factor strengthens in the process of endogenous growth and that it affects the optimal trade-off between quantity and quality of teachers such that the number of teachers hired will grow over time while their relative, but not the absolute, human capital attainment will fall. This is accompanied by increasing inequality, among the group of college educated workers in particular. We show that this effect, which we call the rising talent premium, applies whether teacher salaries are determined based on merit pay or, alternatively, by collective bargaining. Moreover, the salary compression characterizing the latter regime exacerbates the loss of the more talented workers by the teaching profession. Further, we analyze a comparative dynamics effect of exogenous skill-biased technological change which raises the college premium. We show that the effect is detrimental to the aggregate quality of teachers and to the quality of basic education. An important insight from this analysis is that in the process of human capital driven economic growth the rise in premium for high ability outpaces that for the average, whereby this effect is accelerated by technological change. This puts a downward pressure on the real quality of education inputs and therefore can create a negative feedback effect on human capital development as a factor of economic growth.

To answer this question we develop a new framework for sectoral development accounting.

However, in manufactured consumption the sectoral TFP differences are about equal to the aggregate TFP differences, and in services they are much smaller. We show that our level of disaggregation allows us to reconcile the results of existing studies of sectoral productivity differences, which have focused on noncomparable two-sector decompositions of the aggregate data.

Population fairness requires that upon the arrival of a new airline, the contributions of all airlines whose costs are not less than the cost of the new airline should be affected by equal amounts. Smallest-cost consistency requires that upon the departure of an airline with the smallest cost, if the problem is reevaluated from the viewpoint of the remaining airlines, then all the remaining airlines should contribute the same amounts as they did initially. Balanced population impact requires that the effect on the contribution from the departure of one airline to another should be the same between any two airlines.

These games suffer from a curse of dimensionality when the cost of computing players' expectations over all possible future states increases exponentially in the number of state variables. We explore the alternative of continuous-time stochastic games with a finite number of states and argue that continuous time may have substantial advantages. In particular, under widely used laws of motion, continuous time avoids the curse of dimensionality in computing expectations, thereby speeding up the computations by orders of magnitude in games with more than a few state variables. This much smaller computational burden greatly extends the range and richness of applications of stochastic games.","[Doraszelski, Ulrich] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Judd, Kenneth L.] Hoover Inst War Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA USA; [Judd, Kenneth L.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Doraszelski, U (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",doraszelski@wharton.upenn.edu; judd@hoover.stanford.edu,,,,,,,54,41,54,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Since every working strategy has its benefits and costs and may bring a company different opportunities and risks, which kind of working strategy is the most appropriate for a company to accomplish is a sophisticated and complex decision with a high degree of uncertainty Therefore, the current paper proposed an integrated evaluation model based on the analytic network process (ANP) and the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS), to help the decision makers or managers with the selection of proper working strategy in a fuzzy environment where the fuzziness and uncertainties are handled with linguistic terms parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). In this paper fuzzy ANP (FANP) is utilized to take into account interdependence and dependencies and determine the importance weights of benefit, opportunities, cost and risk (BOCR) factors, and fuzzy COPRAS is applied to rank the alternatives.

In this paper I argue that this is, at least in part, because policy-makers (as distinct, perhaps, from business school gurus) never understood competitiveness in quite the manner he assumed. I suggest that Krugman largely misdiagnosed the problem of competitiveness, directing us to the link between competitiveness and protectionism that was always less prevalent and more tenuous than he imagined. As a consequence he overlooked other more pertinent and problematic aspects of the discourse of competitiveness that persist relatively unchallenged in spite of his warnings. More specifically, I seek to show that Krugman's understanding of competitiveness is insufficiently differentiated and rests on inferences drawn from an overly stylised model of competition for market share in product markets that exhibit a high demand price elasticity and in which success is associated exclusively with strategies of cost containment. As I show through a series of extensions to his model, this leads him to fail to see that it is the privileging of cost competitiveness specifically, rather than the pursuit of competitiveness per se that is the dangerous obsession from which we most need protecting today.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Hay, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",c.hay@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Hay, Colin/0000-0001-6327-6547",,,,,22,13,17,2,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

However, the behavior of wholesale power marketers has generally been overlooked. To fill this gap, our paper focuses on the pricing behavior of five major power marketers in the California PX during 2000: Duke Energy Trading & Marketing, Reliant Energy Services, Dynegy Power Marketing, Enron Power Marketing, and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading. Our unique data set, collected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during an investigation of energy market pricing manipulation, allows us to assess the level of market power using the conduct parameter pricing model. The estimated conduct parameter allows us to determine power marketer pricing behavior is competitive. Cournot, or collusive. Our results indicate that Duke Energy and Reliant were exercising market power when pricing the wholesale electricity they sold in the California PX during 2000. No statistical evidence was uncovered to show that the smaller marketers - Dynegy, Williams and, Enron - were setting prices at a level higher than those consistent with a competitive market.

The policy leaves investors uncertain about the project type and prescribes different levels of government support, in the form of tax or price distortions. However, the optimal policy does not change the expectations of investors about distribution of project returns.

New evidence of price transmission,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Farmgate prices; Agriculture; Price transmission,INTEGRATION; EMERGENCE; ACCESSION,"This paper examines the extent to which Chinese farmers are connected to regional agricultural markets by looking at the intensity of price transmission from retail markets to the farmgate. This intensity is indicative of the extent to which farmers might benefit from improved marketing opportunities and be exposed to price risks. We estimate the elasticity of farmgate prices to retail prices using price data for 170 markets, in 29 out of 33 provinces of China, at the detail of 12 main products and for the five-year period 1996 to 2000. In each province we find strong linkages between retail and farmgate prices with elasticities ranging between 0.6 and 1 and intensifying over time. This suggests that Chinese farmers are generally well connected to retail markets and that this connectivity has strengthened in the period considered, creating not only new opportunities but also new risks. It is also found that linkages are relatively weak in inland provinces, which is a point of concern in view of Chinese policies to create equal opportunities and equitable growth.

The proposed risk factors include financial market expectations of a gloomy economic outlook, credit or liquidity risks in the general economy, the risks of negative wealth effects resulting from the bursting of asset price bubbles, and signs of deteriorating macroeconomic fundamentals. The model specifications include three different dynamic probit models and the standard static model. The out-of-sample analysis suggests that the four probit models with the proposed risk factors can generate more accurate forecasts for the duration of recessions than the conventional static models with only yield spread and equity price index as the predictors. Among the four probit models, the dynamic and dynamic autoregressive probit models outperform the static and autoregressive models in terms of predicting the recession duration. With respect to forecasting the business cycle turning points, the static probit model is as good as the dynamic probit models by being able to flag an early warning signal of a recession.

We investigated factors affecting household-level wood energy consumption in the four continental U.S. regions using data from the U.S. Residential Energy Consumption Survey. To account for a large number of zero observations (i.e., households that do not burn wood), left-censored Tobit models were estimated. Urban/rural location is a key determinant of level of household wood energy consumption. Wood energy consumption elasticity with respect to non-wood energy price changes was 1.55 at the U.S. level, and a much higher 2.30 among rural households. While household wood energy consumption was affected primarily by non-wood energy price in rural areas, it was influenced mainly by household size and level of income in urban areas. Elasticity of wood energy consumption with respect to income can be positive or negative depending on household urban/rural location, region and income level. Newer houses were found to use less wood energy than older ones, and greater urbanization was found to have negative effect on wood energy use. Our findings suggest that policies reducing relative wood energy cost or increasing non-wood energy prices in the residential sector will result in greater wood energy consumption in the U.S. The effect of policies may vary by region and are likely to be more effective in U.S. rural areas and in the U.S. Midwest in particular.

We find that the auto-correlations display multiscaling behaviors and are dominated by the anti-persistence (mean-reversion) in the long-term. Moreover, the auto-correlations are multifractal, indicating that various small and large fluctuations display different scaling behaviors. Using a technique of rolling windows, we find that some extreme events can drive the degree of anti-persistence and the multifractality (complexity) to rise up. In other words, these events have negative impacts on market efficiency. However, the effects of these events are not alike. We also detect long-range auto-correlations in crack spread volatilities and find a strong persistent behavior and multifractality. Finally, we discuss the modeling implications of the findings on long-range auto-correlated patterns. Our results indicate that ARFIMA-GARCH models can capture the major dynamics of large fluctuations. For small fluctuations, they are misspecified. Interestingly, we find that the strong long-range auto-correlated behaviors do not imply that ARFIMA model which takes long memory into account can outperform random walk model in the sense of out-of-sample prediction. The major reason may be that market complexity exploited in this paper causes the low predictability of ARFIMA model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Most FDI is horizontal. Yet, the world witnessed an FDI boom in 1990s, a period of striking falls in trade barriers. This paper carries out an empirical analysis with rich, firm-level data on the activities of Swedish multinationals around the globe in manufacturing sectors from 1987 to 1998 to shed light on this apparent conflict. The analysis is based on the predictions of a recent literature with an industrial organization (10) angle: Trade costs have asymmetric effects on foreign expansion modes. This view posits that falling trade costs encourage entry realized as mergers and acquisitions (M&As), one of the potential explanations for the conflict between received theory and recent trends in FDI. Empirical results confirm the findings of this recent literature and add to it by testing its extensions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Apart from the well-known simultaneity and selection bias, attention is given to methodological issues that have emerged more recently and that are related to the use of deflated values of inputs and outputs (as opposed to quantities) in estimating productivity at the firm level, as well as to the endogeneity of product choice. In discussing the estimation procedures applied in the literature, attention is given to recent developments in the field. Using data on single-product firms active in the Belgian food and beverages sector, the most commonly applied estimators are illustrated, allowing for comparison of the obtained productivity estimates by way of a simple evaluation exercise.","[Van Beveren, Ilke] Lessius Univ Coll, Dept Business Studies, Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Beveren, Ilke] Catholic Univ Louvain, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Van Beveren, I (通讯作者)，Lessius Univ Coll, Dept Business Studies, Antwerp, Belgium.",,"Van Beveren, Ilke/C-8046-2013","Van Beveren, Ilke/0000-0002-3766-1078",,,,,60,308,346,12,112,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The ARDL bounds testing approach is used to investigate the existance of long-run relationship between FDI, export and economic growth for these countries. After detection of cointegratin relationship, the error-correction based Granger causality test is employed to examine the both long-run and short-run causality issues between the variables by using quarterly data from 1994 to 2008.

In so doing, it makes the following contributions to the literature. First, the methodology allows causality testing within a bivariate system, with other important variables included in the system. Second, the analysis is based on a model chosen out of three other competing models. The models consider the possibility of both symmetric and asymmetric responses to demand and supply shock inflationary situations. This approach differs from the traditional Engle-Granger (EG) approach, which implicitly assumes symmetric adjustment towards equilibrium (Enders and Siklos, 2001). Third, causality testing is conducted within an error correction framework to handle possible inferential biases resulting from invalid asymptotic critical values. The chosen model was used to conduct short-and long-run causality tests within a framework that takes into account differentiated responses to changes in inflation regimes. The following are major findings of this study: There exists dynamic relationship between producer and consumer prices, characterized by unidirectional causality running from producer to consumer inflation. On the issue of asymmetric responses, it is found that consumer inflation reacts differently to positive and negative trends in producer inflation. In other words, consumer price rises faster than it falls.","[Alemu, Zerihun Gudeta] Dev Bank So Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Alemu, Zerihun Gudeta] Univ Orange Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Alemu, ZG (通讯作者)，Dev Bank So Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa.",zerihunA@dbsa.org,,,,,,,13,5,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The availability of the experiment also allows us to estimate the program's general equilibrium effects, which we then incorporate into our simulations.

However, these taxes distort the bequest decision and thus, the overall effect on social welfare is ambiguous.

We find that smuggling is rampant in Cameroon, Pakistan and Kenya while it is least prevalent in Switzerland, Finland and Sweden.","[Buehn, Andreas; Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Chair Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Buehn, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Chair Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",andreas.buehn@.tu-dresden.de,"Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza/AFM-2779-2022","Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza/0000-0002-6533-3645",,,,,51,28,31,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Moreover, it addresses potential crowding-out effects, context-dependent and incoherent preferences, risk misperceptions, ambiguity aversion, and regulator bias.

However, work among welfare participants has increased steadily since the mid-1990s. This study estimates the role of the 1993 Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion on the decline of welfare caseloads using a bivariate probit model. Using monthly Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) information, I find that the 1993 EITC expansion has at least the same effect on reducing welfare use as the welfare reform initiatives. Moreover, the elasticity estimates indicate that single mothers, especially those who were not employed and dependent solely on welfare before the expansion, were the most responsive to the policy initiatives. Finally, the increase in work among welfare participants is due to the relative ineffectiveness of the policies in reducing the net population of those who are on welfare and work simultaneously.","[Chyi, Hau] Renmin Univ China, Hanqing Adv Inst Econ & Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Chyi, H (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Hanqing Adv Inst Econ & Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hauchyi@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our basic set-up and the nature of the questions continue the work of Grossman and Hart (1980), Harris and Raviv (1988), and Blair, Golbe and Gerard (1989). We consider three cases with respect to the allowable price offers (for shares and for votes when they can be traded separately): unrestricted price offers, quantity-restricted price offers, and price offers contingent on winning. Our main results are characterizations of the equilibria and of the circumstances under which vote buying is harmful. We show that allowing votes to be traded separately of shares results in inefficiencies in all the cases we study. Similarly allowing quantity-restricted offers is also harmful, but allowing conditional offers is not in itself detrimental to efficiency. The paper also makes a methodological contribution to the analysis of takeover games with atomless shareholders. It provides a way of dealing with asymmetric equilibria that must be dealt with for a complete analysis and it proves existence of an equilibrium.","[Dekel, Eddie] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Dekel, Eddie; Wolinsky, Asher] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Tel Aviv University; Northwestern University,"Dekel, E (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel.",,,,,,,,28,9,9,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

These probabilities were then compared with the probabilities of the Cup result implied by odds in that market. The odds in the market for the Cup result underreact to both good and bad news that is provided by changes in the odds in the markets for the individual pairings.

Additionally, it is also assumed that acquired ability in childhood and school resources interplay to determine the student's probability of leaving school before graduation. Therefore, considering that dropping out of school and criminality are endogenously determined by the quality of early childhood education, school inputs and law enforcement parameters, this paper offers a framework to study the effects of interventions in early education on criminality and human capital accumulation vis-a-vis enhancing school resources and public spending on enforcement. Numerical simulations show that stimuli to increase investments in the education of children from disadvantaged families are much more cost-effective as a crime-prevention policy than expenditures on school resources and police protection.",,,,marcelors2@insper.edu.br,"dos Santos, Marcelo Rodrigues/AAL-9483-2021","dos Santos, Marcelo Rodrigues/0000-0002-6052-0185",,,,,32,0,0,1,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We use a large set of proxies for central-bank transparency in 12 advanced economies. We find evidence for a sizeable effect (e.g., by announcing a quantified inflation objective, or by publishing inflation and output forecasts). However, there are decreasing marginal effects to increases in transparency, and the disagreement among the expectations of the general public is not affected.

According to the SAH, intra-industry trade leads to relatively lower adjustment costs in comparison to inter-industry trade. The paper tests the SAH by using a dynamic panel data analysis that takes into account lagged effects of changes in the MIIT (marginal intra-industry trade) index. The regressions use the absolute change in the total employment in a given industry as a proxy for trade adjustment costs. The main results imply that a higher MIIT leads to lower adjustment costs in the same year. More specifically, the coefficients of the MITT index are negative and statistically significant in all the regressions.

Both functions consider space as continuous territories, not as the arbitrary addition of discrete geographical units (i.e. municipalities, states).

What are the driving forces behind the changes in the gender labour-market outcomes over the period 1968-1997? It formulates a dynamic general equilibrium model of labour supply, occupational sorting, and human-capital accumulation in which gender discrimination and an earnings gap arise endogenously. It uses this model to quantify the driving forces behind the decline in the gender earnings gap and the increase in female labour-force participation, the proportion of women working in professional occupations, and hours worked. It finds that labour-market experience is the most important factor explaining the gender earnings gap. In addition, statistical discrimination accounts for a large fraction of the observed gender earnings gap and its decline. It also finds that a large increase in aggregate productivity in professional occupations plays a major role in the increase in female labour-force participation, number of hours worked, and the proportion of females working in professional occupations. Although of less importance, demographic changes account for a substantial part of the increase in female labour-force participation and hours worked, whereas home production technology shocks do not.","[Gayle, George-Levi; Golan, Limor] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,,,,,,,60,45,57,4,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The optimal income tax trades off social insurance against incentives to work. Education subsidies are not used for social insurance, but they are only targeted at offsetting the distortions of the labor tax and internalizing a fiscal externality. Both optimal education subsidies and tax rates increase if labor and education are more complementary, because education subsidies indirectly lower labor tax distortions by stimulating labor supply. Optimal education subsidies (taxes) also correct non-tax distortions arising from missing insurance markets. Education subsidies internalize a positive (negative) fiscal externality if there is underinvestment (overinvestment) in education because of risk. Education policy unambiguously allows for more social insurance if education is a risky activity. However, if education hedges against labor-market risk, optimal tax rates could be lower than in the case without education subsidies.","[Jacobs, Bas] Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Schindler, Dirk; Yang, Hongyan] Univ Konstanz, DE-78457 Constance, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Konstanz,"Jacobs, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bjacobs@ese.eur.nl; dirk.schindler@uni-konstanz.de; hongyan.yang@uni-konstanz.de,,"Schindler, Dirk/0000-0002-4254-6592",,,,,27,10,11,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

For the average developing country in our sample, the results indicate that economic catch-up has been accompanied by above-average growth of the use of most primary energy carriers, the consumption of final energy in most sectors and total CO2 emissions. For industrialized countries, we find that economic growth is partially decoupled from energy consumption and that above average rates of economic growth were accompanied by larger improvements in energy efficiency. These results emphasize the need to identify the relevant engines of economic growth, their implications for energy use and possibilities to achieve low-carbon growth centered on productivity and efficiency improvements rather than on capital accumulation.

This paper discusses how different research approaches provide fundamentally different behaviours and attitudes to this problem. It is demonstrated how theory can provide useful yet markedly different interpretations of the organizational budgeting process. Critical theory and interpretive theory operate front varying or transitive epistemological dimension, whereas critical realism tends to emphasize the importance of ontological issues.

Vehicle routing problem is more complex variant of traveling salesman problem, because we have to consider many constraints e.g. vehicle capacity, time windows, diversity of fleet. When solving this problem we also have to solve the knapsack problem, because each vehicle has its defined capacity that has to be utilized optimally. Bee colony optimization algorithm belongs to metaheuristics so we can apply it to solve NP-hard problems. To demonstrate algorithms' ability to solve this kind of problems we created C# program that utilizes bees behaviour during nectar collection. Bees are divided into three groups, active bee, inactive bee and scout. Active bee scans space close to the food source (in our case, food source is city), scout randomly searches through whole space of solutions, and inactive bee waits for waggle dance of active bee and scout. This waggle dance is used for information exchange. Thanks to scouts the hive can leave local extreme, because of their random search of whole space of solutions.","[Marian, Sedivy] Uni Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Informat, Dept Appl Informat, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",,,marian.sedivy@gmail.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,IURA EDITION SPOL SRO,BRATISLAVA,"ORAAVSKA 17, BRATISLAVA, 821 09, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3426-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,193,196,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBN51,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307520000032,0

Emphasis is placed on the flow-of-funds story (finance matters for economic growth). It is noted that recent evidence is weighted in favour of the argument that financial development, in terms of financial institutions and markets and their role in reducing information asymmetry and pricing risk, is crucial for economic growth. Also, new evidence offers important insights into the mechanisms by which finance induces economic growth, including emerging work on corporate finance as well as work that teases out an implication for inter-generational income distribution and poverty reduction (the finance-and-growth opportunity argument). However, there are some cautionary tales, as well, not least because of financial crises and contagion effects and the threat to sustainable growth and income convergence. Evidence specific to African economies is highlighted and implications for policy are drawn. The paper concludes by proposing the way forward for further research.","Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Murinde, V (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",v.murinde@bham.ac.uk,,"Murinde, Victor/0000-0003-4113-5860",,,,,135,36,37,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The indicators are implied options volatility, Treasury-Eurodollar (TED) spread and exchange rate. While implied volatility captures market risk in that it reflects the fear factor embedded in the price of an option, TED spread reflects the default risk premium that is priced into a key short-term credit instrument. Equity markets often show a tendency to reflect the incidence of these risk factors. And because they provide valuable information about the health of the economy, many have argued that equity market valuation be taken into account in the formulation of monetary policy. Results of this study not only show a statistically significant inverse relationship between the stock market and these risk factors, but also evidence of a cointegration. In a variance decomposition of the series, we find that equity valuation is a major contributor to the forecast error variances of each of the risk indicators, a finding that lends tacit support to the argument that risk indicators associated with the equity market be considered in monetary policy decisions.","[Obi, Pat] Purdue Univ Calumet, Hammond, IN 46321 USA; [Dubihlela, Job] Vaal Univ Technol, Vanderbijl Pk, South Africa; [Choi, Jeong-Gil] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Vaal University of Technology (VUT); Kyung Hee University,"Obi, P (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ Calumet, 2200 169th St, Hammond, IN 46321 USA.",cpobi@purdue.edu,"Dubihlela, Jobo/ABE-4987-2020; Choi, Jeong-Gil/ABF-5325-2020","Dubihlela, Jobo/0000-0001-6228-6524;",,,,,31,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Focusing on the educational aspects and human capital for further economic development of EU countries, quality higher education and training, business sophistication and innovation are what should be developed. These three competitiveness aspects are not independent: they tend to reinforce each other, and a weakness in one area often has a negative impact on other areas (World Economic Forum, 2010). Moreover, all of them are tightly related to entrepreneurship and their development concerns the promotion of students' entrepreneurship in the study process at higher educational institutions. Being recognized as one of the lifelong learning key competences, in the European documents entrepreneurship is defined as a combination of entrepreneurial knowledge, skills and attitude (Commission of the European Communities, 2005). However, the PhD research The development of students' enterprise in study process conducted by Karine Oganisjana under the scientific supervision of Tatjana Koke in the University of Latvia (Oganisjana & Koke, 2008; Oganisjana, 2010 a,b) revealed that the concept of entrepreneurship is broader than just a mechanical combination of entrepreneurial knowledge, skills and attitude. Entrepreneurship is defined as a dynamic system of individual's causally interrelated personality traits, motivation, cognition, needs, emotions, abilities, learning, skills and behaviour, on the basis of which an individual or a group of individuals interact with the context (environment) for identifying, generating and realizing opportunities into new values (Oganisjana, 2010b). Therefore, if higher education (HE) is oriented towards the development of students' competence only, which is acknowledged as a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes, the development of the other components of entrepreneurship are not taken care of and the creation of new economic values which then makes the key determinant of entrepreneurship not to be in the focus of such HE. The paper presents the main findings of the research and raises a question about the reconsideration of the capacity of competence-oriented higher education for promoting students' entrepreneurship and as a result for increasing their competitiveness.","[Oganisjana, Karine; Koke, Tatjana] Univ Latvia, LV-1083 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Oganisjana, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Jurmalas St 74-76, LV-1083 Riga, Latvia.",Karine.Oganisjana@lu.lv; Tatjana.koke@lu.lv,,"Oganisjana, Karine/0000-0002-4835-3943",,,,,44,12,15,2,54,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

First, we use a unique input-output table augmented by firm size dimension. Second, we link the input-output table with the balance sheet conditions of financial institutions and firms. Based on Japanese input-output tables, we find that the lending attitude of financial institutions affected firms' input decision in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. Simulation exercises are conducted to evaluate the effects of changes in the lending attitude toward small firms as favorable as that toward large firms on sectoral allocations. We find that output was increased for small firms and reduced for large firms. The change in output was non-negligible, about 5.5% of the initial output of each sector.

Moreover, a negative effect was detected and explained rather controversially: It is argued that the majority of spectators prefer to see the home team play either a much inferior team or a rather successful team. With data of n = 306 matches in the German Bundesliga, a generalized Tobit estimator with individual cut-off points and error terms clustered by home teams is employed to follow up with the discussion on the (un)importance of outcome uncertainty. The results highlight a significant positive effect on attendance when either the home and/or the away team still has a theoretical chance to win the championship while the suggested importance of teams still having the possibility to qualify for the UEFA Champions League is not supported (medium-term uncertainty). Furthermore, in line with previous research we could detect a negative effect of short-term uncertainty. However, while there is no evidence that spectators prefer the home team to play an inferior team, the results suggest that it is rather a strong brand of the away team that rises attendance figures in the German Bundesliga.","[Pawlowski, Tim; Anders, Christoph] German Sport Univ Cologne, Inst Sport Econ & Sport Management, D-50933 Cologne, Germany",German Sport University Cologne,"Pawlowski, T (通讯作者)，German Sport Univ Cologne, Inst Sport Econ & Sport Management, Sportpk Mungersdorf 6, D-50933 Cologne, Germany.",pawlowski@dshs-koeln.de,"Pawlowski, Tim/G-2487-2011",,,,,,9,116,120,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

With constant marginal costs, we find the standard result where the good and the service in the bundle are lower than separately. However, under the increasing cost assumption, when the degree of the complementarity becomes sufficiently high, the marginal price of separate good is lower than the good price in the bundle. Contrary to Martimort (1992), when good and service are perfectly complementary, we can not conclude that it is costly for consumers to sign two contracts from different shops than to buy the bundle. Because of asymmetric properties in the utility function, profitability result of bundling strategy depends, on the one hand, on the degree of complementarity between commodity and related service and on the other hand, on the degree of the optional service.","[Poudou, Jean-Christophe] Univ Montpellier I, LAMETA, F-34006 Montpellier, France",Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Podesta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Savoie, IREGE, 4 Chemin Bellevue,BP 80439, Annecy Le Vieux, France.",marion.podesta@univ-savoie.fr,,"Jean-Christophe, Poudou/0000-0001-9182-1979",,,,,14,1,1,1,12,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Estimates indicate that civil war reduces annual growth by 0.01-0.13 percentage points, and high-intensity inter-state conflict reduces annual growth by 0.18-2.77 percentage points. On the other hand, low-intensity conflict slows growth much less than high-intensity conflict, and may slightly increase it.

For that purpose, we employ: (1) the unit-root tests with good size and power of Ng and Perron (2001) with the small-sample bias correction developed by Perron and Qu (2007); (2) the nonlinear Exponential Smooth Transition Autoregressive (ESTAR) unit-root test proposed by Kapetanios et al. (2003); (3) median-unbiased estimations of the persistence parameter and the respective confidence intervals through the grid-bootstrap method proposed by Hansen (1999) and (4) median-unbiased estimations of the half-life of a shock in addition to the associated confidence intervals through the method based on impulse-response functions proposed by Gospodinov (2004). The results from the application of these techniques indicate that most of the CPI-based inflation rate series clearly contain a unit root. As regards the results for the PPI-based inflation rate series, we have provided evidence that the aggregate series appears to contain a unit root, while at the industry level the inflation rate series are found to be nonlinear stationary in 13 sectors. On the basis of this robust evidence of high persistence in inflation, policymakers should pay more attention to any shock hitting inflation, since the effects are expected to be long-lasting, particularly for consumer prices. Along these lines, it is essential to implement correcting reforms with the aim of raising price adjustment flexibility if one wants to avoid having to intervene actively in the markets to reach the inflation target.","[Romero-Avila, Diego; Usabiaga, Carlos] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Usabiaga, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",cusaiba@upo.es,"Usabiaga, Carlos/AAI-8911-2020; Romero-Ávila, Diego/K-4359-2017","Usabiaga, Carlos/0000-0002-1519-9070",,,,,51,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Family functioning, which has been shown to be a good indicator of child risk for substance abuse, provides a useful reference point for family decision making. Our results show that well-functioning families (with children at low risk for substance use) should have the lowest incentive to participate, but that high-risk families may also opt out of prevention programmes. For programmes that are most effective for high-risk youth, this could be a problem. Using data from the Strengthening Families Programme (SFP) and the Washington Healthy Youth Survey (HYS), we empirically test the implications of our model and find that at least for one measure of family functioning those families with children most likely to be at risk for substance use are opting out of the programme.","[Rosenman, Robert; Goates, Scott] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Hill, Laura] Washington State Univ, Dept Human Dev, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University; Washington State University,"Rosenman, R (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Hulbert Hall 101, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",yamaka@wsu.edu,"Hill, Laura G./A-6009-2008","Rosenman, Robert/0000-0002-3812-5824; Hill, Laura/0000-0002-0988-4637","NIDA NIH HHS [R21 DA025139-02, R21 DA025139] Funding Source: Medline",NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)),,,37,6,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Over this period, aggregate manufacturing value-added grew at the same rate as GDP, the number of manufacturing firms more than doubled, and average firm size fell by more than 40%. I highlight substantial heterogeneity in economic performance across firms, and emphasise a strong association between firm size and value-added per worker. I find that 29% of the value-added size gap can be attributed to differences in product selection across small and large firms. I find no systematic difference in the output price charged by small and large firms for a given product. I therefore attribute the remaining value-added size gap to a higher level of physical labour productivity in large than in small firms. I conclude that small and large firms in Ethiopia use quite different technologies to produce similar products, and that an increase in the number of large firms would raise value-added per worker and ultimately GDP per capita in the country.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Söderbom, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",mans.soderbom@economics.gu.se,,,,,,,17,15,17,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

However, the standard input-output (I-O) model is not particularly well equipped for studying current issues such as the consequences of decreasing access to primary inputs or the effects of specific redistributive policies. This paper addresses this gap in the existing literature. We propose that IDs can excellently be studied by restructuring the I-O relations. A new coefficients matrix is defined, the so-called augmented input coefficients matrix. This matrix is the sum of the intermediate input coefficients matrix and newly constructed matrices of sector-specific input coefficients that represent the existing distribution of income. We show that shifts in the distribution can be modelled by attributing weights to these matrices and vary these according to system-specific rules.

In their evaluation of whether to use performance-enhancing drugs, athletes consider not only costs and benefits (through rank improvement) but also the approval from fellow athletes toward pro-doping decisions. Peer-group approval is modeled as a lagged endogenous variable, depending on the share of doping athletes in the history of a sport. As such, the model can explain an equilibrium of high incidence of doping as a doping culture. In addition to presenting comparative statics of the equilibrium (i.e., in order to answer the question of how a doping culture can be eliminated), I also investigate how doping decisions are affected by the standards set by the leader in a sport (e.g., Olympic qualification marks), and by the disproportionate public veneration of winners.","Leibniz Univ Hannover, DE-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Strulik, H (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, DE-30167 Hannover, Germany.",strulik@vwl.uni-hannover.de,,"Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,32,13,13,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

There have since been new developments in both techniques in energy and emission studies. These developments have been studied systematically for IDA but similar studies for SDA are lacking. In this paper, we fill the gap by examining the new methodological developments in SDA. A new development is a shift towards using decomposition methods that are ideal. We compare four such SDA methods analytically and empirically through decomposing changes in China's CO2 emissions. We then provide guidelines on method selection. Finally, we discuss the similarities and differences between SDA and IDA based on the latest available information. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

At this stage, resources are redistributed in society by an 'invisible hand' to meet the needs of the population.

When using price errors, objective function in term structure estimation is a nonlinear function of the model parameters. This necessarily entails using numerical optimization techniques for estimation, which brings to fore the issue of (sensitivity of final results to) the choice of initialization of the optimization routine. This study assesses the sensitivity of the final objective function value and the final parameter vector to the choice of the 'initial guess' during the estimation of the popular Nelson-Siegel model. It turns out that there exist regions in the shape of the objective function where a slight change in (seemingly reasonable) initial vector takes one far from optimum. Choice of the (range of) 'best' starting vector turns out to be an empirical matter. Grid search is recommended. One must first get to a subset of initial values that results in the objective function value near a minimum and then assess the sensitivity of the final parameter vector to those relevant (subset of) initial values. The study illustrates the process using a typical trading day's data.","Indian Inst Management, Dept Finance & Accounting, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Virmani, V (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Dept Finance & Accounting, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India.",vineetv@iimahd.ernet.in,,,,,,,3,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Second, do government support and favourable investment conditions really help to save shipbuilding industry from the distressing situation? Third, if we separate Japan, South Korea and China as leading shipbuilding clusters, what will the cluster effect be? Our results indicate that the investment of ships can be decided by the freight level, the supply of the market (fleet size), the demand of the ships (trade volume) and the transport service share (location advantage). However, the state of the freight market is of major importance to the investment decision of ships.

Since then, sustainable development and the SEEA have given way to green growth and green economy indicators in the latest 2012 Summit. A lengthy revision process has now produced a curtailed SEEA central framework. The new framework focuses on expenditures for environmental protection and resource management, and stocks and flows of economic resources; both are covered by the conventional national accounts. Environmental degradation, notably from pollution, is left to experimental ecosystem accounts. Further revision of the SEEA should reverse this retrenchment from integrative environmental-economic accounting.

Unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for by means of a random effects model extended to include a Mundlak term and explicit controls for the respondents' personality traits. The paper shows that people care about social comparison information in a number of domains, not just income. Using an equivalent income approach, the estimates suggest that a one standard deviation deterioration of the individual position in the income distribution is as important as a 33.5 percent decrease in own income. This monetary equivalent amounts to an income variation of between 25 and 43 percent when it comes to other deprivation domains, including durables, accommodation, health, and social relations. These results recommend that in the fight against deprivation more emphasis should be directed to these non-monetary relevant dimensions.","[Blazquez Cuesta, Maite] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Budria, Santiago] CEEAplA, Ponta Delgada, Portugal; [Budria, Santiago] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidade dos Acores; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Cuesta, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",maite.blazquez@uam.es,"Blazquez, Maite/V-8795-2018; Budria, Santiago/F-4542-2011","Blazquez, Maite/0000-0002-2152-890X; Budria, Santiago/0000-0001-5537-4059",,,,,65,11,12,0,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

A simple experiment fails to measure a known preference. The divergence of the measured preference from the known preference reflects a mistake, arising from some subjects' misconception of the game form. We conclude that choice data should not be granted an unqualified interpretation of preference revelation. Mistakes in choices obscured by a possible error at the foundation of the theory of framing can masquerade as having been produced by nonstandard preferences.","[Cason, Timothy N.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Plott, Charles R.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; California Institute of Technology,"Cason, TN (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,,56,112,128,2,33,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

Although there are considerable differences between the huge Chinese economy and the small Nordic countries, there are enough similarities to make lesson-drawing a worthwhile exercise. Based on the Scandinavian experience and the added complexity of China's status as a transition economy, financial reforms should strike a proper balance between being gradual (to avoid costly mistakes) and substantive (to secure efficiency gains in the longer term) with due consideration being given to initial conditions concerning regulation, taxes, and exchange rate arrangements. A well-managed process of financial deregulation requires that policymakers and market participants fully understand the linkages between financial reforms and the rest of the economy. In addition, the supervisory and management systems in the financial sector should move in step with the liberalization process.","[Chen, Hongyi] Hong Kong Inst Monetary Res, Int Finance Ctr 2, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jonung, Lars] Lund Univ, Knut Wicksell Ctr Financial Studies, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Unteroberdoerster, Olaf] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Lund University; International Monetary Fund,"Chen, HY (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Inst Monetary Res, Int Finance Ctr 2, 55-F,8 Finance St Cent, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lars.jonung@ehl.lu.se,"chen, hongyi/HTS-1467-2023",,,,,,4,2,2,0,113,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Given this popularity, the question arises as to how much time people save by using search engines for their information needs compared to offline sources, as well as how online searching affects both search experiences and search outcomes. Using a random sample of queries from a major search engine and a sample of reference questions from the Internet Public Library (IPL), we conduct a real-effort experiment to compare online and offline search experiences and outcomes. We find that participants are significantly more likely to find an answer on the Web (100 %), compared to offline searching (between 87 % and 90 %). Restricting our analysis to the set of questions in which participants find answers in both treatments, a Web search takes on average 7 (9) minutes, whereas the corresponding offline search takes 22 (19) minutes for a search-engine (IPL) question. Furthermore, while raters judge library sources to be significantly more trustworthy and authoritative than the corresponding Web sources, they judge Web sources as significantly more relevant. Balancing all factors, we find that the overall source quality is not significantly different between the two treatments for the set of search-engine questions. However, for IPL questions, we find that non-Web sources are judged to have significantly higher overall quality than the corresponding Web sources. In comparison, for factual questions, Web search results are significantly more likely to be correct (66 % vs. 43 %). Lastly, post-search questionnaires reveal that participants find online searching more enjoyable than offline searching.","[Chen, Yan; Jeon, Grace YoungJoo; Kim, Yong-Mi] Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, 105 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",yanchen@umich.edu; yjeon@umich.edu; kimym@umich.edu,,"Chen, Yan/0000-0003-1287-4525; Jeon, Grace YoungJoo/0000-0002-8360-4357",,,,,48,13,16,3,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Using detailed administrative data, we exploit the cross-regional variation in initial industry structures and use trade flows of other high-income countries as instruments for regional import and export exposure. We find that the rise of the East in the world economy caused substantial job losses in German regions specialized in import-competing industries, both in manufacturing and beyond. Regions specialized in export-oriented industries, however, experienced even stronger employment gains and lower unemployment. In the aggregate, we estimate that this trade integration has caused some 442,000 additional jobs in the economy and contributed to retaining the manufacturing sector in Germany. This is almost exclusively driven by the rise of Eastern Europe, not by China.

The application concerns the Italian regions over the period 1952-2002.

The students have an intensive preparation period, and examination in mathematics relative to languages is found to decrease dropout from high school, increase enrollment in higher education, and increase enrollment in natural science and technology education programs. Overall, the causal effects seem to be somewhat stronger for males than for females, but the analysis indicates that gender differences interact in complicated ways with prior skills in mathematics. We explore several mechanisms that might contribute to the findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Trade is analyzed for four types of goods: primary goods, parts and components, capital goods, and consumer goods. For each type of good we also distinguish its definition in terms of flows, intensive margin, and extensive margin. Methodologically, we first derive country-pair fixed effects over all possible pairs of export-import partners, and in the second stage we relate fixed effects with a set of influential factors. We show (i) the intuitive and varying effects of geographical, cultural, and institutional factors; (ii) the beneficial effects of soft and hard infrastructure; and (iii) the key importance of trade between old and new EU members.

Here, we introduce these essays and comments by putting them in a broader historical perspective. In particular, we trace the common origins of modern institutional and evolutionary economics, particularly in the work of Veblen, as well as important additional influences such as Schumpeter and Simon. We highlight how the two approaches became disconnected, and signal the possibility of, and need for, re-establishing closer connections between them.

Their essays centre on the path-breaking contributions to the 'new institutional economics' (NIE) by Ronald Coase, Douglass North and Oliver Williamson. In response, while recognising their substantial achievements, it is pointed out that these three thinkers had contrasting views on key points. Furthermore, Menard's and Shirley's three 'golden triangle' NIE concepts -transaction costs, property rights and contracts are themselves disputed. Once all this is acknowledged, differences of view appear within the NIE, raising interesting questions concerning its identity and boundaries, including its differences with the original institutionalism. There are sizeable overlaps between the two traditions. It is argued here that the NIE can learn from the original institutionalism, particularly when elaborating more dynamic analyses, and developing more nuanced, psychologically-grounded and empirically viable theories of human motivation.","Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Hodgson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",g.m.hodgson@herts.ac.uk,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021",,,,,,104,27,32,0,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This study decomposes the gap in labour market attachment between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in non-remote areas, combining two separate data sources in a novel way to obtain access to richer information than was previously possible. It shows that among women over 90 per cent of the gap can be attributed to differences in the observed characteristics between the two populations. For men, the differences in observed characteristics can account for 44-52 per cent of the gap. A detailed decomposition shows that lower education, worse health, and larger families (particularly for women) explain the lower labour market attachment of Indigenous Australians to a substantial extent. Compared with previous studies, this study is able to explain a larger proportion of the gap in employment between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people and hence provides greater insights into important factors for Closing the gap' policies.","[Kalb, Guyonne; Leung, Felix] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Le, Trinh] Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Hunter, Boyd] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Aboriginal Econ Policy Res, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Melbourne; Australian National University,"Hunter, B (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Aboriginal Econ Policy Res, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",boyd.hunter@anu.edu.au,"Hunter, Boyd/JQV-7527-2023; Hunter, Boyd/AAH-2372-2020; Kalb, Guyonne/H-7383-2015","Hunter, Boyd/0000-0003-0362-4882; Le, Trinh Van Thi/0000-0002-7541-158X; Kalb, Guyonne/0000-0001-6582-8608",,,,,31,11,11,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

We find that in some countries forecasts have not been rational in the sense that they seem to have a systematic bias. We also find that for both GDP growth and inflation the forecast errors are larger for more volatile economies. For some countries GDP and inflation forecast errors have positive correlation, which is consistent with New Keynesian macro-models, whereas for other countries this is not the case.

For this purpose, the performances of various monetary policy rules are compared in terms of social welfare baied on a standard small open economy model. The main findings of this paper are as follows. First, for a small open economy vulnerable to international interest rate shocks, domestic goods price inflation targeting is the optimal policy rule within a family of simple and implementable monetary policy rules. Second, it is found that exchange rate fluctuations implied by inflation targeting rule expose the monetary authority to a trade-off between total demand stabilization and increased volatility of inflation.","Bank Korea Sogong Annex, Econ Res Inst, Macroecon Team, Seoul 100794, South Korea",Bank of Korea,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Bank Korea Sogong Annex, Econ Res Inst, Macroecon Team, 55 Namdaemunno, Seoul 100794, South Korea.",hglee@bok.or.kr,"Lee, Hangyu/HRC-8881-2023",,,,,,39,2,2,1,9,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

The challenge for India is how to put public finances on a more sustainable footing while preserving the potential for high growth and attenuating the adverse consequences on the needy. We analyze the macroeconomic implications of three fiscal consolidation scenarios. A benchmark case based on authorities' intentions that reduces government consumption, general transfers, and strengthens consumption tax collection; a growth-friendly that reallocates the savings to more public investment; and a social-friendly scenario that equally reallocates the savings between more public investment and more transfers to households excluded from the financial system. The simulations indicate that fiscal consolidation yields considerable long-term benefits and also entails output costs in the near term. Growth outcomes are better under the growth-friendly and social-friendly scenarios. These consolidation scenarios alone are not enough to maximize net gains for India. Other factors, such as the pace of consolidation, the combination with structural reforms and external economic conditions, play a critical role in the success of fiscal consolidation.

Verbal autopsies allow us to distinguish AIDS mortality from that due to other causes. The timing of the lower socioeconomic status observed for households with AIDS deaths suggests that the socioeconomic gradient in AIDS mortality is being driven primarily by poor households being at higher risk for AIDS, rather than AIDS impoverishing the households. Following a death, households that experienced an AIDS death are observed being poorer still. However, the additional socioeconomic loss following an AIDS death is very similar to the loss observed from sudden death. Funeral expenses can explain some of the impoverishing effects of death in the household. In contrast, the loss of an employed member cannot. To date, antiretroviral therapy has not changed the socioeconomic status gradient observed in AIDS deaths. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so he has put a great deal of emphasis on the distribution of income between different social groups, especially so when concerned with the labour market. This article attempts to celebrate this particular aspect of his numerous contributions to economics by highlighting the role of social norms in influencing earnings across occupations and demographic groups in the USA. Social norms generate hierarchy, economic and non-economic inequalities amongst ascriptively distinguished groups. Drawing on the stratification and identity economics literatures, this article proposes a novel theoretical and empirical framework for analysing the effects of financialisation on the earnings dynamics of gender and race groups, a framework that is consistent with discrimination as a source of racial and gender inequality. The empirical methodology used in the form of long-run cointegrating relationships of groups' earnings across occupations assesses whether a pattern of social norms on wage distribution emerges over time. The results of this study show that over the past 30 years social norms have exacerbated the stratification of the US labour market.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Arestis, Philip] Univ Basque Country, Leioa, Spain; [Charles, Aurelie] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Sannio, Benevento, Italy",University of Cambridge; University of Basque Country; University of Bath; University of Leeds; University of Sannio,"Charles, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Ctr Dev Studies, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",A.Charles@bath.ac.uk,,"Charles, Aurelie/0000-0001-5770-615X",,,,,42,14,16,4,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Do women play a role in its disappearance? A simple theoretical model suggests that at the later stage of the transition from polygyny to monogamy, the spread of human capital and the increase of labor income have led to the rise of monogamy. A general equilibrium model of the marriage market illustrates that the spread of human capital results in an increase in women's income opportunities and lowers the importance of bequests in determining their sons' incomes. Both effects improve women's outside option, mating monogamously, and decrease the marginal benefit of the economic advantages provided by polygynous unions. This, in turn, reduces polygyny by increasing the cost of polygynous mating for men. When the human capital level is sufficiently high, men find it optimal to marry monogamously instead of bearing the high cost of polygynous mating.","Gebze Inst Technol, Fac Business Adm, TR-41400 Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey",Gebze Technical University,"Citci, SH (通讯作者)，Gebze Inst Technol, Fac Business Adm, TR-41400 Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey.",hcitci@gyte.edu.tr,"citci, sadettin/AAM-8735-2021","citci, sadettin/0000-0002-7451-2979",,,,,53,0,0,2,33,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

These thresholds, along with the process for demand, are estimated using data from the ready-mix concrete industry. Simulations predict that a merger from duopoly to monopoly generates between nine and ten years of monopoly in the market.","Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Collard-Wexler, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",collardwexler@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,13,13,0,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

We continue to find dispersion in the per capita income at which slowdowns occur. But in contrast to our earlier analysis which pointed to the existence of a single mode at which slowdowns occur, in the neighborhood of $15,000-16,000 2005 purchasing power parity dollars, new data suggest the possibility of two modes, one at $10,000-11,000 and another at $15,000-16,000. A number of countries appear to have experienced two slowdowns, consistent with the existence of multiple modes. We suggest that growth in middle-income countries may slow down in a succession of stages rather than at a single point in time. This implies that a larger group of countries is at risk of a growth slowdown and that middle-income countries may find themselves slowing down at lower income levels than implied by our earlier estimates. We also find that slowdowns are less likely in countries where the population has a relatively high level of secondary and tertiary education and where high-technology products accounts for a relatively large share of exports, consistent with our earlier emphasis of the importance of moving up the technology ladder in order to avoid the middle-income trap.

To characterize this payoff set, we derive an upper bound, using mechanism design with limited commitment. We then prove that this upper bound is tight, by showing that all its extreme points are equilibrium payoffs. Our results shed light on the role of different forms of commitment in bargaining.

It is argued that the methodology can be improved to explicitly take the role of structural transformation into account, and by so doing, a potential source of bias in the results is corrected. This requires the use of a tool from the field of theoretical evolutionary biology: Price's equation. A review of a sample of studies that apply decomposition analyses shows that the methodology is best suited for studies of the evolution of labour productivity and the reallocation of labour. Based on Danish data for 1992-2010, it is then demonstrated how the results of decomposition analyses can be considerably improved by the explicit inclusion of levels in the selection process. In the specific analysis conducted by the current paper, economic selection among industries is included. It is found that the structural transformation of the economy has a large impact on the results of decomposition studies, not least on the magnitude of the inter-firm selection effect. Structural transformation from capital-intensive and thus high-labour-productivity manufacturing towards labour-intensive and thus low-labour-productivity services entails that the traditional methodology is biased downwards in its measure of economic selection. Finally, it is demonstrated that the length of the interval studied, while often determined by data limitations, has a significant but predictable effect on the results, and it is tentatively demonstrated that economic selection tends to be stronger in the trough of the business cycle.","[Holm, Jacob Rubaek] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Holm, JR (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, Fibigerstraede 11, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.",jrh@business.aau.dk,"Holm, Jacob Rubæk/H-9402-2017","Holm, Jacob Rubæk/0000-0003-1110-1918",,,,,39,7,7,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

A Monte Carlo procedure simulates the daily summer temperatures, the levels of quantity demanded and prices over the summer months. The main empirical result is that the market price paid for the most important TCC, in terms of volume, (the Hudson Valley to New York City) is higher than the mean of the simulated payouts even though the actual payout was higher than the market price. The market prices for the other two TCCs are lower than the means of the simulated payouts, and as a result, there is no consistent evidence of under-pricing in this analysis of the market for six-month TCCs in the summer of 2006.

COOPER; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; SCALE; EFFICIENCY,"Environmental assessment and protection are important concerns in modem business. Consumers are interested in environmental protection. They avoid purchasing products from dirt-imaged companies even if their prices are much less than the ones produced by green-imaged companies. The green image is very important for business survivability in our global market. A business concern associated with the green image is how to attain corporate sustainability where companies can attain both economic success and pollution prevention in their operations. There is tradeoff between economic prosperity and environmental concern. To attain a high level of corporate sustainability, companies need to measure the current performance in terms of their operational and environmental achievements. This study proposes a use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for such assessment. The proposed DEA assessment provides corporate leaders and managers with not only the measure of corporate sustainability but also information regarding how to invest for technology innovation for abatement of undesirable outputs (e.g., CO2). As an application, this study utilizes the proposed approach to measure the corporate sustainability of petroleum firms in the United States. The petroleum industry is functionally separated into integrated and independent companies. The integrated companies, referred to as Major, have their large supply chains for both upstream (e.g., exploration, development and production of crude oil or natural gas) and downstream (e.g., oil tankers, refineries, storages and retails). Meanwhile, the independent companies focus upon the upstream function, but not the downstream, in their business operations. The empirical comparison between the two groups of petroleum firms identifies that the integrated companies outperform the independent companies because a large supply chain incorporated into the former group provides them with both a scale merit in their operations and an opportunity to obtain consumer's opinions on their business operations. Thus, the large supply chain system, covering business functions for upstream and downstream, enhances corporate sustainability in the U.S. petroleum industry. It is easily envisioned that the empirical findings discussed in this study are useful in preparing business strategy and industrial policy for the petroleum industry of not only the United States but also other nations involved in oil and gas production.

Few attempts have been made, however, to assess the efficiency of hydropower generation in Canada. This paper analyzes the overall efficiency of hydropower generation in Canada from comprehensive viewpoints of electricity generating capability, its profitability, as well as environmental benefits and soda! responsibility using the TOPSIS (the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. The factors that influence the efficiency of the hydropower generation are also presented to help to the sustainable hydropower production in Canada. The most important results of this study concern (1) the pivotal roles of energy saving and of the social responsibility in the overall efficiency of hydropower corporates and (2) the lower hydropower generation efficiency of some of the most important economic regions in Canada. Other results reveal that the overall efficiency of hydropower generation in Canada experienced an improvement in 2012, following a downtrend from 2005 to 2011. Amidst these influencing factors, energy saving and social responsibility are key factors in the overall efficiency scores while management (defined herein by the number of employees and hydropower stations of a corporation) has only a slightly negative impact on the overall efficiency score.

We for the first time test this assumption using methods for univariate time series. Based on longitudinal register data from 1968 to 2005, we first estimate an autoregressive model for each individual using a method for approximately median-unbiased estimation. We then exploit the resulting distribution of the individual-specific estimates to draw inference about the presence of a unit root. Results indicate that earnings for the representative worker are governed by a process where shocks to earnings have moderate persistence and are both economically and statistically significantly different from having permanent effects. These results question the heavy use of unit-root processes for earnings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By allowing for partially privatization of a state-controlled firm, we explore competition under different timings of firms' moves and derive the conditions under which an optimal subsidy allows to achieve maximum efficiency. We show that, irrespective of the mode of competition, while the ownership of the controlled firm is irrelevant when firms play simultaneously, it matters when firms compete sequentially, requiring the leader to be publicly-owned for an optimal subsidy to restore the first-best. The paper also focuses on the extent to which a subsidy is needed to attain the social optimum in the considered scenarios, providing an ordering which highlights the subsidy equivalence between Cournot (Bertrand) private leadership and simultaneous Bertrand (Cournot) under duopoly, and the dominance of the former in oligopoly.

We pay particular attention to North America's trade links with East Asia, which have intensified in the last two decades. Investigation of changes in total trade value and the growth of trade on the extensive margin both demonstrates the expanding fragmentation of production in North America as well as the strengthening of connections with Mexico. Our quantitative analysis, which is based on gravity estimation of trade volume and extensive margin trade responses, also provides evidence that U.S. imports of machinery from East Asia are especially strong, and further, that Mexico's role has changed, as it now provides a bridge for trade between East Asia and the United States.

We find that the Nash equilibrium involves a large country charging a higher tax than a small nation. Lower trade costs lead to an intensification of competition, a drop in Nash tax rates and a narrowing of the gap. Since large, productive firms are naturally more sensitive to tax differences in our model, large firms are the crux of tax competition in our model. This also means that tax competition has consequences for the average productivity of big and small nations' industries; by lowering tax rates, a small nation can attract high-productivity firms.","[Baldwin, Richard E.] Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Okubo, Toshihiro] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Okubo, T (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",richard.baldwin@graduateinstitute.ch; okubo@econ.keio.ac.jp,,"baldwin, richard/0000-0002-1965-4157",,,,,24,13,14,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

We ask whether decentralised collective wage bargaining may result in a second-best allocation. Collective bargaining restores efficiency when the bargained wage is independent of employment; conditions that we characterise. Firms then behave as if collective bargaining was over both wages and employment, thus linking the large-firm search and bargaining environment to the efficient bargaining model (McDonald and Solow, 1981). Under more realistic conditions, workers can bargain for a share of output, so that the wage is then a function of employment.

To do so, we exploit regional banking variations in Russia induced by the idiosyncratic creation of specialized banks in the last years of the Soviet Union (1988-91) that were subsequently privatized. Starting in 1999 private banks including surviving spetsbanks emerged as an important source of external finance for private firms and households. We document that the regional concentration of spetsbanks in the early years of the Russian federation is orthogonal to economic fundamentals that are related to growth after the emergence of bank finance. Results indicate that while privatized banking increased lending significantly, it did not increase economic growth. However, privatization did increase growth when banks retained fewer political connections and when regional property rights were better protected, highlighting the importance of both factors.

Fixed-effects regressions are estimated for three country groups (industrial, developing and emerging markets) on annual data for 87 countries from 1994 to 2010. The trade balance improves significantly after a real depreciation, and to a similar degree, in the long run for all countries, but the adjustment is significantly slower for industrial countries. Emerging markets and developing countries display relatively fast adjustment. Disaggregation into exports and imports shows that the delayed adjustment in industrial countries is almost entirely on the export side. The rate of adjustment in emerging markets is slowing over time, consistent with their eventual graduation to high-income status. The ratio of trade to GDP is also highly sensitive to the real effective exchange rate, with a real depreciation of 10 % raising the trade/GDP ratio across the sample by approximately 4 %. This result, which presumably reflects movements in the prices of tradables relative to non-tradables, raises questions about the widespread use of the trade/GDP ratio as a trade policy indicator, without adjustment for real exchange rate effects.","[Bleaney, Michael; Tian, Mo] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Bleaney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",michael.bleaney@nottingham.ac.uk,"Tian, Mo/X-9280-2019","Tian, Mo/0000-0001-9084-0203",,,,,25,7,8,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

His work, and in particular the Theory of Economic Development, is often interpreted as praising individual entrepreneurs setting up new firms to contribute to an industry's innovativeness. This has come to be referred to as the Schumpeter Mark I perspective. Later, however, in his Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Schumpeter has rather suggested that large incumbents are best positioned to contribute to an industry's innovativeness (Schumpeter Mark II). In this discussion, however, the possibly different effects of structural as opposed to dynamic industry competitiveness is often not taken into account. In addition, the contribution of new and small firms to industry innovativeness are often conflated. Using New Product Announcements as a measure of innovation, we find that industries dominated by small firms prove consistently and significantly more innovative than industries where large firms dominate. Taking account of industries' structural and dynamic levels of competition, we find that high existing and increasing levels of new firms entering an industry, exercising what Schumpeter called the 'entrepreneurial function', actually decrease industry innovativeness. We conclude that the contribution of small firms in terms of industry innovativeness is different from that of large as well as new firms, suggesting a Schumpeter Mark III perspective.","[Dolfsma, Wilfred] Univ Groningen, Sch Econ & Business Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [van der Velde, Gerben] Windesheim Univ Appl Sci, Zwolle, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Dolfsma, W (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Sch Econ & Business Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.",w.a.dolfsma@rug.nl; g.vander.velde@windesheim.nl,,,,,,,69,25,32,0,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We define the fair share of a player P to be the average utility that a player could receive if all players had the same utility function as P. We present a randomized allocation mechanism in which every player has a dominant strategy for maximizing his expected utility. Every player that follows his dominant strategy is guaranteed to receive an expected utility of at least n/(2n - 1) of his fair share. This is best possible in the sense that there is a collection of utility functions with respect to which no allocation mechanism can guarantee a larger fraction of the fair share.

Social plugins are an example in the online context: they embed information from a friend, acquaintance or even a stranger on a web page and the information is usually independent of the content of the web page. We formulate a novel framework to investigate how the speed of learning by chit-chat depends on the structure of the environment. A network represents the environment that individuals navigate to interact with each other. We derive an exact formula to compute how the expected time between meetings depends on the underlying network structure and we use this quantity to investigate the speed of learning in the society. Comparative statics show that the speed of learning is sensitive to a mean-preserving spread of the degree distribution (MPS). Specifically, if the number of individuals is low (high), then a MPS of the network increases (decreases) the speed of learning.

We show that, with endogenous matching, the presence of moral hazard can reverse the matching pattern relative to the first best, and that even if sharecropping is optimal for an exogenously given pair of agent types, it may not be observed in equilibrium with endogenous matching. The economy with endogenous matching features less sharecropping compared to an economy with agent types drawn at random from the same distribution. This suggests that studies of agency costs in sharecropping may underestimate their extent if focusing only on the intensive margin and ignoring the extensive margin. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this loose commitment environment, we find that even a little uncertainty over whether the government can commit yields substantial effects on the optimal dynamic nonlinear income tax system. This result holds even though separating taxation remains optimal, as in the case of full commitment. Under an empirically plausible parameterization, our numerical simulations show that high-skilled individuals must be subsidized in the short run, despite the government's redistributive objective, unless the probability of commitment is higher than 98%. Loose commitment also reverses the short-run welfare effects of changes in most of the model's parameters, and yields some counterintuitive outcomes. For example, all individuals are worse off, rather than better off, in the short run when the proportion of high-skilled individuals in the economy increases.","[Guo, Jang-Ting] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Krause, Alan] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of York - UK,"Guo, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",guojt@ucr.edu,"Guo, Jang-Ting/AAY-8365-2021","Guo, Jang-Ting/0000-0001-9948-9691",,,,,25,10,10,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We build on the concept of common's pool resources to analyze the logic for and consequences of different institutional settings governing the use of gas pipelines. We show that rules based on regulation imply ex ante decisions that preclude players to choose the preferred output. This limitation may be removed by rules designed by market players. We also show that the mechanism to define the rules is based on the definition of network use property rights.

We show that only a uniform mechanism satisfies all three. We also show that all efficient and strategy proof mechanisms must function by assigning budget sets to the agencies and letting them freely choose their optimal bundle. In choosing these budget sets, the agencies' private information has to be taken into account in a particular way. The only way to additionally satisfy a weak fairness requirement (regions with identical preferences should be treated equally) is to assign all agencies the same budget set, as does the uniform mechanism. Finally and maybe more importantly, we show that the central government should not impose constraints on how much to fund an activity (e.g. by reserving some funds only for a particular activity): otherwise, there are no efficient, strategy proof and fair mechanisms, no matter how small these constraints are.","[Kibris, Ozgur] Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey; [Tapki, Ipek Gursel] Kadir Has Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-34083 Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University; Kadir Has University,"Kibris, Ö (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",ozgur@sabanciuniv.edu; ipek.tapki@khas.edu.tr,"KIBRIS, OZGUR/AAG-7639-2021; Gursel Tapki, Ipek/AAE-4298-2022","KIBRIS, OZGUR/0000-0002-7374-441X; Gursel Tapki, Ipek/0000-0001-8314-1113",,,,,55,3,4,0,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Studying middle-school students and using regression discontinuity methods, I estimate the causal effect of requiring two math classes-one remedial, one regular-instead of just one class. Math achievement grows much faster under the requirement, 0.16-0.18 student standard deviations. Yet, one year after returning to a regular one-class schedule, the initial gains decay by as much as half, and two years later just one-third of the initial treatment effect remains. This pattern of decaying effects over time mirrors other educational interventions-assignment to a more skilled teacher, reducing class size, retaining students-but spending more time on math carries different costs. One cost is notable, more time in math crowds out instruction in other subjects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; NIPPON TELEGRAPH,"Environmental assessment has recently become an important business concern because consumers are interested in environmental protection. They try to avoid purchasing products from dirt-imaged companies, which do not pay attention to environmental protection, even if their prices are much less than the ones produced by greenimaged companies. Thus, a green image is very important for corporate survivability in a global market. This study considers corporate sustainability, indicating that companies need to consider both economic prosperity and pollution prevention in their operations. To discuss the issue from corporate strategy for modern business, this study discusses a use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment by focusing upon Research and Development (R&D) strategy as well as technology innovation and selection for reduction of undesirable outputs (e.g., CO2 emission). This type of research has never been explored in previous studies. It is easily envisioned that the proposed DEA environmental assessment will guide corporate leaders in identifying how to invest for technology innovation to reduce an amount of undesirable outputs. To discuss the practicality, this study applies the proposed approach to 153 observations on S&P 500 corporations in 2012 and 2013. The empirical investigation confirms that investors pay more serious attention to company's green image and the reality for a long run sustainability than profitability in a short run concern. Furthermore, the energy sector is the best investment target among seven industrial sectors examined in this study. The measurement of corporate sustainability can serve as an empirical basis in selecting what type of technology is fitted for a specific industry. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from the New Zealand electricity market,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agent-based modelling; Electricity markets; Power trading,POWER; COLLABORATION,"Modelling price formation in electricity markets is a notoriously difficult process, due to physical constraints on electricity generation and transmission, and the potential for market power. This difficulty has inspired the recent development of bottom-up agent-based algorithmic learning models of electricity markets. While these have proven quite successful in small models, few authors have attempted any validation of their model against real-world data in a more realistic model. In this paper we develop the SWEM model, where we take one of the most promising algorithms from the literature, a modified version of the Roth and Erev algorithm, and apply it to a 19-node simplification of the New Zealand electricity market. Once key variables such as water storage are accounted for, we show that our model can closely mimic short-run (weekly) electricity prices at these 19 nodes, given fundamental inputs such as fuel costs, network data, and demand. We show that agents inSWEM are able to manipulate market power when a line outage makes them an effective monopolist in the market. SWEM has already been applied to a wide variety of policy applications in the New Zealand market(2). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The paper covers three major dimensions of green growth (i.e. carbon emissions, environmental protection and material resources use) and some related important topics, as well as the fresh policy implications of the new research agenda, Typical marginal analysis in a given structure of the division of labor suggests that green action is a burden to economic development. Therefore, climate negotiation has become a burden-sharing game and has reached a stalemate. New thinking is badly needed to rescue these negotiations and to drive a shift to a new green growth paradigm. The proposed new research agenda represents an effort to create a new narrative on climate change and green growth. Because the new research agenda can theoretically predict the possibility that a more competitive structure of the division of labor could be triggered by green policy, it has promising policy implications for various important challenges facing us in the 21st century.","State Council China, Res Dev Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, YS (通讯作者)，State Council China, Res Dev Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zys@drc.gov.cn,,,,,,,52,7,7,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2014,22.0,5,,,SI,,93,116,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12086.x,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AP6TT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342211400007,0

The sequential choice algorithm and the parallel choice algorithm used in the context of China's college admissions system are formulated as the well-studied Boston mechanism and the Simple Serial Dictatorship mechanism. We review both theoretical and experimental mechanism design literature in similar assignment problems. Studies show that the Boston mechanism does not eliminate justified envy, is not strategy-proof and is not Pareto-efficient. The Simple Serial Dictatorship mechanism eliminates justified envy, is strategy-proof and is Pareto-efficient, thus outperforming the Boston mechanism in all three criteria. This result provides justification for the transition in recent years from the sequential choice algorithm to the parallel choice algorithm in China's college admissions practices.

As Europe's sovereign debt crisis has shown, governments confronted with high deficits and rising debt may be forced to enact fiscal adjustments in order to avoid increasing market pressure and solvency problems. Over the last four decades, such measures taken by governments in OECD countries have varied in duration, size, composition and in their success to re-establish fiscal sustainability. We find that large and expenditure-based adjustments lead to substantially lower long-term interest rates. Small and revenue-based measures do not have an effect on interest rates. Financial markets thus only seem to value strict and decisive measures - a clear sign that the government's pledge to cut the deficit is credible.","[Schaltegger, Christoph A.] Univ St Gallen, Univ Lucerne, CREMA, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland; [Weder, Martin] Univ Lucerne, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland",University of St Gallen; University of Lucerne; University of Lucerne,"Schaltegger, CA (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Univ Lucerne, CREMA, Frohburgstr 3, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland.",christoph.schaltegger@unilu.ch,,,,,,,54,2,2,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using a comparative static model, Aguiar and Walmsley (2013), find that amnesties have a positive impact on the U.S. economy. However, such policies are one-time changes in the labor force, whose benefits diminish over time, and which are unlikely to stop the flow of undocumented workers or fulfill the demands of U.S. firms for cheap foreign labor. In this paper, we use a global dynamic model to investigate the long run implications of three policy scenarios; 1) a one-time amnesty for undocumented workers living in the U.S.; 2) a permanent increase in the number of foreign worker visas; and 3) enhanced border security. We find that an amnesty is much less effective than a permanent increase in the number of visas at promoting economic growth in the U.S., while enhanced border control by the U.S. has a small negative effect due to the relative size of the undocumented labor market in the U.S. Combined, the three policies offer a mechanism for supporting U.S. short- and long-term economic growth, while also benefiting suppliers of migrant workers, such as Mexico.

The empirical part analyzes the distribution of life satisfaction over the life course at the aggregated, subgroup and individual level. To the findings: On average, life satisfaction is mildly decreasing up to age 55 followed by a hump shape with a maximum at 70. The analysis at the lower levels suggests that people differ in their life satisfaction trends, whereas the hump shape after age 55 is robust. No important differences between men and women are found. In contrast, education groups differ in their trends: highly educated people become happier over the life cycle, where life satisfaction decreases for less-educated people.","Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Baetschmann, G (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurichbergstr 14, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",gregori.baetschmann@econ.uzh.ch,,,,,,,25,23,23,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

We find sensible patterns with regard to standard economic and demographic factors: the probability of choosing the DC plan decreases with the relative financial generosity of the DB plans versus the DC plan and rises with education and income. Using a survey of participants, we find that the ability to control for beliefs, preferences, and other variables not easily obtainable from administrative or standard household surveys increases the explanatory power over seven-fold. Among the important factors in the DB/DC pension choice are respondent attitudes about risk/return tradeoffs, financial literacy, return expectations, and political risk. We also find that individuals make sensible choices based on what they believe to be true about the plans, but that these beliefs about plan parameters are often wrong, thus leading to possibly sub-optimal decisions. Finally, we provide evidence that individuals' preferences over plan attributes (e.g., the degree of control provided) are even more important determinants of the DB/DC decision than expected outcomes (e.g., the relative generosity of the plans).

We suggest that part of the knowledge generated by academic economists is case-based rather than rule-based. That is, instead of offering general rules or theories that should be contrasted with data, economists often analyse models that are 'theoretical cases', which help understand economic problems by drawing analogies between the model and the problem. Thus, economic models, empirical data, experimental results and other sources of knowledge are all on equal footing, that is, they all provide cases to which a given problem can be compared.

Using this model, we show how people with a great deal of experience may persistently be off the production frontier because they fail to notice important features of the data they possess. We also develop predictions on when these learning failures are likely to occur, as well as on the types of interventions that can help people learn. We test the model's predictions in a field experiment with seaweed farmers. The survey data reveal that these farmers do not attend to pod size, a particular input dimension. Experimental trials suggest that farmers are particularly far from optimizing this dimension. Furthermore, consistent with the model, we find that simply having access to the experimental data does not induce learning. Instead, behavioral changes occur only after the farmers are presented with summaries that highlight previously unattended-to relationships in the data.","[Hanna, Rema] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Dartmouth College,"Hanna, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Mullainathan, Sendhil/0000-0001-8508-4052",,,,,41,118,147,1,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Three methods (analytic hierarchy process [AHP], multi-attribute utility theory and elimination and choice expressing reality) were selected for detailed analyses of their application for medical equipment management. Twenty-one work using MCDA, artificial neural networks, human factors engineering, and value analysis were analysed in the framework of medical equipment management. The important aspects of the procedure were described, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. It was determined that the AHP approach corresponds to all defined criteria for selecting large medical equipment. Managing large medical equipment using MCDA will reduce uncertainties, and provide a rational selection and purchase of the most efficient equipment in resource-limited settings. The direction for improving the AHP method was determined.","[Ivlev, Ilya; Kneppo, Peter] Czech Tech Univ, Dept Biomed Technol, Kladno 27201, Czech Republic; [Bartak, Miroslav] Univ JE Purkyne, Dept Social Work, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Barták, M (通讯作者)，Univ JE Purkyne, Dept Social Work, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",miroslav.bartak@ujep.cz,"Barták, Miroslav/N-9249-2017; Ivlev, Ilya/G-1890-2015","Ivlev, Ilya/0000-0002-8015-3626; Kneppo, Peter/0000-0002-4786-1698",,,,,33,41,42,4,79,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The average annual compound employment growth has been about 1% in village enterprises and 3% in small-town enterprises. Access to formal finance, the cost of finance and cumbersome loan procedures pose major challenges for rural entrepreneurs in Pakistan, particularly in terms of availing of long-term financing for investment purposes. Access to and quality of electricity supply, marketing difficulties and transportation-related problems also pose major obstacles. These obstacles have a negative impact on enterprise productivity and the level of investments made by existing firms and discourage the start-up of new enterprises.

It dropped to a new low of 1.74 children for women born in 1949, before stabilizing for subsequent cohorts. We propose a novel explanation for this boom-bust pattern, linking it to the huge improvements in maternal health that started in the mid-1930s. Our hypothesis is that the improvements in maternal health contributed to the mid-twentieth century baby boom and generated a rise in women's human capital, ultimately leading to a decline in desired fertility for subsequent cohorts. To examine this link empirically, we exploit the large cross-state variation in the magnitude of the decline in pregnancy-related mortality and the differential exposure by cohort. We find that the decline in maternal mortality is associated with a rise in fertility for women born between 1921 and 1940, with a rise in college and high school graduation rates for women born in 1933-1950 relative to previous cohorts, and with a decline in fertility for women born in 1941-1950 relative to those born in 1921-1940. The analysis provides new insights on the determinants of fertility in the United States and other countries that experienced similar improvements in maternal health.","[Albanesi, Stefania] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Albanesi, Stefania] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Olivetti, Claudia] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Olivetti, Claudia] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Boston University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Albanesi, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA.",stefania.albanesi@gmail.com; olivetti@bu.edu,,,,,,,58,35,39,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

We examine the consequences of an organizational reform in Israel that transferred the responsibility for housing arrestees from the police to the prison authority. Using the staggered rollout of the reform in different regions of the country, we document strong evidence that this organizational change led to an increase of 11% in the number of arrests and to a decrease of 4% in the number of reported crimes, with these effects concentrated in more minor crimes. The reform also led to a decrease in the quality of arrests, measured by the likelihood of being charged following an arrest. These findings are consistent with the idea that the reform externalized the cost of housing arrestees from the police's perspective, and therefore led the police to increase its activity against crime.

As the number of poor increases, the market for products aimed toward the poor grows, and such products become more profitable. As a result, there are circumstances where an increase in income inequality associates with higher purchasing power of the poor. Using cross-country data on the price of one kilogram of rice and the price of a Big Mac hamburger, we confirm a negative association between income inequality and the price of inferior goods, robust to the inclusion of a large set of control variables. Results are also robust to a first difference specification and to a two-stage instrumental variables approach. Examining economic well-being, it is thus important to analyze not only the incomes of households, but also the prices of the products and services that they buy.","[Bergh, Andreas; Nilsson, Therese] Lund Univ, Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Bergh, Andreas; Nilsson, Therese] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Lund University; Lund University,"Nilsson, T (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",andreas.bergh@nek.lu.se; therese.nilsson@nek.lu.se,"Bergh, Andreas/AAM-2478-2020; Bergh, Andreas/E-9962-2018","Bergh, Andreas/0000-0003-2621-6769; Nilsson, Therese/0000-0002-9745-3449",,,,,34,9,9,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The novelty of this research involves comparing the impact of alcohol restrictions across crimes classified by the degree to which an offense is often committed under the influence of alcohol.

The convergence paths of QRE and level-k are different, but they converge to the same limit point. We analyze whether subjects adapt beliefs when gaining experience, and if so whether they take the QRE or the level-k learning path. We estimate transitions between level-k and QRE belief rules using Markov-switching rule learning models. The analysis reveals that subjects take the level-k learning path and that they advance gradually, switching from level 1 to 2, from level 2 to equilibrium, and reverting to level 1 after observing opponents deviating from equilibrium. The steady state therefore contains a mixture of behavioral rules: levels 0, 1, 2, and equilibrium with weights of 2.9%, 16.6%, 37.9%, and 42.6%, respectively. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We carry out a systematic review of the existing empirical literature, and include both, ex post econometric evidence and ex ante Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) simulation studies. The synthesis of results suggests that the effects of tariff reductions on employment are country and trade policy specific. When looking across higher quality econometric studies that control for the endogeneity of tariffs, only a couple of studies have statistically significant results, and these suggest that employment is likely to decrease slightly in the short run following trade liberalization. This is consistent with the notion that there are winners and losers from trade policy reform. These results are in contrast with the CGE findings, which by design incorporate projections of the medium-run economy-wide knock-on effects suggested by economic theory. The synthesis of CGE studies suggests non-negative effects of trade liberalization on aggregate employment and moderate inter-sectoral labour reallocation effects.","[Cirera, Xavier; Willenbockel, Dirk; Lakshman, Rajith W.

More importantly, evidence on the out-of-sample predictability reinforces the value of the specifications, as the forecast quality is improved over the benchmark EGARCH model under eight conventional criteria. In particular, we show that the benefit of including intraday range as a realized measure is more substantial than realized variance.

At the same time, long-run economic growth is highly uncertain. This paper is the first to evaluate optimal mitigation policy under long-term growth uncertainty in a stochastic integrated assessment model of climate change. The sign and magnitude of the impact depend on preference characteristics and on how damages scale with production. We explain the different mechanisms driving optimal mitigation under certain growth, under uncertain technological progress in the discounted expected utility model, and under uncertain technological progress in a more comprehensive asset pricing model based on Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences. In the latter framework, the dominating uncertainty impact has the opposite sign of a deterministic growth impact; the sign switch results from an endogenous pessimism weighting. All of our numeric scenarios use a DICE based assessment model and find a higher optimal carbon tax than the deterministic DICE base case calibration. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

To study these conditions, and in particular the role played by social ties, we use a Swedish population-wide linked employer-employee data set of graduates from all levels of schooling that includes detailed information on family ties, neighbourhoods, schools, class composition, and parents' and children's employers over a period covering years with both high and low unemployment, together with measures of firm performance. We find that strong social ties (parents) are an important determinant for where young workers find their first job. The effects are larger if the graduate's position is weak (low education, bad grades), during high unemployment years, and when information on potential openings are likely to be scarce. On the hiring side, by contrast, the effects are larger if the parent's position is strong (long tenure, high wage) and if the parent's plant is more productive. The youths appear to benefit from the use of strong social ties through faster access to jobs and by better labour market outcomes as measured a few years after entry. In particular, workers finding their entry jobs through strong social ties are considerably more likely to remain in this job, while experiencing better wage growth than other entrants in the same plant. Firms also appear to benefit from these wage costs (relative to comparable entrants) starting at a lower base. They also benefit on the parents' side; parents' wage growth drops dramatically exactly at the entry of one of their children in the plant, although this is a moment when firm profits tend to be growing. Indeed, the firm-side benefits appear large enough for (at least small) firms to increase job creation at the entry level in years when a child of one of their employees graduates.","[Skans, Oskar Nordstrom] Uppsala Univ, Inst Labour Market Policy Evaluat IFAU, Uppsala Ctr Labor Studies, Uppsala, Sweden; [Skans, Oskar Nordstrom] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Uppsala University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,,,,,,,,,46,130,155,4,74,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

At the same time, each of them adapted a framework to legitimise his own reading of his predecessors: a laissez-faire reading for Stewart and a class-harmonious reading for McCulloch. The similarities and differences in this and other collateral respects between the two highlight several formative aspects of the so-called orthodoxy in political economy, or, in other words, the embodiment of a supposed tradition that has been thought of as continually and lineally handed down from Smith through Ricardo to Marshall and beyond.","[Kubo, Shin] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University,"Kubo, S (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan.",kuboshin@kwansei.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530219] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,58,4,4,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The majority of empirical studies from EE economies found evidence of public sector pay penalties during the period of economic transition from a communist to market-based economy. In developed economies, however, the average differential is usually around zero or positive. The public sector pay inequality reducing effect relative to the private sector is greater in transitioning economies than in developed economies. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the sign of the public sector pay gap as well as the relative public sector pay distribution change with the progress of economic transition towards those usually observed in developed economies. Different pay-setting arrangements between private and public sectors and competition for workers seem to be major arguments for the existence of systematic pay differences between the two sectors.","[Lausev, Jelena] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Lausev, Jelena] Univ Belgrade, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Nottingham; University of Belgrade,"Lausev, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,,,,,,,119,30,33,4,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Hence, accurate cost estimates for credit support programmes are a prerequisite for efficient resource allocation, transparency, effective management and public oversight. I find that OECD governments generally take their cost of capital to be their own borrowing rate, rather than using a weighted-average cost of capital that includes the cost of risk borne by taxpayers and the general public in their role as equity holders. That practice, which is institutionalised in government accounting and budgetary rules, results in cost estimates for credit support that are significantly downwardly biased relative to a fair-value metric that recognises the full cost of risk. The size and possible real consequences of those distortions are illustrated with analyses of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Stability Mechanism and the Tennessee Valley Authority.","MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Lucas, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,27,16,16,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

We construct two such rules. When all connecting costs are 0 or 1, one is derived from the random spanning tree weighted by the volume of traffic on each edge; the other is the weighted Shapley value of the Stand Alone cooperative game.

However, whilst learning dynamics in normal form games with finite action sets are now well studied, it is not until recently that their continuous action space counterparts have been examined. We extend stochastic fictitious play to the continuous action space framework. In normal form games with finite action sets the limiting behaviour of a discrete time learning process is often studied using its continuous time counterpart via stochastic approximation. In this paper we study stochastic fictitious play in games with continuous action spaces using the same method. This requires the asymptotic pseudo-trajectory approach to stochastic approximation to be extended to Banach spaces. In particular the limiting behaviour of stochastic fictitious play is studied using the associated smooth best response dynamics on the space of finite signed measures. Using this approach, stochastic fictitious play is shown to converge to an equilibrium point in two-player zero-sum games and a stochastic fictitious play-like process is shown to converge to an equilibrium in negative definite single population games.

To implement our test, we propose a Markov switching model with absorbing states and examine whether the absorption probabilities are close to the boundary of the parameter space. We exploit recent advances by Andrews (2001) and conduct inference in the proposed model.","Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Huang, YL (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",ylihuang@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,8,4,4,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Although the findings show that the informational content of futures prices varies between different commodities, a similar pattern arises in all of them: the predictive power of futures prices can be observed only if previous volatility or the basis has been low, while no relationship arises if both have previously been high.

The current approach of most researchers and policy makers is to use regional indicators converted, for the case of EU regions, in Purchasing Power Standard (PPS). Although the PPS indicators work well for countries they probably fail for regions. The main reason is that regional purchasing power standards do not reflect actual regional price levels - there is only a national parity (price level) which is equally applied to all the regions within a country. This downgrades the reliability of regional PPS indicators and raises serious analytical and political issues. The key problem is that most regional socio-economic indicators can significantly change when regional price levels are taken into account. The aim of this article is to present results of research focused on regional price levels estimation in the Czech Republic. The results clearly show that there are substantial differences between newly computed real regional indicators and currently used PPS indicators. The impact of these findings on regional convergence, households' real income and the effectiveness of cohesion policy are considered. This topic is broadly discussed worldwide, although in the Czech Republic just first attempts can be seen. Nevertheless, its importance will probably increase, especially in relation to the system of European financial aid distributed according to regional gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in PPS.","[Cadil, Jan; Mazouch, Petr; Musil, Petr; Kramulova, Jana] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Cadil, Jan] BIRC, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Mazouch, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",mazouchp@vse.cz,"Mazouch, Petr/AAO-1650-2021; Musil, Petr/HSB-9652-2023; Mazouch, Petr/N-1832-2016","Musil, Petr/0000-0002-8457-4559; Mazouch, Petr/0000-0001-7109-8808; Cadil, Jan/0000-0001-7043-796X",,,,,43,29,31,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUN,2014,26.0,2,,,,,241,256,,10.1080/14631377.2014.904109,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AH8GK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336374800005,0

It is difficult to prescribe what the optimal pace should be, but evidence accumulating from multiple datasets and methodologies suggests that the rate of business startups and the pace of employment dynamism in the US economy has fallen over recent decades and that this downward trend accelerated after 2000. A critical factor in accounting for the decline in business dynamics is a lower rate of business startups and the related decreasing role of dynamic young businesses in the economy. For example, the share of US employment accounted for by young firms has declined by almost 30 percent over the last 30 years. These trends suggest that incentives for entrepreneurs to start new firms in the United States have diminished over time.

We focus on retention activity in the form of a discount offered to a consumer expressing an intention to switch. When retention strategies are allowed, forward looking firms anticipate the effect of first period market share on second period profits and price more aggressively in the first-period. Thus, first period equilibrium price under BBPD with retention strategies is below its non-discrimination counterpart. This contrasts with first period price above the non-discrimination level if BBPD is used and retention activity is forbidden. Regarding second period prices, the use of retention offers increase the price offered to those consumers who do not signal am intention to switch; the reverse happens to those consumers who decide to switch after being exposed to retention offers. As in other models where consumers have stable exogenous brand preferences, the instrument of BBPD is bad for profits and welfare but good for consumers. BBPD with the additional tool of retention activity boosts consumer surplus and overall welfare but decreases industry profit. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study proposes an evaluation approach for bank loan default classification models based on multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. A large real-life Chinese bank loan dataset is used to validate the proposed approach. Specifically, a set of performance metrics is utilized to measure a selection of statistical and machine-learning default models. The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), a MCDM method, takes the performances of default classification models on multiple performance metrics as inputs to generate a ranking of default risk models. In addition, feature selection and sampling techniques are applied to the data pre-processing step to handle high dimensionality and class unbalancedness of bank loan default data.

We find that risk aversion is strongly correlated to local network clustering, that is, the probability that one has a social tie to friends of friends. We then propose a network formation model that generates this empirical finding, suggesting that locally superior information on benefits makes it more attractive for risk averse individuals to link to friends of friends. Finally, we discuss implications of this model. The model generates a positive correlation between local network clustering and benefits, even if benefits are distributed independently ex ante. This provides an alternative explanation of this relationship to the one given by the social capital literature. We also establish a linkage between the uncertainty of the environment and the network structure: risky environments generate more clustered and more unequal networks in terms of connectivity.","[van der Leij, Marco J.] Univ Amsterdam, CeNDEF, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Leij, Marco J.] Tinbergen Inst, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Leij, Marco J.] Nederlandsche Bank, Res Dept, NL-1017 ZN Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kovarik, Jaromir] Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ & Bridge 1, Bilbao 48015, Spain; [Kovarik, Jaromir] CERGE EI, Prague 11121, Czech Republic",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; University of Basque Country; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"van der Leij, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, CeNDEF, Valckeniersstr 65-67, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.j.vanderleij@uva.nl,"Kovarik, Jaromir/AAE-6921-2021; Kovarik, Jaromir/H-2938-2014","KOVARIK, JAROMIR/0000-0002-0436-929X; van der Leij, Marco/0000-0003-3591-9343","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO FinComplexity); Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competividad [ECO 2012-31626, ECO 2012-35820]; Government of the Basque Country [IT783-13]; GACR [14-22044S]",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO FinComplexity)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competividad(Spanish Government); Government of the Basque Country; GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"We thank Michele Belot, Pablo Branas, Arthur Campbell, Pascal Courty, Maria Paz Espinosa, Marcel Fafchamps, James Fowler, Edoardo Gallo, Jayant Ganguli, Sanjeev Goyal, Daan in 't Veld, Matthew Jackson, Friederike Mengel, Paolo Pin, Andrea Prat, Giorgio Topa, Fernando Vega-Redondo, Adrien Vigier, Andrew Zeitlin and audiences at the European University Institute, University of Amsterdam, University of Cambridge, University of Malaga, University of the Basque Country, University of Oxford, University of Warwick, SAE 2009 in Zaragoza, ICFSN 2009 in Paris and EAA-ESEM 2009 in Barcelona.

However all previous studies in this topic are based exclusively on headline measures of inflation. In this paper we investigate what happens if we instead use core inflation to both identify disinflation episodes and measure the sacrifice ratio. Several important differences emerge: for example, headline inflation produces more disinflation episodes than core inflation does - something which is particularly conspicuous during the Great Recession - and episodes that are generally shorter in length. We also find that the argument in favor of the cold-turkey approach to reducing inflation disappears when combining the use of core inflation with sacrifice ratio measures that allow for varying persistent effects on output of disinflation.

The approach uses only four variables: the consequences of a successful attack, the likelihood of a successful attack, the degree to which the security measure reduces risk, and the cost of the security measure. After measuring the cost of a counterterrorism measure, we explore a range of outcomes for the costs of terrorist attacks and a range of possible estimates for how much risk might be reduced by the measure. Then working from this mix of information and assumptions, we can calculate how many terrorist attacks (and of what size) would need to be averted to justify the cost of the counterterrorism measure in narrow cost-benefit terms. To illustrate this approach, we first apply it to the overall increases in domestic counterterrorism expenditures that have taken place since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and alternatively we apply it to just the FBI's counterterrorism efforts. We then evaluate evidence on the number and size of terrorist attacks that have actually been averted or might have been averted since 9/11.","[Mueller, John] Ohio State Univ, Mershon Ctr Int Secur Studies, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Mueller, John] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Mueller, John] Cato Inst, Washington, DC 20003 USA; [Stewart, Mark G.] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Newcastle,"Mueller, J (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Mershon Ctr Int Secur Studies, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",bbbb@osu.edu; mark.stewart@newcastle.edu.au,"Stewart, Mark G/G-7415-2013","Stewart, Mark/0000-0001-6887-6533",,,,,26,26,32,0,10,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The framework is based on the model of Melitz (2005) in which externalities associated with dynamic learning-by-doing provide a rationale for infant industry protection. Unlike the original model, this paper assumes that there is a time limit for protection: after a fixed number of years, tariffs are required to be constant over time at a low level. This setup reflects the nature of the actual WTO agreement. This model is solved analytically to derive quantitative implications for the optimal tariff path, unlike in Melitz (2005), where only qualitative analyses are undertaken. An interesting result emerges: conventional wisdom is that a country in this situation should reduce the tariff rate gradually over time so that it converges to its long-run rate at the terminal date of protection. By contrast, this paper finds that, in some plausible scenarios, the optimal time path of the tariff can be upward sloping. A numerical analysis applied to the Vietnamese motorcycle industry, a typical infant industry in a country joining the WTO, confirms such a pattern.","Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Duong, TLA (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",,,"Tran, Duong/0000-0002-1988-4489",,,,,16,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Firstly, we shall develop three new aggregation operators: generalized probabilistic 2-tuple weighted average (GP-2TWA) operator, generalized probabilistic 2-tuple ordered weighted average (GP-2TOWA) operator and generalized immediate probabilistic 2-tuple ordered weighted average (GIP-2TOWA) operator. These operators use the weighted average (WA) operator, the ordered weighted average (OWA) operator, linguistic information, probabilistic information and immediate probabilistic information. They are quite useful because they can assess the uncertain information within the problem by using both linguistic labels and the probabilistic information that considers the attitudinal character of the decision maker. In these approaches, alternative appraisal values are calculated by the aggregation of 2-tuple linguistic information. Thus, the ranking of alternative or selection of the most desirable alternative(s) is obtained by the comparison of 2-tuple linguistic information. Finally, we give an illustrative example about selection of strategies to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its feasibility and practicality.","[Wei, Guiwu; Zhao, Xiaofei] Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R China",Chongqing University of Arts & Sciences,"Wei, GW (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R China.",weiguiwu@163.com,"Wei, Guiwu/M-4177-2015","Wei, Guiwu/0000-0001-9074-2005",,,,,39,20,20,0,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This flexibility generates economic advantages for his owner, but what are the financial benefits of a flex-fuel car in comparison with a car using only gasoline? Geographically, where is the owner of the benefits from this flexibility located? This article presents an empirical application of the Real Options Theory in the analysis of the flex-fuel car option for five geographic Brazilian regions: Northern, Northeastern, Central-Western, Southeastern and Southern. The regional price differences as well as the consumer preferences of these regions were met. For this purpose, historical fuel prices were considered stochastic and following a Mean Reverting Stochastic process. The prediction and option values were generated by a Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicated that the option embedded on the Brazilian flex-fuel car adds considerable value to the owner in all regions and car models considered, with the Southeastern Region receiving most benefits by the flex option.","[Samanez, Carlos Patricio; do Nascimento, Carolina Caldas; Costa, Leticia de Almeida] Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Ind Engn Dept, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Ferreira, Leo da Rocha] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Fac Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Bisso, Claudio R.

To test our model, we constructed an enlarged database for all European NUTS2 since 1995, which we analysed using panel data techniques (censored Tobit models). Our results reveal that the regions that are able to maintain player performance do so by persistent effort and external influences.

A multivariate cointegrated vector autoregression (CVAR) is applied to top six nuclear generating countries. We find that nuclear energy tends to reduce CO2 emission for all countries. It is also found that income has a beneficial effect on the environment only in some countries. Finally, we find that CO2 emissions and income are indeed determined simultaneously, while nuclear energy acts exogenously, indicating that nuclear energy is the driving variable, which significantly influences the long-run movements of CO2 emissions and income, but is not affected by CO2 emissions and income in the model.

The empirical results show that intensities of return migration are U-shaped with respect to migrants' income, implying a higher intensity in low- and high-income groups.

We explore the impact of shipping costs on total US FDI stocks abroad, manufacturing stocks and service stocks using measures of sea-shipping and air-shipping costs in a Hausman-Taylor model that controls for endogeneity and allows for time-invariant variables such as distance. We find that transportation costs have a positive and statistically significant relationship with US total and manufacturing FDI, suggesting a substitute relationship between FDI and trade flows consistent with horizontal MNE activity.

They are also relatively short-lived. But the costs of war borne by combatants and their caretakers, which includes families, communities, and the modern welfare state, tend instead to be lifelong. In this paper I show that a significant component of the budgetary costs associated with U.S. wars is long-lived. One third to one half of the total present value of historical war costs are benefits distributed over the remaining life spans of veterans and their dependents. Even thirty years after the end of hostilities, typically half of all benefits remain to be paid. Estimates of the costs of injuries and deaths suggest that the private burden of war borne by survivors, namely the uncompensated costs of service-related injuries, are also large and long-lived.

We find that buildings that are newer and of higher quality consume more electricity, contrasting evidence for the residential sector. However, using our panel data set, we document that newer buildings are most resilient when exposed to hotter weather.

This argument has been advanced by several prominent studies. Simply put, it reads: terms-of-trade agreements are efficient. I show that this result breaks down if the following two standard conditions are met. First, a self-enforcement requirement constrains the agreement and, second, production possibilities are intertemporally linked. These conditions imply that a country's current policy mix affects future production possibilities and thus impacts payoffs under potential defection. Since a terms-of-trade agreement does not specify a country's policy mix, it effectively invites countries to manipulate their own defection temptation. To be self-enforcing, terms-of-trade agreement must ensure that no country, while optimizing its policies on the isoterms-of-trade schedule, will abandon its zone of voluntary cooperation. This requirement implies that terms-of-trade agreements are inefficient and can be improved upon by agreements that target policies directly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Three criteria for measuring hedge effectiveness are employed: hedging instrument effectiveness, overall hedge effectiveness, and relative-to-optimal hedge ratio effectiveness (RHRE). Three portfolios of spot and futures series are formed for empirical analysis. The outcomes confirm that the three multivariate skew distributions are more helpful in deciding the minimum variance hedge ratio, especially the generalized hyperbolic distribution, than the symmetrical normal and Student-t distributions. This outperformance is significant especially at critical market moments and it is indicated by three hedge effectiveness measures. This advantage is held without the cost of lowering portfolio return. In addition, there is speculation possibility existing in the portfolio hedged by the traditional optimal hedge ratio and this potential can be detected especially by RHRE.","La Trobe Univ, Dept Finance, Bundoora, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University,"Liu, WH (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Dept Finance, Bundoora, Vic, Australia.",weihanliu2002@yahoo.com,,"Liu, Wei-han/0000-0001-9077-4322",,,,,45,4,5,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Following the evidence from neuroscience, we model the brain as an organization in which a coordinator allocates limited resources to the brain systems responsible for the different tasks. Systems are privately informed about the amount of resources necessary to perform their task and compete to obtain the resources. The coordinator arbitrates the demands while satisfying the resource constraint. We show that the optimal mechanism is to impose to each system with privately known needs a cap in resources that depends negatively on the amount of resources requested by the other system. This allocation can be implemented using a biologically plausible mechanism. Finally, we provide some implications of our theory: (i) performance can be flawless for sufficiently simple tasks, (ii) the dynamic allocation rule exhibits inertia (current allocations are increasing in past needs), and (iii) different cognitive tasks are performed by different systems only if the tasks are sufficiently important.","[Alonso, Ricardo] Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Brocas, Isabelle; Carrillo, Juan D.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Brocas, Isabelle; Carrillo, Juan D.] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of Southern California; University of Southern California; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Alonso, R (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,,"Alonso, Ricardo/0000-0001-9559-0864",,,,,72,23,24,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

At the same time, banks' sovereign debt portfolios have featured an increasing home bias. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between these two facts, and its rationale. First, we inquire to what extent the dynamics of sovereign yield differentials relative to the swap rate and CDS premia reflect changes in perceived sovereign solvency risk or rather different responses to systemic risk due to the possible collapse of the euro. We do so by decomposing yield differentials and CDS spreads in a country-specific and a common risk component via a dynamic factor model. We then investigate how the home bias of banks' sovereign portfolios responds to yield differentials and to their two components, by estimating a vector error-correction model on 2007-13 monthly data. We find that in most countries of the eurozone, and especially in its periphery, banks' sovereign exposures respond positively to increases in yields. When bank exposures are related to the country and common risk components of yields, it turns out that (1) in the periphery, banks increase their domestic exposure in response to increases in country risk, while in core countries they do not; (2) in most eurozone countries banks respond to an increase in the common risk factor by raising their domestic exposures. Finding (1) suggests distorted incentives in periphery banks' response to changes in their own sovereign's risk. Finding (2) indicates that, when systemic risk increases, all banks tend to increase the home bias of their portfolios, making the eurozone sovereign market more segmented.

Our objective is to determine if a first-price auction or a posted-price market provides a seller with the larger expected revenue when buyers have a common value of the item being sold. An agent-based posted-price market and an agent-based first-price common-value auction with a reserve price are developed to compare these selling methods. Holding the buyers' uncertainty about the value of the item constant, the seller prefers the posted-price market when the seller has no uncertainty about the item's value. When the seller has an equal level of uncertainty as the buyers, the seller's expected revenue for each market is similar. As the seller's uncertainty increases beyond the level of the buyers' uncertainty, the auction with a reserve price eventually becomes the preferred choice.","[Boyer, Christopher N.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Brorsen, B.

The formal evaluation of such forecasts has a long research history. Recently, a new angle to the evaluation of forecasts has been addressed, and in this review we analyze some recent developments from that perspective. The literature on forecast evaluation predominantly assumes that macroeconomic forecasts are generated from econometric models. In practice, however, most macroeconomic forecasts, such as those from the IMF, World Bank, OECD, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and the ECB, are typically based on econometric model forecasts jointly with human intuition. This seemingly inevitable combination renders most of these forecasts biased and, as such, their evaluation becomes nonstandard. In this review, we consider the evaluation of two forecasts in which: (i) the two forecasts are generated from two distinct econometric models; (ii) one forecast is generated from an econometric model and the other is obtained as a combination of a model and intuition; and (iii) the two forecasts are generated from two distinct (but unknown) combinations of different models and intuition. It is shown that alternative tools are needed to compare and evaluate the forecasts in each of these three situations. These alternative techniques are illustrated by comparing the forecasts from the (econometric) Staff of the Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC on inflation, unemployment, and real GDP growth. It is shown that the FOMC does not forecast significantly better than the Staff, and that the intuition of the FOMC does not add significantly in forecasting the actual values of the economic fundamentals. This would seem to belie the purported expertise of the FOMC.","[Franses, Philip Hans; McAleer, Michael; Legerstee, Rianne] Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael; Legerstee, Rianne] Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Complutense University of Madrid,"Franses, PH (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008","Franses, Philip Hans/0000-0002-2364-7777",,,,,22,4,4,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Little empirical work has been done on assessing the regional distribution of the impact of trade. Therefore, this paper looks at the regional distribution in Mexico of the benefits from trade after NAFTA. Unlike previous papers, this study works with municipal-level data, which not only makes it possible to observe the growth patterns across space more clearly but also to identify the effect of NAFTA. The results show that after NAFTA, output per worker in regions near the Mexico-U.S. border grew faster than that in those further away. Furthermore, the trade agreement increased inequality, implying trade increased economic concentration by causing cities to grow faster than other regions. Similarly, regions with a more literate workforce were better able to benefit from NAFTA, growing faster than other areas after the trade agreement.","CIDE, Div Econ, Toluca, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Based on a historical account of German tax legislation, the timing, size, and motivation of legislated tax changes are assessed and a time series of exogenous tax shocks is constructed. The VAR results indicate a substantial and statistically significant reaction of output following implementation of a tax change. In response to a one percentage point increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio, we observe a maximum output reduction of 2.4%.

It is shown that if tax revenues are lump-sum distributed and firms compete over prices, then coordinated tariff-tax reforms improve welfare for a low degree of product differentiation, whereas these reforms are welfare-reducing for any degree of product differentiation under Cournot competition.

There are many reasons for this anti-market attitude; however, economists, could reduce emporiophobia if we stressed cooperation rather than competition in writings and policy discussions. In a sample of introductory textbooks, competition is mentioned on average eight times as often as cooperation. The fundamental economic unit is the transaction, and transactions are cooperative. The benefit of a market economy increased consumer surplus comes from cooperation through transactions, not from competition. Competition in a market economy is competition for the right to cooperate. Competition is important because it guarantees that the best cooperators will win and because it establishes the efficient terms for cooperation, but cooperation is fundamental. For most people, competition has negative connotations since it focuses on losers, while cooperation implies a win-win situation.

The main result is that there are two groups among the French soccer clubs, both following completely different technologies' to obtain league points, suggesting that business strategies need to be adapted to the characteristics of the clubs.

Within this framework, three points are formally addressed: (I) the incomplete nature of the eurozone with respect to a fully fledged federal union has significantly contributed to generating diverging trends and conflicting claims between central and peripheral eurozone countries in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial meltdown; (2) center periphery diverging trends may disappear and a systemic crisis may occur should financial turbulences deepen in big peripheral economies, possibly spreading to the center; and (3) fiscal austerity does not address the core problems of the eurozone. The creation of a European federal government, capable of implementing anti-cyclical fiscal policies through a federal budget, and of a government banker constitutes the most promising solution to stabilize the macroeconomic picture of peripheral countries and to tackle the crisis. The unlimited bond-buying program recently launched by the ECB is a positive albeit mild step in the right direction away from the extreme monetarism that has shaped eurozone institutions thus far.","Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept Law & Econ, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy",Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria,"Botta, A (通讯作者)，Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept Law & Econ, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.",abotta@eco.unipv.it,"Botta, Alberto/ABT-2795-2022","BOTTA, Alberto/0000-0001-9464-8251",,,,,20,3,3,0,11,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The two issues of our primary interests are the following: (i) whether migration patterns of black individuals are consistent with the income-maximising hypothesis as related to the destination choice; and (ii) whether the redistribution of human capital is detected in internal migration. The results from conditional logit regressions on choices among individuals in 318 districts show that individuals prefer districts with higher expected wages, conditional on other regional characteristics. In addition, there exist differing preferences on the share of population with post-secondary education by individuals with commensurate educational attainments. Black individuals with post-secondary education tend to migrate into areas with a higher share of population with post-secondary education and vice versa, which confirms the divergence of human capital levels across districts.","[Choe, Chung] CEPS INSTEAD Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Chrite, E.

We illustrate that the method permits the estimation of bounds on mobility, and provide non-parametric and parametric approaches to obtaining these bounds. We test how well the method works on data sets for Vietnam and Indonesia where we are able to compare our method to true panel estimates.

Starting in 2000, land reform began with farm invasions. This process eventually evolved into a government-guided fast-track reform. During this process, the international community imposed sanctions, and these factors, together with a severe drought, let to a reduction in availability of the main food staple. Inflationary pressures built and were exacerbated by foreign exchange shortages. The economy slowed due to debt overhang and dwindling investment caused in part by increased uncertainty. Several factors contributed to deterioration of the value of the Zimbabwean Dollar and by mid-2007, hyperinflation became rampant. The economic crisis began to abate in 2008 and political agreements signed in 2008 and implemented in 2009 led to further stabilisation. As Zimbabwe moves forward, it is important to understand the conditions faced by the poor, and how they have changed during the period of hyperinflation. To do so, this paper uses 2001 and 2007/8 nationally representative household data and an asset index to avoid reliance on money-metric measures during the period of hyperinflation. An asset index is constructed using polychoric principal component analysis for both periods. A profile of well-being in 2001 is obtained using consumption expenditures, which helps calibrate asset index poverty lines. The 2001 data are used to generate small-area poverty estimates for both survey years and to validate the robustness of the findings from the asset index. The asset index holds its own when compared with standard consumption expenditure methods and small-area estimation-based predictions, providing confidence in our findings. Urban asset poverty declined during 2001/7, but extreme poverty increased. Rural asset poverty and extreme poverty worsened between 2001 and 2007. For the best-educated households, poverty increased significantly. Conditions of communal and resettlement workers deteriorated, reflecting worsening economic conditions in rural areas.","[Larochelle, Catherine; Alwang, Jeffrey] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Taruvinga, Nelson] Zimbabwe Natl Stat Agcy ZIMSTAT, Harare, Zimbabwe",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Larochelle, C (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",claroche@vt.edu; alwang@vt.edu,"Larochelle, Catherine/AAF-9194-2020; Alwang, Jeffrey/AAA-1716-2020","Larochelle, Catherine/0000-0001-7655-7380; Alwang, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2950-8516",,,,,39,10,14,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The model is applied to a panel of 29 Chinese provinces over the period of 1995-2010. It is shown that the model not only captures the impact of changes of economic and human geography but also provides valuable insights and richer information on spatial variations of other contributing factors than conventional country-level analysis.

In contrast to the Mirrlees example, unbounded likelihood ratios on the signal technology are not central. Rather, our examples center around the behavior of the utility function as utility diverges to negative infinity. For any utility function, such as ln(omega), in which utility diverges to negative infinity at a finite wealth level, existence will fail for some specifications of the agent's cost of effort. When utility diverges to negative infinity only as wealth does as well, existence holds for all specifications of the agent's cost of effort if and only if the agent continues to dislike risk as wealth diverges to negative infinity. When there is a finite lower bound on utility, existence is assured. For those cases where existence fails, we characterize the limit of near optimal contracts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This article provides an experimental study of first price private value asymmetric auctions followed by a 12 -double auction resale market opportunity. We compare the 12 -double auction to other resale regimes with an uneven distribution of market power and contrast initial bids, resale prices and efficiency. Despite the conventional wisdom that full efficiency requires the absence of market power, we find that 12 -double auction resale markets lead to lower efficiency than the monopsony resale regime. The level of efficiency achieved, however, is close to the highest across mechanisms that have differential bargaining power at the resale stage.","[Jog, Chintamani] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Econ & Int Business, Edmond, OK 73034 USA; [Kosmopoulou, Georgia] Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Kosmopoulou, Georgia] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Central Oklahoma; National Science Foundation (NSF); University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Kosmopoulou, G (通讯作者)，Natl Sci Fdn, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230 USA.",georgiak@ou.edu,,,,,,,14,6,6,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We identify conditions under which group inequality will persist in the absence of differences in ability, credit constraints, or labor market discrimination. Under these conditions, group inequality may be amplified even if initial group differences are negligible. Increases in social integration may destabilize an unequal state and make group equality possible, but the distributional and human capital effects of this depend on the demographic composition of the population. When the size of the initially disadvantaged group is sufficiently small, integration can lower the long-run costs of human capital investment in both groups and result in an increase the aggregate skill share. In contrast, when the initially disadvantaged group is large, integration can induce a fall in the aggregate skill share as the costs of human capital investment rise in both groups.

The study of this phenomenon is particularly relevant in today's world, where one of the main problems is the transformation of post-communist countries' economies so that they reach the states close to the economic systems of developed countries. This transformation takes place in the process of economic development stimulated by innovation, with the active role of the banking sphere. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to define the concept of equifinality achieved in a finite time, in an innovative development of-the economic system controlled by the banks and the analysis of its properties. For this purpose the possible trajectories of development are studied here in a space of innovative extensions of private ownership economy with money, for which the target state is an innovative extension of a given model. This analysis uses the apparatus of an Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium theory and the theory of dynamical systems.

We find that DG giving is correlated with cooperation in the repeated game when no cooperative equilibria exist, but not when cooperation is an equilibrium. Furthermore, none of the commonly observed strategies are better explained by inequity aversion or efficiency concerns than money maximization. Various survey questions provide additional evidence for the relative unimportance of social preferences. We conclude that cooperation in repeated games is primarily motivated by long-term payoff maximization and that even though some subjects may have other goals, this does not seem to be the key determinant of how play varies with the parameters of the repeated game. In particular, altruism does not seem to be a major source of the observed diversity of play. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that landowners without formal title are more likely to restrict their partners to tenants from the same ethnic group.

First, while both public and private debts have increased markedly, private, not public debts have climbed to historically unprecedented levels. Second, outside war times, financial crises have typically originated in the private sector, yet the costs have increasingly been socialized. Third, the historical record shows that modern democracies have been relatively successful in managing their financial affairs, evidenced by a systematically positive response of primary balances to high debt ratios.

The analysis is conducted using the policy rate, i.e. the central bank rate (CBR) and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) with respect to the interest rate and bank lending channels, respectively. The results indicate that whereas a change in the policy rate is effective in influencing short term rates, the long term lending rates respond marginally. Consequently, the transmission to the real economy and the overall impact on inflation is minimal. However, a change in CBR has a comparatively higher impact on inflation while a change in CRR has a relatively larger impact on aggregate demand. Enhancing the effectiveness of the CBR and strengthening of the interest rate channel have the potential of anchoring inflation expectations and boosting the effectiveness of monetary policy in Kenya.

One might be tempted to simply drop inconsistent subjects from the analysis to avoid such biases in a population-level analysis. Unfortunately, however, this is not a solution: first, the sample size may fall to an unacceptably low level. Second - and even more important - simply dropping inconsistent subjects from the analysis may introduce another unknown bias since systematic differences may exist in the risk preferences of those who answer consistently and those who do not. One must thus conclude that, if the group of interest contains a large proportion of inconsistent subjects, the whole set-up of the Holt-and-Laury lottery (HLL) experiment must be critically reconsidered and the experiment eventually repeated.","[Hirschauer, Norbert; Gruener, Sven] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Musshoff, Oliver; Maart-Noelck, Syster C.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; University of Gottingen,"Gruener, S (通讯作者)，Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",sven.gruener@landw.uni-halle.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889; Gruener, Sven/0000-0001-5794-7076",,,,,11,11,12,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This article examines its role in the post-communist transition. It adopts the approach of Guiso et al. which is based on data collected at the individual level rather than a cross-country analysis. However, with regard to recent literature we allow for a different interpretation of results. The analysis shows that religion still has an impact on individuals' economic attitudes, even after many decades of communist rule. Generally, religion is supportive of pro-market and pro-growth attitudes. The impact of different religions is not uniform, although none of them appears to be an obstacle in transition from a centrally planned economy to the free market. Further, the micro-level findings are compared with the macro-level to explain the differences in the course of transition among post-communist countries.","Univ JE Purkyne, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Minarik, P (通讯作者)，Univ JE Purkyne, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",pavol.minarik@ujep.cz,"Minarik, Pavol/Q-5977-2019; kozmina, yana/O-1695-2014","Minarik, Pavol/0000-0002-3913-2006;",,,,,39,10,10,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JAN 2,2014,26.0,1,,,,,67,88,,10.1080/14631377.2014.874656,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AB5YJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331864300005,0

Using two-state Markov-switching specifications, the results suggest that the relationship between military spending changes and economic growth is state dependent. Specifically, the results show that military spending changes affect the economic growth negatively during a slower growth-higher variance state, while positively within a faster growth-lower variance one. It is also demonstrated that military spending changes contain information about the growth transition probabilities. As a policy tool, the results indicate that increases in military spending can be detrimental to growth during slower growth-higher growth volatility periods.","[Ali, F.

We posit that the impact job security has on job satisfaction is not only a function of how likely it is that a worker loses a job but also how likely it is that a worker could find another. The effect this has on worker job satisfaction then is different depending on whether perceived job loss occurs (or not) when job openings are scarce or when job openings are plentiful. We use difference-in-differences analysis of the 1997 and 2008 waves from the National Study of the Changing Workforce to show that three measures of job security increase private sector worker job satisfaction, and reduce worker incentives to quit, more when job openings are relatively scarce (during contractions) than when job openings are relatively plentiful (during expansions).

First, the overall service input ratio is the lowest in all the sample economies. Second, most producer services are supplied by the traditional labor-intensive sectors. Third, manufacturing is the biggest user of producer services, and service industry is the second, while the opposite is true for most of the other sample economies. Fourth, unlike other economies, China's R&D is characterized more by consumer services than producer services. Fifth, China has fairly lower service input ratios in almost all the industries. The backward and forward linkages coefficients are both smaller for real estate activities and finance and insurance.

On average, the proportion of herd buyers is 2 percent; that of herd sellers is 4 percent. Herding also causes important informational inefficiencies in the market, amounting, on average, to 4 percent of the asset's expected value.","[Cipriani, Marco] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Guarino, Antonio] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; University of London; University College London,"Cipriani, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA.",marco.cipriani@ny.frb.org; a.guarino@ucl.ac.uk,"Cipriani, Marco/JWA-1923-2024","Cipriani, Marco/0000-0003-1960-3963",,,,,36,55,61,8,81,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We randomized the content of training provided to group leaders, with some sessions focusing on the benefits of informally sharing idiosyncratic basis risk. Consistent with learning informed by the theoretical results, we found that members of groups whose leaders had received training that emphasized risk-sharing had considerably higher uptake.

We present evidence of reduced fiscal policy procyclicality in a number of countries. Our empirical results suggest that improvements in institutional quality have led to a more countercyclical fiscal policy stance in a number of countries.

It has also been shown that prosocial acts or norms that dictate prosocial behavior can sometimes crowd out other prosocial behaviors. This paper tests whether a well-understood prosocial norm generosity during the holiday season (i.e., around Christmas) crowds out or complements tipping behavior, another prosocial norm. By examining seasonal differences in within-customer tipping behavior using two years of sales data from a busy restaurant. I find that during the holiday season tipping rates are higher, not lower. This effect appears to be driven by those who are already generous. The finding suggests that individuals do not necessarily view two prosocial norms as competing: rather, such norms can be complementary. Motives for prosocial norms like tipping are discussed.

This narrative, however, is based on measures of trade openness that do not fully take into account purchasing power differences across countries. Due to lack of alternative data, the measures employed in the existing literature are typically based on non-PPP-adjusted trade data denominated by PPP-adjusted GDP data. The present paper seeks to resolve this inconsistency by constructing new trade share estimates for 62 countries, representing 90% of world GDP. for the period from 1870 to 1949. Our estimates combine historical import and export figures with non-PPP-adjusted GDP values that we estimate via the short-cut method. Our estimates confirm qualitatively the narrative of a dramatic rise and fall of world trade over this period. Yet, they indicate that this rise and fall was quantitatively much more pronounced. We find that trade shares were on average 38% higher than previously documented and the world's level of trade openness in 1913 was comparable to that in 1974. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We study a model with heterogeneous firms, in which imperfect contract enforcement implies that productive firms face binding credit constraints, with the borrowing capacity limited by expected equity value. A drop in equity value tightens credit constraints and reallocates resources from productive to unproductive firms.

Because these financial intermediaries perform maturity transformation, they are subject to potential runs. We derive distinct liquidity, collateral, and asset liquidation constraints, which determine whether a run can occur as a result of changing market expectations. We show that the extent to which borrowers can ward off an individual run depends on whether it has sufficient liquidity, collateral, and asset liquidation capacity. These determinants depend on the borrower's (endogenous) balance sheet and on (exogenous) fundamentals. Systemic runs are possible if shocks to the valuation of collateral held by outside investors are sufficiently strong and uniform, and if the system as a whole is exposed to high short-term funding risk. The theory has policy implications for prudential regulation and lender-of-last-resort interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Using data from the 2002-2003 Spanish Time Use Survey (TUS), information was collected on the number of times an individual participated in sports and attended cultural events in the four weeks immediately preceding the survey. In our empirical analysis, we apply count data models to estimate the frequency of sports practice and cultural attendance, both defined in the aggregate, and we also apply those models to estimate specific activities. Moreover, we run separate estimates by gender. Our results reveal that both activities are seasonal and are more common in urban areas. In addition, family responsibilities and family size are a disincentive to engage in such activities, while non-labour income and wages exert a positive effect. In analysing the demand for specific activities, we find that participation elasticity with respect to non-labour income is usually less than one for the cultural and sports activities considered, whereas wage elasticity is generally greater than one. We also find differences by activity and gender. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore we used daily quotations of Ibovespa and ratio between the U. S. Dollar and Brazilian Real, from April, 2003 to August, 2011. The initial analysis evidenced that Brazilian stock market is more volatile than Real/Dollar exchange rate. With the time scales coefficients we estimated families of copulas for the relationship between daily log-returns of Dollar/Real exchange rate and Ibovespa. The results of estimated copulas evidenced that dependence between the variables is negative in all time scales, thus confirming the balanced portfolio theory. The coarse scales exhibit great negative dependence, which is reduced in the middle scales and reaches the lower level at the finest scales. This confirms that investors, holding portfolios composed by Brazilian stocks for long time, are more sensitive to Dollar/Real exchange rate. Regarding the shape of joint probability of the variables, there was a predominance of Student's t copula. This result emphasized that there is more dependence in the tails between exchange rate and Brazilian stock markets than the normally expected. It highlights the necessity of risk management in portfolios composed by stocks of Brazilian market in situations of great variation in Dollar/Real exchange rate. No less important is the caution of the exchange rate policy of the Brazilian government to huge variations and turbulence periods in the stock market.","[Righi, Marcelo Brutti; Ceretta, Paulo Sergio; Coronel, Daniel Arruda] Univ Fed Santa Maria, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"Righi, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Maria, Ave Roraima 1000 74C, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",marcelobrutti@hotmail.com; ceretta10@gmail.com; daniel.coronel@uol.com.br,"Righi, Marcelo/E-3756-2015; Ceretta, Paulo/AAK-3382-2020; ARRUDA CORONEL, DANIEL/J-4898-2014","Righi, Marcelo/0000-0002-3753-0705; ARRUDA CORONEL, DANIEL/0000-0003-0264-6502",,,,,37,2,3,0,10,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Two central results emerge from our study. First, optimal tax policy is counter-cyclical - tax rates fall during recession and rise during boom. This finding contrasts with pro-cyclical tax results obtained in standard sticky price Ramsey models. In presence of learning-by-doing (LBD) mechanism, the Ramsey planner finds it relatively more costly to raise taxes in response to a negative technology shock. Higher taxes would reduce hours, output, and hence future level of organizational capital which will magnify the shock further by lowering future productivity. Hence, in response to a negative productivity shock, the planner finds it optimal to lower taxes in order to raise the after tax return to work and minimize the welfare-reducing effects of the shock. Second, optimal inflation is very stable and persistent over the business cycle. We show that while a dynamic link between current production and future productivity generates the inflation persistence, the real cost of price adjustment is the key factor behind the very low volatility in optimal inflation. Both of these mechanisms work through the monopolistic firms' optimal pricing condition - namely the New Keynesian Philips Curve.","St Marys Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS BCH 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Talukdar, B (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Dept Econ, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS BCH 3C3, Canada.",bidyut.talukdar@smu.ca,,,,,,,37,1,1,1,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We find that both outsourcing and internal accumulation of ICT competencies are strongly correlated to the provision of these services. Moreover we observe that in-house ICT activities have twice as high an impact on e-Government development as compared to ICT outsourcing. The enactment of advanced e-services is less likely in the case of small municipalities, in sparsely populated areas, and in the presence of higher rates of growth of the elder component of population. By contrast it is more likely in areas characterized by more intense patenting activities, which in turn favour a dynamic and sophisticated demand for new services. Though broadly consistent with Fountain's technology enactment framework, our findings suggest that more emphasis should be given to the internal competencies of public administrations, and to context specific factors reflecting the characteristics of end users.

In the first part of the article we analyze a theoretical model with endogenous birth rate in which we do not make any assumption on how fertility directly affects per capita human capital accumulation. The results obtained in this model are then compared with those of a more traditional setting where the birth rate is exogenous and in which the direct effect of this variable on per capita human capital investment is monotonically negative, a rather standard assumption within the available theoretical literature. By using non-parametric techniques, we document the presence of a strong non-monotonicity in the total effect that fertility plays on human capital accumulation, and hence on economic growth. The non-monotonic effect of fertility on human capital appears to hold empirically for OECD, as well as non-OECD countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We define the notion of coalitional network to represent a network and a coalition structure, where the network specifies the nature of the relationship each individual has with her coalition members and with individuals outside her coalition. To predict the coalitional networks that are going to emerge at equilibrium we propose the concepts of strong stability and of contractual stability. Contractual stability imposes that any change made to the coalitional network needs the consent of both the deviating players and their original coalition partners. Requiring the consent of coalition members under the simple majority or unanimity decision rule may help to reconcile stability and efficiency. Moreover, this new framework can provide insights that one cannot obtain if coalition formation and network formation are tackled separately and independently.","[Caulier, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Mauleon, Ana; Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.; Vannetelbosch, Vincent] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Mauleon, Ana; Vannetelbosch, Vincent] Fac Univ St Louis, CEREC, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia 46022, Spain",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite Catholique Louvain; University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles; University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Vannetelbosch, V (通讯作者)，Fac Univ St Louis, CEREC, Blvd Jardin Bot 43, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",jean-francois.caulier@univ-paris1.fr; mauleon@fusl.ac.be; Jose.J.Sempere@uv.es; vincent.vannetelbosch@uclouvain.be,"Sempere-Monerris, Jose J./E-6234-2016; Mauleon, Ana/H-1970-2015","Sempere-Monerris, Jose J./0000-0001-6759-2117;",,,,,31,9,9,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Due to this scope, we will advance that especially the distribution of power was vital for the evolution of one specific aspect of CPRIs, namely accessibility.

First, we explore different social objectives justifying the deployment of RE technologies and review model-based estimates of the economic potential of RE technologies, i.e. their socially optimal deployment level. Second, we address pivotal market failures that arise in the course of implementing the economic potential of RE sources in decentralized markets. Third, we discuss multiple policy instruments curing these market failures. Our framework reveals the requirements for an assessment of the relevant options for real-world decision makers in the field of RE policies.

For empirically relevant parameter estimates, distributional change preserving the functional form of each of these three-parameter distributions is often either pro-poor and inequality reducing, or pro-rich and inequality exacerbating, but it is also possible for pro-rich growth to be inequality reducing.

This raises an important strategic issue that has been overlooked in the previous literature: Bidders may change their bids to inflict higher prices on their competitors because under generalized second-price, the per-click price paid by a bidder is the next highest bid. We provide budget thresholds under which equilibria analyzed in Edelman et al.

Fiscal decentralization is a multifaceted concept not likely to be captured by a single measure. This paper investigates the evolution of three aspects of fiscal decentralization including spending decentralization, revenue decentralization, and autonomy power, and tests the effects of each aspect on the regional income inequality in China in the past thirty years. Several critical findings were obtained through econometric analysis. The fiscal decentralization on spending side in China has contributed to rising income inequality over the last three decades. On the revenue side, the fiscal system became more decentralized from mid-1980s to 1994, and re-centralized after the 1994 tax sharing reform. The econometric analysis shows that the increase in revenue share of local governments from mid-1980s to 1994 indeed increased regional inequality, while the revenue re-centralization in 1994 only had a modest effect on reducing regional inequality. In terms of autonomy power measured by how public spending at local level of government is maintained by its own revenue, the degree of fiscal decentralization decreased since mid-1980s, and experienced a sharp reduction in 1994 due to the tax sharing reform. The autonomy power has mixed effects on regional inequality in the two periods, before and after the 1994 reform, depending on the targeting of fiscal transfers and the incentives of local governments. As it turns out, fiscal decentralization may not be automatically equalizing or anti-equalizing, whereas how fiscal decentralization is promoted is important for how it impacts regional inequality.

An assessment of relative importance is made on various time scales ranging from the shortest ones associated with abrupt changes up to those associated with medium-run changes. Wavelet analysis is used to accomplish this task. We show that relative importance is scale-specific, i.e. depends on the analyzed time scale. Sunshine duration is generally the more important explanatory variable on the shortest time scales and the outside temperature dominates on higher time scales. The reason for the outside temperature being an inferior explanatory variable on the shortest time scales is a low variability of the outside temperature on these time scales and a dampened reaction of electricity consumption to abrupt changes in the outside temperature. Our results show that sunshine duration should be considered relevant when modeling electricity consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We extend the model of Joskow and Tirole (2007) to address the interconnected nature of the PJM grid by considering a market with two different locations connected by transmission lines. We assume that these lines are constrained during peak periods in a manner similar to Borenstein et al. (2000). We find that government intervention has a significant potential for adverse effects on grid resource adequacy and reliability. In our analysis, subsidized investment in baseload capacity is never optimal. In the short run government provision of base capacity displaces competitive base capacity, which reduces the private provision of peak capacity. In the long run, the threat of intervention imposes costs on suppliers in the form of an expected regulatory taking. As a result, resource adequacy decreases in both markets. If governments respond to this state of affairs by subsidizing further supply additions, expectations of intervention are reinforced and competitive capacity supply further diminishes. MOPR attempts to mitigate this vicious cycle by screening out non-economic bids for new capacity. To the extent market participants view MOPR as a credible policy, it succeeds in this goal. In this case, subsidized capacity additions do not perturb the efficiency of market outcomes as long as any charges to consumers to support the subsidy are lump sum in nature. In this case, subsidized resources simply succeed in capturing rents from taxpayers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Briggs, R.

Understanding the extent to which structural or cyclical factors may have driven these patterns is important to assess the likely evolution of global imbalances going forward, as well as the potential adjustment that can be achieved through changes in policy. This paper assesses the link between structural and cyclical factors and current account balances using a panel of 94 countries from 1973 to 2008. We find that the medium-term evolution of global external imbalances can be related in large part to structural factors including cross-country differences in demographics, fiscal deficits, oil dependency and intensity, stage of economic development, financial market development, and institutional quality. Part of the narrowing in current account balances since the financial crisis appears to be related to various cyclical factors including changes in output growth, oil prices, and exchange rates, and may be expected to reverse alongside the economic recovery.","[Furceri, Davide] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Cheung, Calista; Rusticelli, Elena] OECD, Dept Econ, F-75775 Paris 16, France",International Monetary Fund; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Cheung, C (通讯作者)，OECD, Dept Econ, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",dfurceri@imf.org,,,,,,,39,27,27,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The findings, based on cross-sectional as well as household fixed-effect approaches, suggest that girls are less likely to enrol in school but are not allocated fewer resources once they are enrolled.","[Choden, Phuntsho; Sarkar, Dipanwita] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Sarkar, D (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",dipanwita.sarkar@qut.edu.au,"Sarkar, Dipanwita/J-1320-2012","Sarkar, Dipanwita/0000-0002-3824-5746",,,,,34,4,5,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Underpricing is calculated using headline underpricing, underpricing issuer loss, underpricing loss by market value and underpricing loss by issuer price. Aftermarket performance employs monthly cumulative abnormal returns, buy-and-hold returns and wealth relatives. The underpricing results show respective average underpricing of 12.69%, 5.01%, 4.74% and 11.40% for the measures used. This is significantly lower than the underpricing found for the large-firm IPOs listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). However, there is much variability in pricing over the sample period, with substantial underpricing in 2003/04 and correctly priced issues on average in 2001/02 and 2005/06/07. While the performance analysis is suggestive that SMEs perform well after listing, returns adjusted for market performance indicates that this generally only holds up until the second year after listing.","[Chorruk, Jirapun] Mahasarakham Univ, Dept Finance, Maha Sarakham, Thailand; [Worthington, Andrew C.] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Mahasarakham University; Griffith University,"Worthington, AC (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",a.worthington@griffith.edu.au,,"Worthington, Andrew/0000-0003-4113-9036",,,,,28,5,5,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

As the main focus is on the equity market volatility dynamics and less on other equally important asset types, in this paper we examine the dynamics between US money markets, government debt, corporate debt and equities volatilities, and a real GDP growth proxy, between 1963 and 2009. Results show that assets' volatility is essentially counter-cyclical of growth. However, this interaction changes when specific time subsamples are considered: in recessions, rising volatility leads the economic cycle, while in expansions its downward trend lags the business cycle.","[Curto, Jose Dias] IUL Business Sch, ISCTE, Lisbon, Portugal; [Marques, Joao] Caixa Geral Depositos Grp, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Curto, JD (通讯作者)，IUL Business Sch, ISCTE, Lisbon, Portugal.",dias.curto@iscte.pt; joao.silva.marques@cgd.pt,,"Curto, Jose/0000-0003-2012-9015",,,,,45,1,1,0,11,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Country-level macro measures of the quality of policies and institutions are strongly correlated with project outcomes, consistent with the view that country-level performance matters for aid effectiveness. However, a striking feature of the data is that the success of individual development projects varies much more within countries than it does between countries. A large set of project-level micro variables, including project size, project length, the effort devoted to project preparation and supervision, and early-warning indicators that flag problematic projects during the implementation stage, accounts for some of this within-country variation in project outcomes. Measures of World Bank project manager quality also matter significantly for the ultimate project outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings for donor policies aimed at aid effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper employs threshold nonrecursive structural vector autoregression analysis to explore the asymmetric effects of macro-variables on inflation in low and high inflation regimes. The empirical evidence demonstrates, first, that the reactions of inflation to various shocks are inflation-regime-dependent and asymmetric. Second, monetary policy influences China's high inflation and adjusting the domestic interest rate in China may be an effective way to control inflation in a high inflation regime, but not in a low inflation regime. In a high inflation regime, a high inflation rate may cause the macro-policy authorities to increase the domestic interest rate, in an attempt to stabilize high inflation. Third, contrary to expectations, the world oil price is not a strong cost-push factor in a low inflation regime. Oil price increases may increase inflation in a high inflation regime, but there is no such obvious effect in a low inflation regime. Finally, China's nominal effective exchange rate influences inflation in both low and high inflation regimes. A nominal effective exchange rate appreciation might be effective in controlling domestic inflation in both regimes.","Yokohama Natl Univ, Int Grad Sch Social Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 240, Japan",Yokohama National University,"Guo, F (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Int Grad Sch Social Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 240, Japan.",guofangynu@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,1,2,3,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV,2013,21.0,6,,,,,100,120,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12048.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,291TN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329853000006,0

Most existing studies ignored the variation of production technologies among regions in China. Taking this factor into account, we introduce a parametric metafrontier approach based on the Shephard energy distance function. For further analysis, regions in China are divided into three groups using cluster analysis. We find that the regions in group 1 (mainly the regions in the east area of China) not only have the highest energy efficiency score, but also take the lead in terms of technology gap ratio. Meanwhile, due to their backward technology levels, the average energy efficiency score of the regions in group 3 (mainly the regions in the west area of China) is particularly low. Moreover, the pooled estimation, which ignores the technology gap among the groups, tends to underestimate the energy efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Laboratory auctions with uncertainty over final values in this experiment resulted in 18% and 27% of bids above the expected value of the item in private-value first-price and English auctions, respectively. Risk-seeking preferences as measured on an individual decision task cannot explain overbidding and the first-price auction results suggest that risk aversion may not be a good explanation for bidding behavior observed with certain values. Several candidate explanations fail to explain overbidding, rather it appears to stem from some bidders who are prone to overbidding. Relative to first-price auctions, the size and frequency of overbids are significantly larger in English auctions, while more English auctions are won by overbidders. Differences between the formats appear to be driven by the dynamic nature of English auctions which is consistent with popular notions of auction fever. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Firstly, we apply an OLS estimator controlling for a number of individual characteristics and school fixed effects. Secondly, in order to attenuate the impact of confounding factors, we use propensity score matching techniques. Our empirical findings based on average treatment effects suggest that being a victim of school bullying has a considerable negative effect on student performance at both the fourth and the eighth grade level. Importantly, the adverse effect of bullying on educational achievement is larger at age 13 than at age 9. Hence, school violence seems to constitute a relevant factor in explaining student performance. Our findings suggest some possible interventions that Italian policy makers should adopt to prevent or reduce bullying behaviors. (C) 2013 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

I conclude that before the announcement, the existence of such bailout policy reduces investors' bank run incentives, but after the announcement, investors may run on the bank, since such an announcement reflects the government's information about the bad bank asset.

In this paper, we study the impact of this deregulation reform on the operational efficiency for a balanced panel of 34 large power plants for the period 1997-2010. We find that on average these power plants have converged to the technological frontier over the sample period. Controlling for substantial heterogeneity in the technical profile, we also find that the unbundling reform has boosted productivity of China's large thermal power plants; however, the presumably differential impacts of the reform on the previously SPC-managed power plants and the independent power producers in our sample are insignificant.

At the firm level, there is a fixed cost combined with increasing marginal cost, which gives a standard U-shaped cost curve with optimal firm size. The costs of entry (exit) are quadratic in the flow of new firms. The number of firms becomes a second state variable and the entry dynamics gives rise to a richer set of dynamics than in the standard case: in particular, there is likely to be a hump shaped response of output to a fiscal shock with maximum effect after impact and before steady-state is reached. Output and capital per firm are also likely to be hump shaped. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The methods are also used to examine changes in Euro area monetary policy between 1971 and 2007.","[Hall, Alastair R.; Osborn, Denise R.] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Sakkas, Nikolaos] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Manchester; University of Bath,"Hall, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,"Osborn, Denise/B-8692-2008","Osborn, Denise/0000-0001-5534-8926; Sakkas, Nikolaos/0000-0003-0998-4395",ESRC [ES/G002401/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G002401/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,32,19,19,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

To understand this behavior, we examine voluntary provision of a discrete public good with independent private values that can be ascertained at a cost. We find that an individual who considers a smaller contribution is less likely to learn her value, and thus the percentage of informed giving diminishes as the population grows. We also find that a direct grant to the charity exacerbates crowding-out by discouraging information acquisition whereas a matching grant increases donations by encouraging it We further show that with costly information, a (first-order) stochastic increase in values can decrease donations; and that facilitating private acquisition of information can be a better fund-raising strategy than directly supplying it.

That is, we attempt to separately estimate cohort and assimilation effects. We also estimate the associated immigrant earnings growth rate and immigrant-native earnings convergence rate. Our estimates suggest that immigrants from more recent cohorts fare better than earlier ones at entry. Furthermore, the earnings of immigrants from more recent cohorts catch up faster with natives' earnings. While the convergence took over 30 years for those entering in the post-war, it only took half as long for those entering in the early 2000s. This earnings growth is fastest in the first 10 years, and it considerably slows down after 30 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a model in which multinational subsidiaries benefit from lower communication costs despite having to pay for an efficiency wage premium compared with subcontractors. The model predicts that offshoring cost reductions increase foreign insourcing shares for industries that have communication intensity levels above a certain threshold, but decrease the shares otherwise. To test this theoretical prediction, we examine how reductions in offshoring costs that are attributed to the establishment of export processing zones affect the organization of Chinese offshoring.

An agent-based model was proposed for studying the Lewis turning point and labor resource allocation, in which the decision-making interactions were made among the members of a household. This model differs from traditional development economics theory in which only an individual's behavior is considered. How peasant households allocate their human capital to maximize the utility of a household unit was investigated on the basis of the unitary principle under the assumption of risk aversion. The roles of living expenses, subsidies and income adjustment factors were also considered. Our results revealed the paradoxical phenomenon that rural surplus labor and the Lewis turning point coexist.","[Liu, Huai Yu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cao, Shinan] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Deng, Jing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Beijing Forestry University,"Cao, SN (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",shinancao@ruc.edu.cn,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,31,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

To this end, the panel cointegration analysis is applied to the data from Turkey's top 20 export industries to major 20 trading partners for the period 1980-2009. Special attention is paid to test for whether employment of country-level trade data instead of industry-level data is subject to the aggregation bias problem in the estimation of long-run cointegration parameters. The results indicate that employing country-level trade data suffers from the aggregation bias in estimating the cointegration parameters for the level of exchange rate and for the exchange rate volatility. The findings imply that (i) the impact of the exchange rate volatility on Turkish exports differs across industries, (ii) Turkey benefits from the depreciation of Turkish lira, and(iii) the foreign income plays a key role in determining the Turkish industry-level exports. The findings increase our insights to explain therecent dynamics of Turkish exports and provide some policy implications.","Pamukkale Univ, Dept Econometr, Denizli, Turkey",Pamukkale University,"Nazlioglu, S (通讯作者)，Pamukkale Univ, Dept Econometr, Denizli, Turkey.",snazlioglu@pau.edu.tr,,"Nazlioglu, Saban/0000-0002-3607-3434",,,,,41,17,17,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We document that the introduction of a hypothetical award has statistically significant effects on the stated willingness to contribute to a public good. Our design allows us to estimate the impact of different award characteristics related to, for example, how public or how valuable the award is. The stated willingness to share important information with colleagues increases monotonically with the value of the monetary payment or gift that comes with the award and is lower for gifts than payments of equal value. Moreover, publicity has a substantial positive effect: a ceremony increases stated contributions by as much as increasing the value of the award from $0 to $1000. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In our previous article, we evaluated the large-scale Army policies to replace relatively light Type 1 Tactical Wheeled Vehicles (TWVs) with moderately protected Type 2 variants, and later to replace Type 2s with heavily protected Type 3s. We find that the switch from Type 2 to Type 3 TWVs did not appreciably reduce fatalities and were not cost-effective. Mr. Gayl contends that the data and choice of control variables used in our original study negatively bias our findings for Type 3 TWVs. We defend our previous conclusions and argue that Gayl's suggested approach of focusing on deaths per insurgent attack fails to account for effects of the vehicles on when, where, and how attacks occurred. Our methodology does not suffer from this bias and measures effects on total unit casualties rather those incurred per attack. We explain that our estimates are stable across many specifications and are not sensitive to the choice of controls as Gayl suggests.","[Rohlfs, Chris] Morgan Stanley, New York, NY 10019 USA; [Sullivan, Ryan] Naval Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA 93943 USA",Morgan Stanley; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,"Sullivan, R (通讯作者)，Naval Postgrad Sch, 287 Halligan, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.",rssulliv@nps.edu,,"Rohlfs, Chris/0000-0001-7714-9231",,,,,4,1,1,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

If benefit exceeds cost, provision of the service increases social welfare and should therefore be encouraged-but the individuals providing the service gain no (immediate) benefit from providing the service and hence have an incentive to withhold service. Hence, there is scope for designing a protocol that improves welfare by encouraging exchange. To operate successfully within the confines of the online environment, such a protocol should be distributed, robust, and consistent with individual incentives. This paper proposes and analyzes protocols that rely solely on the exchange of fiat money or tokens. The analysis has much in common with work on search models of money but the requirements of the environment also lead to many differences from previous analyses-and some surprises; in particular, existence of equilibrium becomes a thorny problem and the optimal quantity of money is different.","[van der Schaar, Mihaela; Xu, Jie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Zame, William] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Zame, W (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",zame@econ.ucla.edu,,"Xu, Jie/0000-0002-0515-1647; van der schaar, Mihaela/0000-0003-3933-6049",,,,,27,10,10,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We first estimate single equation error correction models for seven interest rate categories and ten euro area countries and find that the interest rate pass-through displays substantial heterogeneity especially in the short run, but also in the long run. We then apply the pooled mean group estimator (PMGE) advanced by Pesaran et al. (1999), allowing for country-specific interest rate pass-through in the short run, while constraining the long-run pass-through to be homogeneous across countries. We find significant evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the short-run pass-through.

Evidence from Quebec's family policies,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Child care; Child care subsidies; Labor supply; Subjective well-being; Life satisfaction; Happiness; Work-life balance,RELATIVE-INCOME; HAPPINESS; WORK; PARADOX; TIME; LIFE,"In this paper, we investigate the effect of a change in child care subsidies on parental subjective well-being. Starting in 1997, the Canadian province of Quebec implemented a generous program providing $5-a-day child care to children under the age of 5. By 2007, the percentage of children attending subsidized day care had tripled and mothers' labor force participation had increased substantially. Objectively, more labor force participation is seen as a positive change, bringing with it higher income, independence and bargaining power. Yet a decrease in women's subjective well-being over previous decades has been documented, perhaps due to a Second Shift effect where women work more but still bear the brunt of housework and childrearing (Hochschild and Machung, 1989). Using data from the Canadian General Social Survey, we estimate a triple-differences model using differences pre- and post-reform between Quebec and the rest of Canada and between parents with young children and those with older children. Our estimates suggest that Quebec's family policies led to a small decrease in parents' life satisfaction. Of note, though, we find large and positive effects for lower-educated mothers and fathers and negative effects for higher-educated parents. This is consistent with an income effect boosting subjective wellbeing for lower-educated parents and with negative effects on child outcomes overtaking income effects for more educated households.

The three sectors are the rural sector, the urban informal sector and the urban formal sector. The rural sector and the urban informal sector use one type of mobile capital while the urban formal sector uses a sector-specific capital. We find that the effects of an inflow of foreign capital in the urban formal sector on unemployment and social welfare crucially hinge on the relative factor intensities of the rural sector and the urban informal sector. We show that there is a possibility of trade-off between the government's twin objectives of improvement in social welfare and mitigation of the urban unemployment problem. These results are extremely crucial from the view point of policymaking in an unemployment plagued, low-income developing economy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A real-life production system inevitably generates nonconforming items and has equipment breakdowns owing to process deterioration or other uncontrollable factors. This study addressed these issues in an EPQ-based system to optimize a replenishment policy that minimizes the long-run average cost for the proposed system. Whenever a breakdown occurs, the machine is assumed to immediately be under repair, and an abort/resume inventory control policy is adopted. Under this control policy production of the interrupted lot resumes immediately after the machine is fixed and restored. A mathematical model and a recursive algorithm were used to derive the optimal replenishment policy. A numerical example was used to demonstrate the practical application and better cost efficiency of the proposed policy compared to a breakdown that occurs under a no-resumption policy.

This is why Ross (1981) proposed a stronger measure of increased risk aversion that maintains for mean-preserving changes in risk the result obtained by Arrow (1965) and Pratt (1964) for risk elimination. Ross's (1981) contribution was later extended to higher orders using Ekern's (1980) notion of a higher-degree increase in risk. In this paper, we show that these measures remain valid under less restrictive assumptions than those implied by Ekern's (1980) approach and we refer to the concept of mean-preserving stochastic dominance.

As mitigation policies ultimately aim to limit emissions, a new scarcity for space in the atmosphere to deposit emissions is created. The associated scarcity rent, or climate rent (that is, for example, directly visible in permit prices under an emission trading scheme) can be higher or lower than the original fossil resource rent. In this paper, we analyze analytically and numerically the impact of mitigation targets, resource availability, backstop costs, discount rates and demand parameters on fossil resource rents and the climate rent. We assess whether and how owners of oil, gas and coal can be compensated by a carbon permit grandfathering rule. One important finding is that reducing (cumulative) fossil resource use could actually increase scarcity rents and benefit fossil resource owners under a permit grandfathering rule. For our standard parameter setting overall scarcity rents under climate policy increase slightly. While low discount rates of resource owners imply higher rent losses due to climate policies, new developments of reserves or energy efficiency improvements could more than double scarcity rents under climate policy. Another important implication is that agents receiving the climate rent (regulating institutions or owners of grandfathered permits) could influence the climate target such that rents are maximized, rather than to limit global warming to a socially desirable level. For our basic parameter setting, rents would be maximized at approximately 650 GtC emissions (50% of business-as-usual emissions) implying a virtual certainty of exceeding a 2 degrees C target and a likelihood of 4 degrees C warming.

Although the literature generally claims that the Boston mechanism is Pareto efficient but neither stable nor strategy-proof, this study delineates a subset of school priority structures for which it fulfills all three criteria. We show that the Boston mechanism is stable if and only if it is strategy-proof if and only if the priority structure is strongly acyclic. However, we find that the condition of strong acyclicity is nearly impossible to satisfy: any priority structure is quasi-cyclic whenever there are two schools whose admission quotas are less than the number of students seeking admission.

Aggregation of resource-intensive sectors decreases the accuracy of the results. Often, economic sectors are compiled in a more aggregated form than environmental satellite accounts, and as [Lenzen, M. (2011) Aggregation Versus Disaggregation in Input-Output Analysis of the Environment. Economic Systems Research, 23, 73-89] asserts, it is superior for environmental analysis to disaggregate the I-O table, even if only partial information exists for the disaggregation. In this paper we present a methodology to disaggregate the electricity sector of the Chinese national I-O table by using regional information and cost data for operation and maintenance of power plants. The electricity sector is disaggregated into a transmission and distribution sector as well as eight sub-sectors representing different types of technology in power plants (subcritical coal, hydro, etc.). The electricity consumption mix of each industry is determined by using regional industry presence and regional electricity power mixes. The disaggregated I-O table offers refined results for calculating emissions embodied in international exports from China, a valuable contribution for estimating national greenhouse gases emissions inventories under the consumption-based approach for countries that rely heavily on imports of goods from China.","[Lindner, S.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Legault, J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Guan, D.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Leeds,"Lindner, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",sml51@cam.ac.uk,"Guan, Dabo/Y-2406-2019","Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403",,,,,40,64,72,3,81,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Empirical results substantiate the finding. Due to the decrease of birth rate and the increase of the share of the working-age population, China's average annual per capita GDP growth rate increased 1.19 and 0.73 percentage points during the sample period.

Different mixture models are estimated and the type (Level-0, Level-1, etc) of each player is determined in every round using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. The matrices showing the number of individuals transitioning among levels is computed in each case. It is found that most players either remain in the same level or advance to the next two levels they were in the previous period. The lowest levels (Level-0 and Level-1) have a higher probability of transitioning to a higher level than Level-2 or Level-3. Thus, we can conclude that subjects, through repetition of the task, quickly become more sophisticated strategic thinkers as defined by higher levels. However, in some specifications the highest levels have a relatively large probability of switching to a lower level in the next period.

Our empirical results confirm the existence of long-run relationship between terrorism and economic growth. The Granger causality analysis indicates that terrorism is Granger cause of economic growth. The feedback effect is found between terrorism and trade openness. The relationship between terrorism and capital is bidirectional. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A path dependency implies that the bank equity return can be knocked out whenever a legally binding barrier is breached. A Cobb-Douglas utility indicates substitutability between equity returns and equity risks for the explicit treatment of risk aversion. We show that an increase in the barrier results in a reduced loan amount held by the bank at an increased interest margin when the probability of hitting the barrier before the expiration date is high. The bank interest margin is negatively related to the degree of the like (Equity returns) preference relative to the dislike (equity risks) preference. Preference as such makes the bank more prone to risk-taking, thereby adversely affecting the stability of the banking system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Europe in 1500 already had incomes twice as high on a per capita basis as Africa, and one-third greater than most of Asia. In this essay, we explain how Europe's tumultuous politics and deadly penchant for warfare translated into a sustained advantage in per capita incomes. We argue that Europe's rise to riches was driven by the nature of its politics after 1350-it was a highly fragmented continent characterized by constant warfare and major religious strife. No other continent in recorded history fought so frequently, for such long periods, killing such a high proportion of its population. When it comes to destroying human life, the atomic bomb and machine guns may be highly efficient, but nothing rivaled the impact of early modern Europe's armies spreading hunger and disease. War therefore helped Europe's precocious rise to riches because the survivors had more land per head available for cultivation. Our interpretation involves a feedback loop from higher incomes to more war and higher land-labor ratios, a loop set in motion by the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century.","[Voigtlaender, Nico] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Voigtlaender, Nico] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Voth, Hans-Joachim] Univ Pompeu Fabra, DEE, Barcelona, Spain; [Voth, Hans-Joachim] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research; Pompeu Fabra University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Voigtländer, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",nico.v@anderson.ucla.edu; jvoth@crei.cat,"Voth, Hans-Joachim/D-7180-2013",,,,,,69,38,39,0,22,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In particular, we investigate a setting where a regulator with incomplete information uses a pollution tax mechanism with a simple, endogenous tax rate adjustment rule to cost-effectively meet a pollution standard. This mechanism provides the opportunity for firms to strategically abate in order to reduce future tax rates. The experiments vary important policy design features such as the type of tax (ambient or emissions), the initial tax rate, and the tax rate adjustment speed. We find that in equilibrium the pollution standard is met on average for each of these settings. The observed long-run tax rates vary considerably across policy designs, which can be explained with a theory that allows for a mix of strategic and myopic firms, along with the recognition that the incentives generated by the policy design can influence whether an agent plays myopically or strategically.

The traditional NEER methodology using aggregated export trade data underestimates the competition between countries producing homogeneous goods, so that the weight of the effective exchange rates is too reliant on trade scale. Based on 2002 6-digit items of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, this paper employs the competitive stress index to adjust the weighting system of the renminbi NEER for third market competition. In the new weighting system, European countries and some emerging economies have higher weights compared with some of the developed countries, including the USA, Japan and resources-dominated economies.

However, Selgin (2001,2010) argues that this is unlikely as long as there are enough banks to ensure (i) routine interbank settlement and (ii) no collusion amongst banks refraining from redeeming one another's notes. Banks effectively form a chain gang where in-concert expansion requires coordination that is prohibitively costly in a system with many banks. In order to test this conjecture, we examine state-level data on circulations and reserves from the Suffolk Banking System (1825-1858) in New England. In addition to narrative evidence on the stability of the Suffolk, panel cointegration tests provide evidence of a long-run relationship between state-level circulations and total reserves. The estimated error-correction mechanisms suggest a deviation half-life of about 2 years. We argue that a cointegrating relationship between circulations and reserves, along with rapid error-correction, supports the Selgin hypothesis. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In addressing this broad question, we focus on the role played by political norms-specifically, the extent to which leaders abuse office for personal gain and the extent to which citizens punish such transgressions. We show how qualitatively distinct political norms can coexist because of a dynamic complementarity, in which citizens' willingness to punish transgressions is raised when they expect such punishments to be used in the future. We seek to understand the emergence of accountability by analysing transitions between norms. To do so, we extend the analysis to include the possibility that, at certain times, a segment of voters are (behaviorally) intolerant of transgressions. Our mechanism highlights the role of leaders, offering an account of how their actions can instigate enduring change, within a fixed set of formal institutions, by disrupting prevailing political norms. We show how such changes do not depend on sun spots to trigger coordination, and are asymmetric in effect-a series of good leaders can (and eventually will) improve norms, whereas bad leaders cannot damage them.

The Long-Term Impact of Displacement on Young Workers,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,JOB DISPLACEMENT; EARNINGS LOSSES; UNEMPLOYMENT,"We investigate short- and long-term impacts on labour market outcomes of experiencing a displacement for young workers. The period under study is 2000-2009. The end of the observation period is characterised by a shrinking labour market, coinciding with the start of the financial crisis. The main merit of the study is the inclusion of a wide battery of dependent variables. In general we find sizeable short-term effect on both unemployment and wage-employment. Furthermore, the results indicate that displacement has a long-term negative effect on wage employment. Part of this pattern seems to be masked by an increased likelihood of self-employment. A positive effect on self-employment is desirable from a policy perspective. Finally, among those who are employed in the final observation year, we find a small negative effect of displacement on hourly wages. This is solely explained by the foregone work experience of the displaced workers in the years after displacement.","[Hardoy, Ines; Schone, Pal] Inst Social Res, N-0208 Oslo, Norway",,"Schone, P (通讯作者)，Inst Social Res, PB 3233 Elisenberg, N-0208 Oslo, Norway.",iha@samfunnsforskning.no; psc@samfunnsforskning.no,,,,,,,23,0,1,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2013,66.0,3,,,,,342,364,,10.1111/kykl.12025,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,180WZ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321631200002,0

The experiment is designed to study whether reciprocity can be observed when efficiency gains or strategic motivations are not present, i.e. when sending money in the first round is due to certain types of distributional preferences. We ask how second round dictators response to first round dictators' kind or unkind actions. We separate between three types of reciprocity. Direct reciprocity occurs when the second round dictator responses directly to the first round dictator. A second round dictator shows indirect reciprocity when s/he is aware of the first round play, has not taken part in it, but yet reacts to the first round dictator's action. In generalized reciprocity, the second round dictator has taken part in the first round play but responses to someone else than the first round dictator. Our results show evidence of strong reciprocity in all three cases. Further, in the experiment, direct and generalized reciprocity are equally intense. An unexpected result Is that intentions do not seem to play a role in our setting. Further, we found no evidence for social influence affecting individual behaviour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, we study the Connecticut Clean Energy Communities (CCEC) program that provides mostly symbolic rewards in the form of municipal photovoltaic installations in proportion to the number of households that voluntarily purchase green electricity. We find that the program causes a 22 % increase in the number of households purchasing green electricity in CCEC municipalities. The pattern of results suggests that the CCEC leads to the mobilization of community-based recruitment campaigns that increase signup rates by up to 700 % around the period of initial qualification. We also find that a change in the marginal incentive created by the program has little consequence on signup behavior. The implication for policy is that community-based incentives can be effective, but the size of the subsidy itself appears less important. Finally, simple calculations based on CCEC up-front costs reveal upper-bound, cost-effectiveness measures of $570 per household signup, 6.7 per kilowatt-hour of annual green-electricity demand, and $113 per ton of annual carbon-dioxide emission reductions.","[Jacobsen, Grant D.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Kotchen, Matthew J.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Kotchen, Matthew J.] Natl Bur Econ Res, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Clendenning, Greg] NMR Grp Inc, Somerville, MA 02144 USA",University of Oregon; Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Jacobsen, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, 128 Hendricks Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",gdjaco@uoregon.edu; matthew.kotchen@yale.edu; gclendenning@nmrgroupinc.com,,,,,,,24,16,17,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

First, we construct a theoretical model where pharmacies can persuade patients with a brand-name prescription to purchase a generic version instead. We show that pharmacies' substitution incentives are determined by relative margins and relative patient copayments. Second, we exploit a unique product level panel data set, which contains information on sales and prices at both producer and retail level. In the empirical analysis, we find a strong relationship between the margins of brand-names and generics and their market shares. This relationship is stronger for pharmaceuticals under reference pricing rather than coinsurance. In terms of policy implications, our results suggest that pharmacy incentives are crucial for promoting generic sales. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To reduce carbon emissions a country reduces consumption of its own good. The direct effect of reducing its own consumption is that consumption declines and with it utility. However, reducing carbon emissions also lowers global temperatures and that increases utility. The trade-off between these two effects determines the incentive for countries to reduce carbon emissions. We find that larger countries are more likely to participate because a given percentage reduction in output will result in a larger reduction in global temperatures. Longer time horizons also lead to greater willingness to participate. The presence of international trade makes carbon reduction agreements more likely because reducing the output of your own (export) good has a positive terms of trade effect which reduces the cost of output reduction.

Incomplete exchange rate pass-through significantly affects the Tobin's Q channel in each country compared with the case of complete exchange rate pass-through. We explore whether different specifications of monetary policy enhance social welfare. Regardless of the degree of home bias, a monetary policy rule that stabilizes domestic asset prices attains preferable outcomes to several alternative policy rules considered in our analysis. Notably, there are large gains from employing a domestic asset price rule when the home bias is large. A monetary policy rule that stabilizes the asset prices of both countries results in worse outcomes. Our simulation results suggest that stabilizing asset prices is important in an open economy with incomplete exchange rate pass-through. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we study the macroeconomic aftermath of large exchange rate appreciations. Using a sample of 128 countries over the period 1960-2008, we identify 25 episodes of large nominal and real appreciations shocks. We use narrative identification of exogenous appreciation episodes and study the macroeconomic effects in a dummy-augmented panel autoregressive model. Our results indicate that exchange rate appreciations tend to have strong effects on current account balances. Within 3 years after the appreciation event, the current account balance on average deteriorates by three percentage points of GDP. This effect occurs through a reduction of savings without a meaningful reduction in investment. Real export growth slows down substantially, but the output costs are small and not statistically significant. All these effects appear somewhat more pronounced in developing countries.","[Kappler, Marcus] ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Reisen, Helmut; Turkisch, Edouard] OECD Dev Ctr, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Schularick, Moritz] Free Univ Berlin, John F Kennedy Inst, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Free University of Berlin,"Turkisch, E (通讯作者)，OECD Dev Ctr, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",edouardturkisch@hotmail.com,,,,,,,61,24,26,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Since the beginning of this financial crisis of 2008-2009, South Africa experienced a significant increase in its household debt to income ratio. In the main, this paper investigates the prominent factors contributing to the rise in the level of household debt in South Africa. Specifically, we construct a model for South African household debt through the application of a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). We employ quarterly time series data throughout the timeline 1985 Q1 to 2012 Q1 and all the econometric tests are analyzed using the statistical software package EViews 7. Our results confirmed the existence of a long run cointegrating relationship between household debt and other macroeconomic determinants. Increasing household debt was found to be significantly affected by positive changes in consumer price index, gross domestic product and household consumption. Also, house prices and household savings were found to positively contribute to a rise in household debt but this relationship was found to be statistically insignificant. Alternatively, household borrowing was found to be significantly and insignificantly affected by negative changes in income and prime rate, respectively. Ultimately, the existence of a long run cointegrated relationship enabled us to build an error correction model for household debt which will facilitate future forecasting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate statistically significant endogenous consumption effects between a youth and a parent. Lower relative prices tend to increase intakes, particularly in the case of vegetables; however, the statistical significance of these effects is marginal.

We consider a political economic theoretical framework, with actuarially fair and unfair early retirement schemes, and derive a political equilibrium with positive social security contribution rates and early retirement. A reduction in the wages in youth, consistent with the recent labor market trends since the massive introduction of temporary jobs, induces workers to postpone retirement, andin the unfair systemleads to lower contribution rates. A reduction in the growth rate of the economy has opposite effects on the retirement decisions, leadingin the unfair systemto more early retirement. Aging induces a negative income effect, but has also an opposite political effect on social security contributions and retirement decisions. For an actuarially fair social security system, we provide conditions for the political effect to dominate; in an unfair scheme, numerical simulations confirm a slight predominance of the political effect, as contribution rates increase.

After the failed experiment with private financial intermediation in the 1990s, Russia migrated towards a banking system consisting of three - rather than two tiers and featuring core institutions controlled by the state directly or indirectly. This evolution is consistent with this country's historical pattern of financial intermediation. It is also in line with recent trends in the real sector of the economy, where public ownership has rebounded over the past decade. The core state- controlled banks have evolved into hybrid institutions, performing two various sets of functions: those of regular commercial banks and of policy banks. We found a similar evolution in China, but not in the transitional economies of central Europe. Institutional matrix theory suggests that, in non-market economies, centralized finance and credit allocation is the dominant institutional form, while private banking activity is complementary.","[Kirdina, Svetlana] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Moscow V71, Russia; [Vernikov, Andrei] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics)","Kirdina, S (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Moscow V71, Russia.",,"Kirdina-Chandler, Svetlana/J-3642-2017; Vernikov, Andrei Владимирович/I-7868-2013","Kirdina-Chandler, Svetlana/0000-0002-9234-8308; Vernikov, Andrei Владимирович/0000-0003-1561-9458",,,,,19,12,12,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The new methodology is used to investigate the causes of stagnating productivity growth in EU business services. The persistence of scale-related inefficiencies is used as an indicator for the effectiveness of market selection. We use a DEA method to construct the productivity frontier by sub-sector and size class, for business services in 13 EU countries. From this we derive scale economies and their development over time. Our results indicate malfunctioning competitive selection. Between 1999 and 2005 we observe a persistence of scale diseconomies, with scale efficiency falling rather than growing over time. In panel regressions we find the distance to the productivity frontier (within and between size classes) to be significantly explained by regulatory policies that hamper entry and exit dynamics and labour adjustment, and by a lack of import penetration and domestic start-ups. The results suggest that policy reform and more market openness may have positive productivity effects. This holds for business services itself, but also wider, because of business services' large role in intermediary production inputs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Kox, Henk L.

Modeling a tax competition race between two countries competing for a population of mobile firms, we show that in equilibrium, the high-wage country charges a lower tax than the low-wage country. Moreover, under tax competition the high-wage country attracts more firms than in a setting without taxation. Exploiting exogenous variation in labor cost differentials induced by the breakdown of communism in eastern Europe, we find that tax policies are in line with the model prediction. Our most conservative estimates suggest that a one dollar increase in the compensation cost differential (in prices as of 2000) triggers a cut of the statutory corporate income tax rate by about one percentage point.

As population size increases, aggregate consumption of private goods goes up and marginal utility of income falls. This explains the positive relationship between population size and public good provision. Any technological changes in the production of private goods are shown to be neutral to the aggregate provision of public good.

It was written in what we would like to call the classic Hicks-Kaldor mode, i.e. relying on ingenious diagrammatic techniques for expository purposes, and, indeed, developing an innovative model of the trade cycle where interaction of monetary and real forces were modelled in terms of elements common to the classic nonlinear endogenous models of these two pioneers. In this paper we reconsider the analytical contents of Hudson's classic, and its expository technique, in the light of later, mathematical, approaches to the same topic. It is a clear example of how a mathematical reading and reformulation of an economically motivated geometric method proves fruitful in furthering the frontiers of economic analysis. Our conclusion is that there is still much to be gained in the expository style adopted by Hudson, especially when viewed mathematically; but, more importantly, there are innovative suggestions and still relevant reflections on theorising and understanding actual performances of advanced industrial economies. Above all Hudson's classic is permeated with the policy underpinnings of a rich model of the trade cycle.","[Ragupathy, V.; Zambelli, Stefano] Univ Trento, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Velupillai, K.

Privatisation developed differently in former socialist countries: in some countries, the process has been completed fully, while in other countries, it has been completed only partially. In addition to differences in the dynamics of privatisation across countries, privatisation evolved differently across sectors within a single national economy. Moreover, the birth of the Croatian state and a shift towards the market economy evolved in specific conditions due to the Croatian War of Independence, which placed an additional burden on the transition process which is difficult as it is. This paper examines the privatisation of hotel industry in Croatia, its dynamics and its results in the light of two facts. Firstly, tourism represents a major driver of economic growth in Croatia, and secondly, the resources available within this sector are very specific. The paper therefore evaluates the justification of privatisation by studying various facets of economic performance among privatised and non-privatised enterprises, e.g. their level of productivity and structure of debt, with special emphasis on the performance of mixed enterprises. The study results indicate a far better performance of private firms in relation to state-owned enterprises. More precisely, better economic performance is noticed in enterprises where state holds minority ownership interest than in enterprises where state holds majority ownership interest.","[Skuflic, Lorena; Turuk, Mladen] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; [Crnjac, Jana] Univ Pula, Pula, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skuflic, L (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.",,"Turuk, Mladen/K-5409-2019; Škuflić, Lorena/H-7577-2018","Turuk, Mladen/0000-0002-1204-3855; Škuflić, Lorena/0000-0002-2978-2902",,,,,15,4,4,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In this political guide for economists, we look at the creation of the euro within the bigger picture of European integration. How and why were European institutions established? What is European integration really about? We address these questions from a political-economy perspective, building on ideas and results from the economic literature on the formation of states and political unions. Specifically, we look at the motivations, assumptions, and limitations of the European strategy initiated by Jean Monnet and his collaborators of partially integrating policy functions in a few areas with the expectation that more integration will follow in other areas in a sort of chain reaction toward an ever-closer union. The euro with its current problems is a child of that strategy and its limits.","[Spolaore, Enrico] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Spolaore, Enrico] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Tufts University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Spolaore, E (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",enrico.spolaore@tufts.edu,,,,,,,71,37,40,0,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We characterize ex post incentives using an appropriate monotonicity condition and reformulate the problem in such a way that the choice of an allocation rule can be separated from the choice of the payment rule. Central to the analysis is the formulation of a regularity condition, which gives a recipe for the optimal mechanism. If the problem is regular, then an optimal mechanism can be obtained by solving a combinatorial allocation problem in which objects are allocated in a way to maximize the sum of virtual valuations. We identify conditions that imply regularity using the techniques of supermodular optimization.","[Uelkue, Levent] ITAM, CIE, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico; [Uelkue, Levent] ITAM, Dept Econ, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Ülkü, L (通讯作者)，ITAM, CIE, Av Santa Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico.",levent.ulku@itam.mx,,,,,,,22,8,10,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

While the civil war resulted in the ending of 42 years under Muammar Gaddafi rule, the economic legacy as represented by the costs of reconstruction efforts is enormous. While the freeing up of tens of billions of dollars of frozen assets may be the key to the country's short-term rehabilitation, longer-term reconstruction, growth and stability will fundamentally depend upon rehabilitating the country's oil sector. Interestingly, this rehabilitation will also have a wider global impact. This paper uses a deterministic dynamic macroeconomic model to analyse the effects upon key macroeconomic variables of a recovery in Libyan oil production to levels that existed prior to the revolution. Model simulation results indicate that additional oil revenue brings about: an increase in government revenue, increased government spending in the domestic economy, increased foreign asset stocks and increased output and wages in the non-oil sector. However, increased oil revenue may also produce adverse consequences, particularly upon the non-oil trade balance, arising from a loss of competitiveness of non-oil tradable goods induced by an appreciation of the real exchange rate and increased imports stimulated by increased real income. Model simulation results also suggest that investment-stimulating policy measures by the government produce the most substantive longer-term benefits for the economy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent with the classical rational choice paradigm, our theory requires that endogenous expectations be replaced with a general-measurable function of the observable states of the model, to be determined optimally. This forecasting function is derived as the regime-independent feedback control minimizing the mean-square deviation of the equilibrium path from the corresponding perfect-foresight state motion (the reference model). We show that model reference adaptive expectations always generate a rational expectations equilibrium, irrespective of the presence of nonlinearities and/or imperfect information. Under equilibrium indeterminacy, this forecasting mechanism enforces the unique mean-square stable solution producing nearly perfect-foresight dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I shed light on the contribution of coincident government mortgage market interventions by examining home loan benefits granted under the World War II and Korean War GI Bills. Veterans' benefits increased home ownership rates primarily by shifting purchase earlier in life, explaining 7.4 percent of the overall 1940-1960 increase, and 25 percent of the increase for affected cohorts. A rough extrapolation suggests that broader changes in mortgage terms can explain 40 percent of the 1940-1960 increase.","[Fetter, Daniel K.] Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA; [Fetter, Daniel K.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Wellesley College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Fetter, DK (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, 106 Cent St, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA.",dfetter@wellesley.edu,,,,,,,65,53,68,1,18,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

This is one of the few studies that analyze soft information outside the banking industry. We find that soft information proxies, such as the descriptive complexity of a pitch, depress prices, in particular for less experienced writers, supporting the common industry view that high concept (short and simple) screenplays sell better. Hard information (measurable experience) variables are priced as well. We also find that large studios shun soft information, whereas small companies handle it better, as predicted by most theories. In the last part of the paper, we find that, surprisingly, buyers seem to be able to forecast the eventual success of a project based upon the purchased script, paying more for screenplays which will eventually culminate in more successful movies.

The cointegration relation implies a common stochastic trend of variables, which are modeled in the empirical analysis.

An expert provides a theory that, conditional on each finite history of outcomes, supplies a probabilistic prediction about the next outcome. However, there may be false experts who have no knowledge of the data-generating process and who deliver theories strategically. Hence, empirical tests for predictions are necessary. A test is manipulable if a false expert can pass the test with a high probability. Like contracts, tests have to be computable to be implemented. Considering only computable tests, we show that there is a test that passes true experts with a high probability yet is not manipulable by any computable strategy. In particular, the constructed test is both prequential and future-independent. Alternatively, any computable test is manipulable by a strategy that is computable relative to the halting problem. Our conclusion overturns earlier results that prequential or future-independent tests are manipulable, and shows that computability considerations have significant effects in these problems.","[Hu, Tai Wei; Shmaya, Eran] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Hu, TW (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",t-hu@kellogg.northwestern.edu; e-shmaya@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,15,4,5,0,5,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The capital and financial account equilibrium conditions, rather than exogenous rules, constrain the current account balance. International capital flows which balance the current account are constrained by supply-and-demand equilibrium conditions on the market for international debt securities, under portfolio managers' optimizing behavior. The asset-liability structure of the financial portfolio is endogenous, and it is possible for a country-agent to have negative net financial assets. In simulations, the interaction of portfolio choices with trade supply and demand behavior leads to endogenous sign reversals in some current account balances, and it results in a different allocation of investment among regions, compared to a model with exogenously determined current account balances.

Using highly detailed register data on blue collar workers it is shown that refugees' employment lags that of natives basically for their whole life time in Sweden. Time in Sweden reduces drastically the unemployment days, though from very high initial levels. Refugees from culturally distant Iran/Iraq and Horn of Africa experience considerably more days in unemployment than refugees from the less distant Eastern Europe and Latin America. The differences are large during the first 20 years in Sweden but some convergence occurs thereafter. Following a business cycle upturn this paper finds that the reduction of refugees' unemployment is half of that of natives'. Since refugees arrive at different ages, high numbers of unemployment days are recorded also for relatively old refugees with the highest number for those above 30.","Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Lundborg, P (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",per.lundborg@sofi.su.se,,,,,,,14,73,78,7,71,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

It argues that before 2007 the flaws in the institutional organisation of the process of coordination between monetary and fiscal policy affected the cyclical and growth operation of the economies. After then, they have contributed to intensifying the conflicts among national and European authorities. The conflicts have curbed policy reactions, held back the interventions of the ECB, as occurred to the Federal Reserve during the crisis of 1929, and favoured the speculative attacks. The conclusion is that the organisation of the area must be reformed to allow its institutions to effectively pursue the objectives for which they were created, i.e. to protect the citizens from the instability of the international financial markets. As has been done in monetary policy, the reforms must reduce the uncertainty on the actual conduct of national policies and transform the defensive attitudes of the different actors of the process into a positive search for the most effective policy for the whole area.","[Panico, Carlo; Purificato, Francesco] Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Giurisprudenza, I-80134 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Panico, C (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Giurisprudenza, Via Mezzocannone 16, I-80134 Naples, Italy.",panico@unina.it; francesco.purificato@unina.it,,"PURIFICATO, Francesco/0000-0003-2744-9126",,,,,60,23,27,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Nevertheless, it attracts many young people. The number of students exceeds the available jobs by far. A potential explanation for this puzzle is that artistic work might result in exceptionally high job satisfaction, a conjecture that has been mentioned at various times in the literature. We conduct the first direct empirical investigation into artists' job satisfaction. The analysis is based on panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Survey. Artists on average are found to be considerably more satisfied with their work than non-artists, a finding that corroborates the conjectures in the literature. Differences in income, working hours, and personality cannot account for the observed difference in job satisfaction. Partially, but not fully, the higher job satisfaction can be attributed to the higher self-employment rate among artists. Suggestive evidence is found that superior procedural characteristics of artistic work, such as increased variety and on-the-job learning, contribute to the difference in job satisfaction.","[Steiner, Lasse; Schneider, Lucian] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Steiner, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Hottingerstr 10, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",lasse.steiner@econ.uzh.ch; lucian.schneider@uzh.ch,,,,,,,54,37,45,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

In particular, they seek to answer the following question: how do we find densely connected subsets of nodes within a credit network? The question is relevant for policy, since these subsets are likely to channel any shock affecting the network. As it turns out, a reliable answer can be obtained with the aid of complex network theory. In particular, the authors show how it is possible to take advantage of the ''community detection'' network literature. The proposed answer entails two subsequent steps. Firstly, the authors verify the hypothesis that the network under study truly has communities. Secondly, they devise a reliable algorithm to find those communities. In order to be sure that a given algorithm works, they test it over a sample of random benchmark networks with known communities. To overcome the limitation of existing benchmarks, the authors introduce a new model and test alternative algorithms, obtaining very good results with an adapted spectral decomposition method. To illustrate this method they provide a community description of the Japanese bank-firm credit network, getting evidence of a strengthening of communities over time and finding support for the well-known Japanese main ''bank'' system. Thus, the authors find comfort both from simulations and from real data on the possibility to apply community detection methods to credit markets. They believe that this method can fruitfully complement the study of contagious defaults. Since network risk depends crucially on community structure, their results suggest that policy maker should identify systemically important communities, i.e. those able extend the initial shock to the entire system.

Toyota's recall crisis in 2010 illustrates how recalls can affect a large number of American drivers and the defects connected to them can result in loss of life and serious accidents. However, in spite of the increase in public concern over recalls and the loss of property and life attached to them, there is no empirical evidence of the effect of vehicle recalls on safety. This paper investigates whether vehicle recalls reduce accidental harm measured by the severity of injuries in vehicle accidents. The results of our analysis show that if a recall for a new-year model is issued, then the severity of injuries of accidents continuously diminishes during the first year after the recall, something we do not find among cars not subject to recalls. This is because defects are repaired over time but also because drivers react by driving more carefully until the defects are fixed. To minimize the losses attached to having dangerously defective cars on our roads, both quick and timely recall issuance are needed and more detailed information on defects should be delivered to owners of defective vehicles. The latter can be made possible through simple but important policy changes by the U.S. government regarding recall information sharing with drivers and insurance companies.

Estimations based on state panel data suggest that the introduction of joint custody led to an increase in marriage rates, an increase in overall fertility (including a shift from nonmarital to marital fertility), and an increase in divorce rates for older couples. Accordingly, female labor market participation decreased. Further, male suicide rates and domestic violence fell in treated states.

It is also higher for dizygotic twins than for non-twin siblings brought up at different times and therefore experiencing varying family circumstances.","[Nicoletti, Cheti] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Rabe, Birgitta] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of York - UK; University of Essex,"Nicoletti, C (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",,"Nicoletti, Cheti/J-8955-2019","Nicoletti, Cheti/0000-0002-7237-2597; Rabe, Birgitta/0000-0001-8632-0088",ESRC [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,27,26,27,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2013,80.0,318,,,,,197,218,,10.1111/ecca.12010,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,107ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316208300001,0

We use several econometric models with multiple stationary time series to discover that there is a strong relationship between the fundamentals, such as German electricity prices and gas and coal prices, with the price of EUA.

To do so, we introduce a Dutch disease model with downward rigidities in government spending to revenue shocks. This model leads to a decoupling between real exchange rate and commodity export price movement during busts. We test our model's theoretical predictions and underlying assumptions using panel data for 32 oil-exporting countries over the period 1992 to 2009. Results are threefold. First, we find that changes in current spending have a stronger impact on real exchange rate compared to capital spending. Second, we find that current spending is downwardly sticky, but increases in boom time, and conversely for capital spending. Third, we find limited evidence that fiscal rules have helped reduce the degree of responsiveness of current spending during booms. In contrast, we find evidence that fiscal rules are associated with a significant reduction in capital expenditure during busts while responsiveness to booms is more muted. This raises concerns on potential adverse consequences of this asymmetry on economic performance in oil-exporting countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model reproduces labor market dynamics after a positive increase in productivity: hours fall, nominal wages hardly react, and real wages go up with some delay.

We focus on a specific set of agency problems that is of first-order importance for these funds: that is, the direct involvement of political leaders in the management process. We show that sovereign wealth funds with greater involvement of political leaders in fund management are associated with investment strategies that seem to favor short-term economic policy goals in their respective countries at the expense of longer-term maximization of returns. Sovereign wealth funds face several other issues, like how best to cope with demands for transparency, which can allow others to copy their investment strategies, and how to address the problems that arise with sheer size, like the difficulties of scaling up investment strategies that only work with a smaller value of assets under investment. In the conclusion, we discuss how various approaches cultivated by effective institutional investors worldwide - from investing in the best people to pioneering new asset classes to compartmentalizing investment activities - may provide clues as to how sovereign wealth funds might address these issues.","[Bernstein, Shai] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lerner, Josh] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Schoar, Antoinette] MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lerner, Josh; Schoar, Antoinette] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bernstein, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",shaib@gsb.stanford.edu; josh@hbs.edu; aschoar@mit.edu,"keola, souksaychay/O-1193-2014",,,,,,30,97,107,3,56,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Policy-makers may wish to adjust estimated preferences if these reflect past inequities in health funding rather than the true production possibilities. Response shift might be quantified by changing the context of the choice task. The ICECAP-O valuation exercise achieved this by asking a binary choice holistic decision of respondents, in addition to the case 2 best-worst choice task among the five attributes. Answers to the former are more likely to be subject to response shift since they involve traditional trade-offs. Answers to the latter reflect only 'relative disutility' of various impairments. Individual level estimates for the latter were substituted into the design matrix in a series of latent class analyses of the binary choice data. The five attribute mean estimates from the conditional logit regressions are the attribute importance parameters and represent the (internal) scaling factors that respondents use in transforming their case 2 BWS utilities into ones relevant in multi-profile decision-making. The principal hypothesis was that there were classes of respondents who used identical attribute importance weights. Rejection of this hypothesis prompted testing of secondary hypotheses that respondents placed lower importance on control (independence) and role (doing things that make you feel valued), those attributes thought to be most vulnerable to response shift. Results showed that 17% of respondents never traded, in most cases illogically given their own ICECAP-O responses, and were dropped. Tests of parameter-equality suggested at least 30% and possibly as many as 53% of respondents for whom there is a single statistically significant attribute importance factor and 64 (21%) of respondents for whom there is a single statistically non-significant attribute importance factor. The remaining 9% of respondents had a moderate status-quo bias (preference for own life). These results do not provide strong support for response shift in the ICECAP-O valuation sample. There is only very limited support for differential weights for the five attributes when moving into a traditional DCE framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The four oil-related CDS spread indexes are responsive to VIX in the short- and long-run, while no index is sensitive to SMOVE which, in turn, unilaterally assembles risk migration from VDC The 2007-2008 Great Recession seems to have led to localization and less migration of credit and market risk in the oil-related sectors.

In fact, different authors use the same terms to denote quite disparate concepts and ideas, impeding rather than advancing progress in understanding natural resource management. As but one example, there is hardly a concept that has been as fundamentally misunderstood as that of the commons. That misunderstanding notwithstanding, there is another, less familiar, more common and even more fundamental one: the persistent confusion of possession with property. This article argues that the distinction between possession and property is of particular importance for comprehending the meaning of institutional shifts from one resource management regime to another.

Using a calibrated general-equilibrium model, a benchmark with a fertility constraint in place is compared to a counterfactual experiment without the fertility constraint. The results indicate that the implementation of the one-child policy promotes the accumulation of human capital and increases per capita output. In addition, the policy leads to different welfare effects across generations and skill groups. The initial generation would benefit from relaxing the one-child policy, but the following generations would be hurt. A redistribution effect between skilled and unskilled workers is also observed. These findings demonstrate that focusing solely on GDP per capita as a measure of economic well-being paints an incomplete picture of the welfare consequences of population policies.

The latter may, for instance, alleviate the collective action problem of the joint use of rights of way and other physical infrastructures. In the empirical exercise, using data for OECD and EU countries for the period 1999-2006, we examine whether centralization promotes new telecommunications markets, in particular the broadband access market. The existing literature, in the main, claims it does, but we find no support for this claim in our data.

A labor market reform is modeled as a permanent structural change in the labor market institutions. We find that changes in the domestic labor market can have drastic welfare implications for both countries. Welfare improvements are observed when a worker (a firm) is more likely to find a job (a worker) or when jobs are less likely to be destroyed. In addition, labor market heterogeneity has sizeable effects on the level of welfare gains. The more flexible the foreign labor market, the higher its welfare. Finally, we show that (i) the way the monetary authorities conduct their policy has negligible welfare effects and (ii) matching frictions can offset the negative effect of price rigidities in the economy.","[Poilly, Celine] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium; [Sahuc, Jean-Guillaume] EDHEC Business Sch, F-59057 Roubaix, France",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Sahuc, JG (通讯作者)，EDHEC Business Sch, 24 Ave Gustave Delory, F-59057 Roubaix, France.",jean-guillaume.sahuc@edhec.edu,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Using different copula models, our findings suggest positive average dependence and extreme symmetric independence that is consistent with interdependence and no contagion effects between the EUA and crude oil markets. The implication of this result for EUA-oil portfolios points to the existence of diversification benefits, hedging effectiveness, and value-at-risk reductions. The EUA market is therefore an attractive market for investors in terms of diversifying market risk and reducing downside risk in crude oil markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Panel data technique is used in this study, as the data set contains cross-sectional units over several time periods. Panel data control for cross sectional heterogeneity by observing individual firm and reduces the risk of biasness and collinearity among variables. The result of panel regression indicates that audit committee activity and committee member's independence are significantly associated to audit fee levels, consistent with the argument that audit committees complement the work of external auditors in monitoring management. In contrast, chief executive officers (CEO) pay incentives both short term and long term neither complement nor substitute for audit effort in disciplining Pakistan's firm management. Further results on the full sample of firms reveal significant differences in determinants of audit fees between the years examined. Finally, the results of control variables suggest a significant association between non-audit fee, board meetings, ROA (return on assets), sales and firm foreign operations with the audit fees in the selected market.

It finds that the Korean IPO market spread is clustered at 3.5% on moderately sized IPOs (i.e., IPOs between 9 (KRW billion) and 33 (KRW billion)), representing a 74% overall rate that increases gradually over time. Our empirical results refute the collusion theory. The Korean IPO market is characterised by low concentration. A 3.5% spread does not represent abnormal profits relative to other IPOs. Cost saving (i.e. an inverse U shape) is confirmed by the use of 3.5% offers. Our results also show that factors typically related to underwriters and issuers such as proceeds, secondary sales, earnings and reputation affect the 3.5% spread used both positively and negatively. Thus, consistent with the efficient contract theory, the use of a 3.5% contract becomes less likely as proceeds increase but becomes more likely for IPOs of over 35 (KRW billion). On the one hand, the use of a 3.5% contract becomes more likely the more insider shares an IPO contains and the higher the volatility of the stock return (an insignificant factor). On the other hand, the use of a 3.5% contract becomes less likely the higher the earnings and debt (insignificant factors) and the more reputable the underwriter. Underpricing in 3.5% IPOs is conditioned by proceeds and secondary sales, not reputation and IPO market concentration. Thus, we conclude against the cartel theory that there is no collusive conspiracy in the Korean IPO market and that underwriters do not reap excess profits from 3.5% IPOs.","[Seo, Ji-Yong] Sangmyung Univ, Div Business Adm, Seoul 110743, South Korea; [Sohn, Pando] Dong A Univ, Dept Business Adm, Pusan, South Korea",Sangmyung University; Dong A University,"Seo, JY (通讯作者)，Sangmyung Univ, Div Business Adm, 7 Hongji Dong, Seoul 110743, South Korea.",jyseo@smu.ac.kr,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

It also adds one group - managers - that generally is not considered as being a stakeholder group. Here it is suggested that control of this stakeholder group holding the executive power should be a central topic for stakeholder theory. The article supports the common idea that the business discourse and the moral discourse should be integrated in stakeholder theory, not treated as separate tracks. The issue is then how to mold the substance for such integration. This article argues that the priority of stakeholders implies a distancing from general altruistic philosophy that argues against - not for - giving special consideration to the company's stakeholders. Both the moral substance and the business potential lie in the special and close relationship with these partners. Stakeholder theory needs a more compatible ethical theory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The practical advantages of our results imply that the potential one or more change points of an ARFIMA process can be detected via recursive predictive tests based on AR regression, even though the exact order of the ARFIMA (p, d, q) is unknown.

Exploiting a sample of more than 600 political leadership durations in up to 152 countries, we find that both institutions and resource types matter for the effect that natural resource wealth has on political survival: (i) wealth derived from natural resources affects political survival in intermediate and autocratic, but not in democratic, polities; and (ii) while oil and non-lootable diamonds are associated with positive effects on the duration in political office, minerals are associated with negative duration effects.

The so-called 'third country' effect is present if adding this term changes the bilateral volatility estimates that are found when external volatility is omitted. This study examines US exports to Hong Kong for 143 industries, and imports from Hong Kong for 110 industries, and finds two key results. First, expected inflation due to Hong Kong's dollar peg leads to increased US exports in a large number of industries. Second, comparing our results with those of a previous study shows strong evidence of a 'third country' effect, especially for US imports. Nonparametric tests suggest that these effects differ by sector: for both exports and imports. Manufacturing industries that enjoy a large trade share are less likely to experience this effect once external volatility is incorporated into the analysis.","[Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Hegerty, Scott W.] Canisius Coll, Wehle Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Buffalo, NY 14208 USA; [Xu, Jia] St Marys Coll Maryland, Dept Econ, St Marys City, MD 20686 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",bahmani@uwm.edu,"Hegerty, Scott/AAF-5659-2020",,,,,,30,13,15,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We estimate a common factor model in which the six factors correspond to supply of funds, financial intermediation, credit demand, aggregate uncertainty, real economic activity, and inflation. We use a simple model of financial intermediation to motivate restrictions on the factor loadings designed to identify supply of funds, uncertainty, credit demand, and financial intermediation factors. We find that the supply of funds and financial intermediation factors explain most of the variation in interest rates spreads, while the financial intermediation and credit demand factors typically contribute to most of the fluctuations in credit quantity variables. For credit indicators, the 2008-2009 financial crisis appears to be largely due to a decline in the financial intermediation. However, this decline in financial intermediation seems to have originated from output and uncertainty shocks, rather than shocks to financial intermediation itself.","[Zeng, Zheng] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Balke, Nathan S.] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Balke, Nathan S.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX USA",University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; Southern Methodist University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Zeng, Z (通讯作者)，Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",zzeng@bgsu.edu,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The developed market economies are 35 countries with the highest values of the composite Human Development Index (HDI). The first part provides the methodology of measure overall globalization using the composite Index of Globalization KOF 2011. The second part introduces the way of measuring competitiveness - the Global Competitiveness Index 2011, its methodology and results. The third part compares indices and scores together, analyzes them, and confirms or refutes the empirical relationships between the Index of Globalization and its dimensions and the Global Competitiveness Index. It is possible to conclude from the results achieved in the study that globalization remains primarily a very strong and powerful economic phenomenon: more globalized countries are more developed. A statistically significant association between globalization and global competitiveness was demonstrated but in the case of the most developed countries the possibilities of globalization to promote their competitiveness seems to be exhausted. There are weak links between social globalization and political globalization and global competitiveness in the developed market countries. The economic dimension of globalization is not statistically significantly correlated with global competitiveness in the developed market economies. For developed market economies with a high degree of engagement in international relations, technological and innovative processes are possibilities to increase their global competitiveness.","[Bednarova, Pavla] Tech Univ Liberec, Econ Fac, Dept Econ, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,pavla.bednarova@tul.cz,"Bednářová, Pavla/HLP-4977-2023",,,,,,8,2,2,1,5,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,27,35,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300003,0

Considering the rapid growth of the Internet in the last few years, the conventional computer aided learning is, as a consequence, gradually evolving towards web-based computer aided learning, mainly due to ease of access, ease of use and the extremely wide spreading of internet networks - specially mobile or wireless. Since one of the main objectives for improving the e-learning domain is represented by the development of new time and cost effective solutions, the paper focuses on describing a web-based e-testing system used for official examination or for self-testing in universities, consisting in two modules that correctly segregate the functional elements a teacher and a student need (they, of course, have completely different roles inside the application). Taking into consideration the metadata standardization model, it is essential to analyze the mechanism of integrating the questions inside the system. The proposed application contains linear and dynamic algorithms for generating the tests, based on either static or randomly question adding mechanisms that allow users to manage, plan and prepare all the assessments they need by adding simple rules and operate changes over them in real time. The system is already being used in one university and, as all gathered user experience feedback reveals, it is a well built, robust and attractive application.","[Butucea, Diana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,dianabutucea@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2013,,,,,,,233,238,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BGV43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324282200042,0

The novel goal is linking mathematical constructs and observable behavior to mechanistic details of neural circuitry. Several complementary methods are used. An initial insight from neuroscience is that distinct systems guide choice: Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning (learning) of state-value and response-value associations, overlearned habits, and model- (or goal-) directed value that requires deliberation. These systems can differ economically from rational choice-for example, habitual choices have low utility and price elasticities, whereas model-directed values are often constructed preferences. Neuroeconomics also provides evidence of situations in which utility maximization either works well (in simple binary choice) or benefits from the introduction of behavioral constructs. Neuroeconomics is well equipped to guide the theory of how choices depend on mental states, such as fear or cognitive load. Examples include extensive studies of risk and time preference, finance, and neural decoding of private information.","CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",California Institute of Technology,"Camerer, CF (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",camerer@hss.caltech.edu,,,,,,,140,30,36,1,99,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4605-8,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

In the treatment in which the strong agent makes a non-binding, cheap talk bonus offer to the weak agent, this unenforceable promise doubles the rate of joint high effort compared to a baseline with no promise. The strong agents most frequently offered to split the gains of the high effort equally, but actually delivered this amount only about one-quarter of the time. An explicit and enforceable contract offer performs substantially better, increasing the frequency of the most efficient outcome by over 200% relative to the baseline. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Tunisia has established its current currency convertibility and has taken steps to achieve full convertibility of the dinar by gradually removing capital flow obstacles. Theoretical and empirical literature suggests that capital account liberalization generally leads to capital inflow in developing countries, generating an appreciation in the real exchange rate (RER) and thus a loss in competitiveness. However, preserving competitiveness is a key challenge for monetary authorities, who have to conciliate these two apparently conflicting purposes. To guide their decisions with respect to the prescribed procedure for capital liberalization, we need to evaluate the impact of each capital component flow on the RER. The question is addressed by analysing impulse response functions (IRF) resulting from a VAR model, covering 1970 to 2010 and gathering the RER, its fundamental determinants, monetary variables and an estimated capital control (CC) variable. Results show that a relaxation of CC overappreciates the RER to its long-term level, and liberalizing portfolio investment is the most compromising for competitiveness.","Univ Tunis El Manar, Fac Econ & Management Sci Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis-El-Manar,"Charfi, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis El Manar, Fac Econ & Management Sci Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.",fatmamarrakchicharfi@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,4,,,,,515,540,,10.2298/PAN1304515M,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,178BO,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321419300005,0

However, in forecasting processes, it is difficult to deal with high-order stock data, because it is hard to give a proper weight to each period of past stock price, reduce data dimensions without losing stock information, and produce a comprehensive forecasting result based on stock data with nonlinear relationships. Additionally, there are two more drawbacks to past time-series models: (1) some assumptions (Bollerslev, 1986; Engle, 1982) about stock variables are required for statistical methods, such as the autoregressive model (AR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA); (2) numeric time-series models have been presented to deal with forecasting problems for stock markets, but they can not handle the nonlinear relationships within the stock prices. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a new time series model, which employs the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator to fuse high-order data into the aggregated values of single attributes, a fusion adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) procedure, for forecasting stock price in Taiwanese stock markets. In verification, this paper employs a seven-year period of the TAIEX stock index, from 1997 to 2003, as experimental datasets and the root mean square error (RMSE) as evaluation criterion. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model is superior to the listing methods in terms of root mean squared error. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to the literature it uses both demand and supply-side explanations for the analysis. An entrepreneurial subsidy policy to encourage entrepreneurship in autarky financed by a lump sum tax on the rich is not very effective in unequal economies since it hardly impacts the welfare. When trade is opened up in the luxury good sector of such an economy the sector might cease to exist. In such a scenario, the rich people being the sole consumers would reap the entire benefits of globalization via low price of the imported luxury good. The paper highlights that the crucial question is: 'how to globalize' rather than 'whether to globalize' and suggests policy measures to make globalization inclusive.","[Chowdhury, Sahana Roy] Indian Council Res Int Econ Relat, India Habitat Ctr, New Delhi 110003, India; [Chowdhury, Sahana Roy] Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, Kolkata, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata,"Chowdhury, SR (通讯作者)，Indian Council Res Int Econ Relat, India Habitat Ctr, Core 6A,4th Floor,Lodi Rd, New Delhi 110003, India.",sahana.isi@gmail.com,"Roy Chowdhury, Sahana/AAR-8184-2021","Roy Chowdhury, Sahana/0000-0002-1589-484X",,,,,17,5,5,0,41,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

A proper understanding of location patterns of innovative outputs can enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of national and European placed-based innovation policies. Building on the literature on the knowledge production function, the aim of this article is to explain the observed differences in the production of innovative outputs across European regions. Our main research question is whether geographical proximity and social capital are important vehicles of knowledge transmission in Europe. Several other variables are used to control for structural differences across European regions.

To do this we unify two strands of the empirical literature on this topic, one that relies on demand data and one that relies on subjective evaluations of wellbeing. This way we are able to employ the strengths of both kinds of information. Equivalence scales are not identified from demand data alone. This is because changes in demographics could affect wellbeing directly, i.e., in ways that are not revealed by changes in behavior. The demand-based literature rules out such effects a priori and restricts parameters that measure them. In this paper we do not rely on such restrictions and instead use subjective evaluations of wellbeing as an additional source of information. Because demand data are highly informative about some of the other parameters of the model its use increases efficiency. This becomes critical once we specify complex preference structures that allow for the equivalence scale's dependence on price and utility. Our model nests the typical models used in the subjective and the demand literature and we are able to test down both kinds. We find evidence for direct utility effects. This rejects the validity of some of the restrictions applied by the demand literature within the Indonesian context. We estimate equivalence scales that are of reasonable magnitude and decrease in utility. We also find that the scales increase in the food to nonfood price ratio for poor households, whereas we do not find price dependence for more affluent households. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, having access to foreign, and to a lesser degree, domestic equity markets is found to reduce these negative effects at significant levels.

They have to demonstrate fine resource management and accountability in support of clearly defined and feasible goals, even more important during periods of financial crisis and budget cuts. From a managerial perspective, Intellectual Capital (IC) management and reporting can contribute to making the best use of available resources (Elena et al., 2011). In the realm of practice, an increasing number of universities and research centres in Europe have developed IC management and reporting models. However, their application has been, so far, based on voluntary basis. An important effort to provide a homogenous and comprehensive framework for managing and reporting IC in universities was developed by the Observatory of European Universities (Sanchez et al., 2009 and OEU, 2006). The Austrian case is a remarkable example since it has established a law that includes the compulsory delivery of an Intellectual Capital Report (Wissensbilanz) (Altenburger and Schaffhauser-Linzatti 2006) by its publically funded universities since 2006. Currently, a project is being carried out in Romania, with the ultimate goal of preparing a guideline for applying IC reporting in Higher Education institutions. A series of Mutual Learning Workshops (MLW) are being organised (started in October 2012) by the Rumanian Agency for Education, Research and Innovation together with international experts. Learning from the Austrian case and from other initiatives, the MLWs are meant to discuss between researchers, practitioners, managers and policy-makers, how to design a guideline for IC reporting for Romanian Universities considering the national context and current reforms of the university system. The guideline should be also applicable for universities in other countries undergoing a reformation process of the university system. The paper will give an overview of international experiences with IC reporting of universities. As a practical case, the paper will present the first results of this on-going project and reflect on which methods are appropriate to report on IC in different types of European universities and to what extent is it possible and advisable to standardise IC models.","[Elena, Susana] European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain; [Leitner, Karl-Heinz] AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Elena, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain.",susana.elena-perez@ec.europa.eu; karl-heinz.leitner@ait.ac.at,,"Leitner, Karl-Heinz/0000-0002-3885-9465",,,,,22,3,3,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,132,141,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000016,0

The optimal divestment entails the sale of assets whose costs are close to the post-divestment price (i.e. they are price-setting). A divestment of this type can be several times more effective in reducing prices than divestments of low-cost assets.

On the contrary, with active policies we show that profitable mergers are welfare enhancing due to lower gross pollution, higher consumer surplus, lower tax costs and efficiency gains.

We find evidence of a somewhat dominant effect of the CROBEX and CETOP stock indices on the BELEX 15 stock index across a range of frequencies.

The financial variables used are: M0, M1, M2, M3, lending rate, 3-month Treasury bill rate, term spread, real effective exchange rate, real stock prices, dividend yield and non-food credit growth. We observe that that, at times, in-sample and out-of-sample predictive ability of the financial variables tend to coincide. We find relatively strong evidence of out-of-sample predictability for at least one of the horizons for M0, M1, M2, M3, the lending rate and real share price growth rate. The term-spread and dividend yield are added to the list when weaker versions of the out-of-sample test statistics are considered as well. Given that we consider a large number of financial variables, when we checked the significant results by accounting for data mining across the 11 financial variables, majority of these results ceases to be significant, with only M0, M1 and M2 retaining some of its predictive ability.","[Gupta, Rangan; Ye, Yuxiang; Sako, Christopher M.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",Rangan.Gupta@up.oc.za,,"Ye, Yuxiang/0000-0003-1534-0713",,,,,31,5,5,0,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Within the government sector, we pay special attention to Germany's fiscal equalization mechanism. For pre-unification Germany, we find that about 19% of a shock is smoothed by private factor markets, 50% is smoothed by the German government sector, and a further 17% is smoothed through credit markets. For the post-unification period, 1995 to 2006, the relative importance of the smoothing channels has changed. Factor markets contribute around 50.5% to consumption smoothing.

For adopted sons born in Sweden, we have access to the criminal records of both the adopting and biological parents. This allows us to assess the relative importance of pre-birth factors (genes, prenatal environment and perinatal conditions) and post-birth factors for generating parent-son associations in crime. When considering the extensive margin, we find that pre-birth and post-birth factors are both important determinants of sons' convictions and that mothers and fathers contribute equally through these two channels. At the intensive margin, pre-birth factors still matter, however post-birth factors appear to dominate. In particular, adopting mothers appear to matter most for the probability that sons will be convicted of multiple crimes and/or be sentenced to prison. We find little evidence of interaction effects between biological and adoptive parents' criminal convictions. Having more highly educated adoptive parents, however, does appear to mitigate the impact of biological parents' criminality. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, we use the vector auto-regression model to examine the interest rate pass-through into bank and building society interest rates in 2004 - 2011.

Auditors have employed more sophisticated digital analysis such as Benford's law, as part of their fraud detection processes. This study investigated the window dressing behaviour among firms in the US marine industry. The findings of the study suggest that window dressing is a significant practice among the marine firms. However, the extent of the pervasiveness of such behaviour is less severe among marine firms than among all publicly-listed firms in the entire US economy, suggesting that the quality of financial statements of marine companies is higher than the overall population of public companies.","[Lin, Fengyi] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Coll Management, Dept Business Management, Taipei 10608, Taiwan; [Lin, Fengyi] Chihlee Inst Technol, Dept Accounting Informat, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taipei University of Technology,"Lin, FY (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Coll Management, Dept Business Management, 1,Sec 3,Chung Hsiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.",linfengyi.tw@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,2,4,4,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In such an environment, PMGs increase the value of buying the good and therefore increase consumers' reservation prices. This increase is so large that even after accounting for the possible execution of PMGs. firms' profits are larger in an equilibrium where PMGs are offered than in an equilibrium without PMGs.

If this happens, fewer females are employed in high-end jobs (a glass ceiling effect). The average productivity of female workers may at the same time be higher than that of male workers.

In his evaluation affirms' offers for a public contract the agent has some discretion to favor a firm in exchange for a bribe. While unilateral commitment to transparency is never incentive compatible, under some circumstances a voluntary but conditional commitment mechanism can eliminate corruption. A low quality firm may prefer not to commit only when the agent's discretion is strong and the market's profitability is small. In that situation, the high quality firms commit when commitment decisions are kept secret, but some conditions on firms' beliefs are required when commitment decisions are publicly announced. A mechanism combining both conditionality and a reward (a transparent selection advantage that needs not be large) allows complete elimination of corruption.

Despite initial optimistic expectations there has so far been no significant economic growth, which would give a clear signal that the economic crisis is over. Recently, there have been increasing opinions that the main cause is poorly set economic policy, which is too focused on fiscal discipline, thereby limiting investments that would kick-start the economy of the European Union. According to some authors, however, Economic Policy Uncertainty, which has a negative influence economic growth, also plays an important part. The aim of this paper is to use panel regression to prove or disprove this hypothesis on the example of 5 largest European economies. The analyses suggest that statistically significant negative effect of economic policy uncertainty on economic growth was demonstrated in 2000-2012 in the developed EU economies, which corresponds to the results of analyses carried out by the authors for the United States.","[Kotlanova, Eva] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Kotlánová, E (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",kotlanova@opf.slu.cz,,,,,,,18,2,2,5,12,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-248-3095-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,140,147,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393737200014,0

They can increase the timeliness and accuracy of patient care. Their impact should be assessed from several perspectives: the quality and availability of medical information, quality of diagnostic decisions and health care services. On the one hand, information technologies have a potential to improve health care quality, safety and patient satisfaction, but, on the other hand, require financial investment. Every investment project needs to specify its goals and measurable benefits. Indirect costs which are difficult to measure might be challenging in the evaluation of financial investment. Healthcare information technologies can improve the quality of health care, support treatment and consequently contribute to patients' health. Examples of such systems are patient monitoring technologies. The benefits of these technologies are for the patient, health care facility and personnel. They decrease the number of personnel and errors. These devices can provide information directly to a healthcare information system. Considering all of the above, this paper aims to present a procedure of how to measure the benefits of non- standard healthcare systems. Based on statistically proven facts, we identify problems that can eliminate financial investment in non- standard healthcare systems. These investments are balanced by the benefits to both the medical staff and patients.","[Kunstova, Renata; Potancok, Martin] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kunstova, R (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",kunstova@vse.cz; xpotm03@vse.cz,"Potancok, Martin/C-4324-2019","Potancok, Martin/0000-0002-7613-9290",,,,,39,11,12,0,14,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Balances are much less inert than is typically found in Western Europe. However, there is clear evidence of a fiscal loosening in the run-up to EU accession. This began in 1999 in larger central European countries, often identified as 'front-runners'. The other seven began loosening in 2001, after the Nice Treaty was agreed.

In order to analyze the transmission mechanisms of Operation Twist, the limit solution of nonhomogeneous linear equations is introduced. The impact of Operation Twist on the U.S. and world economies is studied quantitatively by selecting 24 non-equal frequency series of variables belonging to 7 categories: Treasury yield, quantity of loans of commercial banks, unemployment rate, inflation rate, GDP, exchange rate and trade. The TRAMO/SEATS technique is used to identify the structural change points of these series and make predictions. Results show that, in general, the effects of Operation Twist are not quiet ideal. Since Operation Twist is a policy designed to fine-tune the economy, the macroeconomic regulators should establish an organic system integrating monetary as well as fiscal policies, strengthening its coordination of interests between different nations so as to ensure better regulation on the macro-economy.","[Ma, Li; Duan, Zhongyuan; Yu, Huadan] Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Ma, L (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",manny@whu.edu.cn; 501281805@qq.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,13,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Consequently, significant indication for potential investors to not invest in the company, would exist if the best practice of corperate governance (including the system of Corporate Governance recommended by CCG) is not applied.","[Maurovic, Ljiljana; Hasic, Tea] Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Maurovic, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula, Croatia.",ljmaurov@efpu.hr; thasic@unipu.hr,,,,,,,11,4,4,1,9,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,1848-9664,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The government lowered the amount for obligatory contributions transferred to private open pension funds and redirected the difference to notional accounts. A Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to compare two variants of the Polish pension system. In the previous system, the premium was accumulated in open funds, and interest was earned as a result of real financial market mechanisms. In the current system, the premium is split into two flows, where one flow accumulates on the notional account and is indexed according to the rules defined by legislation. Assuming the same macro-economic circumstances, the economic implications of the new and previous pension system strategies were formulated from an individual worker's perspective. Terminal value and risk associated with investment were used to compare both systems. Simulation analysis for the 2nd pillar was run for this portion of the contribution, which had previously been transferred to private open funds but is now deposited into two different accounts (i.e., public and private). The experiments are conducted simultaneously for two variants of the pension systems, and the identical values of macro-economic forecasts are defined as the input data. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Agents receive initial private information and select an action out of a choice set under uncertainty in each of infinitely many periods, observing the history of choices of their neighbors. Choices are made based on a common behavioral rule. Conditions under which rational learning leads to global consensus, local indifference, and local disagreement are characterized. In the general setting considered, rational learning can lead to pairs of neighbors selecting different actions once learning ends while not being indifferent among their choices. The effect of the network structure on the degree of information aggregation and speed of convergence is also considered, and an answer to the question of optimal information aggregation in networks is provided.

To this end, we present and estimate two systems of structural equations with error components through which gross income inequality determines different fiscal policy outcomes, which subsequently affects the evolution of economic growth and net income inequality. The empirical results, obtained using an unbalanced panel data of 21 high-income OCDE countries during the period 1972-2006, suggest that gross income inequality is a significant determinant of fiscal policy outcomes. Additionally, the results show that distributive expenditures and direct taxes may produce significant reductions in GDP growth and net income inequality reflecting the standard efficiency-equity trade-off associated to certain fiscal policy measures. Finally, the results also indicate that the most adequate fiscal policy strategy in a context of fiscal consolidation is to cut non distributive expenditure, since this could increase GDP growth while reducing income inequality.

We find that ISPs' investments are driven by the trade-off between softening consumer price competition and increasing revenues from CPs. Specifically, investments are higher in the non-neutral regime because it is easier to extract revenue through appropriate CP pricing. On the other hand, participation of CPs may be reduced in a non-neutral network due to higher prices. The net impact of non-neutrality on social welfare is determined by which of these two effects is dominant. Overall, we find that the non-neutral network is always welfare superior in a walled-gardens model, while the neutral network is superior in a priority lanes model when CP-quality heterogeneity is large. These results provide useful insights that inform the net-neutrality debate.","[Njoroge, Paul; Ozdaglar, Asuman] MIT, Lab Informat Decis Syst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Stier-Moses, Nicolas E.] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Stier-Moses, Nicolas E.] Univ Torcuato Di Tella, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Weintraub, Gabriel Y.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Weintraub, Gabriel Y.] Columbia Business Sch, Risk & Operat Div, New York, NY USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Columbia University; Universidad Torcuato Di Tella; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Columbia University,"Njoroge, P (通讯作者)，MIT, Lab Informat Decis Syst, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",njoroge@mit.edu,"Stier-Moses, Nicolas/R-5236-2018","Stier-Moses, Nicolas/0000-0001-6380-1516",,,,,40,42,43,3,29,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The multiple empirical evidence obtained in this study lets us conclude that the main explanatory theories of firm investment cannot be considered mutually exclusive in explaining the investment of Portuguese fitness SMEs, since: 1) they adjust investment as a function of sales, corroborating the assumptions of Neoclassical theory; 2) cash flow is an important financial resource for investment, corroborating the assumptions of Free Cash Flow theory; and 3) external finance, namely debt, is a restrictive determinant of investment, which corroborates the assumptions of Agency theory. Besides these results, we find that growth opportunities and government subsidies are positive determinants of investment in Portuguese fitness SMEs, and the financial crisis of 2008 has a negative influence on investment in Portuguese fitness SMEs. The financial crisis of 2008 also means greater relative importance of cash flow and government subsidies for increased investment, and debt for diminished investment, in fitness SMEs.","[Nunes, Paulo Macas; Serrasqueiro, Zelia] Beira Interior Univ, Management & Econ Dept, Covilha, Portugal; [Nunes, Paulo Macas; Serrasqueiro, Zelia] Univ Evora, CEFAGE Res Ctr, Evora, Portugal; [de Carvalho, Pedro Guedes] Beira Interior Univ, Sport Sci Dept, Covilha, Portugal; [de Carvalho, Pedro Guedes] UTAD Univ, CIDESD Res Ctr, Vila Real, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior; University of Evora; Universidade da Beira Interior; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro,"Nunes, PM (通讯作者)，Beira Interior Univ, Management & Econ Dept, Covilha, Portugal.",macas@ubi.pt,"Serrasqueiro, Zélia/J-5662-2014","Serrasqueiro, Zélia/0000-0003-1761-5426",,,,,58,2,4,0,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Our confidence interval allows us to reject even small amounts of same-race bias in passing patterns. We find some evidence of own-race bias in situations where the outcome of a particular play is less important. Our findings suggest that high levels of interracial cooperation can occur in a setting where workers are operating in a highly visible setting with strong incentives to behave efficiently.

Most of the research work in this area focuses on enterprises and organizations, although there is an effort, especially lately, to provide answers concerning development of national economy. This theory has a lot of potential to create new insights and it is expected that it becomes even more incorporated into mainstream economics. This paper is an attempt to incorporate intellectual capital theory insights into endogenous growth theory as part of modern macroeconomics. In this paper, simple AK endogenous growth model is used as a basis. The intellectual capital growth model presented here also takes A or Total Factor Productivity as an average total productivity but with one fundamental distinction. It is using the logic of Calculated Intangible Value and/or Knowledge Capital Earnings by Baruch Lev where higher than average returns indicate higher intellectual capital. The model presented here applies this logic to Total Factor Productivity. In cases where TFP is equal to the average, the intellectual capital performance is also equal to the average, and the model is with constant returns as the AK model. But in cases where TFP is larger than average, the intellectual capital performance is also better than average, and the model is with increasing returns, and in cases where TFP is less than average, the intellectual capital performance is worse, and the model is with diminishing returns. The most important implication of the model is that savings and investments have a long-term effect on growth only if intellectual capital performance is equal or better than average. If intellectual capital is worse than average there is no such an effect because of diminishing returns. In such a situation the policy should be first to increase intellectual capital to at least average performance and then to increase investments.","Univ Banja Luka, Fac Econ, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Banja Luka (UNIBL),"Pucar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Banja Luka, Fac Econ, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg.",stevo.pucar@blic.net,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,333,343,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000038,0

I provide a sufficient condition for its existence and sufficient conditions for its nonexistence. When the minimum type is strictly positive, a non-trivial equilibrium may exist, but it must be pooling. I provide a sufficient condition for the existence of such an equilibrium.

A specific question that is addressed throught this study is what is the threshold energy consumption rate for Sweden. In addition, we try to answer a question, if there is statistical significant relationship between energy consumption and growth. In this paper, we use econometric methodology of the threshold estimation proposed by Hansen (2000). Hansen, develops new tests for threshold effects, estimates the threshold parameter, and constructs asymptotic confidence intervals for the threshold parameter. The primary idea behind the Hansen test for threshold estimation is that an exogenously given variable, called threshold variable, is used to split the sample in two groups or regime, which can or cannot be a regressor. This theory derives the asymptotic distribution of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates of the threshold parameter.","Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Stjepanovic, S (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",sstjepan@unipu.hr,"Stjepanović, Saša/AAL-4337-2020","Stjepanović, Saša/0000-0003-1938-3681",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,1848-9664,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We make use of unique primary data from 494 firms, and focus on three important industries, the resource-based food and beverages industry, the labour-intensive textiles and wearing apparel industry, and the more high-technology electronics and electrical appliances industry. We find that FDI plays a role in ISO14001 adoption, especially FDI from Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and ISO14001-rich countries. Other important determinants include firm size, experience with ISO9000, and production of intermediate products. Firms faced with fewer obstacles to environmental improvements such as those facing lower costs, having more understanding of the procedure, and with greater access to the appropriate technology are also more likely to adopt ISO14001.","[Kontoleon, Andreas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Tambunlertchai, Kanittha] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",University of Cambridge; Chulalongkorn University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Kontoleon, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",ak219@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,24,26,3,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A Conditional Bargaining Problem is the conjoint extension of a Bargaining Problem, conditional on the fact that the individuals have agreed on a measurement event. Within this context, Subjective Mixture methods are especially powerful. These techniques are used to characterise versions of the Nash and the Kalai-Smorodinsky solutions. This approach identifies solutions based only on the individuals' tastes for the outcomes. It is therefore possible to do Bargaining theory in almost complete generality. The results apply to Biseparable preferences, so are valid for almost all non-expected utility models currently used in economics.","Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Webb, CS (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",craig.webb@manchester.ac.uk,"Webb, Craig/I-2237-2019","Webb, Craig/0000-0001-8814-7653",,,,,43,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Few studies have examined the possibility of nonlinearity in inflation and tested nonlinear stationarity of the inflation rates. This study thus intends to fill the gap. This study utilizes the tests for nonlinearity along with the unit root tests that allow for nonlinearity in the variables to examine the stationarity of inflation rates of 12 European countries that formed the Euro Zone (EZ) later in the sample period. The results suggest that the majority of these countries' inflation rates can be characterized by mean reversion during the floating exchange rate period. Many of them appear to be nonlinear stationary. This finding is essential in conducting applied economic studies for these countries, when constructing models whose validity relies on whether or not inflation is stationary. The results of this study also imply that shocks to inflation have a transitory effect on inflation in the euro area. Therefore, it would be less costly in exercising the policies of disinflation for the monetary authorities of the euro area than for those of the countries with nonstationary inflation.","Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Zhou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, 1 UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",su.zhou@utsa.edu,,,,,,,30,12,12,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The tax increase is initially completely capitalized, but some of the burden is shifted to labor on the transition path and in the steady state. Several new welfare effects are uncovered including an effect involving the parameters of the social security program.

According to proponents, they can circumvent chronic barriers to effective public sector environmental regulation in developing countries. But eco-certification programs will have limited effects on producers' environmental performance if, as one would expect, they select for those already meeting certification standards. Rigorous evaluations of the environmental effects of eco-certification in developing countries that control for selection bias are rare. We use plant-level data on more than 80,000 Mexican facilities to determine whether ISO 14001 series certification of environmental management systems boosts regulatory compliance. We use propensity score matching to control for nonrandom selection into the program. We find that plants recently fined by environmental regulators were more likely to be certified, all other things equal, but that certified plants were subsequently fined just as often as similar uncertified plants. These results suggest that in Mexico, the ISO 14001 program attracts dirty plants under pressure from regulators-not just relatively clean ones-but does not have a large, lasting impact on their regulatory compliance.","[Blackman, Allen] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Blackman, Allen] Environm Dev Ctr Cent Amer, Turrialba, Costa Rica",Resources for the Future; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza,"Blackman, A (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",blackman@rff.org,,,,,,,54,24,29,0,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In a sense, the subtitle of the book explains well what this volume is all about - why economics cannot explain the modern world. An important modifier would be - modern economics cannot explain the modern world - because much of what McCloskey argues is the resurrection of an older argument that was associated with classical liberal political economists from Smith, Bastiat, Mises, Hayek and Friedman. Fundamentally, she reasserts the power of ideas to shape the world. McCloskey's narrative is simple and compelling - materialist stories (whether technological, genetic, or institutional) do not work; incentive based stories do not provide a complete picture of why some countries grew rich while others remained poor, let alone for the exact timing for the divergence in the wealth and poverty of nations with the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th century. McCloskey proposes that incentive based explanations must reside within a broader narrative that addresses values and beliefs, as well as institutions, technologies, and material conditions. In doing so, McCloskey paves the way for a true behavioral approach to a political and economic inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, both the nature of pluralism and the concrete role ascribed to pluralist thinking for the development of economics have been somewhat contested, pointing to a lack of (widely agreed) conceptual foundations. This paper addresses this conceptual gap by proposing a framework for interested pluralism as a guideline for organizing heterodox economic research, in particular, as well as economic debates, in general. In essence, interested pluralism suggests replacing the traditionally invoked demarcation criteria between different economic traditions by a set of rather ecumenical pluralist principles, whose concrete implications for economic research we discuss.","[Dobusch, Leonhard] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Management, Berlin, Germany; [Kapeller, Jakob] Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, Linz, Austria",Free University of Berlin; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Dobusch, L (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Dept Management, Berlin, Germany.",,"Dobusch, Leonhard/J-6573-2019; Kapeller, Jakob/AAP-1109-2020","Dobusch, Leonhard/0000-0002-5448-4683;",,,,,99,63,63,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

One potential reason behind this is that the share of elderly in a community is endogenous, and it is very difficult to disentangle the effects of individuals aging in place from that of dynamic Tiebout sorting. The point of this paper is to carefully document the degree to which aging in place has occurred in the American suburbs, and to estimate the degree to which it has influenced school finance once the initial settlers of these suburbs were no longer the parents of school-aged children. We hand-match data from the 1950 and 1960 Censuses of Population and Housing to more recent data to link postwar suburban development to later school finance. Using a novel method for identifying the causal effects of aging in place, we find that the percentage of elderly adults in a school district is negatively related to the level of support for public schooling, and that this is particularly true for school districts in metropolitan areas where the school-aged population is more heavily nonwhite relative to the elderly population.

This paper contains 795 individual banks in 39 countries covering the period 19992006. Foreign ownership is calculated using bank level data as a proxy for the degree of foreign bank ownership in the banking sector. First, we find that foreign bank ownership is associated with a decrease in both the profitability and overhead expenses of the domestic bank after applying the system panel Generalized Method of Moments model. Second, a lower level of economic development of the host country enhances the positive effects of foreign bank ownership on the income, profit and cost of domestic banks. Third, financial development plays an important role in determining the effect of foreign bank ownership. Fourth, while the use of aggregate foreign ownership data may provide us with a big picture, it may not explain why individual banks in the same country perform differently, which this study will answer.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Meng-Fen] Natl Taiwan Inst Technol, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Dai, Hua-Wei] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; National Taiwan University of Science & Technology; National Chung Hsing University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,56,12,13,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Although little empirical work exists in this area, often presenting indirect evidence, the theory is divided over the effect of family risk over saving and wealth accumulation. By using data from the Italian Survey on Households Income and Wealth, we build a probabilistic model to assess the probability of marital splitting, and then we insert this probability as a distinct or interacted regressor, in a statistically consistent way, into a linear model of consumption. Furthermore, we study the differential behaviour, in terms of consumption/saving choices, of couples experiencing marital splitting over the subsequent 2 years. The main result of our analysis is that family disruption risk generates precautionary savings, reducing current consumption. In fact, according to our estimates, on average, the risk of divorce generates an amount of additional yearly precautionary savings of around 800 euros at constant prices of the year 2000, which represents 11% of overall household savings.","[Ventura, Luigi] Dipartimento Econ, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Pericoli, Filippo] Italys Minist Econ & Finance, Dept Treasury, Rome, Italy; [Pericoli, Filippo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, CEIS Econ Fdn, Rome, Italy; [Ventura, Luigi] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; Sapienza University Rome,"Ventura, L (通讯作者)，Dipartimento Econ, Circonvallaz Tiburtina 4, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",luigi.ventura@uniroma1.it,,"Ventura, Luigi/0000-0003-2760-7868",,,,,39,9,11,2,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

It employs both regression and power analysis (Cohen's d effect size statistic). The paper analyzes the impact of internal and external marketing orientation, business innovation and HRM performance indicators on firm performance (added value per employee) in an economic crisis context. The effect size statistic further analyzes the link between the basic employee-firm relationship and the perceived importance of trust and long-term relationships with the firm in the eyes of the customer; as evaluated by respondent firms' managers. The results of our analysis confirm the increasing importance of relationship orientation in an economic crisis. On the one hand both internal and external relationship orientation are closely linked, while on the other hand, only the internal relationship orientation (internal marketing) seems to be directly linked to firm performance in our OLS regression model. This does not by imply that external market orientation is not important, but may indicate that is acts more as a buffer, not as a productive source of firm performance in an economic crisis. In addition, the results of our effect size estimation show how market oriented firms also display significantly higher scores on the basic employee-firm relationship; indicating a significant effect size relationship between the two constructs. More interestingly, this effect size is almost identical for 2008 and 2010, but considerably higher for 2009, when the economic crisis in Slovenia reached its climax. In the end, a series of implications for marketing and management theory and practice are discussed.","[Raskovic, Matevz; Moerec, Barbara; Brencic, Maja Makovec] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Brencic, Maja Makovec] Slovenian Mkt Assoc, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Raskovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",matevz.raskovic@ef.uni-lj.si,"Raskovic, Matevz/AFV-3565-2022; Morec, Barbara/J-1820-2017","Raskovic, Matevz/0000-0001-5311-4050; Morec, Barbara/0000-0003-4764-8122",,,,,57,3,3,1,28,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We apply the concept of 'trade in tasks' of Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg to analyze the nature of North-toSouth manufacturing outsourcing. As a conceptual innovation, we carefully distinguish two different implicit assumptions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model: 'factor immobility' versus 'task inseparability'. We show that outsourcing, as a form of trade in tasks, essentially attains ` task separability' while apparently retaining factor immobility, thus rendering the traditional Heckscher-Ohlin framework obsolete for analyzing current North-South trade. We argue that this change in the nature of trade calls for new thinking in economics and public policy-making.","[Tang, Xiang] Peking Univ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Tang, X (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",tangxiang_pku@163.com,,,,,,,46,2,2,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We develop an algorithm for estimating spillovers using panel data that addresses both of these problems. The key innovation is to allow the spillover to operate through the fixed effects of a student's peers. The only data requirements are multiple outcomes per student and heterogeneity in the peer group over time. We first show that the nonlinear least squares estimate of the spillover parameter is consistent and asymptotically normal for a fixed T. We then provide an iterative estimation algorithm that is easy to implement and converges to the nonlinear least squares solution. Using University of Maryland transcript data, we find statistically significant peer effects on course grades, particularly in courses of a collaborative nature. We compare our method with traditional approaches to the estimation of peer effects, and quantify separately the biases associated with selection and spillovers through peer unobservables.","[Arcidiacono, Peter] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Foster, Gigi] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Kinsler, Josh] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",Duke University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Rochester,"Arcidiacono, P (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",psarcidi@econ.duke.edu; gigi.foster@unsw.edu.au; natalie.goodpaster@gmail.com; joshua.kinsler@rochester.edu,"Foster, Gigi/D-5297-2019","Foster, Gigi/0000-0002-1588-0202",,,,,48,50,63,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.
