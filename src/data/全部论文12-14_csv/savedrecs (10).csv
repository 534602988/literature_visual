Whereas their growth strategies and their integration in the world production system has been widely analyzed from different angles, it seems that there has been less attention paid to how integration in the global economy (and openness) is related to integration in the regional economy. Firstly, we will therefore propose a series of indicators to better assess the interdependence between the BRIC economies and the economies of their respective 'regions', be it institutionalized or de facto regions. Secondly, we will present a series of statistical tests to evaluate the relationship between globalization and regionalization. This should further clarify the implications of a scenario of sustained growth and globalization in the BRICs for the patterns and levels of production and trade in their regions of influence. Among the findings of this article, model estimations suggest that the relative globalization of the BRICs is related to more global sourcing by the BRICs, enhanced regional competitiveness of the BRICs, and more asymmetry and trade dependence from the perspective of the regional trade partners.

I use the concentration of campaign contributions from Political Action Committees to proxy for special interests' capture of US Senate candidates from 1980 to 2002, and compare the reaction of voters to increases in concentration in two different types of media markets: in-state media markets and out-of-state media markets. Unlike in-state media markets, out-of-state markets focus on neighboring states' politics and elections. Thus, if citizens punish political capture, increases in concentration of special interest contributions to a particular candidate should reduce his vote share in in-state counties relative to the out-of-state counties, where the candidate receives less coverage. I find that a one-standard deviation increase in concentration of special interest contributions to incumbents reduces their vote share by about 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points in in-state counties relative to the out-of-state counties. Robustness checks suggest that these results are not driven by omitted Senator characteristics or by differences between in-state and out-of-state counties along dimensions other than the media environment.

The global factors of indicators are correlated across asset classes, but the market-and country-specific components of indicators are still significantly large to suggest diversification benefits of both multi-asset and multi-country portfolios.

This is supported by the European Semester with all its mechanisms, including the analysis of macroeconomic imbalances and processing of in-depth reviews. This article summarizes the results of the in-depth reviews to assess the macroeconomic situation in the EU countries during the post-crisis period (2012 - 2014).","[Navratil, Boris] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,boris.navratil@vsb.cz,"Navrátil, Boris/L-4114-2019; Navratil, Boris/AAZ-6885-2020","Navratil, Boris/0000-0001-6958-6204",,,,,6,1,1,0,3,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Expanding the empirical basis from 78 to 300 000 industrial firms, I overturn the previous result and show that wage determination in the average firm fits the international norm. Exploring subsamples of firms I also point to a likely source for the conflicting findings: firm size is positively correlated with the average wage in private firms, but negatively correlated with the average wage in the state-owned sector. These novel results could guide future studies aiming to understand the sources of the firm size wage premium, and, in particular, studies that target the largest industrial labor market in the world.","[Rickne, Johanna] Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Rickne, Johanna] IFN, Res Inst Ind Econ, New York, NY USA",Columbia University,"Rickne, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA.",johanna.rickne@ifn.se,"Rickne, Johanna/AEY-8084-2022","Rickne, Johanna/0000-0002-3733-7606",,,,,37,2,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2014,22,1,,,,,67,82,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12053.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AJ0RS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337364000004,0

In other words, interactions among individuals, firms and institutions produce the transmission of knowledge in the form of knowledge spillovers. In the case of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS), one of their main features is their capacity to adapt and disseminate tacit knowledge. Despite a variety of recent studies have contributed to improve one's understanding of the tacit knowledge diffuser role of KIBS, there has been little investigation on the spatial effects related to the presence of KIBS. This article represents an attempt to combine in one model knowledge spillovers and availability of a group of KIBS, those called high-tech services (HTS). The objective is to shed some light on the role of both geographical and technological distance in the knowledge diffusion process and to show how HTS account for a significant part of the regional innovation process using an extended knowledge production function (KPF) framework applied to 240 European regions from 23 countries. Two major findings of this analysis are following. For one part, inter-regional knowledge flows are key elements for explaining regional innovation performance, although technological proximity is far less important than geographical proximity. For the other part, regions with a higher specialization in HTS, or proximate to regions with a higher presence of HTS, tend to innovate more, mainly because HTS can improve their capacity to transform knowledge into innovation.","Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Rodriguez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Campus Univ Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",m_rodrig@ugr.es,"Rodríguez, Mercedes/HTL-9989-2023; Rodriguez, Mercedes/H-5517-2015","Rodriguez, Mercedes/0000-0002-0524-7737",,,,,47,16,17,0,55,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Overall, we identify a number of firm-level factors, including involvement in risk-taking behaviour, more extensive use of networking channels, and efficient use of various business strategies as potential sources to increase the competitiveness of Latvian companies. Company owner-managers, however, tend to be more productive in using available human resources, and are satisfied with the availability of physical resources in addition to having a strong export orientation. The study also indicates various shortcomings in the external environment which, as perceived by respondents, are a burden for competitive entrepreneurship activities in the Latvian market, In this light, albeit of an exploratory nature, this study can be used as a source for evidencebased entrepreneurship policies in Latvia and other countries of Central and Eastern Europe.","Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, Dept Business Management, Riga, Latvia",,"Sauka, A (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, Dept Business Management, Riga, Latvia.",arnis.sauka@sseriga.edu,"Sauka, Arnis/ABF-7869-2021",,,,,,51,10,11,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

This large-scale field experiment uses a HoltLaury mechanism to elicit the preferences of 1,289 randomly selected subjects from 94 villages covering six out of seven agro-climatic zones across rural Uganda. As in previous studies, we find evidence of risk aversion and loss aversion among most subjects. In addition, we find significant heterogeneity in risk attitudes across agro-climatic zones. Especially, the farmers in the agro-climatically least favourable zone, the uni-modal rainfall zone, are the most risk-averse, loss-averse and impatient. We also find significant relationships between risk attitudes and village-level predictors such as the distance to town and the road conditions. After controlling for the village-level factors, we find that the level of schooling still positively correlates with the individuals level of loss tolerance and patience. The main results are not altered by allowing for probability weighting in subjects choices. Overall the results provide clear evidence that within one country there may be significant regional variations in risk and time attitudes. We conjecture that the agro-climatic conditions that affect farmers livelihoods may also affect their risk and time preferences, and village-level development in infrastructure could improve the household perception of investment-related policies.","[Tanaka, Yuki] Embassy Japan Uganda, Kampala, Uganda; [Munro, Alistair] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Tanaka, Y (通讯作者)，Embassy Japan Uganda, POB 23553, Kampala, Uganda.",phd08006@grips.ac.jp,"Munro, Alistair/A-3714-2009","Munro, Alistair/0000-0003-3918-8701",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25101002] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,40,26,31,0,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

By examining the organisational, information and communication technologies (ICT) and research and development (R&D) component of intangibles, we observe a decrease in the value of R&D capital that was to some extent offset by an increase in the value of ICT capital. We find that organisational workers had higher productivity than the average worker. The dynamic of change was gradual during the transition. The capitalisation of intangibles implied an average 4.5% increase of gross domestic product (GDP) for the new member states. Nonetheless, a worrying convergence can be observed between the tangible and the intangible capital. One can thus expect the intangibles have an important role in the future growth in Slovenia and across the European countries, but only if proper attention is devoted to them in terms of policy measures and regulation.","[Verbic, Miroslav; Polanec, Saso] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Verbic, Miroslav] Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Verbic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",miroslav.verbic@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,28,10,10,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Regret-averse preferences are characterized by a modified utility function that includes disutility from having chosen ex-post suboptimal alternatives. The extent of regret depends on the difference between the actual profit and the maximum profit attained by making the optimal production decision had the firm observed the true realization of the random output price. If the firm is not too regret averse, we show that the conventional result that the optimal output level under uncertainty is less than that under certainty holds. Using a simple binary model wherein the random output price can take on either a low value or a high value with positive probability, we show the possibility that the firm may optimally produce more, not less, under uncertainty than under certainty, particularly when the firm is sufficiently regret averse and the low butput price is very likely to prevail.

To begin with, family ownership can indeed reduce agency costs through better aligning the interests of owners and managers. This is a 'determining' effect in that it independently mitigates one source of agency problems. However, altruism combined with self-control problems arising from the highly concentrated ownership often found in family firms can also increase agency costs. This is an 'embedding' effect as it is rooted in the personal relationships within the family firm. Using the Business Longitudinal Database compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that for larger SMEs (those with 20-200 employees), the gains in lower agency costs arising from family ownership are almost completely offset by the losses from altruism and the lack of self-control.","[Xiang, Dong] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China; [Worthington, Andrew C.; Higgs, Helen] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Griffith University,"Xiang, D (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China.",donxiang@gmail.com,,"Worthington, Andrew/0000-0003-4113-9036",,,,,42,7,7,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We use a simple frictionless dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to investigate inflation dynamics under alternative interest rate rules when agents have heterogeneous expectations, and update their beliefs based on past performance, as in Brock and Hommes [Econometrica 65(5), 1059-1095 (1997)]. The stabilizing effect of different monetary policies depends on the ecology of forecasting rules (i.e., the composition of the set of predictors), on agents' sensitivity to differences in forecasting performance, and on how aggressively the monetary authority sets the nominal interest rate in response to inflation. In particular, if the monetary authority responds only weakly to inflation, a cumulative process with rising inflation is likely. On the other hand, a Taylor interest rate rule that sets the interest rate more than point for point in response to inflation stabilizes inflation dynamics, but does not always lead the system to converge to the rational expectations equilibrium, as multiple equilibria may persist.","[Anufriev, Mikhail] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Anufriev, Mikhail; Assenza, Tiziana; Hommes, Cars; Massaro, Domenico] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Assenza, Tiziana] Catholic Univ Milan, Milan, Italy",University of Technology Sydney; University of Amsterdam; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Hommes, C (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Sch Econ, CeNDEF, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",C.H.Hommes@uva.nl,"Anufriev, Mikhail/B-6099-2019; Assenza, Tiziana/A-8644-2016; Anufriev, Mikhail/AAW-5452-2020","Anufriev, Mikhail/0000-0002-1842-6814; Assenza, Tiziana/0000-0001-9547-1574; Anufriev, Mikhail/0000-0002-1842-6814; Hommes, Cars/0000-0002-2260-2665; Massaro, Domenico/0000-0001-9652-1174",,,,,45,64,64,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The SPSM approach classifies the whole panel into a group of stationary and non-stationary series and is able to account for structural breaks, nonlinearity, and cross-section dependence.

Identifying peer effect is complicated by several endogenity problems including self-selection problem, reflective problem and uncontrolled correlated effect. By taking advantage of the special feature of Hukou system and son preference phenomenon in rural China, the endogenity issues are quite reasonably addressed. More specifically, we discover a new and valid instrumental variable for peer's dropout rate: peers' firstborn boy rate. Intuitively, the more the firstborn boy peers, the lower the peers' dropout rate because of son preference and the lower one's own dropout probability due to peer effect. It is found that as peers' dropout rates increase by one percentage point, the child dropout rate would increase by 0.393 to 0.504 percentage points, the corresponding social multiplier effects of peer dropout are from 1.647 to 2.016. It is also found that elder kids and females are more susceptible to peer pressure in dropout decisions. Many other interesting findings are documented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The sample covers 25 countries for the period from January 1998 to December 2009. We find, first, that transparency reduces the bias (the difference between the money market rate and the weighted expected target rate over the contract period) in money market expectations. The effect is larger for countries with no exchange rate peg and countries with low income. Second, an intermediate level of transparency is found to have the most favorable influence on money market expectations: neither complete secrecy nor complete transparency is optimal. Finally, all subcategories of the Eijffinger and Geraats (2006) index lead to a smaller bias in expectations, with political transparency having the largest effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We used data from male employees in Japan (N = 1004) drawn from a panel dataset of career wage records spanning a period of over 30 years. The income history used in this study was based on administrative records; thus, the data were almost free of recall error. Our results show that life satisfaction was more closely associated with a change in lifetime average income or maximum income than with a change in income compared to the previous year, whereas the opposite was true for self-rated health. In addition, life satisfaction tended to resist a decline in response to a fall in income from its average or maximum level, but this was not the case for self-rated health. Furthermore, an income peak experienced in the past made both life satisfaction and self-rated health more sensitive to changes in income, whereas a trough experienced in the past made them less sensitive. These findings suggest that the association of income between subjective well-being and health should be studied further, within a dynamic framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, by focusing on the diversification of imports, we add a missing piece to already analysed export trends. We use highly disaggregated trade statistics (4963 product lines) for 163 countries (1988-2010) and find that, despite differences in levels (imports being typically more diversified than exports, particularly at lower stages of economic development), they follow a similar path of evolution in the development process. Progressing relative diversification (despecialisation) of both import and export structures accompanies economic growth, while re-specialisation is plausible only in case of few specific countries (very rich, small ones, abundant in oil/petrol). We also show that even though while diversifying countries increase the degree of import-export similarity in terms of product categories, imported and exported goods differ in terms of within-product characteristics.

LLS vehicles, such as lottery bonds, are financial instruments that preserve depositors' principal but provide randomized variable returns to these depositors through periodic lottery drawings, in lieu of the regular coupon payments traditionally received by bondholders. This type of asset is very popular in Europe. We note that the framing of LLS instruments is linked to their popularity, and we attempt to elucidate that link and thereby determine the optimal structure of payments for LLS programmes. Our goal is to frame LLS programmes in a manner that both maximizes their investors' satisfaction and preserves their ability to serve as inexpensive sources of capital for their issuers. We demonstrate that the optimal pay-off structure is characterized by a high level of skewness, as investors are willing to accept a decrease in the small and medium prizes of the lottery in exchange for an increase in the grand prize. Thus, to attract a maximum number of depositors, the issuers of LLS programmes should prioritize the jackpot size relative to the other lottery pay-offs and insist on high skewness for the lottery pay-offs relating to the LLS assets.","Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LaRGE Res Ctr, Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Pfiffelmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LaRGE Res Ctr, Strasbourg, France.",m.pfiffelmann@unistra.fr,,,,,,,32,2,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper I simulate a version of the Mortensen-Pissarides (MP) model with wage rigidity and endogenous separation. The model is then able to answer a key question in the literature: can wage rigidity and endogenous separation explain the joint dynamics of unemployment, vacancies and wages? I find that it can. The model generates sufficient volatility in unemployment, the separation rate and the finding rate, 75% of the observed volatility in vacancies, and 70% of the Beveridge curve (the negative correlation between unemployment and vacancies). More substantially, the model matches the volatility of the average wage and generates a response of new hires' wages to productivity and unemployment consistent with key estimates in the literature. I then simulate the model while restricting the separation rate to be constant and show that the model predicts only 70% of the variance of unemployment. I conclude that finding rate fluctuations explain 70% of unemployment fluctuations halfway in between the most prominent estimates in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Crucially, we find that production agglomeration has a positive relationship with firms' productivity, especially for smaller firms.

The results indicate that in the case of hydropower, solar, wind, waste, and biofuels the estimates of fractional integration are higher than 0.5 but less than 1.0 implying nonstationary, but mean reverting behavior. In the case of geothermal and waste the estimates of fractional integration are around 0.5 and in the boundary case between stationarity and nonstationarity. For wood, the estimate of fractional integration is significantly smaller than 0.5 and thus showing stationary behavior with long memory behavior. Furthermore, the study incorporates the presence of breaks in the data with the absence of breaks in hydropower, geothermal, solar, wind, wood, and biofuels, but a single break in the case of waste due to the inclusion of non-renewable waste from non-biogenic sources through 2000.

We find that the gender wage gap declined from 21 % in 2002 to 18 % in 2007. The main determinant of this decline is the relative improvement of women's unobserved characteristics. The decline of the gender wage gap is also due to women having attained more formal education and to a convergence of men's and women's returns to education. Women's improved educational attainments were partly offset by a shift in the demand for skilled workers that disadvantaged unskilled workers, most of whom are women, resulting in a moderate decrease of the gender pay gap over these years.

Transport costs have a negative and significant effect on product quality. The evidence suggests that estimated unit value increases capture product quality upgrading, imports' competition effects drive quality upgrading, and benefits depend on firms' industrial specialization.

We show for 16 European countries over the period 1998-2008 that higher electricity end-user prices in a country subsequently lead to larger aggregate investments in the capital stock, i.e. in generation, distribution and transmission assets. Moreover, there is a trade-off between vertical economies and competition. Ownership unbundling and forced access to the incumbent transmission grid increases competition but come at the cost of lost vertical economies. Generally, we find that regulation that affects only the market directly, like the establishment of a wholesale market or free choice of suppliers, increases aggregate investment. Regulation, however, that adversely affects the incumbent directly, like ownership unbundling, decreases aggregate investment spending. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First, they make it more attractive to join a network the larger its installed base. Second, they create incentives for network members to actively recruit new members. Despite indications that the latter peer effect can be more important for network growth than the installed-base effect, it has so far been largely ignored in the literature. We address this gap using game-theoretical models. When all early adopters can band together to exert peer influence-an assumption that fits, e.g., the case of firms supporting a technical standard-we find that the peer effect induces additional growth of the network by a factor. When, in contrast, individuals exert peer influence in small groups of size n, the increase in network size is by an additive constant-which, for small networks, can amount to a large relative increase. The difference between small, local, personal networks and large, global, anonymous networks arises endogenously from our analysis. Fundamentally, the first type of networks is tie-reinforcing, the other, tie-creating. We use survey data from users of the Internet services, Skype and eBay, to illustrate the main logic of our theoretical results. As predicted by the model, we find that the peer effect matters strongly for the network of Skype users-which effectively consists of numerous small sub-networks-but not for that of eBay users. Since many network goods give rise to small, local networks, our findings bear relevance to the economics of network goods and related social networks in general.","[Henkel, Joachim; Block, Joern] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Henkel, Joachim] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England; [Block, Joern] Univ Trier, Dept Business Adm, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Block, Joern] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Technical University of Munich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Universitat Trier; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Henkel, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",henkel@wi.tum.de; block@uni-trier.de,"Block, Joern/K-2208-2016","Block, Joern/0000-0003-4564-0346; Henkel, Joachim/0000-0002-6065-0983",,,,,37,6,8,0,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

It considers the case for industrial policy, contrasting the neoliberal with the structuralist approach. It argues that there is a valid case for selective interventions in overcoming the market and institutional failures in building the capabilities required for industrial development. It describes the strategies adopted by the Asian Tigers to build industrial competitiveness, and concludes with lessons for other developing countries. The kinds of industrial policy needed in the current setting are different from traditional industrialisation strategies, but globalization and technical change do not eliminate the need for intervention. On the contrary, given path dependence, cumulativeness and agglomeration economies, they increase it. There is a need to reconsider the rules of the game constraining the exercise of industrial policy, and for international assistance in designing and implementing appropriate policies.","Univ Oxford Green Coll, Oxford OX2 6HG, England",University of Oxford,"Lall, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Green Coll, Oxford OX2 6HG, England.",,,,,,,,46,20,21,2,35,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

I find that the comovement of main macroeconomic variables and the common factor increases for core Eurozone countries from the first to the second period, while it decreases for most peripheral economies. This can be interpreted as a rise in business cycle synchronization for the core and a respective decline for the periphery. Different to the implications made by the endogeneity argument of currency areas (Frankel and Rose in Econ J 108(449):1009-1025, 1998), my evidence suggest that the introduction of the Euro has fostered imbalances between core and peripheral Eurozone countries.","Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Int Trade Dept, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Lehwald, S (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Int Trade Dept, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",Lehwald@ifo.de,,,,,,,37,33,33,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2013,40,4,,,,,655,684,,10.1007/s10663-012-9205-8,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,236PK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325811100005,0

J,"Knabe, A; Schöb, R",,,,"Knabe, Andreas; Schoeb, Ronnie",,,Subsidizing extra jobs: promoting employment by taming the unions,OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNEMPLOYMENT; SECURITY; POLICIES; COSTS,"We study the subsidization of extra jobs in a general equilibrium framework. While the previous literature focuses on symmetric marginal employment subsidies where firms are rewarded when they increase employment but punished when they reduce their workforce, we consider an asymmetric scheme that only rewards employment expansion. This changes the incidence substantially. In the asymmetric case without punishment, it becomes less costly for firms to lay off a substantial fraction of their workforce when trade unions raise wages. This tames the unions, which causes wage moderation and raises aggregate employment and welfare. For moderate subsidy rates, all unions prefer to restrain their wage claims. At sufficiently high subsidy rates, labour market conditions improve so much that some unions enforce higher wages and let their firms shrink. This displacement of firms might have a negative impact on employment and welfare.","[Knabe, Andreas] Univ Magdeburg, Fac Econ & Management, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany; [Knabe, Andreas; Schoeb, Ronnie] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Schoeb, Ronnie] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Otto von Guericke University; Ifo Institut; Free University of Berlin,"Knabe, A (通讯作者)，Univ Magdeburg, Fac Econ & Management, POB 4120, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany.",Andreas.Knabe@ovgu.de,,"Knabe, Andreas/0000-0003-1298-0416",,,,,35,0,0,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Firms offer and commit to (Markov) contracts, which specify a wage contingent on all payoff-relevant states, but must pay equally all of their workers, who have limited commitment and are free to quit at any time. We find sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a stochastic search equilibrium in such contracts, which is Rank Preserving [RP]: larger and more productive firms offer more generous contracts to their workers in all states of the world. On the RP equilibrium path, turnover is always efficient as workers always move from less to more productive firms. The resulting stochastic dynamics of firm size provide an intuitive explanation for the empirical finding that large employers have more cyclical job creation (Moscarini and Postel-Vinay, 2012).

This behavior would be motivated by the similarities in the financial policies of neighboring firms as they share financial, legal and economic environmental characteristics and because of trade and financial links. In order to contrast this idea, we apply spatial econometric methodology on a sample composed by 23 279 Spanish manufacturing firms. Our findings confirm that firms' ratios of total debt are not randomly distributed over the Spanish territory but there are high (low) leveraged regions which tend to be surrounded by high (low) indebted areas. Besides, the traditional determinants of capital structure are subtly altered when we consider the spatial effect. Therefore, there is a need of including regional effects into financial capital structure models to avoid wrong estimations.","[Sanchez Val, Maria Luz Mate; Hernandez Canovas, Gines; Sanchez Vidal, Javier] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Fac Ciencias Empresa, Murcia, Spain; [Minguez Vera, Antonio] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Org Empresas & Finanzas, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; University of Murcia,"Val, MLMS (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cartagena, Fac Ciencias Empresa, Murcia, Spain.",mluz.mate@upct.es; gines.hernandez@upct.es; javier.sanchez@upct.es; minver@um.es,"Mate, Mariluz/H-2131-2015; Minguez-Vera, Antonio/Z-5658-2019; Cánovas, Ginés Hernández/H-4829-2015","Mate, Mariluz/0000-0002-9805-6365;",,,,,43,0,0,0,8,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

The properties of this function are discussed and employed to derive systems of inverse demand for imported goods. We illustrate its usefulness by proposing two new parametric forms of trade distance functions. While the trade distance function directly yields Hicksian inverse demand functions of imports, they usually lack closed-form representations in terms of observable variables. This problem, however, need not hinder estimation and could be solved by using the numerical inversion estimation method. Results generally indicate that the suggested modelling and estimation methods are operationally, implying that the trade distance function approach is a promising tool of the empirical analysis of import demands subjected to tight theoretical conditions.","Univ Macau, FSH, Dept Econ, Taipa, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Wong, KKG (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, FSH, Dept Econ, Taipa, Peoples R China.",garywong@umac.mo,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that changes of ratings are informative, economically important, and highly statistically significant in panel models, even after controlling for a host of domestic and global fundamental factors and investigating various functional forms, time and country groupings, and dynamic structures. Dynamic panel model estimates indicate that a credit rating upgrade decreases credit default swap (CDS) spreads by about 45 basis points, on average, for European Union (EU) countries. However, the association between credit rating changes and spreads shifted markedly between the pre-crisis and crisis periods. European countries had quite similar CDS responses to credit rating changes during the pre-crisis period, but large differences emerged during the crisis period between the now highly sensitive GIIPS group (Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Spain) and other European country groupings (EU and euro area excluding GIIPS, and the non-EU area). We also find a complicated non-linear pattern dependent on the level of the credit rating. The results are robust to the inclusion of credit outlook or watch signals by credit rating agencies. In addition, contagion from rating downgrades in GIIPS to other euro countries is not evident once own-country credit rating changes are taken into account.","[Aizenman, Joshua] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Binici, Mahir] Cent Bank Turkey, Ankara, Turkey",National Bureau of Economic Research; Prime Ministry Turkey; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,,aizenman@usc.edu; mahir.binici@tcmb.gov.tr; hutch@ucsc.edu,,"Binici, Mahir/0000-0001-8655-3113",,,,,26,28,33,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

However, such has not been the case with the USA, which has seen a relentless trade deficit since 1982. Its interest rates have been lower than those prevailing in many trade-surplus nations. Furthermore, these rates fell even as the trade shortfall shot up, generating an interest-rate paradox. This paper demonstrates that, unlike for other nations, the rising trade deficit itself became the cause of lower US interest rates, and this happened because of the world's strong interest in maintaining a high value of the dollar.","[Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, Coll Business, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Batra, Ravi] So Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75222 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Southern Methodist University,"Batra, R (通讯作者)，So Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75222 USA.",hamid.beladi@utsa.edu,,,,,,,17,7,7,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Expressed crudely, the charge sheet is this: The market depends on instrumental rationality and extrinsic motivation; market interactions therefore fail to respect the internal value of human practices and the intrinsic motivations of human actors; by using market exchange as its central model, economics normalizes extrinsic motivation, not only in markets but also in social life more generally; therefore economics is complicit in an assault on virtue and on human flourishing. We will argue that this critique is flawed, both as a description of how markets actually work and as a representation of how classical and neoclassical economists have understood the market. We show how the market and economics can be defended against the critique from virtue ethics, and crucially, this defense is constructed using the language and logic of virtue ethics. Using the methods of virtue ethics and with reference to the writings of some major economists, we propose an understanding of the purpose (telos) of markets as cooperation for mutual benefit, and identify traits that thereby count as virtues for market participants. We conclude that the market need not be seen as a virtue-free zone.","[Bruni, Luigino] LUMSA Univ, Rome, Italy; [Sugden, Robert] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Universita LUMSA; University of East Anglia,"Bruni, L (通讯作者)，LUMSA Univ, Rome, Italy.",l.bruni@lumsa.it; r.sugden@uea.ac.uk,"Sugden, Robert/B-1153-2012","Sugden, Robert/0000-0002-3401-3139","ESRC [ES/H004831/1, ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1, ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,53,86,88,1,20,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In a two-sided market, two or more groups of agents such as buyers and sellers interact while exerting cross-group externalities upon each other. They interact with each other via some sort of medium, called the platform of interaction. This paper integrates the concept of two-sided markets into the optimal location problem for two platform providers. We show that when the two groups of customers' cross-side network externalities are equal, the duopoly platforms will agglomerate at the market center with no undercutting. However, disparate conditions exist under which the duopoly platforms will stay apart at the market endpoints, or agglomerate at either endpoint, with no undercutting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, we observe that a strong rule of law, with an effective mechanism of property rights reinforcement, as well as the pre-adoption existence of a pro-growth set of public policies can contribute to the encouragement of IFRSs adoption.","[Dima, Bogdan; Moldovan, Nicoleta Claudia; Pirtea, Marilen Gabriel] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Timisoara, Romania; [Dima (Cristea), Stefana] Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Fac Econ, Accounting & Finance Dept, Arad, Romania",West University of Timisoara; Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad,"Dima, B (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Timisoara, Romania.",bogdandima2001@gmail.com; stefana_cristea@yahoo.it; nicoletamoldovan2004@yahoo.com; marilen.pirtea@gmail.com,"DIMA, STEFANA M./N-1626-2016; Pirtea, Marilen Gabriel/IVV-6430-2023; Dima, Bogdan/N-1048-2016; Moldovan, Nicoleta Claudia/ADP-3323-2022","DIMA, STEFANA M./0000-0003-0452-7216; Pirtea, Marilen Gabriel/0000-0002-3956-4394; Dima, Bogdan/0000-0002-0820-9904; Moldovan, Nicoleta Claudia/0000-0002-1916-2638",,,,,47,4,4,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Despite such large and rapidly growing investment figures, the success rates of IT deployment projects over the past 20 years remained relatively low: approximately half of IT deployment projects were unsuccessful. Literature review reveals that inadequate strategic information system planning (SISP) is one of the main reasons for low deployment success rates of IT deployment projects and, thus, one of the current critical IT management issues. For this reason researchers and practitioners in the SISP field are currently directing their efforts into expanding the traditional understanding of SISP as a pure IT planning activity. In addition to the activities dedicated to the planning of IT investments, new SISP models should also include the contextual activities that enable adaptation of the deployed IT to the environment and knowledge transfer from the environment. In this paper, the authors propose an extended SISP model that includes influences of environmental stakeholders. The developed SISP model was empirically tested on a sample from the population of 1000 largest enterprises in Slovenia. The authors believe that the findings of their research and the suggested extended SISP model will improve understanding of SISP success factors in enterprises and consequently enable them to manage their IT investments with greater success.","[Hovelja, Tomaz; Rupnik, Rok] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Vasilecas, Olegas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Ljubljana; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Vasilecas, O (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",olegas.vasilecas@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,80,7,7,1,35,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Based on a model where two technologically asymmetric countries compete for FDI, we determine an equilibrium where a multinational firm relocates to a less efficient country. Moreover, we demonstrate that the policy competition for FDI between less integrated economies might improve social welfare when the multinational firm relocates to a country with a lower technology and a less competitive market. Nonetheless, we show that the traditional argument can be true when the policy competition for FDI between highly integrated economies deteriorates host countries' welfare, as supported by the empirical evidences of moderated competition for FDI within EU member countries.

As household income increases, solid and transitional fuel use evolves in an inverse U manner, while electricity consumption shows a direct relationship with income. Public infrastructure provision, income, and education are the key variables which can be targeted to reduce household dependence on solid-fuels while increasing non-solid fuel use. While education and public infrastructure have varying impacts on rural and urban households' energy mix, these variables generally reduce rudimentary fuel use and increase modern fuel consumption. Timely investment in electricity infrastructure is necessary to cater for burgeoning electricity demand as households become affluent Strategies for reforestation, dissemination of improved cookstoves, relieving supply side constraints for modern fuels, and staggered payment options to lower the cost of entry for modern fuels can improve Ugandan households' energy security.

We characterize the bound on the speed of convergence in a family of stationary equilibria in which policy bounces between right-wing and left-wing policies.

An efficient tree is constructed in any equilibrium of the Bertrand game. We evaluate the price of imperfect competition (PIC), namely the ratio of the total price that could be charged to the buyer in some equilibrium, to the true minimal cost. If each seller can only bid for a single edge and costs satisfy the triangle inequality, we show that the PIC is at most 2 for an odd number of nodes, and at most 2n-1/n-2 for an even number n of nodes. Surprisingly, this worst case ratio does not improve when the cost pattern is ultrametric (a much more demanding substitutability requirement), although the overhead is much lower on average under typical probabilistic assumptions.

Exports act as the only exogenous drivers of growth only under a regime of fixed exchange rates and when cumulative causation is blocked. Under flexible exchange rates, by contrast, it is internal demand that serves as the only exogenous driver of growth. Moreover, regardless of the type of shock, the presence of cumulative causation does not boost growth, although it may render growth more sustainable.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Razmi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",,,,,,,,9,4,4,0,9,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Using a model similar to Ireland (2007) and the method presented in Bai and Perron (1998) and Bai and Perron (2003) to estimate unknown structural breaks, Monte Carlo simulation results suggest that reduced-form evidence of structural breaks are broadly in line with what is predicted by forward-looking rational expectation models; that is, as the transition period increases, break estimates gradually move farther from the policy announcement date.","[Uzeda, Luis] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Jones, Callum] NYU, New York, NY USA",Australian National University; New York University,"Uzeda, L (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",luis.uzeda@anu.edu.au; jonescallum@gmail.com,,/0000-0002-2177-676X,,,,,11,1,1,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We find that an expansion in discretionary fiscal policy boosts growth in the short term, but is detrimental in the medium term.

This welfare equivalence is in contrast to most previous studies, which demonstrate the superiority of the ad valorem tax in a partial equilibrium framework. In this paper, we relax the assumption of 100% profit taxation and allow the consumers to receive profit incomes from ownership of shares in the monopoly firm. We find that, under certain regularity conditions, for any fixed vector of profit shares, the utility possibility sets of economies with unit and ad valorem taxes are not generally identical. But it does not imply that one completely dominates the other. Rather, the two utility possibility frontiers cross each other. Additionally, employing a standard partial equilibrium welfare analysis, we show that the Marshallian social surpluses resulting from the two tax structures are identical when the government can implement unrestricted transfers.","[Blackorby, Charles] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Murty, Sushama] Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England",University of British Columbia; University of Exeter,"Blackorby, C (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,,,,,,,16,8,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

THE CASE OF SELF-SELECTED STUDENT SAMPLES,JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRUST; FIELD; COOPERATION; RECIPROCITY; BEHAVIOR; PEOPLE,"Social preference research has received considerable attention among economists in recent years. However, the empirical foundation of social preferences is largely based on laboratory experiments with self-selected students as participants. This is potentially problematic as students participating in experiments may behave systematically different than nonparticipating students or nonstudents. In this paper we empirically investigate whether laboratory experiments with student samples misrepresent the importance of social preferences. Our first study shows that students who exhibit stronger prosocial inclinations in an unrelated field donation are not more likely to participate in experiments. This suggests that self-selection of more prosocial students into experiments is not a major issue. Our second study compares the behavior of students and participants recruited from the general population in a trust experiment. In general, we find very similar behavioral patterns for the two groups, but nonstudents make significantly more generous repayments suggesting that results from student samples might be seen as a lower bound for the importance of prosocial behavior.","[Falk, Armin] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Meier, Stephan] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zehnder, Christian] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Bonn; Columbia University; University of Lausanne,"Falk, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",armin.falk@uni-bonn.de; sm3087@columbia.edu; christian.zehnder@unil.ch,,,,,,,19,133,145,3,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Each differentiated final good requires both management and manufacturing services as inputs, and firms are heterogeneous with regard to their productivity levels in providing these inputs. Two scenarios of relocating manufacturing to the South, which are interpreted to correspond to vertical foreign direct investment (FDI) and offshoring, are investigated. In both cases there is a minimum level of management productivity required for firms to benefit from relocation of manufacturing to the South. In the case of offshoring, productivity and profit gains are relatively larger for firms with low initial manufacturing productivity. Firms with high initial productivity in both aspects choose not to offshore owing to the presence of fixed costs. The model is subsequently used to examine the implications of global economic integration on the type of firm that exits an industry, changes production location or keeps manufacturing domestically.","Villanova Univ, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",Villanova University,"Kersting, EK (通讯作者)，Villanova Univ, 800 E Lancaster Ave, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",erasmus.kersting@villanova.edu,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Our empirical investigation relies on a large data set of executives and outside directors of French public firms. This data source is a matched employer-employee data set that provides detailed information on directors/CEOs as well as information about the firm employing them. We find a strong and robust correlation between the CEO's network and that of his directors. Networks of former high-ranking civil servants are the most active in shaping board composition. Our identification strategy takes into account not only firm and directors' fixed effects but also the matching of firms and director in terms of one observable and one unobservable characteristic. Turning to the direct effects of such network activity, we find that firms in which these networks are most active pay their CEOs more, are less likely to replace a CEO who underperforms, and engage in less value-creating acquisitions. These findings suggest that social networks are active in the boardroom and have detrimental effects on firms' governance.","[Thesmar, David] HEC Paris, Paris, France",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris,,kramarz@ensae.fr; thesmar@hec.fr,,"thesmar, david/0000-0001-9265-0526",,,,,30,75,84,0,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The three papers in this issue explore the role of various institutions, both public and private, in delivering efficient services to promote economic growth. The first paper by Bold and Svensson is on Policies and Institutions for Effective Service Delivery: The Need of a Microeconomic and Micro-Political Approach. The authors review evidence on recent trends and outcomes in the education and health sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa, with a focus on the quality in service provision. The paper views low and ineffective spending on service delivery sectors as a symptom of the underlying institutional environment decay. The paper further argues that a microeconomic approach that explicitly takes political and bureaucratic incentives and constraints into account provides a fruitful, and complementary, way forward. The main finding of the paper is that innovations in the measurement of performance and ability in education and health open up ways to influence the political economic equilibrium. The second paper by Bold, Kimenyi and Sandefur looks at public and private provision of education in Kenya. The authors examine the superior examination performance of private primary schools and elite public secondary schools and test whether this performance reflects causal returns to the school type. The main finding is that, although there is a large increase in primary school enrolment following the introduction of free primary education, the increase is primarily driven by the increase in private school enrolments. The third paper by Blimpo, Harding and Wantchekon focuses on Public Investment in Infrastructure Giving Deliberations on Some Political Economy Considerations. The article constructs a unique data set to study the extent of the relationship between political marginalisation, public investment in transport infrastructure and food security in Benin, Ghana, Mali and Senegal. The main finding of the paper is that political marginalisation indirectly affects food security, via its impact on the quality of transport infrastructure. Moreover, the density of roads per square kilometre has a significant negative relationship to food insecurity.","[Manda, Damiano K.; Mwakubo, Samuel] AERC, Nairobi, Kenya",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"Manda, DK (通讯作者)，AERC, Nairobi, Kenya.",damiano.manda@aercafrica.org,,,,,,,11,1,1,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

After documenting original stylized facts, the paper presents a model in which patent offices set patent fees and the quality level of their examination process. A higher effort in the examination process enhances the patent holders' protection in the judicial system and strengthens the screening of innovations with small inventive steps. We compare the quality of the examination process for various objectives of patent offices. Patent examination quality is the highest in an office maximizing incentives to innovate and the lowest in that maximizing the number of granted patents. A rent-seeking patent office can provide good incentives to innovate if it does not set too high markups on fees. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The main macroeconomic indicators (growth, employment, price stability, sustainable public finances) are shown to depend on the assumed long-run policy options followed. It is demonstrated that the ageing of the Slovenian population projected in the demographic forecast leads to severe budgetary problems unless increases of the retirement age, rising social security contributions or reductions of state financed pensions are implemented. A reduction of the pension replacement rate turns out to be the most effective measure to cope with the budgetary implications of population ageing.

A cooperative solution encapsulating the operation of the different mechanisms designed to cope with the conflict and including the various elements of compensation is presented. The model shows that the amount of the explicit compensation depends on the extent of the strategic conflict between the parties as well as on the factors that determine the implicit compensation (i.e., unions' inflation aversion, partisanship) or are partial substitutes for it (i.e., the conservative central banker).

The central debate focuses on whether energy consumption contributes or not to economic growth since it has direct implications for the formulation of strategic policies. Nevertheless, current studies cannot provide a conclusive suggestion due to mixed causality results. This inconclusive evidence is potentially attributed to model specifications and the stage of economic development of the countries under investigation. Hence, this study attempts to empirically re-investigate the validity of the energy-led growth hypothesis using a different model specification and different stages of economic development for 85 selected countries around the globe. Overall, although the causality results are mixed among countries, we do find a systematic pattern. In particular, Granger causality models with three and four variables are more likely to support the hypothesis compared to their counterparts that contain only two variables. In addition, both developed and developing countries are more likely to support the energy-led growth hypothesis compared to the less developed or low income countries. Therefore, causality results are very sensitive to the choice of the model specification along with the stages of economic development. Finally, energy conservation policies should only focus on low income countries as these policies may not retard the process of economic growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We consider an extended version of Lucas's (1988) human capital investment model that includes labour adjustment costs and compare its performance under different utility specifications with different degrees of complementarity and substitutability between consumption and leisure. We find that when consumption and leisure are complements the model succeeds in matching not only the autocorrelation of output growth but also the important trend-reverting component found in US data. These results hold even if low adjustment costs of labour are considered.

We demonstrate that in nonlinear models of this form, the presence of sunspot equilibria implies two natural schemes for learning the conditional means of endogenous variables: under mean value learning, agents condition on a sunspot variable that captures the self-fulfilling serial correlation in the equilibrium, whereas under vector autoregression learning (VAR learning), the self-fulfilling serial correlation must be learned. We show that an intuitive condition ensures convergence to a regime-switching rational expectations equilibrium. However, the stability of sunspot equilibria, when they exist, depends on whether agents adopt mean value or VAR learning: coordinating on sunspot equilibria via a VAR learning rule is not possible. To illustrate these phenomena, we develop results for an overlapping-generations model and a New Keynesian model.","[Branch, William A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA; [McGough, Bruce] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Oregon State University,"Branch, WA (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",wbranch@uci.edu,,,,,,,29,18,21,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We argue that, despite neoclassical (mis)treatments, more socialised conceptions of social capital address individuals capacities to share a sense of social obligation and common identity and pursue joint strategies for public welfare. We attempt to reinstate the social in social capital via the concept of social embeddedness, where individuals freely engage in processes of reflection, social mobilisation and political debate to assess different and often conflicting values and objectives across multiple collective agencies. Choices thus depend not only on personal utility, but also on personal identity, i.e. what kind of person one wants to be and what kind of society one wishes to have.","[Christoforou, Asimina] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Christoforou, A (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, 76 Patiss Str, Athens 10434, Greece.",asimina@aueb.gr,,,,,,,60,30,35,5,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We find no evidence that trade openness is directly and robustly correlated with economic growth in the long run. We further check the robustness of this finding by employing a battery of proxies for trade openness, namely, current openness, real openness, the fraction of open years based on the Sachs and Warner (1995) criteria and the weighted averages of tariff rates, non-tariff barriers and the black market premium. The main result is robust to the inclusion of different trade openness proxies and none of the proxies is robustly associated with economic growth. The data evidence also indicates that economic institutions and macroeconomic uncertainties such as those induced by high inflation and excess government consumption are key factors in explaining economic growth.

In this paper I provide a theoretical explanation for the observed differences by analyzing optimal fiscal policy under different degrees of access to world capital markets. If the supply of foreign capital is elastic, as in a developed country, then it is optimal to adjust to an adverse external shock by borrowing from abroad to finance public expenditure and cutting taxes to smooth private consumption. If the supply of foreign capital is inelastic, however, as in a developing country, the optimal adjustment policy is to reduce public investment (by much more than public consumption) and to raise consumption taxes.

Extended linear models are refinements that aim at endowing the linear models with additional general equilibrium feedbacks. We detect that these rules may give rise in these models to some allegedly pathological and biased behavior. We find that in these models sectoral or aggregate output may not follow the logical and economically expected direct relationship with some underlying endogenous variables - namely, output and value-added in the supply-driven model and output and consumption in the demand-driven model. Because of their shared mathematical structure, whatever is or seems to be pathological in the Ghosh model also has a symmetric counterpart in the Leontief model. These would not be good news for the inner consistency of these linear models and raise doubts regarding the validity of their empirical applications. To avoid such possible inconsistencies, we propose new and simple endogeneization rules that have a sound economic interpretation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

All studies have been conducted in line with legal-centralist or private-ordering views, only. Our contribution in this study is twofold. We combined private-ordering and legal-centralist views and propose an augmented endogenous growth model to calculate the optimum share of public and private sectors in property rights protection (PPRs). Also, the shares of government and private sectors in total production have been calculated. The result of calibration in Iran's economy indicated that the optimum share of government expenditure in PPRs should equal to 45.37%, and private sector's share should be 54.63%. Also the optimum share of government production should be 16.62% and production share of private sector should be 83.38%. Nevertheless in Iran's economy private sector shares only a small percentage (about 2%) of the total quantity of expenditures on PPRs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Combining administrative data on disbursement and household survey data on receipt under Indonesia's anti-poverty program, Inpres Desa Tertinggal (IDT), we find that only 69% of disbursements were actually received by the intended beneficiaries. When these missing funds are ignored, the distribution of IDT benefits is pro-poor, and better targeting is found in districts with higher per capita expenditure. However, when the missing funds are taken into account, the distribution of IDT benefits in fact becomes less pro-poor than universal, equal distribution, and better targeting is correlated with a higher proportion of female village heads and a higher level of villagers' human capital. These results underscore the importance of considering the size and allocation of missing funds in the analysis of targeting in public resource delivery. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is demonstrated that if a good is active in Cournot equilibrium, then it is active in either one of the socially optimal solution and the monopoly solution; but, the converse is not true. When demands are linear, a good is active in the monopoly solution if and only if it is socially desirable. Therefore, the monopoly would be socially better than the Cournot duopoly in selecting products. We establish that each Cournot output falls below its corresponding monopoly output regardless of whether the solutions are interior or not. However, in the monopoly solution, a good should be cross-subsidized if and only if it is a supplemental good. This result has two implications. First, a small decrease in the output level of a supplemental good raises the welfare, implying that when there exists a supplement good, lower quantities are not necessarily worse in welfare terms. Second, if each good is a base good, then the Cournot equilibrium indeed is less welfare-efficient than the monopoly solution. In order to verify whether it is possible to have a welfare reversal, we consider the case where demands are linear. We demonstrate that prices are lower in the monopoly solution, and that lower prices are better in the welfare terms. These two results imply that welfare is higher in the monopoly solution. Again, these results hold regardless of whether the solutions are interior or not.","[Chang, Ming Chung; Lin, Chiu Fen] Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Chungli 32001, Taiwan; [Lin, Yun-Chieh] Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Yi Lan City 26047, Taiwan",National Central University; National Ilan University,"Chang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, 300 Chung Ta Rd, Chungli 32001, Taiwan.",mcchang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,13,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The government issues nominal bonds of several maturities with noncontingent face value at redemption. Intervening in the exchange market to implement an adequate state-contingent path for the nominal exchange rate is an effective way for the government to prevent the economy from reaching any competitive equilibrium it wishes to rule out. Most sterilized interventions are not neutral; however, few of them are. As a consequence, the composition in question is undetermined. Hence, a floating regime may decentralize every competitive outcome, even one induced by a pegging policy. Conversely, outcomes brought forth by a floating regime can also be induced by a policy that prescribes active government intervention in the foreign currency market. Moreover, an open-market operation can be replaced by an equivalent combination of an exchange intervention plus a restructuring of the domestic debt maturity. Introducing in the model strategic behavior by the government combined with asymmetric information or lack of commitment can remove that indeterminacy. Hence, these factors seem to be the major determinants of a possible relation between floating exchange rate policies and economic outcomes.","Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Cunha, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Av Pasteur 250, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",research@alexbcunha.com,,"Cunha, Alexandre B./0000-0001-8103-9043",,,,,62,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

After haltingly sliding toward neoliberalism in the 1990s, Brazil has adopted an economic policy stance, sometimes termed neodevelopmentalism, entailing a forceful and successful growth with redistribution strategy. Mexico, having embraced policy nihilism, has endured a relative stagnation in income and employment, accompanied by a rising incidence of poverty and massive emigration. This article offers an analysis of the differential institutional economic structures of these two Latin American countries that serves to explain their relative degrees of success and failure.

We have examined the association of asthma prevalence and the amount of health investment with daily mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mm (PM2.5) in 16 metropolitan areas in U.S. using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2001) data in conjunction with the Air Quality System data collected by the Environmental Protection Agency. A multivariate probit approach has been used to estimate recursive systems of equations for environmental health outcome and life-styles. A piecewise linear relationship has been postulated to describe the association between health outcome, health investment and pollution. We have assumed one change point at AQI value of 100 which corresponds to the US national air quality standard. The most interesting result concerns the influence of pollution on health-improving life-style choices: below a specified threshold concentration (AQI = 100) a positive linear association exists between exposure to PM2.5 and health investments; above the threshold the association becomes negative. Hence, only if ambient pollution is in the 'satisfactory range' (AQI level at or below 100), individuals will have incentive to invest in health. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Basically, two effects of tax loss treatment can be expected. First, firms make their investment decisions considering potential future losses. Then, the various types of conceivable loss offset provisions affect investment decisions. Secondly, existing loss carryforwards resulting from losses in the past affect the tax rate elasticity of current investment decisions. Our empirical analysis is based on data of German multinationals. We pay particular attention to industries having a high probability to make losses. Our regression results suggest that a short carryforward time limit lowers investment in particular for firms with a high loss probability. We only find mixed evidence that group loss offsetting provisions foster investment. Concerning the effects of existing losses carried forward, we find a reduced tax rate elasticity of investment for companies shielded by loss carryforwards.","[Dressler, Daniel] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Overesch, Michael] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Business Adm & Econ, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Goethe University Frankfurt,"Overesch, M (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Business Adm & Econ, Westend Campus, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",dressler@zew.de; overesch@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de,"Overesch, Michael/AAZ-6573-2021","Overesch, Michael/0000-0002-1531-0357",,,,,33,18,19,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We demonstrate that concern for the norms we elicit and for money predict changes in behavior across several variants of the dictator game, including data from a novel experiment and from prior published laboratory studies, that are unaccounted for by most current theories of social preferences. Moreover, we find that the importance of social norm compliance and of monetary considerations is fairly constant across different experiments. This consistency allows prediction of treatment effects across experiments, and implies that subjects have a generally stable willingness to sacrifice money to take behaviors that are socially appropriate.","[Krupka, Erin L.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Weber, Roberto A.] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Zurich,"Krupka, EL (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ekrupka@umich.edu; roberto.weber@econ.uzh.ch,"Krupka, Erin/AAP-6393-2020",,,,,,0,409,446,10,94,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We estimate both the extensive margins - number of products imported per product group or trade partner - and intensive margins - amount of imports per product group or trade partner - of China's imports. Our paper contributes to the literature of firm heterogeneity in international trade in three different ways. First, we distinguish firms into foreign firms and domestic firms, which are further divided into private firms and public firms. Second, we distinguish products into final goods and intermediate goods. Third, we estimate gravity equations from the perspective of dynamics utilizing a dynamic adjustment model. Overall, our analysis yields a number of new stylized facts about China's imports. These, in turn, help us to gain a fuller understanding of China's trade patterns in light of its recent emergence as a globally significant importer. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Participants played in 15-round sessions where they were allowed to vote to remove other subjects only after round 5 and in one design also voted whether to punish the remaining subjects after round 10. Consistent with the literature, we find that an additional threat of punishment increases the contributions of participants before the punishment vote. The literature shows that frequent threats of expulsion may increase efficiency in the provision of public goods. In realistic settings, however, opportunities for expulsion are limited whereas threats of non-expulsive punishments are common. We find the threat of costly punishment increases contributions with little impact on efficiency (57.1% versus 58.1%), and that standards for inclusion rise when later punishment is available.

Potential innovators decide which technologies to develop after considering available factors of production, and individuals decide the quality and quantity of their children after considering available technologies. This interaction allows us to evaluate potentially divergent development paths. We find that unskilled labor-biased technological growth can induce higher fertility and lower education, exerting downward pressure on growth in per-person income. Despite this, for most plausible developing-country scenarios, unskilled intensive growth produces more per-person income than skill-intensive growth.

When firms and households use the same discount factor, the effects of indeterminacy are limited to adding volatility to the wage rate. If these discount factors differ, however, then indeterminacy also destabilises newly employed labour and total hours.

Evidence suggests the best response to this problem is greater differentiation and institutional independence for economics as a social science. Specifically, the social science wing should differentiate itself as the discipline of political economy' within faculties of social science. This strategy of differentiation and independence can potentially bring about the revitalisation of the social science wing of the discipline.

According to superstition, fire horse women are said to have troubled marriages, to mistreat men, and to cause early deaths for their husbands and fathers. No such stigma applies to men born in these years. This paper attempts to investigate the impact of women's birth in the most recent fire horse year (1966) on the outcome of their lives by using individual-level microdata. We find that there is no evidence of disadvantages to fire horse women in human capital investment, performance in the marriage market, or intra-household allocation of resources after marriage. We provide two plausible explanations for this lack of impact from the stigma: a cohort size effect and a dynamic transition in the share of arranged and love marriages. The latter affected parents' decisions in 1966 as well as the performance of fire horse women in the marriage market and in intra-household resource allocation after marriage. This finding suggests the importance of careful attention to the dynamic effects of society and the economy that may occur before the emergence of a cohort size effect.","Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Yamada, H (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, 1-31 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",hyamada@osipp.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Yamada, Hiroyuki/Q-3464-2019",,,,,,34,4,5,2,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The question arises whether this policy option is feasible in aging countries. Are their electorates becoming more favorable to immigration? The attitudes of the people living in the recipient locations are a key issue in the study of migration and culture. This paper uses the 19992010 waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel to disentangle the effects of age, birth cohort and time on concerns about immigration. Older birth cohorts are found to be more concerned than younger ones whereas concerns are found to decrease over the life cycle. Both findings suggest scope for the loosening of immigration constraints.","Fraunhofer Inst Appl Informat Technol, Res Grp MIKMOD, D-53754 Schloss Birlinghoven, Sankt Augustin, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Calahorrano, L (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Appl Informat Technol, Res Grp MIKMOD, D-53754 Schloss Birlinghoven, Sankt Augustin, Germany.",lena.calahorrano@fit.fraunhofer.de,,,,,,,20,19,19,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The general criticism is that survey responses reflect how people would like to behave, rather than how they actually behave. In our study of climate change and carbon emissions reductions, based on the increasing bulk of evidence from psychology and economics regarding the effects of making promises, we investigate the effect of an oath script in a contingent valuation survey. The survey was conducted in Sweden and China, and its results indicate that an oath script has significant effects on respondent behavior in answering willingness-to-pay (WTP) questions. In both countries, the shares of zero WTP responses and extremely high WTP responses decrease when an oath script is used, resulting in lower variance. Furthermore, the conditional WTP decreases in the Chinese but not in the Swedish sample. We also find that the effect of the oath script is not generally dependent on respondent characteristics, and the few differences we observe vary with the countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Finally, the model may explain the different unemployment dynamics in Europe and in the United States, following the 1980 disinflationary episode.

We develop a model that predicts that the time until expiration of a prediction market should negatively affect the accuracy of prices as a forecasting tool in the direction of a favourite/longshot bias'. That is, high-likelihood events are underpriced, and low-likelihood events are over-priced. We confirm this result using a large data set of prediction market transaction prices. Prediction markets are reasonably well calibrated when time to expiration is relatively short, but prices are significantly biased for events farther in the future. When time value of money is considered, the miscalibration can be exploited to earn excess returns only when the trader has a relatively low discount rate.","Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Duke University,"Page, L (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",lionel.page@qut.edu.au,,"Page, Lionel/0000-0002-6020-9733",,,,,40,23,25,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

The most common approach, the theory of optimal currency areas, postulates that traded goods are produced by labour and the exchange rate between national currencies is the ratio of commodity wages, expressed in monetary units, in different countries. In this analysis the exchange rate and wages are substitutes for obtaining international competitiveness. Such a view is the basis for current reflections about the future of the euro and the reduction of its difficulties to relative wages rates in different countries of the eurozone. The theory has two important limitations. First, it takes no account of the import intensity of exports, which would require wage adjustments to reinforce exchange rate adjustments, so that wages and exchange rates are necessarily complementary parameters, rather than being substitutes for each other. Hence, exit from the eurozone as a means of closing trade deficits would require additional austerity. Even more importantly, it is a commodity money theory, in which imbalances are accommodated by accumulations of specie or fiat money. However, in a credit economy, banking systems absorb trade imbalances into their balance sheets. Moreover, financial integration means that banking systems throughout Europe are vulnerable to balance sheet risks from exchange rate depreciation in any country in Europe.","[Toporowski, Jan] SOAS, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Toporowski, J (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St, London WC1H 0XG, England.",jt29@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,12,14,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Our results show that there has been long-term equilibrium in REIT and stock indices in most of these markets. To earn exceptional profits, it is recommended that investors can sell (buy) the REITs when the indices of REITs are lower (higher) than equilibrium in Australia, Singapore and Taiwan: on the other hand, they should sell (buy) when the REIT market goes up (down) in Hong Kong and Japan. A causality test revealed that previous information about stocks predicted changes in the REITs in all the Asian/Pacific markets. One can also find that the lead-lag relationships are significant. The threshold EC model predicts two-way causality under both the regimes for the financial markets in most countries during all the sample periods. In addition, the adjustment speeds for the stock indices are faster than that for the REIT indices as disequilibrium occurs. This paper also finds that the previous mentioned trading strategies generally remained the same during the period of sub-prime mortgage crisis. However, the threshold EC model predicts one-way causality for both the regimes for the financial markets in most countries during this crisis period. In addition, we also find that the severe shock in REIT markets led investors in Australia and Taiwan to be more conservative during this period. The REIT indices had more effect on stock indices after the sub-prime mortgage crisis. According to the empirical results, we can infer that the degree of market imbalance and the occurrence of the sub-prime mortgage crisis induce the changes in the investment behavior of market participants.

The digital divide is examined in four different dimensions: (i) between students in urban public schools and students in rural public schools; (ii) between students in rural public schools and students in private migrant schools; (iii) between migrant students in urban public schools and migrant students in private migrant schools; and (iv) between students in Han-dominated rural areas and students in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. Using data from a set of large-scale surveys in schools in different parts of the country, we find a wide gap between computer and Internet access of students in rural areas and those in urban public schools. The gap widens further when comparing urban students to students from minority areas. The divide is also large between urban and rural schools when examining the quality of computer instruction and access to learning software. Migration does not appear to eliminate the digital divide, unless migrant families are able to enroll their children in urban public schools. The digital divide in elementary schools may have implications for future employment, education and income inequality in China.","[Yang, Yihua] Jilin Univ, Sch Philosophy & Soc, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiao; Qu, Qinghe] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lai, Fang; Boswell, Matthew; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lai, Fang] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Louvain, Belgium; [Shi, Yaojiang] NW Univ Xian, Sch Econ Management, Xian 710069, Peoples R China","Jilin University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University; KU Leuven; Northwest University Xi'an","Shi, YJ (通讯作者)，NW Univ Xian, Sch Econ Management, Xian 710069, Peoples R China.",yangyihua@jlu.edu.cn; xh228@cornell.edu; qhqu.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; Laifang1@stanford.edu; syj8882002@yahoo.com.cn; kefka@stanford.edu; rozelle@stanford.edu,"Lang, Ming/HIK-0758-2022; Yang, Ye/GZM-4812-2022; yang, yang/HGT-7999-2022",,,,,,25,25,28,13,66,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2013,21,3,,,SI,,61,79,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12022.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,148AB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319212800005,0
J,"Adilov, N; Waldman, M",,,,"Adilov, Nodir; Waldman, Michael",,,OPTIMAL COPYRIGHT LENGTH AND EX POST INVESTMENT: A MICKEY MOUSE APPROACH,ECONOMIC INQUIRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper considers a theoretical model of copyright protection in which the value of an intellectual work changes over time because of depreciation and value-enhancing ex post investments. The first main finding is that, in the case of a single project, granting infinitely lived copyright protection maximizes social welfare when the return on ex post investments is high relative to the return on the initial investment. We also provide simulation results of our model for the case of multiple heterogeneous projects that show how social welfare varies with the length of copyright protection and the returns on initial and ex post investments. We then consider what our framework says concerning the social-welfare effects of the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act. Here we show that, depending on the importance of ex post investments, the act may have either increased or decreased social welfare. Our final analysis considers the social-welfare implications of replacing fixed-length copyright protection with Landes and Posner's (University of Chicago Law Review, 70(2), 2003, 471518) idea of indefinitely renewable copyright protection. We find that implementing indefinitely renewable copyright protection frequently increases social welfare provided the returns on ex post investments are sufficiently large. We also provide a brief history of Disney's Mickey Mouse and argue that the history of that character matches quite well with the predictions of our theoretical approach.

However their analysis does not take firm size into account. This paper explores this link. Our model stresses that size should matter: if innovations are large-scale and costly in the firm's sector or relatively to the size of the firm, competitive shocks have to be large enough to change innovation choices. Using a unique panel of French firms we show an inverted-U-shape relationship that becomes flatter when the relative cost of R&D increases until it vanish altogether for small firms.","[Askenazy, Philippe; Cahn, Christophe; Irac, Delphine] Banque France, F-75049 Paris 01, France; [Askenazy, Philippe] Paris Sch Econ CNRS, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Paris School of Economics,"Askenazy, P (通讯作者)，Banque France, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris 01, France.",christophe.cahn@banque-france.fr,"Cahn, Christophe/T-2206-2019","Cahn, Christophe/0000-0002-0413-2305; Askenazy, Philippe/0000-0003-1447-9668",,,,,21,21,21,2,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

One of the largest is immigrants, where the incidence of being unbanked is over 13% higher than among natives in 2001. We document growth in the nativity gap in bank use over time. We also test the importance of immigrant enclaves, defined as areas with high concentrations of immigrants from the same region, in explaining the increasing differential in bank use. Combining data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, Census, and FDIC we find that immigrants living in enclaves are significantly less likely to have a bank account. We take steps to isolate one particular channel through which this might operate: the use of informal financial services provided by co-ethnics in enclaves.

We provide causal evidence that broadcast TV decreased the ideological extremism of US representatives. We then show that exposure to radio was associated with decreased polarization. We interpret this result by using a simple framework that identifies two channels linking media environment to politicians' incentives to polarize. First, the ideology effect: changes in the media environment may affect the distribution of citizens' ideological views, with politicians moving their positions accordingly. Second, the motivation effect: the media may affect citizens' political motivation, changing the ideological composition of the electorate and thereby impacting elite polarization while mass polarization is unchanged. The evidence on polarization and turnout is consistent with a prevalence of the ideology effect in the case of TV, as both of them decreased. Increased turnout associated with radio exposure is in turn consistent with a role for the motivation effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

With appropriate changes to the Diamond and Dybvig model of commercial banking, we show how market concentration enables banks to collect 'seigniorage' profits; and how 'tail risk' investments which escape regulatory notice allow losses to be shifted onto the taxpayer. In principle, the franchise values associated with market power might assist regulatory capital requirements to check risk-taking. But when big banks act strategically, bailout expectations can undermine these disciplining devices: and the taxpayer ends up 'on the hook' - as in the recent crisis. Structural change is needed to prevent a repeat; and we discuss how the Vickers report proposes to protect the taxpayer by a 'ring fence' separating commercial and investment banking.","[Miller, Marcus; Zhang, Lei] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Zhang, Lei] Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Li, Hanhao] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick; Sichuan University; University of Warwick,"Miller, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",marcus.miller@warwick.ac.uk; l.zhang@warwick.ac.uk; hanhao.li@googlemail.com,"Miller, Marcus/A-2123-2009",,ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,52,2,2,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Evidence on the role of cognitive skills in gender earnings gap decompositions is virtually absent. I use two approaches to investigate the potential for cognitive skills to affect the size and pattern of the unexplained component of the earnings gap (relative discrimination') across the wage distribution, using data from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). It has been shown that when the raw cognitive score is used to control for cognitive skills, the return to schooling cognitive skills is generally underestimated. Once a distinction is made about the origins of cognitive skills (acquired in school versus outside the school), the returns to cognitive skills can vary depending on their origin. I find that using the raw score to control for cognitive skills does not result in any significantly different estimates of the unexplained component of the gap compared to when cognitive skills are not controlled for. However, once cognitive skills by origin of skill are used in place of total cognitive skills, the results change substantially for three of the five countries examined.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Econ Humanities Arts & Social Sci, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Sakellariou, C (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Econ Humanities Arts & Social Sci, 04-64,14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",acsake@ntu.edu.sg,,"Sakellariou, Chris/0000-0003-3299-4348",,,,,26,0,0,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

If price stickiness is introduced into the model, then the model replicates a low policy interest rate during a housing boom as an endogenous reaction to a low inflation rate, given a Taylor rule.

This paper implements ALP growth decomposition that is generalized to output in constant prices and to output in chained prices (i.e., chained volume measure or CVM) and exactly additive since with either output the sum of contributions exactly equals actual ALP growth. It compares this generalized exactly additive decomposition (GEAD) to the traditional (TRAD) ALP growth decomposition devised for output in constant prices. The results show GEAD and TRAD are exactly additive when output is in constant prices, but GEAD is exactly additive while TRAD is not when output is in CVM. Also, GEAD components are empirically purer than or analytically superior to those from TRAD. Moreover, considering that contributions to ALP growth can be classified by industry or region each year over many years, GEAD provides a more well-grounded picture over time of industrial or regional transformation than TRAD. Therefore, GEAD should replace TRAD in practice.","Philippine Inst Dev Studies, Makati 1229, Philippines",,"Dumagan, JC (通讯作者)，Philippine Inst Dev Studies, 106 Amorsolo St, Makati 1229, Philippines.",jdumagan@mail.pids.gov.ph,,,,,,,15,18,18,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We introduce a small-open-economy extension of the volatility spill-over model proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). Based on generalised variance decompositions (Pesaran and Shin, 1998) of a vector autoregressive model, this approach combines bidirectional spillovers exchanged by domestic assets with volatility injections imported from shocks to the global financial system. The analysis relates to a sample of daily observations ranging from October 1996 to June 2010. The estimated spillover levels are time-varying, and increase during domestic and foreign crises. Average domestic spillovers of 38% exceed average foreign spillovers of 4.7%, and maximum domestic spillovers estimated for the United States for a similar sample period (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012). These findings suggest a high degree of systemic risk in SA and, furthermore, that this risk is predominantly related to country-specific factors.

This is particularly the case if output-based allocation (OBA) of quotas is used. Gas power production is then substantially higher than if quotas are grandfathered.

This article is based on a detailed survey of the entire VC industry between 1989-2010. It demonstrates that while there was a relatively strong correlation between the allocation of capital to VC&PE funds and the capital flow into the Budapest Stock Exchange, the changes in investment activities were closely related to election years. Investments had been hampered primarily not by the shortage of capital, but by a lack of demand and attractive business plans. The article illustrates the different roles and approaches of global, regional and country VC&PE funds in Hungary. It points out that VC investments hardly satisfied their principal function or mission, namely to support innovative start-up and small businesses. Government interventions in the VC market proved to be ineffective as well. Similarly to the whole region, the Hungarian market profited from a transitory situation in the case of high-value PE transactions between 2007 and 2008, at the beginning of the crisis, when the investment problems in Western Europe had yet not extended to the CEE region. From 2009 onward, however, the crisis has resulted in a drop in investments despite the significant amount of uninvested capital accumulated in recent years. As to the prospects for 2013, the early-stage VC segment in Hungary is expected to flourish owing to the Jeremie funds, while the high-value buyout segment of the market will suffer from both the euro zone debt crisis and the loss of transparency in economic policy.","Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Res Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Karsai, J (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Res Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.",judit.karsai@krtk.mta.hu,"Karsai, Judit/AGE-9666-2022","Karsai, Judit/0000-0002-6364-4917",,,,,25,3,3,0,28,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

However, a rise in the pegged rate is sure to depress the balanced-growth rate under the regime of inflation rate targeting.

Countries try to attract mobile capital in order to foster economic development, albeit FDI might increase regional inequality since the many different regions of a country usually do not receive FDI in equal measure. A conflict emerges between efficiency and redistribution. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of foreign direct investment on regional inequalities. First, the Chinese case is analyzed as an introductory example. FDI has increased regional inequalities in China after the economic reforms in the 1980s, but the effect has vanished - if not reversed since the end of the 1990s. Second, the major contribution of the paper is to analyze cross-country time-series data on FDI and regional inequalities. Based on a unique panel data set of regional inequalities covering 55 countries at different stages of development, I find net FDI inflows to increase regional inequality in low and middle income countries, while there are no negative redistributional consequences in high income economies. The analysis also shows that the observable higher mobility of individuals in highly developed countries as well as government policies are likely to mitigate the negative redistributional impact of FDI on regional inequality. Insofar, the cross-country data supports the lessons from the Chinese case with respect to the reducing effect development has on the negative impact from FDI on regional inequality.

Economic theory focuses on two main explanations: common shocks and common transmission mechanisms.

First, we provide an in-depth analysis of the Greek economy, summarizing crucial aspects and trends by means of relevant econometric techniques such as business cycles extraction and periodization based on filtering, spectral analysis and causality tests. Next, we assess the long-run equilibriums of the Greek economy with the rest of the E.U. countries and the U.S. economy by means of a Vector Error Correction model. Our results imply a significant shift in the long-run equilibriums of the Greek economy towards increasing convergence rates with the U.S. economy after the implementation of the common monetary policy and increasing convergence rates towards the peripheral countries of the E.M.U. Also, the Greek GDP fluctuations are found to be caused, to a certain extent, by the EMU and US fluctuations, implying a transmission mechanism of business cycles from the EMU and the US to the Greek economy.

We derive a three-sector Cobb-Douglas GDP function including three goods (agriculture, manufacturing, and services) and three factors (capital, labor, and land). It is very difficult to derive the Stolper-Samuelson theorem in the three-sector version. But we derive it numerically. By applying the empirical factor income share across sectors, we show that an increase in the relative agricultural goods price in terms of manufacturing goods decreases the real interest rate and the wage rate while it increases the land rent.

Labor supply of health care professionals in China,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health care professionals; Labor supply; Wage elasticity; China,PANEL-DATA; MARKET; WORK; NURSES; MONOPSONY,"This paper estimates the labor supply functions for health care professionals in China using Census-based data in 2005. The rapid economic growth and population aging in China led to a substantial increase in the demand for health care services and the derived demand for health care professionals in recent years. However, the increase in the supply of doctors and nurses lags behind the growth in demand, raising the question of whether the excess demand should be met by expanding the health care manpower or by inducing the existing personnel to work more hours through wage increase. Our findings indicate that wage rate adjustment has a significant impact on the length of working time among the self-employed practitioners (with an estimated short-run elasticity of 0.575), while the labor supply of hospital employees is inelastic due to their fixed payment scheme. Instead, hours worked in the employee group are related to non-wage factors such as asset holdings and the hospital ownership type. An important policy implication of our study is that adjustments of labor compensation methods and hospital ownership structure are potentially effective approaches for coping with the excess demand for health care professionals and improving the quality of health care in China.

To address endogeneity, the paper uses instrumental variables, first-difference, propensity-score matching and nonparametric bounding methods. We apply these methods to a panel dataset from South Korea, the Korea Education Longitudinal Study. The results show that the true effect of private tutoring remains, at most, modest. Instrumental variables (first-difference) estimates suggest that a 10-percent increase in expenditure raises a test score by 0.03 standard deviations or 1.1 percent (0.002 standard deviations or 0.08 percent). Matching estimates imply that the same amount of increase in expenditure leads to a 0.33 to 0.72 percent higher average test score. The tightest bounds of the effect of tutoring reveal that a 10-percent increase in expenditure improves the test score by a low of 0 to a high of 2.01 percent, while statistical tests fail to rule out zero effects. The modest effects of private tutoring found in the present study are comparable to the effects of public school expenditures on test scores and earnings estimated in previous studies.","[Ryu, Deockhyun; Kang, Changhui] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, 221 Heukseok Dong Dongjak Gu, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",ckang@cau.ac.kr; dhryu@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,37,44,53,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The main aim of this paper is to analyze whether the quality of BCS indicators in transition countries is comparable to the quality of those in developed European countries. This paper provides several extensions to other related BCS studies: (1) it is the first empirical paper to observe each specific BCS indicator and its sector-related macroeconomic variable at the EU level; (2) the data set is extensive, comprising all EU members; and (3) the analysis is based on the recent panel vector autoregressive methodology. It is found that new member states' indicators exhibit pronounced predictive properties and can be used as leading indicators of related macroeconomic variables for even four quarters ahead. This shows that they are as efficient as the indicators in EU15 and that the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys is fully justified on its fiftieth jubilee.","[Soric, Petar; Cizmesija, Mirjana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Skrabic, Blanka] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Dept Quantitat Methods, Split, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Split,"Soric, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",,"Skrabic Peric, Blanka/D-4976-2017; Soric, Petar/AAB-9026-2019; Cizmesija, Mirjana/L-1379-2019; Čižmešija, Mirjana/I-6984-2015","Skrabic Peric, Blanka/0000-0002-7448-3821; Soric, Petar/0000-0002-6773-264X; Cizmesija, Mirjana/0000-0002-9873-7291; Čižmešija, Mirjana/0000-0002-9873-7291",,,,,26,11,11,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

By incorporating risk averse investors who trade with an emerging economy, the present model explains a larger proportion and volatility of the spread between sovereign bonds and riskless assets than the standard model with risk neutral investors. The paper shows that if investors have DARA preferences, then the emerging economy's default risk, capital flows, and bond prices are a function not only of the fundamentals of the economy but also of the level of financial wealth and risk aversion of international investors. In particular, as investors become wealthier or less risk averse, the emerging economy becomes less credit constrained. As a result, the emerging economy's default risk is lower, and its bond prices and capital inflows are higher. Additionally, with risk averse investors, the risk premium in the asset prices of the sovereign countries can be decomposed into two components: a base premium that compensates the investors for the probability of default and an excess premium that compensates them for taking the risk of default.

The availability of scores in standardized tests for Brazilian universities helps a lot with this task since they provide a widely accepted output measure. The difference between the scores of last-year and first-year students in ENADE is used to measure performance. There exists an entrance exam in Brazilian universities where they can screen out their students. Therefore we believe that students' characteristics should be considered a non-discretionary input and consequently explain the output.

We use hedonic price regressions in order to explain the price of classical music manuscripts by several characteristics. The paper shows that the 'trace' of the composer (e.g. whether the manuscript is fully or partly in the hand of the composer or in a scribal hand), the artistic value of the composition, the number of pages, the period (Baroque, Classical, etc.), and of course the name of the composer and the relative scarcity of his manuscripts, are all characteristics that contribute to explain the hammer price of these manuscripts. However, parameter estimates for characteristics such as the type of music (symphony, opera, etc.) and whether the manuscript is the complete work or some fragment (say, one movement) are not statistically significant. The paper also estimates a hedonic price index that provides a measure of the average returns and (high) risk of collecting and investing in music manuscripts.","[Georges, Patrick] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Seckin, Aylin] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34440 Istanbul, Turkey",University of Ottawa; Istanbul Bilgi University,"Georges, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 55 Laurier E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",pgeorges@uottawa.ca; aylin.seckin@bilgi.edu.tr,,"SECKIN, ZENNUBE AYLIN/0000-0003-4139-2728",,,,,57,9,9,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,,,J CULT ECON,J.

We consider a housing market with loss-averse sellers and anchoring buyers in a dynamic setting. We show that when both cognitive biases are present, changes in house prices are predicted by price dispersion and trade volume. Using a sample of housing transactions in Hong Kong from 1992 to 2006, we find that price dispersion and transaction volume are, indeed, powerful predictors of housing return.

Several explanations have been provided by the previous literature: large fraction of preannuitized wealth in retirees' portfolios; adverse selection; bequest motives: and medical expense uncertainty. This paper uses a quantitative model to assess the importance of these impediments to annuitization and also studies three newer explanations: government safety net in terms of means-tested transfers; illiquidity of housing wealth; and restrictions on minimum amount of investment in annuities. This paper shows that quantitatively four explanations play a big role in reducing annuity demand: preannuitized wealth, minimum annuity purchase requirement, illiquidity of housing wealth, and bequest motives. The annuity purchase involves big upfront investment, especially if there is a minimum purchase restriction. This is binding for many, especially if housing is illiquid and part of wealth is preannuitized. While bequest motives significantly reduce the overall annuity demand, the model with a strong bequest motive cannot match the empirical fact that high-income people have the highest demand for annuities.

Our analysis of savings behavior shows that the dispersion in survival estimates is primarily explained by individuals disagreeing on the survival probability and not by their true awareness of the underlying uncertainty.

Results demonstrate that preferences for consolidation vary considerably across individuals along economically informed dimensions. First, voters behave rationally in the sense that self-interest matters. Second, voters care for their children (but this motive seems less important than one might presume). Third, voters care strongly for how the consolidation burden is distributed among the current generation this is at least as important as the intergenerational aspect. Forth, the lack of credibility of fiscal policy plans is a serious impediment to voters' support for consolidation. These results imply that fiscal consolidation plans should be fair and that the imposition of credible fiscal policy rules could increase voters' support of consolidations.","Oesterreich Natl Bank, Econ Studies Div, A-1011 Vienna, Austria",,"Stix, H (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Natl Bank, Econ Studies Div, POB 61, A-1011 Vienna, Austria.",helmut.stix@oenb.at,,,,,,,21,22,23,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2013,66,1,,,,,102,129,,10.1111/kykl.12013,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,066ZV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313262000006,0

But recently, some authors have argued that the relationship is more complex than previously acknowledged: property rights reforms might, for example, not per se lead to increases in observed growth rates. This paper contributes to the debate by emphasizing that the mere promise of secure property rights is unlikely to have any effects unless accompanied by some commitment to enforce these rights that is perceived as credible by private actors. An independent judiciary is interpreted as a tool that permits governments to make credible commitments to abide by the law. We provide empirical evidence for a positive growth effect of constitutional property rights, once the judicial system is independent enough to guarantee their enforcement.

In the second semester of 2011, increased significant dynamic correlations suggest the presence of volatility spillovers from the math capital equity markets. Although all DCC models can capture contagion, seen as a significant increase in the co-movements of stock index returns, the AGD-DCC model is more sensitive to unexpected changes in returns.

In the first part, we propose a review of the literature on the subject, describing both theoretical and empirical models. In the second part, based on Filardo's approach, we construct a reduced-form model for the Euro Area, addressing the need to include the financial stability objective into the ECB monetary policy decisions. The purpose of the paper is to see whether the ECB decisions can be improved if policymakers systematically react to financial instability signals. The novelty of the paper is the introduction of an aggregate financial instability index in the augmented Taylor's rule that is a part of the proposed model. Our results show that, since the ECB setup until nowadays, the monetary policy decisions were influenced by the financial instability level, as indicated by the optimal policy rate. However, at the beginning and at the end of the analysed interval, we observe a discrepancy between the real key rate and the proposed optimal policy rule. More precisely, for the period 1999-2001, the model shows that the optimal rate ranged bellow the key rate, fact which shows that the ECB has intentionally fixed its initial interest rate to a much higher level in order to strengthen its credibility. In the same line, in 2009 the ECB should have decreased the key rate below the level of 1% to better overcome the lack of liquidity on the market. Our results also show that, towards the end of the analysed period (2010-2011), the ECB should have considerably increased the key rate to respond to inflation threats.","Politehn Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",Polytechnic University of Timisoara,"Albulescu, CT (通讯作者)，Politehn Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania.",claudiu.albulescu@ct.upt.ro,"ALBULESCU, Claudiu Tiberiu/AAI-7850-2020","ALBULESCU, Claudiu Tiberiu/0000-0003-2875-1749",,,,,34,6,8,1,16,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The most striking restructuring measure receiving much attention was dramatic labour downsizing: until 2004 employment was reduced by 60%. But other overlooked measures are the significant restructuring of workforce composition, and important changes in railroads' workplace organization practices and corporate culture. To better understand this successful occupational restructuring, I investigate labour inputs substitutional relationships by using a translog variable cost model. Labour is decomposed into six employee categories rather than traditional production-nonproduction breakdown to estimate inputs elasticities of substitution. The data investigated is a unique firm-level dataset on the US freight Class I Railroads, covering a 22-year period, which allows this fine-grained analysis. I also document railroad workplace organization practices relating to results and reflecting changes in railroads corporate culture. I find strong substitutability between managerial positions and transportation employees, pointing to achievement of better command and control of operations; a high degree of complementarity between the most skilled employee categories and the strongest substitute relationship between transportation and maintenance of Ways&Structures groups.","Champagne Sch Management, Grp ESC Troyes, Dept Econ, F-10002 Troyes, France",,"Angulo, LP (通讯作者)，Champagne Sch Management, Grp ESC Troyes, Dept Econ, 217 Ave Pierre Brossolette,BP 710, F-10002 Troyes, France.",laura.padilla@get-mail.fr,"Padilla-Angulo, Laura/P-2543-2019","Padilla-Angulo, Laura/0000-0003-4011-6115",,,,,28,2,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that the consumption-wealth ratio does predict future stock returns, but the evidence is weaker than that from US data, and the source of predictability is limited to observations after the collapse of the asset bubble at the beginning of the 1990s. The consumption-wealth ratio also helps to explain cross-sectional Japanese stock returns. The second contribution of the paper is that we propose new consumption-wealth ratio that more explicitly deal with household real estate wealth utilizing Japanese aggregate-level data. Such real estate augmented consumption-wealth ratio perform better than the consumption-wealth ratio calculated with only financial wealth data.

There is little empirical evidence of such activity. In this article, we investigate which factors that may influence physicians' choice of work between the public hospital sector and elsewhere. An exceptionally high wage increase in 1996 for one group of hospital physicians (physician assistants) serves as a natural experiment, and we analyse whether wages in general and this reform in particular have affected physicians' external earnings. For physician assistants we find that higher wages at public hospitals affect negatively both the decisions to earn income externally, and level of income once active. For chief physicians, on the other hand, there was no such response to the wage increase. Several hospital specific factors representing job specific work characteristics also matter for physicians' decisions to earn income externally.","[Askildsen, Jan Erik; Holmas, Tor Helge] Uni Res, Uni Rokkan Ctr, N-5015 Bergen, Norway",,"Askildsen, JE (通讯作者)，Uni Res, Uni Rokkan Ctr, Nygardsgaten 5, N-5015 Bergen, Norway.",jan.askildsen@econ.uib.no,,,,,,,17,5,5,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

For the whole process of formalization it can be achieved a computer system which aims to improve the respective process, the development of formal models for other economic processes and beyond To design an useful computer system for analyzing and optimizing the economic processes based on formal languages it is suggested resorting to standard modeling language proposed by the Object Management Group, respectively the Unified Modeling Language - UML.

This indicates that ignoring structural breaks can lead to model misspecification, which can bias (upward) shocks' persistence measures.

There is a possibility to describe the evolution and impact on the environment By using the first precedence of this analysis we MO find the frequency of observed changes In the area. The range (distance) changes of selected variables in the area we find by using multiple precedence. The article demonstrates the method on the example of road access to regions of the Czech Republic. Comparing different types of region's roads were created directions border flows. These flows were described by binary precedence matrices. Square precedence matrices have been calculated for all regions and groups of roads. Thus were made multiple precedencies. Those precedencies are recorded by matrices, charts and maps. By using the criteria there can be set a boundary threshold. For the basic research the threshold is set around the average values. To determine the direction of flow of the individual variables can be used multicriteria threshold. For the demonstration of the method there is applied the difference of observed variables averages. Referred method allows comparing the increases and decreases in the values of selected road network. The article compares the percentage ratios of the sums given for regions and sums given for road types. For the basic understanding and for demonstration of the method there have been compared the precedence in two categories by quality. Comparison is done on the highway and motorway and from the first to third class local roads. Above mentioned method is further extended for example by the monitoring of border flows or cyclical events. Binary matrices are use for research of the precedence existence.

We examine this proposition by focusing on agricultural trade. Specifically, we ask whether non-tariff barriers (NTBs) are stunting agricultural trade within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a grouping of fifteen countries in West Africa that has removed tariffs on agricultural trade among its members. Our survey of truckers in Tambacounda (Senegal) in August 2009 found evidence of extensive bribery by police and border officials, effectively representing a barrier to trading. We estimate a unit-elastic structural gravity model of agricultural trade, using data from 135 countries for 2000, 2003 and 2006, and employing Tobit and other types of structural specification. A robust result emerges: agricultural trade among the countries of ECOWAS is higher than one would expect. This does not mean that there are no NTBs within ECOWAS, but it does imply that any such barriers are less harmful to agricultural trade in ECOWAS than in the world as a whole. Similar effects are found for the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the South African Development Community (SADC). This suggests that African countries are not averse to agricultural trade, and local traders have been effective at exploiting trade opportunities.","[Haughton, Jonathan; Makpayo, Kossi] Suffolk Univ, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Haughton, Jonathan] Beacon Hill Inst, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Cissokho, Lassana; Seck, Abdoulaye] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Dakar, Senegal",Suffolk University; University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar,"Haughton, J (通讯作者)，Suffolk Univ, 8 Ashburton Pl, Boston, MA 02108 USA.",jonathan.haughton@suffolk.edu,,,,,,,35,9,9,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

The case of US states,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Corruption; Institutional maturity; Compliance; Accountability; Ethics in the US,UNITED-STATES; GOVERNMENT; COUNTRIES; BRIBERY; GROWTH,"This paper applies a novel methodology to measure corruption levels in U.S. states, leading to insights which could be useful to policymakers in their effort to reduce unethical behavior. The level of public corruption is difficult to quantify because much of it goes undetected and because different cultures and jurisdictions have different definitions and different degrees of tolerance for corruption. When comparing corruption across countries, in the absence of another solution, this difficulty has been addressed by using survey-based methods. Within countries, because of the greater homogeneity in culture, institutions, and legal frameworks, other measures have been used, such as public official convictions per capita. This paper suggests that even these more objective measures of corruption may lead to distortions, describes an alternative methodology based on the analysis of public official non-compliance as compared to general population non-compliance, and illustrates its use. The method is based on modeling an institution as a system (and corruption as a failure in that system) and using time-tested statistical quality control techniques to examine its incidence. When applied to states of the U.S. Union, the methodology flags some states as more corrupt than estimated through other methods and, conversely, identifies other states as less corrupt than anticipated. The paper thus offers a tool and suggestions to support policy-makers in their efforts to evaluate the prevalence of unethical practices and to reduce corruption levels.

Using insights from recent developments in nonparametric econometrics, we show how conditional efficiency scores can be estimated using a tailored mixed kernel function with a data-driven bandwidth selection. The methodology is applied to the sample of Dutch pupils from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Programme for International Student Assessment (OECD PISA) data set. We estimate students' performance and the influence of its background characteristics. The results of our application show that several family-and student-specific characteristics have a statistically significant effect on the educational efficiency, while school-level variables do not have impact on performance.","[De Witte, Kristof] Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res TIER, Maastricht, Netherlands; [De Witte, Kristof] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Louvain, Belgium; [Kortelainen, Mika] Govt Inst Econ Res VATT, Helsinki, Finland; [Kortelainen, Mika] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England",Maastricht University; KU Leuven; VATT Institute for Economic Research; University of Manchester,"De Witte, K (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res TIER, Maastricht, Netherlands.",kristof.dewitte@econ.kuleuven.be,,"De Witte, Kristof/0000-0003-0505-8642",,,,,31,115,117,2,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By contrast, in real life punishments are often meted out only insofar as punishers are entitled to punish and punishees deserve to be punished. We provide an experimental test for this 'legitimate punishment' institution and show that it yields substantial benefits to cooperation and efficiency gains, compared to a classic, 'vigilante justice' institution. We also focus on the role of feedback and we interestingly find that removing the information over high contributors' choices is sufficient to generate a dramatic decline in cooperation rates and earnings. This interaction result implies that providing feedback over virtuous behavior in the group is necessary to make a legitimate punishment scheme effective. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the study empirically explores whether tourism activity leads on the long run to economic growth, or, alternatively, whether economic expansion drives tourism growth, or indeed a bi-directional relationship exists between the two variables. To this end, cointegration analysis, exogeneity and causality tests are applied to quarterly data for the period 1990 - 2011. The findings show the existence of a cointegrating relationship between each real per capita GDP and tourism Even though the evidence supports the tourism-led growth hypothesis for all the countries, the elasticity of real per capita GDP with respect to tourism activity differs between them. The long run equations estimated (Vector Error Correction models) show that the higher elasticity corresponds to the smaller countries, Paraguay and Uruguay (both nearly 0.4). On the contrary, the smaller elasticity corresponds to the mayor economy of the regional block, Brazil (about 0.10). The elasticity for Argentina is around 0.30. In almost all the countries, the exogeneity and causality analysis do not allow rejecting the hypothesis that tourism activity drives economic growth unidirectionally.

Bradbury's critique of our 2011 Labour Economics paper examining the peer effect of Jose Canseco. None of Bradbury's criticisms have any merit, and many reveal a severe misunderstanding of basic econometrics. For example, Bradbury accuses us of not deleting enough years from the sample, not censoring the sample on an outcome measure, and not controlling for average performance measures for each year explicitly when we have already included dummy variables for each year. Bradbury claims that we distort our findings, but he overlooks the parts of our paper that do not fit his thesis. Bradbury reexamines the performance of Canseco's teammates empirically and argues that our results are sensitive. However, this should not be surprising because Bradbury performs a completely different and highly flawed analysis. In particular, he fails to realize that he is estimating very different parameters which are difficult, if not impossible, to interpret. His specification and estimation are based on very restrictive assumptions which are not necessary, nor are they justified or even acknowledged. After examining every one of Bradbury's attacks on our paper, we conclude that none provides a convincing reason to reject our conclusions.","[Gould, Eric D.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Kaplan, Todd R.] Univ Haifa, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Kaplan, Todd R.] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Haifa; University of Exeter,"Gould, ED (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",mseric@mscc.huji.ac.il; isdr@toddkaplan.com,"Kaplan, Todd/AAB-3204-2020; Gould, Eric/R-8785-2019","Kaplan, Todd/0000-0001-5307-743X;",,,,,5,0,0,0,11,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

Inventories create a significant portion of the assets of manufacturing enterprises. They may be purchased externally or created within a company. It is necessary to devote a special attention to inventories created through the company's internal activities. The method of their valuation is based on the characteristics of the production process. Simultaneously, the valuation approach must be such as to avoid overvaluation or undervaluation of assets. The selected method of valuation of products does not affect only the value of assets, but it will be significantly reflected by changes of inventories into the economic result, and thus Into the tax base. Integrally, it will have an impact on the fundamental financial statements and the related calculations of indicators of financial management In specific production conditions of a given company, a case study demonstrates how the economic result may be impacted by adoption of either of the two alternative valuation methods. Currently, the company evaluates its self-produced inventories on the basis of direct costs. In correspondence with the nature of the manufacturing process, however, the company could also include their overheads into the valuation process.","[Hasprova, Olga; Pur, David] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,olga.hasprova@tul.cz; david.pur@seznam.cz,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,185,193,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300019,0

In this paper, we have developed an agent-based model to study whether resource scarcity is likely to lead to an increase in the appropriation of resources in environments where adaptive agents can allocate a fraction of their effort to predatory behavior. By enriching a production and conflict model through the introduction of separate product and resource appropriations, we show how boundedly-rational agents capable of learning can update their adaptive expectations and optimize their allocation decisions using a genetic framework. Arising from a few simple rules, the results show a high level of complexity in agents' allocation behavior with outputs ranging from no statistically significant allocation changes to widespread conflict in the environment, depending on the initial conditions and the nature of the scenarios. Overall the results support previous empirical findings that the main link between resource scarcity and conflict is through changes in the distribution of resources rather than their overall availability.

Uncertain variables are employed to describe the security returns. Using expected value and risk index as measurements of portfolio return and risk respectively, we propose two portfolio optimization models for an existing portfolio in two cases, taking minimum transaction lot, transaction cost, and lower and upper bound constraints into account. In one case the riskless asset can be both borrowed and lent freely, and in another case the riskless asset can only be lent and the borrowing of riskless asset is not allowed. The adjusting models are converted into their crisp equivalents, enabling the users to solve them with currently available programming solvers. For the sake of illustration, numerical examples in two cases are also provided. The results show that under the same predetermined maximum tolerable risk level the expected return of the optimal portfolio is smaller when the riskless asset can only be lent than when the riskless asset can be both borrowed and lent freely.

The concept of crisis in this period became the holder of the absolute record in terms of its presence in the mass media around the world. Daily information on the crisis negatively affect the course of events in global markets. Investors and consumers are exposed to uncertainty, which is not conducive to growth. The situation is similar in the real estate market, even when compared with the years 2008 to 2010 we see a slight recovery. The recovery came after a period of sharp decline, which was recorded in the real estate industry. Demand for real estate in the period of crisis did not fall because the market was saturated, but because many companies have planned to move to new premises were to stop any such decision on its headquarters, also now need to focus more on survival, maintaining market share and so on. That they need are still there, but the time parked on the sidelines. A similar situation is in demand by households. Household demand for housing has fallen partially due to the general hysteria, but in part to reduced household income.

This test is a direct and robust test of a number of 'random walk models' available in the literature. This procedure also enables us to differentiate among 'strong tax smoothing', 'weak tax smoothing' and 'no-tax smoothing', all of which are consistent with the random walk behaviour of a tax rate. Application of this test to Australia, Canada, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the UK and the US show evidence in support of weak forms of tax smoothing.","[Abeysinghe, Tilak] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Jayawickrama, Ananda] Univ Peradeniya, Dept Econ, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka",National University of Singapore; University of Peradeniya,"Abeysinghe, T (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Block AS2,05-11,1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",tilakabey@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,35,3,3,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper introduces three new features to the analysis: trade and FDI barriers, firm heterogeneity and political economy considerations in setting patent policies. Based on calibration, we find that there would be global under-protection of patent rights when there is no international policy coordination. The empirical fact that firm revenues follow a fat-tailed distribution implies that the barriers to exploit inventions internationally are quite low, despite the fact that only a small fraction of firms sell overseas and an even smaller fraction of firms carry out FDI as a result of trade barriers. Furthermore, requiring all countries to harmonize their patent standards with the equilibrium standard of the most innovative country (the US) does not lead to global over-protection of patent rights.

The confidence intervals of these half-life estimates, however, are extremely wide, with lower bounds of about 1 year and upper bounds of infinity. We extend median-unbiased estimation to the Dickey-Fuller Generalized Least Square (DF-GLS) regression of Elliott et al. (1996). We find that combining median-unbiased estimation with this regression has the potential to tighten confidence intervals for the half-lives. Using long-horizon real exchange rate data, we find that the typical lower bound of the confidence intervals for median-unbiased half-lives is just below 3 years. Thus, while previous confidence intervals for median-unbiased half-lives are consistent with virtually anything, our tighter confidence intervals are inconsistent with economic models with nominal rigidities as candidates for explaining the observed behaviour of real exchange rates and move us away from solving the PPP puzzle.","[Lopez, Claude] Banque France, DGEI DERIE SEMSI, F-75049 Paris, France; [Murray, Christian J.; Papell, David H.] Univ Houston, Dept Econ, Houston, TX USA",European Central Bank; Bank of France; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Lopez, C (通讯作者)，Banque France, DGEI DERIE SEMSI, F-75049 Paris, France.",claude.lopez@banque-france.fr,"Lopez, Claude/C-3053-2013","Lopez, Claude/0000-0002-6969-9193",,,,,31,4,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper incorporates money illusion into a stochastic continuous-time monetary model of endogenous growth. We model an agent's money illusion behavior by assuming that he maximizes nonstandard utility derived from both nominal and real quantities. Money illusion affects an agent's perception of the growth and riskiness of real wealth and distorts his consumption/savings decisions. It influences long-run growth via this channel. We show that the welfare cost of money illusion is negligible, whereas its impact on long-run growth is noticeable even if the degree of money illusion is low. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Both fairness concerns and offshoring of jobs done by unskilled workers create the overhiring effect for skilled workers. An increase in the concern for fairness in the closed economy increases the cost of hiring unskilled workers and increases the unemployment rates of both types of workers; however, wage inequality decreases. In the open economy case, an increase in the concern for fairness leads to greater offshoring which prevents skilled unemployment from increasing, but the unemployment of unskilled workers increases. A reduction in the cost of offshoring also increases offshoring and increases the unemployment of unskilled workers, but has a positive effect on skilled workers. Due to the presence of an overhiring effect in the hiring of skilled workers for both offshoring and non-offshoring firms, skilled workers experience higher wages and lower unemployment. The opposite movements in skilled and unskilled unemployment render the net effect ambiguous. Even though wage inequality increases, the impact on the wages of unskilled workers is ambiguous.","[Ranjan, Priya] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Mitra, Devashish] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Mitra, Devashish] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Mitra, Devashish] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Syracuse University; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Ranjan, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",dmitra@maxwell.syr.edu; pranjan@uci.edu,,,,,,,30,3,4,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This paper highlights that after changing two assumptions in the standard model the optimal tax drops by almost half. First, the utility function is altered such that it implies that an agent's Frisch labor supply elasticity is constant over his lifetime. Second, the government is allowed to tax accidental bequests and ordinary capital income at separate rates. Quantifying the effect of these assumptions is important because the first has limited empirical evidence and the second confounds a motive for taxing capital and accidental bequests.

Kaizen is of special importance in times of crisis, because culture of continuous improvement allows each employee to make changes, from minor improvements to strategic changes. Kaizen in the long term may contribute to improving the efficiency, effectiveness, reduce costs and consequently to improve the competitiveness of enterprise. This approach is particularly important in the era of internationalization and fierce competition. The main objective of this paper is to present the process of internationalization and its impact on the selection of management method in Polish companies, which is kaizen. Major objectives of research were to explore and confront theoretical knowledge with practical people who indirectly or directly deal with lean in the enterprise on the subject of the culture of continuous improvement in Polish enterprises, opportunities for change and improvements. One of conclusions of the research is that systematic search for and implementation of improvements has a positive effect on the elimination of losses in the company, but also for proper fit into the environment.

These institutions have now more than ever the power to stimulate business competitiveness thanks to their ability to foster innovation, attract new businesses, and provide continuous flow of information, knowledge and, last but not least, to improve the workforce. Therefore, these institutions should be seen in the last few years as the agents of a valuable source of innovation and skilled people who can contribute to higher level of local and global competitiveness. It is expected from them to use an innovative approach in their teaching methods and curriculum to ensure more flexibility and creativity for the needs of the business world. However, most of them recognize their unique and essential opportunity to change only very slowly and without any formulation of clear marks to this issue. This article deals with the issues related to the current situation and the role of higher institutions (especially universities), and points out their emerging innovative approach in order to contribute as a significant element to business competitiveness. To better understand the current position it is necessary to prepare an appropriate platform for discussion and research of existing organisational structure, practice barriers of, change and suggest their core implementation. The current situation is evaluated according to the results of the empirical researches made by the authors. A special emphasis is placed on the innovative approach in the teaching methods based on the needs of business practice.

Lately, based on data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor about entrepreneurial activity in the world, an empirical analysis is carried out in order to show some existing differences between market entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. The final aims of this work are, on the one hand, to encourage economic authorities to design policies which support the social start-up process and the social business persistence and, on the other hand, to encourage economists of being aware of the importance to teach and research Economics from a different perspective.","[Santos, Francisco J.] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Barroso, Maria de la O.; Guzman, Carmen] Univ Huelva, Huelva, Spain",University of Sevilla; Universidad de Huelva,"Santos, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",fjsantos@us.es; barroso@uhu.es; carmen.guzman@dege.uhu.es,"Santos, Francisco J./E-8709-2010; PENG, Xiao-bao/J-4466-2012; Barroso-González, María de la O/AAG-7518-2020; Guzman, Carmen/I-8025-2018","Santos, Francisco J./0000-0003-4453-7048; Barroso-González, María de la O/0000-0002-1507-4745; Guzman, Carmen/0000-0002-5290-8841",,,,,47,6,6,1,28,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Therefore, it is important for policy makers to understand the relationship between inflation and economic growth in order to make sound policies. If inflation is detrimental to economic growth, then policy makers should aim for low rates of inflation. This leads to a question: how low should the inflation rate be? Previous research in the non-linearities of the inflation-growth relationship has found that a positive relationship exists when the inflation rate is low and a negative relationship when the inflation rate is high. This implies the existence of a threshold level of inflation at which the sign switches. In this paper we use panel data for the period 1980-2008 to examine the inflation-growth nexus in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region and to endogenously determine the threshold level of inflation. To deal with problems of endogeneity and heterogeneity, the paper uses the Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) method developed by Gonzalez et al. (2005) to examine the non-linearities in the inflation-growth nexus. This technique further estimates the smoothness of the transition from a low inflation to a high inflation regime. The findings reveal a threshold level of 18.9%, above which inflation is detrimental to economic growth in the SADC region. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that each pattern of adoption motives is followed by particular benefits and drawbacks. In summary, Operationally oriented adopters experience negative, Partners oriented adopter positive and Investing adopters neutral to positive influence of adoption to operational and business performance. We explain these findings relying on institutional characteristics of Lithuanian economy and characteristics of adopters. This paper provides more nuanced understanding of patterns of adoption of ISO 9000 series standards transcending common functional-institutional framework. Also, it reveals that functional motivation to adopt the standards produces negative influence to operational and business performance of organizations in Lithuania, indicating of under researched institutional factors preventing successful internalizations of quality management practices constituting the standards.

Brands are identified as market assets and as a part of relational capital. However, is it the same for dormant brands? Are they forgotten intangible assets? Dormant brands as well as brand awareness can be seen as intangible assets because they are immaterial and invisible. However, this issue is little researched, especially from the perspective of intellectual capital. The revival of such a brand is sometimes successful, sometimes not. The paper investigates what factors influence the success of brand revival. It also explores how to discover the potential (attractiveness) of a brand which had been unused for a long time. There is the need to broaden the definition of relational capital. It is often associated with knowledge embedded in relationships with customers (and other stakeholders). However, when it comes to dormant brands this knowledge about customers (values, purchase intentions) is uncertain. Over years they have changed. It is hard to say anything about stable relationships with customers. Data about market share, brand awareness, customer loyalty are all past history. On the other hand, it is still possible to gain 'old' and new customers which in consequence will generate future value for a company. The methods to measure relational (customer) capital are not sufficient when it comes to dormant brands. Literature and research concerning this issue are very scarce. Moreover, in practice, opinions about brand revival are contrary. Thus, the research question becomes: how to measure the value of a dormant brand? The next research question is: when is brand revival successful? In exploring when brand revival is successful or not, two qualitative case studies are being conducted. They concern two Polish brands in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) market which were dormant for some years. An exploratory case study method was used to gain an understanding of which factors determine the value of such a brand and a successful reintroduction to the market. The data collection procedures employed were documentation and archival records. The findings might be interesting for companies which consider reviving a dormant brand. By defining critical factors which distinguish successful and unsuccessful brand revivals it is possible to give guidance on how to measure the value of a dormant brand and create new relational capital.","Bogdan Janski Sch Management & Entrepreneurship, Lomza, Poland",,"Zalesna, A (通讯作者)，Bogdan Janski Sch Management & Entrepreneurship, Lomza, Poland.",aleksandrazalesna@wp.pl,,,,,,,35,0,0,2,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,464,470,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000053,0

Typically, urban areas are less than fully stratified, and the question arises, how much do departures from standard Tiebout assumptions contribute to observed within-neighborhood mixing? This paper quantifies the separate effects of employment geography (via costly commuting) and preferences for housing attributes on neighborhood stratification. It does so using an equilibrium sorting model, estimated with rich Census micro-data. Simulations based on the model and credible preference estimates show that counterfactual reductions in commuting costs lead to marked increases in racial and education segregation and, to a lesser degree, increases in income segregation, given that households now find it easier to locate in neighborhoods with like households. While turning off preferences for housing characteristics increases racial segregation, especially for blacks, doing so reduces income segregation, indicating that heterogeneity in the housing stock serves to stratify households based on ability-to-pay. Further, we show that differences in housing help to accentuate differences in the consumption of local amenities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

I call this outcome aging before affluence. As a result of this demographic transition, China has already passed through its Lewis turning point, and its demographic dividend from the decline in the population dependence ratio is about to end. I identify a potential nexus between aging before affluence and the middle-income trap. China is losing comparative advantage in labor-intensive industries, but China is not ready to gain comparative advantage in technology-intensive and capital-intensive industries. For China to avoid the middle-income trap, it must (1) transform economic growth to a consumption-driven pattern; (2) shift the labor-intensive industries to the central and western regions; and (3) speed up technological catching up.","Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Cai, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, 5 Jianguomennei Dajie, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China.",caifang@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,32,18,19,6,56,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Bibliometrics is a powerful tool that helps to explore, organize and analyze large amounts of information in a quantitative manner. Selecting the most important economic journal focusing on the Chinese economy - the China Economic Review (CER) - we classified and assessed all the (512) articles that have been published in CER from its founding (1989) to December 2010. Based on these articles, and undertaking an exploratory statistical analysis on three databases - a 'bibliographic' database (512 articles), a 'roots' database (over 10 thousand citations), and an 'influence' database (over 3 thousand citations), we concluded that: 1) 'Economic Development, Technological Change, and Growth': 'Economic Systems', and 'International economics' are the most important topics for Chinese economics literature; 2) there is a trend in Chinese economics research for growing 'rigor', associated to a noticeable rise in the weight of formal/mathematical-based articles; 3) the 'International economics' topic does not influence nor is it influenced by Chinese economics literature; and 4) Chinese economics literature is characterized by a certain level of endogamy, given that its range of influence is rather concentrated (geographically) in China and the USA.

We find that the dynamic responses to news shocks identified using a short-run restriction are biased. However, this bias is smaller if news shocks account for most of the variability of the endogenous variable and the economy exhibits strong forward-looking behavior.

We have also provided evidence that exogenous shocks such as the devaluation of the CFA franc, the military coup d',tat, and the civil war have significantly influenced criminal activity in Abidjan. The civil war which occurred in Cte d'Ivoire, while driving to a booming of property crimes, has deterred violent crimes given the crackdown effect of temporary massive presence of military and paramilitary forces in the streets of the city of Abidjan. In addition, using a sample of 1,600 households, our inquiry on the likelihood of crime victimization has pointed out that the risk of being victimized of any kind of crime increases with the income; the fact of being displaced due to the civil war and the decrease in the number of police stations in the neighborhood.","[Kimou, Jose Carlos A.] Univ Cocody Abidjan, Sch Econ, Abidjan 08, Cote Ivoire; [Kimou, Jose Carlos A.] Univ Cocody Abidjan, CIRES, Abidjan 08, Cote Ivoire",Universite Felix Houphouet-Boigny; Universite Felix Houphouet-Boigny,"Kimou, JCA (通讯作者)，Univ Cocody Abidjan, Sch Econ, 08 BP 1295, Abidjan 08, Cote Ivoire.",carlos.kimou@univ-cocody.ci,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

By using values characteristic of a specific segment, the likelihood of creating a successful advertisement increases, which is why stereotypes that exist in a society have a very big influence on advertising content and style. One of the most discussed types of stereotyping is gender stereotyping. Since a culture greatly affects the way gender roles are defined and since most of the conducted research in this area comes from the western world, this study was aimed at exploring the way gender roles are perceived in Croatia. The main goal of the study was to get insight into the way Croatian consumers perceive advertising stereotypes. The theoretical framework was based on Hofstede's masculinity dimension according to which Croatia is a conservative country with traditional values. Through the research it came out that respondents recognized various elements of gender stereotyping such as age, work roles, objectification and the gender of the voice-over. In most cases female respondents recognized gender roles in advertising as negative and stated negative attitudes towards them. On the other hand male respondents recognized mentioned stereotypes but were mainly indifferent to them.","[Vercic, Ana Tkalac] Fac Econ &Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,petraki20@yahoo.com; atkalac@efzg.hr,"Verčič, Ana Tkalac/AAR-5040-2021","Verčič, Ana Tkalac/0000-0002-9538-673X",,,,,25,0,1,6,130,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We diagnose the potential response of Asian economies to the imposition of various climate policies, showing that if we were to equally price carbon across the world roughly half of the abatement would occur in developing Asia. We show that such autarkic measures would be consistent with the policy targets put forward by the Major Economies Forum but would not necessarily be equitable. We thus propose a fragmented cap-and-trade scheme with a specific regional market for developing Asia, the Asian Emission Trading Scheme (Asia ETS). We assess the role of the Asia ETS on the macro-economy and international transfers vis-a-vis the standard case of global trading. Our results indicate that creating two large trading markets would result in small global efficiency losses, while at the same time generating more reasonable regional incentives and transfers.

Specifically, we examine the size and speed of adjustment of bank lending rates to the changes in money market rates by employing various cointegration methods. In addition, we assess the stability of interest rate passthrough during the transition period, including the recent economic crisis. The results reveal the existence of a cointegrating relationship among some of the interest rates. We find that the long-run pass-through is far from complete with the exception of Macedonia. The shortrun adjustment of lending rates is also low and sluggish, implying that the domestic monetary policy may have a limited impact on the interest rate channel. Finally, the econometric investigation provides mixed evidence on the stability of the interest rate pass-through. Therefore, the overall findings of the paper support the view that in small open economies with rigid exchange rates the effectiveness of domestic monetary policy through the interest rate channel is quite limited.

We also find that forward-looking bidding dampens the competition-softening effects of asymmetry: farsighted firms compete more intensely than myopic ones. This can undermine the goal of a bid-preference-style affirmative action program: more farsighted firms respond less to the asymmetry induced via bid preferences.","Oberlin Coll, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA",University System of Ohio; Oberlin College,"Saini, V (通讯作者)，Oberlin Coll, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA.",viplav.saini@oberlin.edu,,,,,,,46,15,20,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

To understand the socioeconomic value of ideology during China's recent history, and the impacts of ideological change. I evaluated the potential links with socioeconomic development by presenting a historical perspective on the changing Chinese ideology. Since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, China has followed a bumpy road created by the contradiction between official government atheism, the lack of an ideology with a strong ethical grounding, and the desire of many people to believe in a higher power (i.e., a divinity). This contradiction may have increased social transaction costs, decreased social stability and economic efficiency, and damaged environmental conservation. Although China has experienced an extraordinary economic boom in the past three decades, the socioeconomic system may be more fragile than is commonly believed because it has been undermined by this ideological confusion. To promote sustainable socioeconomic development, China's government, scientists, and citizens should seek a new ideology that accommodates the desire for more religious freedom by promoting prosocial institutional reform.

We also show that while habit formation destabilizes the macroeconomy by making the balanced growth equilibrium exhibit local indeterminacy, durability in consumption maintains saddle-path stability of the balanced growth equilibrium. We find that the mechanism through which habit formation and durability impose different effects on both the growth-effect of money and the macroeconomic stabilizing properties is such that habit formation and durability influence the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption in opposite directions.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",shchen@mail.ntpu.edu.tw,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,9,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

However, while hierarchies are easily described, too few mathematical tools are available for flexible organizations. In this article, two measures are proposed in order to assess the state and trend of flexible organizations. The first of these measures is based on information waste, which occurs whenever information is classified into categories. The second measure is based on duplication of operations. The underlying idea is that firms have an endogenous drive towards organizational configurations where waste of information and duplication of operations are minimized. However, environmental uncertainty may require some flexibility, which is ensured by cognitive processes that discard some information as well as by parallel undertaking of similar actions.","Univ Bologna, Dept Management Sci, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Fioretti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Management Sci, Bologna, Italy.",guido.fioretti@unibo.it,"Fioretti, Guido/B-9967-2012","Fioretti, Guido/0000-0002-4235-6086",,,,,53,6,9,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In this aspect, I develop a model of international trade based on new trade theory with financial constraints and non-homothetic preferences. With these two modified assumptions, the main findings are i) financial constraints act as trade barriers, ii) the largest amount of trade is between countries that have healthier financial systems in terms of access to loans and iii) financial constraints can cause one way or zero trade. As a result, this paper provides a single framework able to account for all possible patterns (two-way, one-way, and no trade) within the same industry. All these findings have important policy implications for countries suffering from relatively poor financial systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Sensitivity analysis shows that greater demand volatility is associated with the firm investing in larger increments, less frequently. This is in contrast to the conventional wisdom, which is that greater volatility leads to investment in smaller increments, more frequently. Overall, the reduced frequency dominates the greater scale, so that the long-run average rate of investment is a decreasing function of demand volatility. The timing and scale of investment are most sensitive to volatility when there are substantial investment economies of scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The database was constructed by combing energy consumption (and energy price data to construct the energy quality index) from the IEA with economic data (value added, labor employed, and physical capital) from the OECD's Structural Analysis Database. In addition to finding the variables analyzed are panel l(1) and cointegrated for each sector-based panel, the long-run elasticity estimates (from panel FMOLS) indicate the importance of energy quality primarily the shift toward the use of high quality electricity - in these energy-intensive manufacturing sectors. In each case, the elasticity for energy quality is greater than that for conventionally measured energy consumption-sometimes orders of magnitude greater. Indeed, the elasticity of conventionally measured energy consumption is insignificant to very small for three of the five sectors. Also, when using the energy quality measure, the importance of energy consumption relative to the other production factors stands out. Such results are useful for both energy-GDP cointegration/causality modelers and CGE modelers, who may need to estimate elasticities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The investigations have revealed that the reactions of central banks to economic variables depend on the level of the variables, confirming the non-linearity of monetary policy in these countries. However, research into whether monetary policy is non-linear in emerging markets has been hampered by the lack of data, as a stable, modern monetary regime has existed in emerging markets for only a relatively short time. Employing quantile regression, which is not as constrained as other regression methods by the shortness of time series, we investigate the non-linearity of monetary policy in four emerging Asian nations: Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. Our results indicate that monetary policy in all four is non-linear. All display a hump-shaped response to inflation across the quantilespolicy becomes tighter, going from lower to higher quantiles, reaches a peak, and then becomes looser. These results are similar to those found previously in Japan, and likely arise from a desire to limit exchange rate appreciation, as all four countries depend heavily on exports.","[Miles, William] Wichita State Univ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA; [Schreyer, Sam] Ft Hays State Univ, Hays, KS 67601 USA",Wichita State University,"Miles, W (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",William.miles@wichita.edu,,,,,,,25,8,8,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

These results contribute to the literature by providing evidence that the economic cycle also influences believers' prayers and publicly acknowledged graces.","Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Econ & Management Sch, P-4700 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Mourao, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Econ & Management Sch, P-4700 Braga, Portugal.",paulom@eeg.uminho.pt,"Mourao, Paulo/D-9619-2011","Mourao, Paulo/0000-0001-6046-645X",,,,,0,2,3,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2012,65,4,,,,,563,580,,10.1111/kykl.12006,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,026AT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310241200007,0

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; EXTENSION; INDUSTRY; RETURNS,"This study discusses how to apply Data Environment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment. A unique feature of DEA environmental assessment is that it classifies outputs into desirable (good) and undesirable (bad) outputs because many firms often produce not only desirable outputs but also undesirable outputs as a result of their economic activities. A methodological difficulty of DEA applications is how to combine operational performance on desirable outputs and environmental performance on undesirable outputs in a unified treatment. Although previous DEA environmental studies have utilized mainly radial models and their extensions, this study uses a non-radial DEA model for the output unification because the non-radial model can unify the two types of outputs more easily than the radial models. This study incorporates three types of output unification in DEA environmental assessment. The first unification considers both an increase and a decrease in an input vector along with a decrease in the direction vector of undesirable outputs. This type of unification measures unified efficiency. The second unification considers a decrease in an input vector along with a decrease in the vector of undesirable outputs. This type of unification is referred to as natural disposability and measures unified efficiency under natural disposability. The third unification considers an increase in an input vector but a decrease in the vector of undesirable outputs. This type of unification is referred to as managerial disposability and measures unified efficiency under managerial disposability. All the unifications increase the vector of desirable outputs. Using the output unification under natural and managerial disposability, this study examines methodological strengths and drawbacks of the proposed non-radial approach. Moreover, using a data set on U.S. coal fired power plants, we compare methodological strengths and drawbacks of radial and non-radial models for DEA environmental assessments. The methodological comparison is important in guiding a large energy issue because policy implications depend upon a methodology(s) used for an empirical study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The latter has the advantage that aggregate demand does not depend on a parameter that measures the degree of product differentiation. This allows to interpret variations in the degree of product differentiation as changes in competitive pressure because these changes can influence aggregate demand only through changes in equilibrium prices and quantities. The consequences of the alternative specifications are made explicit with two applications. In both cases the different specifications yield substantial changes in important results in industrial economics.","[Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus 43204, Spain; [Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Reus 43204, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Theilen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Avinguda Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.",bernd.theilen@urv.es,"Theilen, Bernd/Z-1589-2019","Theilen, Bernd/0000-0001-7141-2780",,,,,9,4,5,3,27,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

This study empirically examines the impact of access to microfinance by women, and male involvement in business decision making on efficiency of small scale enterprises in northern Ghana. We found very low level mean technical efficiency of 40% indicating that output of the enterprises could potentially be more than doubled without employing additional inputs. Moreover access to microfinance increases efficiency by 11%; and enterprises with male spousal influence were less efficient than their counterparts that were independently managed by the women. Furthermore, enterprises owned by women who managed more than one business operated at relatively lower efficiency levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, we use a different sample of companies and a large number of years for U.S. firms and we find similar results to those reported by Rajan and Zingales (1995) more than a decade ago.. As expected, we report similar results for Chilean firms as the updated results for U.S. firms. The capital structure of Chilean firms is: positively related to tangible assets; negatively related to growth opportunities; positively related to size and negatively related to performance. This is not only true for book leverage but also for market leverage. The rest of Latin American countries show mixed results.

Although this invariance is an implication of the theory when payoffs mirror expected utilities, it is an empirical question when payoffs are actually money amounts. Loss avoidance is a phenomenon where payoff-level changes matter when they change the signs of payoffs: gains become losses or vice versa. We report the results of a human-subjects experiment designed to test for two types of loss avoidance: certain-loss avoidance (avoiding a strategy leading to a sure loss, in favor of an alternative that might lead to a gain) and possible-loss avoidance (avoiding a strategy leading to a possible loss, in favor of an alternative that leads to a sure gain). Subjects in the experiment play three versions of Stag Hunt, which are identical up to the level of payoffs, under a variety of treatments. We find strong evidence of behavior consistent with certain-loss avoidance in the experiment. We also find evidence of possible-loss avoidance, although weaker than that for certain-loss avoidance. Our results carry implications for theorists modeling real-life situations with game theory and for experimenters attempting to test theory and interpret observed behavior in terms of theory.

Our experimental analysis involves a between subject design exposing subjects to financial substance on colored backgrounds and exploring the effect on their investment decisions. We focus on financial decisions under uncertainty about probability, examining subjects' investment valuations and the probabilities they assign to the possible outcomes. This study explores the role of color exposure as a priming factor in financial decision making. Priming is a process of activating particular connections or associations in memory prior to carrying out an action or task. The associations occur when a certain stimulus or event increases the availability of specific information categories and, as a result, affect decision making. The results indicate that red color priming emphasizes value losses of the underlying asset. To wit, subjects who were exposed to red (R) assigned higher valuations and probabilities to events involving the loss domain, than to events involving the gain domain, relatively to the valuations assigned by subjects who were exposed to green (G). The aggregated evaluation given by the R subjects when the investment payback was subject to negative (positive) underlying asset returns was higher (lower) than that of the G subjects by roughly 15%(19%) of the invested amount.

For East European countries, gains from trade are 9.23% at the mean, ranging from 2.85% for Russia to 20% for Estonia.

The higher is sigma, the greater the similarity between capital and labor in the production function, and thus diminishing returns set in very slowly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that tests the hypothesis that growth rate is increasing with the value of sigma at the cross-country level. We estimate sigma for 90 countries from direct estimation of the normalized CES production function and then include these estimators as an explanatory variable in cross-country growth regression. We investigate the sign and significance of the coefficient of sigma conditioning on country characteristics, initial conditions, and a set of policy variables. After accounting for endogeneity and the fact that sigma is a generated regressor, we find strong support for the hypothesis. The result is robust to both Leamer's (1983) extreme value analysis and Bayesian model averaging. About a fifth to a quarter of the growth rate differential between East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa can be explained by sigma alone. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Depending on their experience span, banks turn over-optimistic and underprice default risk 3-5 years into the boom. During recessions an overpricing of risk begins just quarters into the recession. Our simulations are calibrated with U.S. data and provide evidence for the view that banks contribute to excessive lending during the upswing and to credit crunches in recessions.

We develop an economic model to explain the mechanism by which people decide to take the influenza vaccination. Using our model and the data obtained from a large-scale survey we conducted in Japan, we demonstrated that people make rational decisions about vaccinations after considering its cost and benefits. People consider the probability of infection, severity of the disease, and the vaccination's effectiveness and side effects. The time discount rate is another consideration because the timing of costs and benefits of the vaccination differ. Risk aversion (fearing the contraction of the flu and vaccination's side effects) also affects the decision. People also deviate from rationality altruism and status quo bias play important roles in the decision-making. Overconfidence indirectly affects the decision via perception variables such as the subjective probability of infection and assessment of influenza's severity. The decision also depends on attributes such as gender, age, and marital status. If the general perception of flu and vaccination is inaccurate, supplying accurate information regarding those may increase or decrease the vaccination rate, depending on whether this perception is, respectively, higher or lower than the objective rates. Thus, we examine whether the general perception is biased. Our survey suggests that disseminating information on the vaccination's effectiveness may increase the rate of vaccination, whereas that on the probability of infection may have the opposite effect.

This paper analyzes the design of optimal divisional structure within an organization where ex post bargaining between the potential divisional managers is possible. In much the same light as Aghion and Tirole (J Political Econ 105(1):1-29, 1997), we study the control problem in the context of search for projects. Our model shows that when the managers cannot bargain with one another, internal integration is preferred to internal separation. Where bargaining is possible, formal divisional structure defines both the ex post bargaining position of the two managers and their incentive to search ex ante. When the managers tend to arrive at a more favorable project to the principal via bargaining, the general leader of a firm may want to choose separation instead to increase the probability of bargaining, as the symmetrical incentive requires both managers to search and get informed.","[Bao, Te] Univ Amsterdam, CeNDEF, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bao, Te] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wang, Yongqin] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, CCES, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Fudan University,"Bao, T (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, CeNDEF, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.bao@uva.nl; yongqinwang@fudan.edu.cn,"yang, xu/JMP-5558-2023; Bao, Te/S-2353-2019","Bao, Te/0000-0001-6397-9365",,,,,21,1,3,1,31,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

There is, however, little consensus on the appropriate method to correct for the endogeneity of union membership or the size of the union wage gap. Furthermore, there are very few studies on the bargaining council wage premium in South Africa because of lack of data on the coverage of employees under these agreements. Our study, using 2005 Labour Force Survey data, firstly reconsiders the union wage gap controlling for both firm-level and job characteristics. When correcting for the endogeneity of union status through a two-stage selection model and including firm size, type of employment, and non-wage benefits, we find a much lower union wage premium for African workers in the formal sector than premiums reported in some previous studies. Secondly, our study estimates bargaining council wage premiums for the private and public sectors. We find that extension procedures are present in both private and public bargaining council systems but that unions negotiate for additional gains for their members at the plant level. Furthermore, there is some evidence that unions negotiate for awards for their members in the private sector irrespective of bargaining council coverage.","[Bhorat, Haroon; Goga, Sumayya; Van der Westhuizen, Carlene] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Dev Policy Res Unit, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Van der Westhuizen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Dev Policy Res Unit, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",carlene.vanderwesthuizen@uct.ac.za,,,,,,,21,10,11,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

This relationship exists when we decompose overall charitable donations into different types of philanthropy, with charitable contributions to caring and needy organisations having the largest positive association with donations to the victims of the tsunami. Furthermore, when we explore the impact of donations to the victims of the tsunami on future donations to charity, there is evidence of a positive relationship with the largest association with donations to caring and needy organisations.

This process is called social learning. Learning in incomplete networks, where different individuals have different information, is especially challenging: because of the lack of common knowledge individuals must draw inferences about the actions others have observed, as well as about their private information. This paper reports an experimental investigation of learning in three-person networks and uses the theoretical framework of Gale and Kariv (Games Econ Behav 45:329-346, 2003) to interpret the data generated by the experiments. The family of three-person networks includes several non-trivial architectures, each of which gives rise to its own distinctive learning patterns. To test the usefulness of the theory in interpreting the data, we adapt the Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) model of Mckelvey and Palfrey (Games Econ Behav 10:6-38, 1995; Exp Econ 1:9-41, 1998). We find that the theory can account for the behavior observed in the laboratory in a variety of networks and informational settings.

The model shows two different strategies that enterprises adopt when they confront different levels of price fluctuations. In respond to small fluctuations, enterprises might adopt a conservative strategy of maintaining the ratio of factor inputs and leaving production plans unchanged of the adjustment cost. As a result, allocation inefficiency is unavoidable. However, greater fluctuations which increase the opportunity cost of a conservative strategy induce enterprises to accept an adjustment strategy; they must change the ratio of factor inputs and the production plans passively. This transformation indicates that a threshold effect exists in the price fluctuations' influence on resource allocation inefficiency. Using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and China's provincial panel data of 1978 to 2007, this paper confirms that price fluctuation has a nonlinear effect on allocation efficiency loss, and concludes that traditional analyses underestimate the adverse impacts of price fluctuation on China's economy.","[Ding, Congming; Xi, Yanling; Chen, Zhongchang] Chongqing Univ, Fac Publ Adm, Dept Econ, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China",Chongqing University,"Ding, CM (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ, Fac Publ Adm, Dept Econ, 174 Shazheng Rd, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",hayekt-ing@126.com; yan-ling.xi@hotmail.com; czcmx@cqu.edu.cn,,,,,,,30,0,0,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The intended contributions of the paper are twofold: it extends the Kaleckian model for an open economy to incorporate the effects of capital flows on the RER and interest rate, and it acknowledges the possibility of having different macroeconomic regimes that reflect different preferences for inflation and employment by the government. A monetary rule that considers its effects on both inflation and employment may be more conducive to stability than a regime that solely focuses on inflation.

This study finds systematic variations in liquidity in different segments of the Nordic electricity swap market and analyzes the potential for replacing low-liquidity, delivery-period-matched hedging instruments with more liquid, delivery-period-mismatched hedging instruments. When the costs of implementing such dirty hedging strategies are lower than those of the replaced hedging instruments and the loss of hedge effectiveness is small, dirty hedging strategies may then replace their delivery-period-matched counterparts. In this context, I analyze the dynamic out-of-sample tracking performance of selected dirty hedges. Electricity swaps with delivery in front year one and two, respectively, track electricity swaps with delivery in front year three quite well. This suggests that hedge effectiveness can be traded off for the reduced costs of implementing these dirty hedging strategies compared with those of the less liquid year-three swaps.

The long-run Okun relationship for regions in Finland appears to confirm results found elsewhere in the literature on countries as a whole, although the coefficients tend to be smaller.","[Kangasharju, Aki] Govt Inst Econ Res, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Tavera, Christophe] Univ Rennes 1, Dept Econ, Rennes, France; [Nijkamp, Peter] Free Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nijkamp, Peter] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Universite de Rennes; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Kangasharju, A (通讯作者)，Govt Inst Econ Res, Arkadiankatu 7, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",aki.kangasharju@vatt.fi; christophe.tavera@univ-rennes1.fr; p.nijkamp@vu.nl,,"Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132",,,,,29,25,26,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

We explicitly illustrate this point by considering the additive aggregation of cost efficiency indicators for production and advertising activities, which use different inputs. Then, the overall cost efficiency indicator is given by the weighted (rather than the simple) sum of the production and the advertising cost efficiency indicators. The reason is that the value of the directional vector used to normalize the difference between the minimum and the observed cost in each activity-based efficiency indicator will differ.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; MODELS; PERFORMANCE; ENERGY,"This study proposes a use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment. All organizations in private and public sectors produce not only desirable (good) but also undesirable (bad) outputs as a result of their economic activities. The proposed use of DEA determines the level of unified (operational and environmental) efficiency of all the organizations. A contribution of this study is that it explores how to measure not only RTS (Returns to Scale) on desirable outputs but also a new concept regarding DTS: Damages to Scale (corresponding to RTS for undesirable outputs). This study discusses how to measure RTS under natural disposability and DTS under managerial disposability by DEA. The measurement of RTS and DTS is formulated by incorporating Strong Complementary Slackness Conditions (SCSCs). As a result, this study can handle an occurrence of multiple reference sets and multiple projections in the RTS/DTS measurement. The incorporation of SCSCs makes it possible both to restrict DEA multipliers in a specific range without any prior information and to identify all possible efficient organizations as a reference set. Using the unique capabilities of SCSCs, this study discusses the use of DEA environmental assessment by exploring how to classify the type of RTS/DTS with SCSCs. Such analytical capabilities are essential, but not previously explored in DEA environmental assessment for energy industries. As an illustrative example, this study applies the proposed approach for the performance evaluation of Japanese manufacturing industries. This study finds that these firms need to introduce technology innovation to reduce an amount of greenhouse gases and wastes. The empirical result confirms the importance of measuring RTS/DTS in DEA environmental assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis indicates that, in China, rice yields have converged over time and rice production has become increasingly homogeneous. In contrast, rice yields in Brazil have diverged over time,. primarily due to variations in upland rice yields. Three hypothetical explanations may account for the different behaviors of rice yields in Brazil and China, namely: 1) differences in production systems (i.e. irrigated in China vs. upland in Brazil); 2) changes in rainfall patterns; and 3) bias in agricultural research and development (R&D) towards irrigated rice. Our empirical analysis supports the first two hypotheses by establishing that: 1) upland rice shows much more variation in yields compared to irrigated rice; and 2) changing rainfall patterns have primarily affected upland rice. We also provide evidence of the bias towards irrigated systems by looking at the patterns of varietal release. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This paper addresses whether it is optimal for a state composed of multiple regions to levy differentiated commodity tax rates across the regions. In a model where states maximize social welfare, a state's optimal commodity tax system is almost always geographically differentiated. The optimal pattern of geographic differentiation critically depends on fundamental parameters as well as whether the state has a preference for high or low taxes. Under the assumption that utility is linear in consumption and that the elasticity of cross-border shopping is less than unity in absolute value, high-tax states will find it optimal to set a tax rate that is lower in the border region than in the periphery region and low-tax states will find it optimal to set a tax rate that is higher in the border region than in the periphery region. Optimizing high-tax states will set a higher tax rate in the border region if the social welfare measure is sufficiently redistributive. With welfare maximization, it is possible for taxes to be higher in the region near the state border-an outcome that cannot arise when the government cares only about total tax revenue.","Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Agrawal, DR (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",dagrawal@umich.edu,"Agrawal, David/C-1945-2013","Agrawal, David/0000-0001-8480-1849",,,,,20,14,14,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The lack of behavioral change has long puzzled both researchers and policy makers. In this paper, an attempt is made to disentangle mechanisms underlying excessive sexual risk taking. Drawing on ideas from psychology, related to decision-making processes and risk evaluation, an intertemporal model is developed and analyzed. More specifically, the theoretical model merges psychological theories of affect-induced myopia and cognitive dissonance with economic theory of utility maximization. The results of the theoretical analysis suggest that, if sexual arousal is associated with shortsighted behavior, the fear of an HIV infection may reduce the effect of HIV information campaigns via the effect of cognitive dissonance. The results further suggest that policy aimed to increase awareness of rationalization tendencies may constitute an important complement to existing AIDS policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, firms in the larger market have higher competitiveness, which increases their market shares in international markets. Furthermore, and contrary to what is predicted by Krugman (Am Econ Rev 70:950-959, 1980) home market effect, in equilibrium the larger country does not need to host a disproportionately higher share of the world's industry than of the world's demand.

Social capital refers to resources that are embedded in a durable network of relationships. This article focuses specifically on the structure of networks. There are two main views on the relation between network structure and entrepreneurial performance. One view argues that closed networks are beneficial for cooperation and resource sharing, which is needed to implement an innovation, while another view argues that closed networks constrain entrepreneurs, since it is open networks that provide entrepreneurs with fresh information and ideas. Based on these arguments, we hypothesise that the relationship between the degree of constraint of a network and innovative performance has an inverted U-shape. We also examine the hypothesis that overlap between personal and business networks will hamper innovative performance of entrepreneurs because information will be less diverse and heterogeneous, and because re-distributive kinship obligations may act as a drain on entrepreneurial resources. We test our hypotheses using a recent survey of about 700 Ugandan rural and urban entrepreneurs. Our hypotheses are supported in the urban sample, but not in the rural sample.","[Rooks, Gerrit] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Rooks, Gerrit; Sserwanga, Arthur] Makerere Univ, Sch Business, Kampala, Uganda; [Szirmai, Adam] UNU MERIT, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; Makerere University; Maastricht University,"Rooks, G (通讯作者)，Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dolech 2, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",g.rooks@tue.nl,,,,,,,59,13,17,0,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

However, introducing a European equity price gives rise to a more stable system. Furthermore, recursive estimates confirm the relative stability of long-term coefficients. Estimates of the real money gap, based on the money demand equation including equity prices, point to moderate, albeit persistent, excess liquidity in the euro area in recent years.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is expected to make an essential contribution, but due to relatively high cost, its growth to date has been largely driven by public policy, notably feed-in tariffs. Feed-in tariffs have been implemented in various countries, but with widely differing outcomes in terms of installed PV capacity. Previous research indicates that the level of policy risk may be an important driver for differences in renewable energy policy effectiveness. This paper suggests that project developers who make a decision between PV investment opportunities in different countries carefully weigh feed-in tariff-induced returns against a set of policy risks, and choose the country with the most favorable risk-return profile. This model is empirically tested by a stated preference survey among European PV project developers, consisting of 1575 choice decisions by 63 investors. The findings demonstrate that risk matters in PV policy design, and that a price tag can be attached to specific policy risks, such as the duration of administrative processes or uncertainty induced by an approaching capacity cap. Governments can build on these empirical results to design policies that will be effective in attracting private PV investment, while at the same time maintaining efficiency by providing an adequate compensation for policy risk.

Experimental studies have challenged this way of proceeding by showing that the principle of transfers, which underlies the generalised Lorenz criterion, does not meet with widespread agreement among the public that theorists would have expected. We propose to substitute the non-deprivation quasi-ordering introduced by Chakravarty (1997) for the generalised Lorenz criterion. This criterion is less demanding than the generalised Lorenz criterion as it builds on a weaker version of the principle of transfers and it is therefore more likely to be accepted by the public. We use income data from the Luxembourg Income Study for 17 countries in order to contrast the generalised Lorenz and the non-deprivation criteria. Although the non-deprivation quasi-ordering is less decisive than the generalised Lorenz criterion, it is shown that the former approximates the latter surprisingly well. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To discuss MRT and RS, this study first examines a concept of disposability from the perspective of corporate strategies to adapt a regulation change on undesirable outputs. The concept of disposability is separated into natural and managerial disposability. Then, this study explores the computational framework of RTS (Returns to Scale) and DTS (Damages to Scale). The type of RTS is measured within the natural disposability, while the type of DTS is measured within the managerial disposability. Considering the two types of disposability, this study discusses MRT and RS between desirable and undesirable outputs. As an illustrative example, this study applies the proposed approach to evaluate the performance of US coal-fired power plants. This study finds that the regulation policy on NOx and SO2 has been effective on their emission controls under US Clean Air Act (CAA). The regulation on CO2, or a major source of the global warming and climate change, is still insufficient in the United States. Therefore, this study recommends that US federal and local governments should regulate the amount of CO2 emission under the CM. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

I develop an open-economy model in which workers undertake non-contractible activities to acquire firm-specific skills on the job. In the model, labor market protection raises workers' incentives to acquire firm-specific skills relative to general skills, turning labor laws into a source of comparative advantage. In particular, the model shows that countries with more protective labor laws export relatively more in firm-specific skill-intensive sectors at both the intensive and extensive margins. To test the theoretical predictions. I construct sector proxies for the firm-specific and industry-specific skill intensity by estimating returns to firm tenure and industry tenure for different U.S. manufacturing sectors during the 1974-1993 period. By estimating sector-level gravity equations for 84 countries using the Helpman-Melitz-Rubinstein (2008) framework, I find evidence supporting the predicted effects of labor market institutions at both margins of exports.

In the presence of borrowing constraints, asset sales become a crucial means for agents to finance opportunities to invest in new assets. In this environment, reduced asset sales due to asymmetric information lower the economic growth rate if agents invest in new assets. The volume of asset trade, however, becomes zero if and only if agents stop investing in new assets because of sufficiently low aggregate productivity. A low economic growth rate with a market shutdown is solely due to low aggregate productivity without any role of the market shutdown. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

This paper evaluates the relevance of this transmission process in the formation of gender roles during childhood. In particular, we analyze the relationship between parents' and children's housework allocation patterns. We propose a simple theoretical model that predicts that parents with a strong adherence to gender to traditional gender norms-as proxied by their division of household labor-are more likely to allocate housework to children in a way that reflects stereotypes of men's and women's domestic tasks. The empirical application is carried out with data from the 2002-2003 Spanish Time Use Survey. The sample restricts to two-parent households with at least one child aged 10-17 years. We find a significant positive correlation between a more egalitarian parents' allocation of housework and a less asymmetrical distribution of domestic chores between sons and daughters.","[Alvarez, Begona; Miles-Touya, Daniel] Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ Aplicada, Vigo 36310, Pontevedra, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Miles-Touya, D (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ Aplicada, Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Pontevedra, Spain.",alvarez@uvigo.es; dmiles@uvigo.es,"Touya, Daniel Miles/R-9665-2018; Alvarez, Begoña/H-9724-2015","Touya, Daniel Miles/0000-0003-3968-8298; Alvarez, Begoña/0000-0003-1756-7014",,,,,28,25,29,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Nowadays, many patents directly protect knowledge. To account for this evolution, we construct a simple R&D-based growth model where pieces of knowledge are directly protected by patents. To deal with the nonconvexity property of technologies in which knowledge is an input and show how research can be funded privately, we construct a dynamic general equilibrium with Cournot competition and free entry where knowledge is exchanged on markets that can be subject to imperfect exclusion. Under the assumption of perfect exclusion, we show that research is funded optimally as the distortion caused by the knowledge spillover vanishes when markets are complete. We then argue and demonstrate that insufficient research investments leading to an insufficient level of growth can be explained by the public good nature of knowledge itself, i.e., the problem of imperfect exclusion faced by the sellers of knowledge.","Minist Econ Finances & Ind, F-75012 Paris, France; [Chantrel, Etienne] Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France; [Grimaud, Andre] Toulouse Sch Econ IDEI & LERNA, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Grimaud, Andre] Toulouse Business Sch, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Tournemaine, Frederic] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Sch Econ, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Tournemaine, Frederic] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, RIPED, Bangkok 10400, Thailand",IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education; University Thai Chamber Commerce; University Thai Chamber Commerce,"Chantrel, É (通讯作者)，Minist Econ Finances & Ind, 139 Rue Bercy, F-75012 Paris, France.",etienne.chantrel@normalesup.org; grimaud@cict.fr; frederic.tournemaine@gmail.com,"Tournemaine, Frederic/D-4728-2009",,,,,,47,10,10,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

This is captured by assuming that nominal wages are predetermined. As a consequence, wage setters act as Stackelberg leaders, whereas in the typical New Keynesian model the wage-setting rule implies that they play a Nash game. We present a DSGE New Keynesian model with pre-determined wages and money entering the representative household's utility function and show how these assumptions are sufficient to identify an inverse relationship between the inflation target and the wage markup (and thus employment) both in the short and the long run. This is due to the complementary effects that wage claims and the inflation target have on money holdings.

The theory developed emphasizing the interplay between cultural beliefs, interest groups, technological change, insurance expansion and government financing offers a plausible explanation of reforms since the 1960s separating prescribing from dispensing in societies such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China. Technological change and adoption of universal coverage trigger reforms by greatly increasing the social opportunity costs of physician over-prescribing and reshaping the political economy of forces impinging on the doctor patient relationship.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Eggleston, K (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",karene@stanford.edu,,,,,,,55,11,12,1,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This paper focuses on two of those policies: research and regional development. Here, we model and discuss how the level of commitment of a central authority toward poor regions affects the design of the best decision-making process. We explore cases of full centralization and full decentralization, and situations where the two levels of government are allowed to take decisions, either simultaneously or sequentially. In the latter case, we make a distinction between a situation where the central agency decides first as in most federations, and one in which it decides second, then being an agent of national governments. This setting is especially relevant for the European Union. We show, in particular, that when the degree of commitment of the center is high, assignment of redistributive competencies to both levels of power is a proxy for centralization. Additionally, the poorer region may find its best interest in an institutional design where the regions decide first.","[Gerard, Marcel; Gilson, Natacha; Ruiz, Fernando] Catholic Univ Louvain, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Gerard, Marcel] CESifo, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Ruiz, Fernando] Royal Mil Acad, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Ifo Institut,"Gérard, M (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, ChaussTe Binche 151, B-7000 Mons, Belgium.",marcel.gerard@uclouvain.be; natacha.gilson@fucam.ac.be; fernando.ruiz@fucam.ac.be,,"Ruiz, Fernando/0009-0006-2980-6544",,,,,20,2,2,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The probability of making the playoffs and home team success are more important determinants of match attendance than match uncertainty. Alternative measures of playoff uncertainty based on points behind the leader, although more ad hoc, also appear able to capture broadly similar effects on attendance to the playoff probabilities.","[King, Nicholas; Owen, P.

This paper examines the role of the exchange rate regime in explaining how emerging market economies fared in the recent global financial crisis, particularly in terms of output losses and output rebound. After controlling for regime switches during the crisis, using alternative definitions for pegs, and taking account of other likely determinants, we find that the growth performance for pegs was not different from that of floats during the crisis. The picture is different for the recovery period 2010-2011, as pegs appear to be faring worse, with growth recovering more slowly than floats. These results suggest an asymmetric effect of the regime during and recovering from the crisis. We also find that proxies of the trade and financial channels are important determinants of growth performance during the crisis, while only the trade channel appears important for the recovery thus far.

The objective of this paper is to assess the impacts of food safety standards on tea exports from China, the world's largest tea producer and exporter. To achieve this objective, the paper discusses the trends and nature of China's tea production and export, analyzes changes on tea safety standards indicated by Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures, Maximum Residual Limit (MRL) of pesticides and the coverage of tea safety standards concerning regulatory pesticides in major importing countries, and quantitatively estimates the impacts of food safety standards on China's tea export based on a gravity model. The results show that the MRL of pesticides (e.g., endosulfan, fenvalerate and flucythrinate) imposed by importing countries have significantly affected China's tea exports. The results also show that China's tea exports have been significantly restricted when importing countries increase coverage of tea safety standards concerning regulatory pesticides.

For this purpose, we investigate the potential consequences of two financial activities, issued by the local government (G) of a region R, which work like contracts between G and, respectively, visitors of R and firms operating in R. According to these contracts, agents who decide to visit R (firms that decide to adopt an environmental friendly technology) have to buy an option that entitle them to get a partial or total reimbursement if environmental quality in R turns out to be sufficiently low (high), namely, below (above) a given predetermined threshold level. Using a two-population evolutionary game model, we analyze the dynamics emerging from the model and prove that under such fund rising mechanism the virtuous equilibrium (in which all firms adopt the pollution-free technology and all agents choose to visit the region) is always locally attractive. Furthermore, we show that the attraction basin of the poverty trap equilibrium (in which no firm adopts the clean technology and no tourist comes to the region) can be decreased by raising the reimbursement offered by the local government to the visitors. Finally, using numerical simulations, it can be shown that the dynamics of the model may give rise to another attractive stationary state in correspondence of the environmental quality threshold determined by the government, as well as to a limit cycle that oscillates around the threshold.

In some of the most widely cited publications in the field of economics and political science, scholars have claimed that such cross-country variation is explained by a country's legal origin (common law or civil law tradition). It is claimed that because of stronger legal protection for outside investors and less state intervention, common law countries have achieved higher levels of economy prosperity and social life than civil law countries. To a large extent, this hypothesis has been corroborated by much empirical evidence. This paper proposes an alternative interpretation of the cross-country differences observed. Building on scholarly studies of state formation developments, the basic proposition of this paper is that the state formation process affects the character of the state infrastructure to be either patrimonial or bureaucratic, which in turn affects institutions and social outcomes. We argue that this fundamental distinction of state formation precedes the legal origins of a country and thus offers superior explanatory power. This argument is tested empirically on a set of 31 OECD countries. It is shown that the state infrastructure is indeed more influential than the legal traditions on a set of institutional variables (formalism, judicial independence, regulation of entry and case law) as well as on a set of social outcomes (corruption, rule of law, and property rights).

The nature and effects of such collaboration vary significantly between the type of firm involved and their location, and the analysis investigates this in relation to various aspects of innovative activity and firms' performance.

The extension of social welfare provision is examined through a case study of education and health care in the South China village of Yantian. Yantian lies at the core of the Pearl River Delta, which has become a key link in the global reorganization of manufacturing and production. Consequently the village is home to some 80 000 migrant workers who complement the 3000 registered inhabitants. A study of education and health-care provision reveals that in terms of equity, registered villagers enjoy significant advantages in seeking welfare resources. Although living in the same village, the two groups inhabit different worlds. However, provision, while selective, has become more inclusive. The present research suggests that social citizenship will precede political citizenship.","[Hu, Biliang] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Saich, Tony] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Beijing Normal University; Harvard University,"Hu, BL (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",hubiliang@bnu.edu.cn; Anthony_Saich@harvard.edu,"Hu, Biliang/J-7564-2013",,,,,,9,7,8,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2012,20,3,,,,,69,87,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01288.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,952BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304763800005,0

Under normality assumption, we present the exact distributions of the three tests, analyze their power comprehensively. We find that the power is most driven by the difference of the global minimum-variance portfolios of the two minimum-variance frontiers, and it does not always align well with the economic significance. As an alternative, we provide a step-down test to allow better assessment of the power. Under general distributional assumptions, we provide a new spanning test based on the generalized method of moments (GMM), and evaluate its performance along with other GMM tests by simulation.","[Kan, Raymond] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Zhou, GuoFu] Washington Univ, John M Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",University of Toronto; Washington University (WUSTL),"Kan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",kan@chass.utoronto.ca; zhou@wustl.edu,,,,,,,45,60,67,0,17,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Based on the production axioms of monotonicity, convexity and weak disposability, we formulate a convex non-parametric least squares (CNLS) quadratic optimization problem to estimate a frontier production function assuming either a deterministic disturbance term consisting only of inefficiency, or a composite disturbance term composed of both inefficiency and noise. The suggested methodology extends the stochastic semi-nonparametric envelopment of data (StoNED) described in Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (2011). Applying the method to estimate the shadow prices of SO2 and NOx generated by U.S. coal power plants, we conclude that the weak disposability StoNED method provides more consistent estimates of market prices.

Taxpayers in our model initially have low income and stochastically transit to high income that is an absorbing state. A low-income taxpayer who transits to high income can underreport his true income and evade his taxes. With a constant absolute risk-aversion utility function and a costly and imperfect auditing technology, we show that the optimal auditing mechanism in our model consists of cycles. Within each cycle, a low-income taxpayer is initially unaudited, but if the duration of low-income reports exceeds a threshold, then the auditing probability becomes positive. That is, the tax authority guarantees that the taxpayer is not audited until the threshold duration is reached. We also find that auditing becomes less frequent if the auditing cost is higher or if the variance of income is lower.","[Ravikumar, B.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO USA; [Zhang, Yuzhe] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Ravikumar, B (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO USA.",b.ravikumar@wustl.edu; yuzhe-zhang@econmail.tamu.edu,"Ravikumar, B./K-6862-2016","Ravikumar, B./0000-0001-6991-4677",,,,,20,9,9,1,27,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

However, the resulting macroeconomic effects seem to be surprisingly weak. This contradiction can be explained within an intertemporal framework in which DNWR not only prevents nominal wage cuts but also induces firms to compress wage increases. We analyze whether a compression of wage increases occurs when DNWR is binding by applying Unconditional Quantile Regression and Seemingly Unrelated Regression to a dataset comprising more than 169 million wage changes. We find evidence of a compression of wage increases and only very small effects of DNWR on average real wage growth. The results indicate that DNWR does not provide a strong argument against low inflation targets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we use a new method of testing for linear and nonlinear lead/lag relationships between time series, introduced by Brooks and Hinich (J Empir Finance 20:385-404, 1999), based on the concepts of cross-correlation and cross-bicorrelation. Our evidence points to a relatively rare episodic nonlinearity within and across foreign exchange rates. We also test the validity of specifying ARCH-type error structures for foreign exchange rates. In doing so, we estimate Bollerslev's (J Econom 31:307-327, 1986) generalized ARCH (GARCH) model and Nelson's (1988) exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model, using a variety of error densities [including the normal, the Student-t distribution, and the Generalized Error Distribution (GED)] and a comprehensive set of diagnostic checks. We apply the Brooks and Hinich (1999) nonlinearity test to the standardized residuals of the optimal GARCH/EGARCH model for each exchange rate series and show that the nonlinearity in the exchange rates is not due to ARCH-type effects. This result has important implications for the interpretation of the recent voluminous literature which attempts to model financial asset returns using this family of models.","[Serletis, Apostolos] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Malliaris, Anastasios G.] Loyola Univ, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Hinich, Melvin J.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt & Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gogas, Periklis] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Int Econ Relat & Dev, Komotini, Greece",University of Calgary; Loyola University Chicago; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Democritus University of Thrace,"Serletis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",Serletis@ucalgary.ca,"Gogas, Periklis/N-8162-2014; Malliaris, A./ABA-4808-2020","Gogas, Periklis/0000-0002-5134-3869;",,,,,23,3,5,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

J,"Dynan, K",,,,"Dynan, Karen",,,Is a Household Debt Overhang Holding Back Consumption?,BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WEALTH; PRICES,"The recent plunge in U.S. home prices left many households that had borrowed voraciously during the credit boom highly leveraged, with very high levels of debt relative to the value of their assets. Analysts often assert that this debt overhang created a need for household deleveraging that, in turn, has been depressing consumer spending and impeding the economic recovery. This paper uses household-level data to examine this hypothesis. I find that highly leveraged homeowners had larger declines in spending between 2007 and 2009 than other homeowners, despite having smaller changes in net worth, suggesting that their leverage weighed on consumption above and beyond what would have been predicted by wealth effects alone. Results from regressions that control for wealth effects and other factors support the view that excessive leverage has contributed to the weakness in consumption. I also show that U.S. households, on the whole, have made limited progress in reducing leverage over the past few years. It may take many years for some households to reduce their leverage to precrisis norms. Thus, the effects of deleveraging may persist for some time to come.","Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution,"Dynan, K (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,"Dynan, Karen/0000-0001-5504-4025",,,,,37,114,131,6,50,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We find that when people can choose between wage work and managerial work, the worldwide labor market raises output by more in the rich and the poor countries, and by less in the middle-income countries. This is because the middle-income countries experience the smallest change in the factor-price ratio, and where the option to choose between wage work and managerial work has the least value in the integrated economy. Our theory also establishes that after economic integration, the high skill countries see a disproportionate increase in managerial occupations. Using aggregate data on GDP, openness and occupations from 115 countries, we find evidence for these patterns of occupational choice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

But these same governments invest in infrastructure designed to reduce vulnerability to natural and man-made hazards. We show that when the federal government is committed to full insurance against disasters, regions will have incentives to under-invest in ex-ante protective measures. We derive the structure of the optimal second-best insurance system when regional governments choose investment levels non-cooperatively and the central government cannot verify regional investment choices. For low probability disasters this will result in lower ex-post intergovernmental transfers (and hence less ex-post redistribution) and greater ex-ante investment. However, the second-best transfer scheme suffers from a time-inconsistency problem. Ex-post, the central government will be driven towards full insurance rather than the second-best grants, which results in a type of soft budget constraint problem. Subnational governments will anticipate this and reduce their investment in protective infrastructure even further. The result is that the central government may be better off suffering the underinvestment that results with first-best transfers because investment is even lower under second-best transfers when the central government is unable to commit.","[Goodspeed, Timothy J.] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Goodspeed, Timothy J.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Haughwout, Andrew F.] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Goodspeed, TJ (通讯作者)，CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Econ, 695 Pk Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",timothy.goodspeed@hunter.cuny.edu; Andrew.Haughwout@ny.frb.org,,"Goodspeed, Timothy J./0000-0002-5983-6078",,,,,29,13,13,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

We find substantial variation in export sophistication at the province and prefecture level, controlling for the level of development, and that this sophistication in turn drives growth. Our results suggest that these gains are limited to the ordinary export activities undertaken by domestic firms: no direct gains result from either processing trade activities or foreign firms, even though these are the main contributors to the global upgrading of China's exports. As such, the extent of assembly trade and foreign entities should be distinguished in order to measure the true movement in a country's technology and the contribution of exports to economic growth.

This paper explores the reasons for the stability of the rate. First, the degree of concentration in the foreign exchange market has increased, thus making the task of moral suasion relatively straightforward once this policy tool comes to bear on the dominant trader(s). Second, long-term or non-volatile capital inflows make the exchange rate less susceptible to sudden reversal. Third, commercial banks, the dominant foreign exchange traders, have large outlays of assets in domestic currency, thus their desire for exchange rate stability.

The article then illustrates the usefulness of the extension by applying it to Australian panel data for the recent period, 20012008. The empirical application exploits the subgroup decomposability of the deprivation measures to identify the subgroups that are more deprived than others. The proposed measure is also decomposable by dimensions and is used to identify the dimensions where deprivation is more persistent. The comparison between the subgroups shows that the divide between homeowners and non-homeowners is one of the sharpest, with the latter suffering much more deprivation than the former. The results are robust to alternative schemes for weighting and aggregating the dimensions as well as to the choice of model parameters.","[Nicholas, Aaron] Deakin Univ, Grad Sch Business, Geelong, Vic 3125, Australia; [Ray, Ranjan] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Deakin University; Monash University,"Nicholas, A (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Grad Sch Business, Burwood Campus, Geelong, Vic 3125, Australia.",Aaron.Nicholas@deakin.edu.au,,"Ray, Ranjan/0000-0002-0411-6268",,,,,36,14,15,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Since economic growth implies externalities and market failures, and a portion of it can be defined as uneconomic, the ISEW method introduces some corrections and adjustments to the GDP calculation framework. The ISEW has been calculated for a number of nations but it has been rarely applied to sub-national systems. Its calculation at the local level is important especially in case of administrative decentralization, and autonomy and responsibility of local authorities in certain fields. For this reason, a more and more comprehensive knowledge of the characteristics and peculiarities of the territorial system they manage is necessary. This paper presents the results of the ISEW calculation for Tuscany, a region in central Italy, in the period 1971-2006. This is one of the few attempts to apply the ISEW in time series at the regional level. Final results show that a discrepancy between ISEW and GDP appeared in the 1970s. Social and environmental pressures increased during the period under study making the gap equal to about 30 percent of regional GDP in 2006. The ISEW can be used also as a tool for evaluating policies, but further adjustments in calculation of certain items are considered necessary for taking into account and evaluating punctual policies. A case of energy policy is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As in the existing literature, a state-owned public firm is assumed to maximise the welfare of an entire country comprising two regions. On the other hand, a local public firm is assumed to maximise the welfare of only one region. In such a setting, we find that when the central and local governments independently consider whether to privatise their respective public firms, only the state-owned public firm should be privatised.

Despite the fact that a large number of forecasting models have been designed to forecast crude oil prices' volatility, so far the relative performance evaluation of competing forecasting models remains an exercise that is unidimensional in nature. To be more specific, most studies tend to use several criteria and their measures to assess the relative performance of these models, but competing models are always ranked by performance measure; thus, leading in general to different rankings for different criteria and to a situation where one cannot make an informed decision as to which model performs best with respect to all criteria under consideration. The purpose of this paper is to propose a single ranking that takes account of several criteria using a Data Envelopment Analysis framework. Our empirical results reveal that the unidimensional rankings for different criteria might differ significantly and that the multidimensional ranking of some models could be substantially different from their unidimensional rankings, which highlights the importance of the proposed performance evaluation tool.

The results show that successful coordination on the Pareto optimal equilibrium in the median game influences behavior in the minimum game when the games are played sequentially. Moreover, this positive, Pareto-improving spillover is present even when group composition changes across games, although the effect is not as strong. We also find that the precedent for uncooperative behavior in the minimum game does not influence play in the median game.

Prices of lumber derivatives are used to calibrate a regime switching model, with each of two regimes characterized by a different mean reverting process. A single regime, mean reverting process is also calibrated. The value of a representative stand of trees and optimal harvesting prices are determined by specifying a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Variational Inequality, which is solved for both pricing models using a implicit finite difference approach. The regime switching model is found to more closely match the behavior of futures prices than the single regime model.

One of the key challenges in mounting a global response to it is the seeming unwillingness of the fastest growing economies such as China and India to sign a treaty that limits their emissions. The aim of this paper is to examine the differential incentives of countries on different trajectories of capital growth. A benchmark dynamic game to study global warming, introduced in Dutta and Radner (J Econ Behav Organ, 2009), is generalized to allow for exogenous capital accumulation. It is shown that the presence of capital exacerbates the tragedy of the common. Furthermore, even with high discount factors, the threat of reverting to the inefficient tragedy equilibrium is not sufficient to deter the emissions growth of the fastest growing economies-in contrast to standard folk theorem like results. However, foreign aid can help. If the slower growth economies-like the United States and Western Europe-are willing to make transfers to China and India, then the latter can be incentivized to cut emissions. Such an outcome is Pareto improving for both slower and faster growth economies.","[Dutta, Prajit K.] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Radner, Roy] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",Columbia University; New York University,"Dutta, PK (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10025 USA.",pkd1@columbia.edu; rradner@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,22,9,9,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In addition, spatial separation and private information generate a transactions role for money. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the industrial organization of the financial system bears significant implications for the effects of monetary policy. Under perfect competition, higher rates of money growth lead to lower interest rates and a higher volume of lending activity. In contrast, in a monopoly banking sector, money growth restricts the availability of funds and raises the cost of borrowing.","[Ghossoub, Edgar A.] Univ Texas San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Laosuthi, Thanarak] Kasetsart Univ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Reed, Robert R.] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Kasetsart University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Ghossoub, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",Edgar.Ghossoub@UTSA.edu,,,,,,,23,8,9,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The dataset covers a large sample of UK service and manufacturing firms. We find that stock market value is positively associated with own trade mark activity and trade mark-active firms achieve significantly higher value-added. Greater trade mark activity by competitors reduces net output of firms, but raises their stock market value.

The theory behind this point of view is represented by search-theoretic models. The fundamental shortcoming of the traditional version of these models is that they fail to make a distinction between different types of money, in particular between commodity money and fiduciary money. In the international context a fiduciary money can be accepted only when a political exchange is possible between a leading country which has an interest in producing trust in the future value of its currency and other countries which attach no importance to the relative gains the issuing country acquires by exploiting the privilege of seigniorage. The Bretton Woods system and the dollar standard, although based on fiduciary monies, have worked thanks to the institutional framework maintained by the United States and accepted by other countries. Unlike the United States, the euro area is not in a position to exercise any form of political leadership on the international scene. As things stand the euro does not represent a threat to the dollar and it is bound to remain a regional money.","[Pittaluga, Giovanni B.] Univ Genoa, Dept Polit Sci, Genoa, Italy; [Seghezza, Elena] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa; University of Genoa,"Pittaluga, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Polit Sci, Genoa, Italy.",pittagb@unige.it; seghezza@unige.it,,,,,,,79,4,5,2,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We show that the degree and direction of real wage cyclicality is determined by the interaction of (i) the returns to scale in production, (ii) the nature of aggregate shocks and (iii) monetary policy. Given that production technology is fairly constant in the short run, we suggest that variations in the real wage - output covariance depend largely on the combination of the latter two.

However, in the present scenario, the formal sector is unable to absorb the entire workforce. In view of these labour demand constraints in the formal sector, this paper sets out to explore the opportunities for the promotion of informal sector employment. It measures employment trends and patterns in the informal sector in India and estimates the sector's employment determinants using a large and nationally representative sample of individual data. The estimation also tests the hypothesis that the determinants of informal sector employment vary with the states' development levels. Our findings reveal that individuals without any general or technical education have a greater probability of entering the informal sector. As education increases, this probability decreases in all the states irrespective of their development level. In some cases, results for the underdeveloped states contrast with the developing and developed states. For instance, individuals in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category who always stay in the same employment catchment area have a greater probability of finding a job in the informal sector in the developed and developing states, while they have no exposure to finding a job in the informal sector in the underdeveloped states. Education (both general and technical) and migration are themain policy variables for the promotion of employment.","Inst Social & Econ Change, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",,"Bairagya, I (通讯作者)，Inst Social & Econ Change, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",indrajit@isec.ac.in,,"Bairagya, Indrajit/0000-0001-6068-2363",,,,,40,11,11,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Despite limited empirical evidence, this hypothesis rests on the assumption that global timber markets respond to a common equilibrating mechanism that provides strong enough incentives for loggers in the tropical regions of the world. This article develops a simple model and taps into a unique data set on timber prices of hardwood and softwood in leading markets to test the global timber markets hypothesis. While we find evidence of a global equilibrating mechanism with potentially significant economic incentives to affect tropical deforestation, our results do not endorse the common conjecture in the literature that timber price shocks in developed countries lead to a homogeneous response in terms of deforestation everywhere in the tropical world. Instead, they invite further development of structural global timber market models to assess the linkages between markets and the consequences of such linkages to deforestation.","[Chimeli, Ariaster B.; Boyd, Roy G.] Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Adams, Darius M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Resources, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio University; Oregon State University,"Chimeli, AB (通讯作者)，Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, 313 Bentley Annex, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",chimeli@ohio.edu,"Chimeli, Ariaster/D-8190-2015","Chimeli, Ariaster/0000-0002-4269-8924",,,,,28,5,6,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A coalition of the richest and most economically powerful segments of society, conservative politicians who represent their interests and right-wing populist groups like the Tea Party has demanded that deficits be eliminated by severe cuts at all levels of government in spending that either supports the poor and the middle class or funds crucial public investment. It also demands tax cuts for the rich and for business. These demands constitute a deliberate attempt to destroy the New Deal project, begun in the 1930s, whose goal was to subject capitalism to democratic control. In this paper I argue that our deficit crisis is the result of a shift from the New Deal-based economic model of the early postwar period to today's neoliberal, free-market model. The new model has generated slow growth, rising inequality and rising deficits. Rising deficits in turn created demands for austerity. After tracing the long-term evolution of our current deficit crisis, I show that this crisis should be resolved primarily by raising taxes on upper-income households and large corporations, cutting war spending and adopting a Canadian- or European-style health care system. Calls for massive government spending cuts should be seen as what they are-an attack by the rich and powerful against the basic interests of the American people.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Crotty, J (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",jcrotty@comcast.net,,,,,,,48,52,55,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Extending the approaches in Lemieux (2003), Zheng (2000) and Miles and Mora (2003), we conduct consistent specification tests not only on parametric functional forms but also on the semiparametric partially linear model to verify the effect of modelling choice on the schooling-earnings as well as the experience-earnings relationships.

We hope that this strategy will improve our understanding of the precise channels through which BITs determine aggregate investment. Using data on the foreign activity of the universe of German multinationals, we provide descriptive evidence on changes in the intensive and extensive margins of multinational firm activity around the adoption of BITs. The results of multivariate empirical models broadly support the hypotheses derived from a parsimonious model of heterogeneous firms on the effects of BITs on different margins of investment: BITs raise the number of multinational firms that are active in a particular host country and they have a positive effect on the number of plants per firm, as well as on FDI stocks and fixed assets per firm.","[Egger, Peter; Merlo, Valeria] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Egger, P (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",egger@kof.ethz.ch; merlo@kof.ethz.ch,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",,,,,35,39,40,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

We find that although there is less variation in director compensation for connected boards, which share a common director, than for unrelated boards, there remains a high variation in director compensation for directors with multiple directorships. We also find that active Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), on average, command higher total director compensation in subsequent board appointments. This result holds for appointments where the individual already holds two or more directorships and is counter to the prediction of a busy director effect. Overall, our evidence suggests that active CEOs are high-quality directors or have a high disutility of additional board work and are able to command higher compensation when added to subsequent boards.","[Farrell, Kathleen] Univ Nebraska, Dept Finance, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Hersch, Philip L.] Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Wichita State University,"Farrell, K (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Finance, Lincoln 214C CBA, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",kfarrell2@unl.edu,,,,,,,3,1,1,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This discrepancy, which is not caused by re-exporting through Hong Kong, varies by product categories, and in some cases takes the opposite sign. In this paper, we focus on China's direct exports to the United States. Using a model that allows for simultaneous misreporting to two authorities, we find strong statistical evidence of under-reporting exports at the Chinese border to avoid paying value-added tax (VAT). The value of VAT avoided is estimated at $6.5 billion during 2002-2008, and the associated understatements account for approximately two-thirds of the discrepancy. We also provide evidence of tariff evasion at the U.S. border, in particular for related-party transactions, and indirect evidence of transfer pricing and evasion of Chinese capital controls. An estimated $2 billion of U.S. tariff revenue is lost due to such evasion during 2002-2008, which reduces the apparent size of the statistical discrepancy.

According to job search and job matching theories, overqualification is a transitory problem. Other theories show that overqualification can also be of a permanent nature. We test the perpetuity of overeducation using panel data from the first eight waves of the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) covering the period 1999 to 2006. Our empirical analysis reveals little evidence for lasting rigidities that would cause permanent job mismatches. Rather, spells of overqualification are relatively short: about half of all individuals who were overqualified in a given year had an adequate job match 1 year later. While a short duration of overqualification would be consistent with job search and job matching theories, our observation that the probability of a job mismatch does not significantly decrease with experience is at odds with these theories. Our article provides an alternative explanation for this phenomenon: the constant accumulation of experience and qualifications throughout a worker's career implies that, for a good job match to be maintained, qualification-specific job requirements must increase as the worker ages. If this does not occur, even older workers face a risk of becoming overqualified.","[Sousa-Poza, Alfonso] Univ Hohenheim, Fac Business Econ & Social Sci, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Frei, Christa] Univ St Gallen, Dept Econ, St Gallen, Switzerland",University Hohenheim; University of St Gallen,"Sousa-Poza, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Fac Business Econ & Social Sci, Fruwirthstr 48, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",alfonso.sousa-poza@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Sousa-Poza, Alfonso/0000-0002-6524-9654",,,,,23,42,52,2,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show how the parameters of our model may be estimated by means of past mortgage delinquency rates. We give statistical evidence that the non-normal model is much more suitable than the one which assumes the normal distribution of risk factors. We point out in what way the assumption that risk factors follow a normal distribution can be dangerous.

We use a unified approach that simultaneously measures market power and efficiency to test the quiet life hypothesis of German savings banks. We find that average local market power declined between 1996 and 2006. Cost and profit efficiency remained constant. Nonparametric correlations are consistent with a quiet life regarding cost efficiency but not regarding profit efficiency. The quiet life on the cost side is negatively correlated with bank size, quality of loan portfolio and local per capita income. The last result indicates that the quiet cost life is therefore potentially due to benevolent excess consumption of local input factors by public savings banks.","[Koetter, M.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Koetter, M.] Univ Groningen, CIBIF, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Hackethal, A.; Vins, O.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Finance, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Groningen; University of Groningen; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Koetter, M (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.koetter@rug.nl,"Koetter, Michael/Y-5715-2019","Koetter, Michael/0000-0002-6525-8622",,,,,39,3,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Of late, science, notably medical science, seems to have become functionally subservient to market imperatives. We offer a twofold Hayekian analysis: a justification of the multiplicity view of spontaneous orders and a critique of the libertarian justification of market prioricity. Methodology/approach - This chapter brings to light Hayekian continuities between diverse literatures - philosophical, epistemological, cognitive, and scientific. Findings - The very precondition of knowledge is the exploitation of the epistemic virtues accorded by society's manifold of spontaneous forces, a manifold that gives context and definition to intimate, regulate, and inform action. The free-flow of information is the lifeblood of civil (liberal) society. The commoditization of medical knowledge promotes a dysfunctional free-flow of information that compromises notions of expertise and ultimately has implications for the greater good. Research limitations/implications - While we accept that there are irresolvable tensions between these epistemic magisteria we are troubled by the overt tampering with the spontaneous order mechanism of medical science. The lessons of Hayek are not being assimilated by many who would go by the adjective Hayekian. Originality/value of chapter - On offer is a Hayekian restatement (contra the libertarian view typically attributed to Hayek) cautioning that no one spontaneous order should dominate over another, neither should they be made conversable. Indeed, we argue that the healthy functioning of a market presupposes institutions that should not answer to market imperatives.","[Hardwick, David F.; Marsh, Leslie] Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,,,,,,,,,68,2,2,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78190-216-5,ADV AUSTRIAN ECON,,,2012,17,,,,,,37,60,,10.1108/S1529-2134(2012)0000017006,0.0,,,24,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJK95,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328736500004,0

The causes of these shocks varied during that period and stemmed from the mortgage crisis, the crisis in the banking sector or the problematic parameters in fiscal economies of individual countries, especially those in Europe. These causes were often interrelated, and, respectively, they followed each other in relatively quick succession. The article shows how to use the probit analysis to indicate the possible twists and turns in the development of economy based on high probability of their occurrence. Along with the probit analysis method, Koyck linear dynamic model with time-lagged independent (explanatory) variable is also used, which allow for setting the advance of those indicators that can affect economic development and mark the regime change-points.","[Hindls, Richard] Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fak Informatiky & Stat, Katedra Stat & Pravdepodobnosti, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Hronova, Stanislava] Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fak Informatiky & Stat, Katedra Ekonomicke Stat, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",,"Hindls, R (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fak Informatiky & Stat, Katedra Stat & Pravdepodobnosti, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",hindls@vse.cz; hronova@vse.cz,"Hronova, Stanislava/AAA-8360-2021","Hronova, Stanislava/0000-0002-3568-9755",,,,,25,0,0,0,8,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

For the manufacturing sector as a whole, our results lead us to reject the null hypothesis of a competitive market, although market imperfection varies across industry sectors. Meanwhile, the parameter for union bargaining power over firm profit was much smaller than those found in the previous studies and insignificant in some industry sectors. Our firm-level results indicate that intra-industry variation in mark-ups and returns to scale is greater than interindustry variation as shown in the sector analysis. Also, we find that mark-ups respond counter-cyclically to aggregate demand shocks and that the magnitudes of responses differ from industry to industry.","[Kim, Donghun] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Jeong, Kap-Young] Yonsei Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University; Yonsei University,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",dhkim2@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

However, at the dawn of its second decade of existence, Khazanah became much more transparent and accountable, and provided the public with more information about its activities, including a limited range of financial indicators.

The conditional logit estimates confirm that although industry-specific Korean agglomeration and domestic agglomeration play an important role, the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) location is more sensitively affected by the interstate difference in endowment conditions than by the same nationality agglomeration. Both business service and intermediate good agglomeration are main determinants of FDI location. Furthermore, estimation results show substantial change in the location pattern after recovery from the Asian financial crisis.

With the ongoing cross-Strait dialogue and closer commercial ties between Taiwan and China, the share of military spending in government expenditures (or GDP) has tended to gradually decline, which is in accordance with the change in defense policy from an offensive posture to a defensive-oriented attitude. In addition, we investigate the defense spending-inflation nexus in Taiwan. The multivariate structural change test identifies two break points and three regimes are categorized accordingly. The Granger causality test based on the VAR model reveals that the heavy defense burden in Taiwan during 1952-71 (the first regime) is essentially an important factor causing the higher price levels. However, when the tension across the Taiwan Strait is alleviated as well as the defense-oriented policy adopted, the military spending no longer plays a crucial role in determining inflation in the recent two regimes.

A simple theoretical model is used to illustrate that the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth is attributable to the effects of scale economies, market competition and technical change. We then examine empirically the effect of various factors on the TFP growth in the industry using panel data in 12 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries for the period 1983 through 2003. The empirical results are consistent with the theoretical prediction. A new finding in this article is that higher machinery and equipment (M&E) capital intensity and human capital contribute to higher TFP growth in the telecommunications services industry. The decomposition analysis also suggests that technical change induced by changes in M&E capital intensity and human capital are important sources of productivity performance in the industry across the OECD countries, contributing to about 20-50% and 2-7% of TFP growth, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of improving the conditions for M&E capital investment and the quality of human capital, which in turn could facilitate the adoption of new technologies and enhance the productivity in the industry.","Ind Canada, Econ Res & Policy Anal Branch, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H5, Canada",,"Ng, ECY (通讯作者)，Ind Canada, Econ Res & Policy Anal Branch, 235 Queen St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H5, Canada.",Eric.Ng@ic.gc.ca,,,,,,,44,4,5,3,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We present a model that predicts that financial development (i) increases employment and/or labour productivity and wages, with a smaller impact at high levels of the equilibrium wage and financial development; (ii) may induce either more or less reallocation of jobs depending on whether shocks to profit opportunities or to cash flow predominate; (iii) amplifies the output and employment losses in crises, firms that rely most on banks for liquidity being hit the hardest. Testing these predictions on international industry-level data for 19702003, we find that standard measures of financial development are indeed associated with greater employment growth, although only in non-OECD countries, and are not correlated with labour productivity or real wage growth. Moreover, they correlate negatively with inter-industry dispersion of employment growth. Finally, there is some evidence of a dark side of financial development, in that during banking crises employment grows less in the industries that are more dependent on external finance and those located in the more financially developed countries.","[Pagano, Marco] Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, EIEF, Naples, Italy; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England; Univ Salerno, Salerno, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; Imperial College London; University of Salerno,"Pagano, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, EIEF, Naples, Italy.",,"PAGANO, MARCO/AAD-8218-2022","PAGANO, MARCO/0000-0002-0709-6119",,,,,60,74,83,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Credibility is captured by a regime change from discretion to commitment. The policy determines the optimal output and inflation responses to a source of inflation risk. Bond yields contain compensations for this risk that depend on the policy. Credibility improvements reduce the exposure to inflation risk and bond risk premiums decline. A model calibration implies lower yield spreads, less volatile yields, and reduced deviations from the expectations hypothesis under commitment. The model suggests an explanation for changes in yield dynamics in the U.S. across different policy regimes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The time-series analysis of unemployment and vacancies as well as two other relevant labour market variables, real wages and real labour productivity, strongly suggests inefficiency in the Turkish labour market. A stable long-run relationship between unemployment rate and vacancy rate is found for Turkey, that is, the existence of a negatively sloped BC is verified. The estimated Turkish BC reflects the structural problems and lack of flexibility in the labour market. The modified BC with real wages and labour productivity reveals that labour productivity has no significant effect on unemployment rate whereas wages have positive and significant effects on the same variable.","[Saglam, Bahar Bayraktar; Gunalp, Burak] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Gunalp, B (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",gunalp@hacettepe.edu.tr,"Gunalp, Burak/I-8711-2013","Gunalp, Burak/0000-0001-6546-4031",,,,,35,6,6,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Finally, the inclusion of a variable measuring oil rents does not seem to substantially influence the results.","[Grabowski, Richard] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Self, Sharmistha] Missouri State Univ, Dept Econ, Springfield, MO 65897 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; Missouri State University,"Grabowski, R (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",ricardo@siu.edu,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We employ a recently developed procedure, based on a bivariate Markov switching model, to test the hypotheses of independence, causality and asymmetric causality between credit and output. Using a sample of 103 banking crises around the world, we find that neither credit nor output takes precedence as a variable in calm and crisis periods, although there is evidence of instantaneous interdependence between the banking and real sector during crises. The results suggest that shocks propagate mostly within a year between the banking sector and the real economy. The linear link between credit growth and output growth is also regime dependent.","[Serwa, Dobromil] Natl Bank Poland, Financial Syst Dept, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland; [Serwa, Dobromil] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; Warsaw School of Economics,"Serwa, D (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Poland, Financial Syst Dept, Ul Swietokrzyska 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland.",dobromil.serwa@nbp.pl,,"Serwa, Dobromil/0000-0002-1040-1815",,,,,30,4,4,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We use a vector error correction model and a threshold error correction model in order to asses the long-run and the short-run responsiveness of consumption to permanent changes in housing wealth. We find evidence supporting the existence of the housing wealth effect in all four countries, the strength of which is comparable with developed countries' wealth effect. In Bulgaria, Croatia and Estonia the response of consumption to housing wealth changes is characterised by threshold effects, while in the Czech Republic the wealth effect is detected only in the linear framework. The error correction model estimates suggest aggregate consumption adjusts to deviations from the long-run equilibrium; however, in countries where the wealth effect is characterised by threshold effects this adjustment process is partial and takes place when consumption is below levels warranted by the fundamentals. We also find evidence of relatively strong consumption persistence in three of the four countries.","[Vizek, Maruska] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Sonje, Amina Ahec] Zagreb Sch Econ & Management, Zagreb, Croatia; [Casni, Anita Ceh] Fac Econ, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Vizek, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.",mvizek@eizg.hr,"Časni, Anita Čeh/H-9236-2018","Časni, Anita Čeh/0000-0002-2742-8619",,,,,40,12,12,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24,1,,,,,73,85,,10.1080/14631377.2012.647629,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,918PH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302262100004,0

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the results of an employment promotion policy introduced in Spain in 2004 which increased the deductions to the Social Security contributions paid by employers that hired disabled women. We apply difference-in-difference models and estimate a recursive bivariate probit model to evaluate the existence of shifts in employment trends in the women relative to the men sample conditioning on the existence of preexisting trends. We find that the impact of the policy is significant and we estimate an average elasticity of employment of 0.14 for partially and of 0.08 for totally disabled women relative to the deductions in the employer Social Security contributions. Finally, when we extrapolate the results beyond our sample, we estimate that 7100 disabled women were able to find a job in Spain due to the policy with an associated cost of 10,997.900 euro for the government.

Rolling regression has been the main tool used to quantify such a relationship. This methodology suffers from several well-known problems which lead to spurious non-linear patterns in the Okun's coefficient behaviour over time. Here, we take a penalized regression spline approach to estimate the Okun's time-varying effects. As a result, spurious non-linearities are suppressed and hence important time-varying coefficient features revealed. Our empirical results show that the inverse relationship in some Euro area countries is spatially heterogeneous and time-varying.

Based on this premise, we propose a model of endogenously changing preferences in an intertemporal environment. The two types of agents are distinguished by their self-knowledge of the dynamically inconsistent preferences. In particular, we study the dynamic contract design problem of a monopolistic principal in this setup. Commitment contracts and spot contracts are contrasted. When types are known to the principal, commitment contracts are superior to spot arrangements. When types are unobservable, we arrive at several unconventional results. First, the first best outcome can still be achieved in the case of commitment contracts. Second, informational externality may extend in both directions when the first best spot contracts are not incentive compatible. Lastly, in the second best spot contracts, informational rent may accrue to both types of agents.","No Illinois Univ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",Northern Illinois University,"Zhang, W (通讯作者)，No Illinois Univ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",wzhang1@niu.edu,,,,,,,31,4,5,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We investigate whether professional car mechanics - as real sellers of credence goods - react in the same way to changes in informational and institutional constraints.

We show how differences in the investors' level of technology and differences in the host country government's trade-off between bribes and taxes determine who wins the competition for the resource and the winning price. One finding is that competition from a bribe-willing investor may induce a bribe-averse investor to enter into corruption.

In large societies, norms are enforced by specialists such as government officials. However, not every public cause is overseen by states, for instance those organized at the international level. This paper shows how nongovernmental norm enforcement can emerge as a decentralized equilibrium. As a first stage, individuals voluntarily contribute to a nongovernmental agency that produces an incentive system. The second stage is the provision of a public good on the basis of private contributions. The incentive system increases contributions by means of public approval or disapproval of behavior. It is shown that, even in large populations, nongovernmental norm enforcement can be supported in a noncooperative equilibrium of utility-maximizing individuals. This result is in sharp contrast to those obtained in the standard situation of voluntary provision of an intrinsic public good whichwithout altruism or related motivesis eroded by free-riding. Reliance on altruistic behavior is not required in supplying the second-order public good norm enforcement in large societies.","[Buchholz, Wolfgang] Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [Falkinger, Josef] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ruebbelke, Dirk] TU Bergakad Freiberg, Fac Business Adm, Freiberg, Germany",University of Regensburg; University of Zurich; Technical University Freiberg,"Buchholz, W (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",wolfgang.buchholz@wiwi.uni-regensburg.de; josef.falkinger@econ.uzh.ch; dirk.ruebbelke@vwl.tu-freiberg.de,"Rübbelke, Dirk/M-5604-2013","Rübbelke, Dirk/0000-0002-9934-8570",,,,,29,6,6,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The increasing volatility of crude oil prices in the last decade has encouraged many researchers to model its dynamics. Recent studies have tried to explain this dynamics by taking into account the role of various market participants many of whom have increasingly used crude oil for portfolio diversification. We propose a modified supply-demand framework which assumes that the real price of crude oil is affected not only by fundamental shocks but also by financial shocks. We assess the role of what we define as the financial shock component when describing the dynamics of the real crude oil price and endeavor to measure a possible equilibrium relationship between standard supply/demand variables and our financial shock component. Using a Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) approach and an ECM framework we are able to empirically assess the significant role of hedging pressure on the real price of oil and find evidence that the impact of the hedging pressure is not only affecting quick reverting short-term deviations but also the structural long-run equilibrium of the oil price.

This paper investigates the societal implications of two interdependency types that are not adequately addressed in the existing literature: early adoption advantages (EAAs) and institutional change (IC). EM corresponds to the use-value that agents create with the innovation, if they can adopt it earlier than others. Institutions are shared routines in society following the definition of Veblen (1919) and IC can be regarded as the changes in institutions that are induced by increasing levels of diffusion. In both EM and IC, the adoption decisions of consumers depend on the number of existing adopters and this paper demonstrates that these interdependencies can lead to involuntary technology adoptions. That is, for some individuals, adoption is a worse state than their initial state before the launch of the innovation. Once it is launched, however, non-adoption becomes an even worse state. Hence, the agents adopt the innovation, albeit not happily. This implies that a society can 'lock-in' to inefficient, partially harmful or destructive technologies that entail these particular forms of consumer interdependencies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By doing so, we are able to overcome the issue of unavailable itemized spending data on land revenues. The behavioral foundation of leading local officials on land revenues is that they may be treated as discretionary funds that will be spent on projects that can benefit local officials' political advancements. Thus it is hypothesized that Chinese local officials intend to channel land revenues more toward growth-oriented infrastructure such as urban roads, more toward image projects such as public squares and open space, and more toward projects that help to boost public impression of local economic success on which cadre evaluation weighs heavily. We test those hypotheses using a panel data of Chinese prefecture cities from 1999 to 2006. Econometric estimates confirm those hypotheses.

Using panel data estimation, and after controlling for other determinants of industry concentration (entry barriers, market size, and growth), we found a significant negative impact of FDI on industry concentration. This finding is in line with the results of the empirical literature on other developed countries. Moreover, it supports the argument that FDI has positive effects on domestic firms, eventually through positive externalities, and contradicts the widespread view that in small economies FDI increases concentration. Overall, this study adds to the controversial literature on FDI and concentration, and it is the first study on this topic applied to Portugal.","[Forte, Rosa; Sarmento, Paula] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Forte, R (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",rforte@fep.up.pt; sarmento@fep.up.pt,"Forte, Rosa/AAG-2716-2019; Sarmento, Paula/B-6113-2009","Forte, Rosa/0000-0002-3441-9112; Sarmento, Paula/0000-0002-4199-6030",,,,,32,7,7,0,23,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

It then proposes three lines of policy that take account of the special characteristics of developing countries: resource allocation policies targeted at segments of strategic importance for economic and financial development; policies to control financial and external fragility; and compensatory policies of a more interventionist cast, in particular directed credit programmes for both public- and private-sector lending to complement resource allocation policies, and countercyclical regulatory barriers so that fragility can be better controlled.","Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Hermann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",jenniferh@terra.com.br,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,6,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,DEC,2014,,114,,,,,67,82,,,,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF4LI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352520200004,0

The model incorporates an active banking sector and pays particular attention to the leverage of both firms and banks. It is shown that the endogenous change in the desired margins of safety of firms and banks is likely to transform an otherwise stable debt-burdened economy into an unstable one. The endogeneity of the desired margins of safety can also produce, under certain conditions, investment and leverage cycles during which investment and leverage move both in the same and in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the paper investigates the potential stabilising role of fiscal policy. It is indicated that fiscal policy can reduce the destabilising forces in the macroeconomy when government expenditures adjust adequately to variations in the divergence between the actual and the desired margins of safety.

Our analysis shows that although there have been improvements in the child anthropometric measures height-for-age and weight-for-age over the last two decades, children, particularly girls from non-one child households have adverse nutritional outcomes. These gender differences persist in two-child households, where boys have better height-for-age outcomes when their sibling is a male rather than a female.

We find that having more than one judge consider cases reduces error effectively. This does not mean that it is necessary to deliberate about all cases. In simple cases many errors can be avoided by mechanical aggregation of independent opinions, and deliberation has no added value. In difficult cases discussion leads to less error. The advantage of deliberation goes beyond the case at hand: although we provide no feedback about the quality of verdicts, it improves individual decisions in subsequent cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Any attempt to identify the impact of parental migration on children's school performance may encounter the problem of endogeneity. We use unique survey data from more than 7600 4th and 5th grade students from 74 rural elementary schools. Using an instrumental variable estimation, our results indicated that having migrant parents can marginally reduce a child's math score rank by 15.60%, which implies that the current economic growth in China partially jeopardizes the future of the next rural generation.

However, the rule does not take explicitly into account the zero lower bound on the interest rate. Prior studies on interest rate selection subject to the zero lower bound have not produced derivations of explicit formulas. In this work, Taylor-like rules for central bank interest rates bounded below by zero are derived rigorously using a multi-parametric model predictive control framework. This framework is used to derive rules with or without inertia. The proposed approach is illustrated through simulations. Application of the approach to US economy data demonstrates its relevance and provides insight into the objectives underlying central bank interest rate decisions.

We use a stock trading laboratory experiment to investigate if it is possible to reduce subjects' tendency to exhibit a disposition effect by making information about a stock's purchase price, and thus about capital gains and losses, less salient. We compare two experimental conditions: a high-saliency condition in which the purchase price of a stock is prominently displayed by the trading software, and a low-saliency condition in which it is not displayed at all. We find that individuals exhibit a disposition effect in the high-saliency condition, and that the effect is 25% smaller in the low-saliency condition.

Our results indicate that China's political risk index was ranked 48th among 153 economies in 2011, in the lower risk level of the PRI spectrum. In an international comparison of political risk distribution, the proportion of Chinese outward direct investment (ODI) among countries with high political risk is less than the world average. The Chinese ODI political risk index has significantly improved and remains lower than the world average. To improve Chinese ODI PRI, the Chinese Government should continue to implement differentiation strategies and to offer official development assistance to improve the investment environment in developing countries and reduce political risk.","[Guo, Jiann-jong] Tamkang Univ, Inst China Studies, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Wang, Guo-chen] Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Tung, Chien-hung] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Program Landscape Architecture & Recreat, Taichung 40227, Taiwan",Tamkang University; National Chung Hsing University,"Guo, JJ (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Inst China Studies, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",jj03082011@gmail.com; guochenwang@hotmail.com; ct176@columbia.edu,,,,,,,58,11,15,2,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2014,22,6,,,,,22,43,,10.1111/cwe.12090,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AU0WI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345342500002,0

Yet there are reasons to believe that such choices involve a degree of self-sacrifice, in particular in developing countries where rural regions typically combine geographic hostile environment, high levels of poverty, low educational opportunities, limited access to basic services and worse career opportunities. On the other hand, as shortage of qualified staff is higher in rural areas, the returns on the presence of a health worker, and the benefits to the populations, are likely to be higher. Using data from a longitudinal study of nurses in South Africa this paper tests this hypothesis by linking experimental measure of pro-social preferences and revealed preferences outcomes. Three measures of pro-social preferences are constructed based on donations made by study participants in a dictator game played at baseline. Job choices are observed three years later for more than 97% of the initial sample. We show that the more dedicated the nurses - measured by their generosity towards patients in the dictator game - the more likely they are to have chosen a rural job. This result is robust to the inclusion of various demographic controls and to different econometric specifications. This finding contributes to the literature on role of pro-social values as an intrinsic motivation factor in labour supply decisions and it has policy implications for the provision of social services in difficult settings.

In both countries, ancillary carbon reductions resulting from SO2 and NOx control tend to rise with the increased stringency of control targets, reflecting the eventual need for wholesale change toward non-fossil technologies when large reductions are required. Under stringent pollution targets, the non-target effects tend to be higher in China than in the U.S., due to China's heavy reliance on coal. This result suggests that China may have greater incentives to reduce SO2 and NOx with locally apparent pollution benefits, but related efforts would at the same time reduce CO2 emissions significantly.

Our results indicate that an energy price shock has a negative impact on productivity growth in the short run (1 year). An energy price shock and an agricultural productivity shock each account for about 10% of U.S. agricultural commodity price volatility with the productivity shock's contribution slightly higher. However, the impact from energy prices outweighs the contribution of agricultural productivity in the medium term (3 years).

An implication is that even in asset markets where the search frictions are very small, asset prices respond to changes in liquidity. Another implication is that asset liquidity is a state variable, the dynamics of which are analysed. I demonstrate that transition paths of liquidity to its (stable) steady state can exhibit dramatic divergence before convergence following small positive deviations in the measure of buyers in the market. Thus, adjustment costs of entry are a potential source of volatility by generating large waves of liquidity, or tsunami, in asset markets. I quantitatively assess the ability of the mechanism to generate asset market booms and busts via the implied price movements.","Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, Y (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",yongkim75@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

We adopt a generalized recursive ambiguity model to accommodate the investor's aversion to model uncertainty. The investor deals with specification doubts by slanting his beliefs about submodels of returns pessimistically, causing his investment strategy to be more conservative than the Bayesian strategy. Unlike in the Bayesian framework, the hedging demand against model uncertainty may cause the investor's stock allocation to decrease sharply given a small doubt of return predictability, even though the expected return according to the VAR model is large. Over much of the parameter space, the robust strategy is very close to the Bayesian strategy with Epstein-Zin preferences and risk aversion chosen to match the same average portfolio holdings. This is true in particular when the IID model is unlikely and the dividend yield is low, as in recent years. However, differences in strategies can be substantial if the IID model is unlikely and the dividend yield is high. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The main distinctive features of the model are related to: (a) the role played by the public sector in redeploying income between workers and capitalists, since it is assumed that the bargaining power of the two classes affects tax rates and transfers levied upon them; (b) the influence that past events have on the agents' current behavior, with particular regard to consumption patterns; (c) the specification of firms' investment function, which incorporate Keynesian and Harrodian elements by assuming that investments are a function of both the difference between interest and profit rate and the discrepancy between actual and desired capital to output ratio. Since all these assumptions imply possible balance sheets disequilibrium, particular regard is dedicated to the analysis of macroagents' debt dynamics. Special emphasis is placed on the analysis of the destabilization of equilibria via Hopf bifurcations, which leads to the emergence of an interesting and rich cyclical dynamics.

We study this question experimentally using generosity as a sign and a signal of trustworthiness, and a trust game. Subjects play a dictator game unaware that later they will play a trust game and that their level of generosity in the dictator game will be revealed to trusters, with some inaccuracy, before trusters decide whether to trust or not. Once made aware of what follows, trustees have the option to play a second dictator game, from which their choice will be accurately conveyed to trusters in addition to their decision in the initial game. Consistent with 'countersignalling theory', those who, in the first dictator game, were either miserly or generous do not play the second dictator game, resigned or content with the information conveyed by their past actions. Those neither miserly nor generous in the first dictator game, an intermediate generous group, are likeliest to use the second dictator game; many of them for the purpose of signalling, so that they are not confused with the miserly.

Rankings are gaining prominence as countries adopt regular research assessment exercises that especially reward publication in high-impact journals. Yet even within a rankings-oriented discipline like economics there is no agreement on how aggressively lower-ranked journals are down-weighted and in how wide is the universe of journals considered. Moreover, since it is typically less costly for authors to cite superfluous references, whether of their own volition or prompted by editors, than it is to ignore relevant ones, rankings based on citations may be easily manipulated. In contrast, when the merits of publication in one journal or another are debated during hiring, promotion, and salary decisions, the evaluators are choosing over actions with costly consequences. We therefore look to the academic labor market, using data on economists in the University of California system to relate their lifetime publications in 700 different academic journals to salary. We test amongst various sets of journal rankings, and publication discount rates, to see which are most congruent with the returns implied by the academic labor market.","[Gibson, John; Tressler, John] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Anderson, David L.] Queens Univ, Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Waikato; Queens University - Canada,"Gibson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",jkgibson@waikato.ac.nz; dla@queensu.ca; tressler@waikato.ac.nz,"Gibson, John/AAM-6159-2020","Gibson, John/0000-0003-3886-6873",,,,,43,38,41,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

These beliefs can in turn create a social pressure to behave well, as good works can also signal to others that individuals belong to the elect and are therefore likely to behave well in social interactions. Moreover, the Consistory, an institution created by Calvin to monitor and publicize individuals' behavior, can allow for such social signalling.

We use the construction of the trade cost variables based on Baltic Dry Index in primary goods as instruments of trade openness to address the endogeneity issue. We find that the increase in trade openness leads to an increase in government size: a 1 percent expansion in trade openness (trade GDP ratio) raises government consumption over GDP ratio by approximately 0.1-0.2 percentage points on average. Its quantitative significance emphasizes the importance of rethinking the costs and benefits of trade openness for SDCs.,"[Lin, Faqin; Li, Bing] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sim, Nicholas C.

We present an empirical analysis of inequality that specifically considers the path from individual wages and earnings, to household earnings, after-tax income, and finally consumption. We find that household earnings inequality rose substantially over this period. This rise is made up of two distinct episodes: from 1981 to 1996 all incomes rose, but they rose faster at higher percentiles; from 1996 to 2008 incomes above the 50th percentile remained flat but they fell at and below the 50th percentile. Inequality in disposable income and in consumption also rose over this period but to a lesser extent, suggesting taxes and transfers as well as insurance channels available to households helped to insulate household consumption from shocks to wages. We find the same pattern in inequality trends when we look over the life cycle of households as we do over time in the economy. Additionally we find that there are notable differences in the inequality trends for wages and hours between men and women over this period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

By employing the Granger causality tests of Cheung and Ng (1996) and Hong (2001), we show evidence of short-term (up to 6 months), medium-term (up to 12 months) and long-term (up to 24 months) causality for the Czech Republic and Hungary. In the case of Poland, only medium-term and long-term causality is found. Using rolling-correlation analysis, we find that although the growth-returns relationship is positive during the examined period, there is an apparent variability in the strength of this relationship that is particularly visible during the period of the financial crisis in the late 2000s. Consequently, we find that the predictive power of stock markets in the CEE-3 countries increases during periods of high market volatility and decreases during periods of economic recovery.

Using endogenous growth models in which the government levies an income tax to provide public inputs to the production of private firms, the paper demonstrates that such perceptions of growth constraints may be misleading from a policy perspective. In particular, firms can be expected to systematically overestimate the growth-enhancing effects of lower tax rates relative to public services and public capital, and underestimate the growth-enhancing effects of greater provision of public capital relative to taxation and public services. In addition, we show that firms rank different public services and different types of public capital according to the actual costs they impose on firms. It is then shown that these theoretical predictions regarding how firms rank constraints correspond closely to the observed ranking of constraints by firms in the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys.","[Misch, Florian] Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany; [Gemmell, Norman] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Gemmell, Norman; Kneller, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Victoria University Wellington; University of Nottingham,"Misch, F (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany.",misch@zew.de; norman.gemmell@vuw.ac.nz; richard.kneller@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Kneller, Richard/0000-0002-4542-5358",,,,,23,3,3,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

The present research highlights the role of two contributors to this pattern. First, the results suggest that evaluations are more sensitive to rare events than decisions. It seems that the implied weighting of the peak experiences is a reflection of beliefs that affect evaluation and decisions in different ways. Second, the results show clear indications of underweighting rare events in ongoing decisions, but not in planning decisions. This pattern can be explained with the assertion of beliefs concerning the probability of the peak event is approximately accurate on average, but it changes from trial to trial.

Regret aversion is characterized by a utility function that includes disutility from having chosen ex-post suboptimal alternatives. We show that a negative spread between fixed and variable rate loans is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the dominance of variable rate loans over fixed rate loans. If the bank optimally extends both fixed and variable rate loans, the total amount of loans depends neither on the bank's regret aversion nor on the funding cost uncertainty. The bank, however, optimally lends less should it be forced to assume the entire funding cost uncertainty by exclusively extending fixed rate loans. Finally, using a two-state example, we show that the bank optimally extends more (less) fixed rate loans than in the case of pure risk aversion if the high (low) marginal cost of funds is more likely to prevail. Regret aversion as such plays a crucial role in determining the bank's optimal choice between fixed and variable rate loans. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While investment is higher under ownership rather than functional separation, the latter may yield the highest social welfare among vertical industry structures.

His international influence started at an early stage. The article offers scattered archive observations on Klein's early years from undergraduate study to the University of Pennsylvania in 1958. Klein was in 1944 recruited by the Cowles Commission in Chicago to construct the first macroeconomic model in the USA, drawing on the experiences of the interwar modeling work of Jan Tinbergen and the new path-breaking econometric methods developed by Trygve Haavelmo. The first Klein model was taken into use at the end of 1945 to shed light on the prospects for the US economy in the transition from war to peace. After two-three years in Chicago Chicago, Klein traveled for a year in Europe and initiated macroeconometric modeling work in Canada, at the University of Michigan, and at Oxford University. This was only the beginning of the lifelong influence exerted on modelers around the globe.

J,"Boeters, S",,,,"Boeters, Stefan",,,Optimally differentiated carbon prices for unilateral climate policy,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate policy; Uniform carbon price; Carbon price differentiation; Optimal taxation; Computable general equilibrium model,TAX; COST,"Economic thought on climate policy as an instance of environmental regulation is strongly influenced by the principle of a uniform carbon price. Economists acknowledge that this principle breaks down in a second-best world with other distortions, such as taxes and market power in domestic and international markets. However, systematic analysis of this point in the economic climate policy literature is scarce. In the present paper, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) set-up is chosen in order to examine what pattern of differentiated carbon prices emerges as optimal in a second-best world. The CGE model WorldScan, which is considered to be representative of the class of models routinely used for numerical climate policy analysis, produces three main results: First, the optimal pattern of carbon prices is highly differentiated, ranging from almost prohibitive taxes to high subsidies (with a range of more than 1700 euros per ton of CO2). Second, the welfare gain from switching from a uniform price to optimally differentiated prices is enormous, equivalent to a 27% emission reduction for free. Third, the most important drivers of carbon price differentiation are market power in export markets as well as taxes on consumption, intermediate inputs and domestic output. This shows that carbon price differentiation cannot be dismissed as a policy option lightly. However, before translating these findings into concrete policy advice, the relevant features of modelling preexisting distortions in CGE models need close revision. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This conclusion is special, however, to the case of continuous full employment. When the assumption of perfect wage flexibility is relaxed very slightly so that the labor market clears quickly but not instantaneously, determinacy is the norm. The threat of indeterminacy is limited to a tiny, irrelevant corner of the parameter space where the elasticity of labor supply is unusually high and real wage adjustment is unbelievably fast. Everywhere else, the Taylor principle guarantees a unique rational expectations equilibrium. The dramatic difference in results reflects the sensitivity of the monetary transmission mechanism to the speed of adjustment in the labor market. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The improved consumption feedback provided, and in particular, the installation of in-house displays, has been shown to significantly reduce residential electricity demand in some international trials. This paper attempts to uncover the underlying drivers of such information-led reductions by exploring two research questions. First, does feedback improve a household's stock of information about potential energy reducing behaviours? And second, do improvements in such information help explain the demand reductions associated with the introduction of smart metering and time-of-use tariffs? Data is from a randomised controlled smart metering trial (Ireland) which also collected extensive information on household attitudes towards energy conservation and self-reported stocks of information related to energy saving. As with previous results in Ireland, we find that participation in a smart metering programme with time-of-use tariffs significantly reduces demand. Although treated households also increased their selfreported energy-reducing information, such improvements are not correlated with demand reductions in the short-run. Given this result, it is possible that feedback and other information provided in the context of smart metering are mainly effective in reducing and shifting demand because they act as a reminder and motivator.

In this essay, I argue that this network perspective on production linkages can offer novel insights on how local shocks occurring along this production network can propagate across the economy and give rise to aggregate fluctuations. First, I discuss how production networks can be mapped to a standard general equilibrium setup. In particular, through a series of stylized examples, I demonstrate how the propagation of sectoral shocks-and hence aggregate volatility-depends on different arrangements of production, that is, on different shapes of the underlying production network. Next I explore, from a network perspective, the empirical properties of a large-scale production network as given by detailed US input-output data.

That game in turn is used as the basis for constructing another Bayesian game which has no Bayesian equilibria at all, even in non-measurable strategies, in a construction complementary to one appearing in Friedenberg and Meier [1].

The period under study was one of rapid growth at the economy level, while the main sectors have undergone considerable churn and reallocation. The findings are based on an analysis of firm-level data and display dramatically different pictures for the two main sectors. In business services large establishments that are mostly state-owned use an important portion of production factors inefficiently. Firms need to be very productive to enter the market and, on average, exiting firms are more productive than incumbents in business services. In contrast, in manufacturing industries the market selection mechanism is effective, the state-owned firms are as productive as private establishments and factor allocation is more efficient.","Inst Natl Stat & Etud Econ Grand Duche Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Kilinç, U (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Stat & Etud Econ Grand Duche Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",umut.kilinc@statec.etat.lu,,,,,,,25,2,2,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,SEP,2014,26,3,,,,,359,375,,10.1080/14631377.2014.937095,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AO7HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341523600004,0

Three measures of firm performance are used, namely: market share, revenue and productivity. Special attention is paid to differences in the impact on the performance measures depending on a firm's position as either a market incumbent or entrant. We find that while access prices have a negative effect on entrants' market share and revenue, the effect on incumbents' market share, revenue and productivity is positive. Further, we find that multinational entrants perform better than national entrants in terms of their market share but worse in terms of their revenue and productivity. The opposite is true of incumbent multinationals which perform better than nationals in terms of their revenue and productivity but worse in terms of their market share. This confirms that a firm's multinational status has a significant impact on its performance, and that this impact differs for incumbents and entrants. Finally, when evaluating the impact of access prices on firm performance at the mean performance of national and multinational firms, we find that the impact of access prices is lower for multinational than for national firms.","[Trujillo-Baute, Elisa] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Montolio, Daniel] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Business, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Montolio, Daniel] Inst Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Trujillo-Baute, Elisa] IESE Barcelona, Publ Private Sect Res Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Trillas, Francesc] Barcelona Inst Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Warwick; University of Barcelona; University of Navarra,"Trujillo-Baute, E (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Room B2-01, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",elisatrujillo@ub.edu,"Montolio, Daniel/F-1204-2016; Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/L-2128-2014; Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/P-2285-2019","Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/0000-0002-6328-3242; Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/0000-0002-6328-3242",Catalan Autonomous Government [2009SGR102]; Barcelona Institute of Economics,Catalan Autonomous Government; Barcelona Institute of Economics,"We would like to thank Joan Calzada, Mattia Nardotto, Miguel A.

On the one hand, we study the properties of the emerging networks and we show that they reproduce the stylized facts of innovation networks. Moreover, we focus the analysis on the impact of these three innovation categories on the macro economic aggregate, finding that collaborative companies are those having the highest positive impact on the economic system.

However, the impact of FDI on inequality not only remains controversial, but has not received the same attention, particularly from scholars of transition economies (Vijaya and Kaltani 2007; Zulfiu-Alili 2014). Foreign-owned firms are increasingly important employers of labor in transition economies and pay higher wages than their domestic counterparts, all else being constant. Even though Macedonia has introduced extensive fiscal and business-sector reforms, it has lagged behind in attracting foreign investment, with thus far only a limited impact on employment. Using data from the People-Centred Analyses (PCA) survey for 2008, this article examines the question of whether foreign-owned firms pay higher wages than domestically owned firms in Macedonia, and whether this effect is associated with workers' characteristics such as education, age, and gender distribution, ethnicity, region, type of contract, and occupation. This relationship is examined first by estimating an earnings equation and by decomposing overall wage inequality into inequality within groups and between groups, where the groups are defined by type of ownership, type of contract, level of education, occupation, age, gender, ethnicity, and region. The empirical results suggest that foreign-owned firms pay higher wages than their domestic counterparts, all else being equal. In addition, a decomposition analysis indicates that wage inequality is higher within foreign-owned firms than in domestically owned firms.","South East European Univ, Fac Publ Adm & Polit Sci, Econ, Tetovo, North Macedonia",,"Zulfiu-Alili, M (通讯作者)，South East European Univ, Fac Publ Adm & Polit Sci, Econ, Tetovo, North Macedonia.",,"Alili, Merita Zulfiu/B-2953-2016","Alili, Merita Zulfiu/0000-0002-6367-6193",,,,,52,7,9,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Quantifying productivity using our model shows that a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function generates unbiased estimates of TFP but biased estimates of marginal product and elasticity of substitution across skills. Our model also generates estimates of the TFP distribution based on CEO compensation alone.","[Eeckhout, Jan] UCL, London WC1H 0AX, England; GSE UPF, Barcelona, Spain; Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of London; University College London; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Eeckhout, J (通讯作者)，UCL, 30 Gordon St, London WC1H 0AX, England.",j.eeckhout@ucl.ac.uk,"Eeckhout, Jan/A-3981-2008","Eeckhout, Jan/0000-0001-6509-4296; PINHEIRO, ROBERTO/0000-0002-5989-4999",,,,,57,3,7,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

(2011) propose random orthogonal matrix (ROM) simulation for generating multivariate samples matching means and covariances exactly. Its computational efficiency compared to standard Monte Carlo methods makes it an interesting alternative. In this paper we enhance this method's attractiveness by focusing on applications in finance. Many financial applications require simulated asset returns to be free of arbitrage opportunities. We analytically derive no-arbitrage bounds for expected excess returns to be used in the context of ROM simulation, and we establish the theoretical relation between the number of states (i.e., the sample size) and the size of (no-)arbitrage regions. Based on these results, we present a No-Arbitrage ROM simulation algorithm, which generates arbitrage-free random samples by purposefully rotating a simplex. Hence, the proposed algorithm completely avoids any need for checking samples for arbitrage. Compared to the alternative of (potentially frequent) re-sampling followed by arbitrage checks, it is considerably more efficient As a by-product, we provide interesting geometrical insights into affine transformations associated with the No-Arbitrage ROM simulation algorithm.

We consider the choice of optimal bribes by corrupt officials and the share of the proceeds of corruption that will be concealed in tax havens. Our framework provides novel welfare implications of tax havens. First, tax havens' services have a positive effect on welfare through encouraging investment by firms fearing expropriation and bribes in corrupt countries. Second, by supporting corruption and the concealment of officials' bribes, tax havens discourage the provision of public goods and hence have also a negative effect on welfare. The net welfare effect depends on the specified preferences and parameters. One source of this ambiguity is that the presence of multinational firms in corrupted countries is positively associated with demanding tax havens' operations. Using firm-level data, we provide new empirical results supporting this hypothesis. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (3) (2014) 739-754.

Using local comparisons within Gujarat, a single Indian state known for both its non-violent local traditions and for widespread ethnic pogroms in 2002,1 provide evidence that where political competition was focused upon towns where ethnic groups have historically competed, there was a rise in the propensity for ethnic rioting and increased electoral support for the incumbent party complicit in the violence. However, where political competition was focused in towns that historically enjoyed inter-ethnic complementarities, there were fewer ethnic riots, and these towns also voted against the incumbent. These historic legacies proved to be important predictors of the identity of the winner even in very close electoral races. I argue that these results reflect the role local inter-ethnic economic relations can play in altering the nature and the benefits of political campaigns that encourage ethnic violence.

The first, from 1952 to 1973, was highly dynamic. In the second, from 1973 to 1991, this dynamism lessened. Lastly, between 1991 and 2008, the dynamism of technical change recovered slightly. The wage share held fairly steady throughout the period. The rate of profit dropped between 1952 and 1991 before rising slightly from 1991 to 2008. The net capital accumulation rate contracted after 1975 because of the decline in the rates of profit and investment.

We offer an agency-based explanation by considering competition between an original home manufacturer and a foreign retailer. The model endogenizes the role of the retailer as an agent with private information on the perceived quality of the good in its own market. The manufacturer cannot control the retailer once the latter has ordered its sales quantity but it can limit the initial offer. If parallel trade is permitted, this offer will fall if there is incomplete information, resulting in a small, or zero, volume of parallel trade. This outcome makes both the original producer and foreign consumers worse off, while offering little benefit to home consumers, compared to the case where such trade is banned. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the first two weeks, individuals assigned to the transit subsidy group apply and interview for 19% more jobs than those not receiving subsidies. The subsidies generate the greatest increase in search intensity for individuals living far from employment opportunities. Some suggestive evidence indicates that greater search intensity translates into shorter unemployment durations.

According to this global view reserve accumulation might destabilize the international financial system. Since the crisis affects all countries alike, the accumulation of reserves imposes a negative externality on non-accumulating countries. We integrate this idea in a theoretical model of the optimal amount of reserves and illustrate the gap between local and global optimality: the consideration of systemic risk lowers the demand for reserves. Moreover, if a supranational authority determines the optimal level of reserves, it internalizes the negative externality and accumulates fewer reserves. A macroprudential tax on reserve hoardings might implement the socially optimal solution. Our calibration analysis shows that these considerations are economically significant: they lower the optimal amount of reserves in the benchmark case by 45%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We utilize a panel data-set spanning from 1994 to 2008 and the model is estimated using panel least squares, fixed effects, random effects and generalized method of moments with various types of effects specifications and transformations. The key finding from the empirical study is that there is a significant relationship between patenting activity and financial performance at the Malaysian firm level, but that the impact is rather small and that the signs on the coefficients are mixed.

When an equilibrium exists, partnership and revenue distribution will be automatically and endogenously determined by the process. Moreover, several fundamental properties of the equilibrium solution and the model are derived. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A feature of the analysis is that a high cost firm participating in a merger can learn from the low cost participant. The determination of the equilibrium ownership structure (EOS) rests on the size of the cost asymmetries and learning abilities. Using an endogenous merger model, we find that the EOS always involves a merger between the two most efficient firms. This result holds whether firms adopt a decentralized or centralized structure post-merger and whether learning abilities are known or uncertain pre-merger.

This article explores the role that access to information technology, in particular, plays in enhancing, or possibly detracting from, the transfer function of the community college. Using data from the first-ever field experiment randomly providing free computers to students, we examine the relationships between access to home computers and enrollment in transferable courses and actual transfers to 4-year colleges. The results from the field experiment indicate that the treatment group of students receiving free computers has a 4.5 percentage point higher probability of taking transferable courses than the control group of students not receiving free computers. The evidence is less clear for the effects on actual transfers to 4-year colleges and the probability of using a computer to search for college information (which possibly represents one of the mechanisms for positive effects). In both cases, point estimates are positive, but the confidence intervals are wide. Finally, power calculations indicate that sample sizes would have to be considerably larger to find statistically significant treatment effects and reasonably precise confidence intervals given the actual transfer rate point estimates.

Building on autoregressive distributed lag modelling, mean-group and pooled mean-group estimation methods, we use annual data over the 1960-2010 period for a panel of 22 OECD countries and find significant support for the 'law'. Next, we also explore empirically the hypothesis that the BOP-constrained growth rate (y (B) ) must equal the natural (or potential) rate of growth (y (N) ) and find that the data do not reject this hypothesis. Finally, we adopt a new approach, based on panel Granger causality methods, to explore the direction of causality between y (B) and y (N) . The results indicate the existence of unidirectional long-run causality from y (B) to y (N) , thus reinforcing the view, embodied in the law that long-run growth is determined by demand and constrained by the BOP.","[Lanzafame, Matteo] Univ Messina, I-98100 Messina, Italy",University of Messina,"Lanzafame, M (通讯作者)，Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Ambientali & Meto, Via T Cannizzaro 278, I-98122 Messina, Italy.",mlanzafame@unime.it,"Lanzafame, Matteo/T-4799-2019","Lanzafame, Matteo/0000-0003-0737-3005",,,,,41,26,34,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Denmark's fixed exchange rate implies that the nominal interest rate remains fixed after a fiscal expansion, facilitating a substantial impact of the fiscal stimulus on the real economy. On the other hand, the large degree of openness of the Danish economy means that a sizeable share of the fiscal stimulus will be directed towards imported goods. Our results suggest that the 'monetary accomodation channel' dominates the 'leakage effect' in the short run. We demonstrate that fiscal stimulus has a rather large impact on economic activity in the very short run, with a government spending multiplier of 1.1 on impact in our preferred specification. We also find that the effects of fiscal stimulus are rather short-lived in Denmark, with the effect on output becoming insignificant after around two years. The fiscal multiplier is above 1 only in the first quarter, and drops to 0.6 one year after the shock. We also find that in the short run, the government spending multiplier is larger than the tax multiplier. Finally, we demonstrate that exogenous shocks to government spending account for less than 10 % of the movements in output over the business cycle in Denmark.","[Ravn, Soren Hove; Spange, Morten] Danmarks Nationalbank, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ravn, Soren Hove] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Ravn, SH (通讯作者)，Danmarks Nationalbank, Copenhagen, Denmark.",shr@nationalbanken.dk; msp@nationalbanken.dk,,"Ravn, Soren Hove/0000-0002-6495-5100",,,,,40,3,4,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Women devote more time to total work than men, and this difference has increased throughout the period studied by 2 hours per week. The relative increase in total work for women compared to men can be explained by a relative increase in market work of 8 hours per week, coupled with a relative decrease in nonmarket work of 6 hours per week, which have led Spanish women to devote, relatively, 2 fewer hours to leisure per week in 2009-10, compared to 2002-03. We propose social norms as a potential explanation of these empirical findings. By uncovering how individuals allocate their time inside and outside the market over a period of time, our results may improve our understanding of the dynamics of economic change and welfare.","[Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain; [Sevilla, Almudena] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London, England",University of Zaragoza; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Gimenez-Nadal, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.",ngimenez@unizar.es,"Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/H-4276-2015","Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-1610-5451",,,,,80,24,24,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By employing a variety of dynamic panel estimators for 54 countries over the period 1995-2010, we show that the primary equity market is not an important determinant of economic growth, although it facilitates the development of the secondary market. This study also confirms the importance of liquidity provided by the secondary market.

If the frequency of bankruptcy is countercyclical, the model predicts that fluctuations are more severe in regions with lower bankruptcy resolution capacity. This is because, in these regions, banks' bad-loan recovery costs are higher (due to the length of the bankruptcy proceedings) and their lending is more sensitive to macroeconomic shocks that impact the likelihood of bankruptcy. Therefore, shocks that increase the frequency of bankruptcy and decrease output at the same time, for example, are amplified due to a lower level of bank lending. I draw opposite conclusions when bankruptcy is procyclical (i.e., economic fluctuations are less severe in regions with low bankruptcy resolution capacity). In the second half of the paper, I find evidence indicating that bankruptcy is countercyclical and that in the U.S. states with lower bankruptcy resolution capacity, economic fluctuations, consistent with the model's predictions, are more severe.

We show that the acquisition of experience in the phase of service-based competition delays the entrant's investment when the prospects for infrastructure investment are good, and accelerates investment otherwise.

Our estimates, based on Engel curves for food consumption, indicate an average per capita income growth of 6.8% per year in 1993-2005. This figure is slightly larger than the 5.9% per year obtained by deflating nominal incomes by the CPI. We attribute this discrepancy to a small bias in the CPI, which is of a similar magnitude to the one often associated with the CPI in the United States. This result supports the view that Chinese price statistics are reliable. Our estimates indicate stronger gains among poorer households, suggesting that urban inflation up to 2005 in China was pro-poor, in the sense that the increase in the cost of living for poorer households was smaller than for the average one.

An analytical framework is formulated that allows for a changing distribution and interaction of agents along the subsystems, each of which is characterized by distinct and intrinsic institutional rules. The framework studies the convergence of agents and institutions toward the dominant subsystem and behavioral type. The focus is on three subsystems - household, firm and state settings - and the intrinsic behavioral types that are associated with these, namely social sharing, profit maximization, and rent acquisition, respectively. A fourth prototype is proposed. In this paper, we deduce and support the positioning of country groups along the prototype systems by empirical evidence and compare these with CSES literature on the varieties of capitalism. We also address the question as to why and how different paths emerged for alternative systems, their comparative economic performances, and their future global outlooks in the context of projected displacements of current leading countries by newcomer leading countries which possess different economic systems and different behavioral profiles.

Based on a canonical framework the analysis revisits both old and new growth literature along three dimensions: (i) What if growth is not exogenous but endogenous and driven by learning by doing? (ii) What if technical progress is embodied rather than disembodied? And (iii) what if the vehicle of learning is gross investment as in the Arrowian tradition rather than net investment as in most recent contributions? From both a theoretical and a quantitative point of view we show that the speed of convergence (both asymptotically and in a finite distance from the steady state) depends strongly and negatively on the importance of learning in the growth engine and on gross investment being the vehicle of learning rather than net investment.

The results demonstrate that the first three of these sources of health care financing are progressive in Australia, while the distribution of direct payments is regressive. Surprisingly, we find that neither the introduction of Medicare in Australia in 1984 nor the Extended Medicare Safety Net in 2004 had significant effects on the progressivity of health care financing in Australia.

The implicit assumption is that prevailing wages are highly influenced by the presence of strong labor unions, hence the attack on prevailing wage laws are part of the broader neoliberal attack on labor unions. Therefore, the empirical analysis in this paper compares construction costs in states that have repealed their prevailing wage laws with states that have not, and demonstrates that there is no empirical evidence supporting the neoliberal claims. The main contribution of the model is to point out the importance of separating public from private construction projects and to differentiate construction projects by type of structure. Without such distinctions, the analysis would conflate the causes of higher construction costs even for similar types of structures. The paper provides an institutional history of the prevailing wage laws in the United States; then uses regression analysis to test for the significance of prevailing wage legislation on construction costs. The empirical investigation provides some simple descriptive statistics from the F. W. Dodge data set; then constructs alternative models to refute the claim that prevailing wage laws cause higher construction costs. The article closes with a discussion of policy implications, summary, and concluding remarks.","[Kaboub, Fadhel] Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA; [Kelsay, Michael] Univ Missouri, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",University System of Ohio; Denison University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Kaboub, F (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,5,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The article argues that this situation can be explained by examining Russian government policy making in the area of housing finance during the post-Soviet period. Following comparative literature, the process of policy development over time is argued to be determined by the interaction of such factors as policy legacies, policy ideas, institutional environment and actors' interests. The article demonstrates how the agency model of housing finance was institutionalised in policy during the 1990s. The initial appeal of this model to the interest of diverse actors at different levels of government is explained. The subsequent evolution of this model towards the formation of a state-led model of housing finance' over the recent decade is traced and its limitations in producing sufficient volumes of mortgage funding are highlighted. The analysis, in addition, demonstrates that alternative policy ideas with the potential to generate extra volumes of mortgage finance are also available in Russia within the relevant policy community. Their adoption in policy is, however, presently blocked by the interests of the top policy officials seeking to increase and maintain the central role of the Russian state in directing the country's economy.","Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Oxford OX2 6JF, England",University of Oxford,"Khmelnitskaya, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Oxford OX2 6JF, England.",marina.khm2012@gmail.com,,"Khmelnitskaya, Marina/0000-0002-6394-5242",,,,,128,16,16,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUN,2014,26,2,,,,,149,175,,10.1080/14631377.2014.904104,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AH8GK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336374800001,0

The results show that during the past two decades spatial price variation has increased steadily, with the most recent period (2005-2009) witnessing a large increase.

Despite the increasing attention, however, we know surprisingly little about how the zoning regulations, which impose a constraint on the supply of land for a particular use, affect retailers in urban areas. This paper examines the effect of the zoning regulations introduced in 1968 in Japan on entry of convenience-store outlets. The act specifies two zoning restrictions for retail outlets. First, the law prohibits building commercial outlets in specified residential and industrial areas (type 1 zoning). Second, the law requires a developer to obtain permission from the local government to develop an outlet in specified areas (type 2 zoning). To account for the spatial dependence in demand, costs, and zoning regulation status across markets, this paper employs an equilibrium model of store-network choice by multistore firms. Using the cross-sectional data of entry and zoning in Okinawa in 2002, the paper finds hypothetically eliminating the type 1 and type 2 regulations would increase the total number of convenience-store outlets by 10-14 and 2-3 %, respectively. Although the magnitude of the increase in store counts and sales are similar across two national chains in Okinawa, the geographical markets in which each firm increases its outlets after the deregulation differ across these two chains.","Johns Hopkins Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Nishida, M (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Carey Business Sch, 100 Int Dr Baltimore, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",nishida@jhu.edu,"Nishida, Mitsukuni/I-4890-2017",,,,,,37,8,11,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

I used household fixed effects models to address the possibility that spousal work status may be correlated with unobserved factors that also affect bargaining power within the home. Consistent with the hypothesis that greater economic resources yield greater bargaining power, I found that the spouse of the head of household is more likely to be involved in making decisions when she has been employed. Similarly, the head of household is less likely to be the sole decision-maker when his spouse works.","Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Antman, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",francisca.antman@colorado.edu,,"ANTMAN, FRANCISCA/0000-0002-4283-149X","NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD066613, R24 HD066613] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,7,31,45,3,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Because of the agency conflict, CEOs may adopt sub-optimal leverage levels that promote their own private benefits at the expense of shareholders. Using Bebchuk et al. (2011) CEO pay slice (CPS) to gauge CEO power, we find that powerful CEOs view leverage negatively and avoid high debt. However, CEOs appear to adopt sub-optimal leverage only when their power is sufficiently consolidated. Relatively weak CEOs do not seem to avoid leverage. The effect of CEO power on capital structure decisions is thus nonmonotonic. Our results imply that agency problems lead to self-serving behaviour only when managers command sufficient influence in the company. Finally, we also show that our conclusion is unlikely confounded by endogeneity.","[Chintrakarn, Pandej] Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Bangkok 10700, Thailand; [Jiraporn, Pornsit; Singh, Manohar] Penn State Univ, Great Valley Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA",Mahidol University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Jiraporn, P (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Great Valley Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA.",pxj11@psu.edu,,,,,,,6,16,19,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In each period, two parties choose electoral platforms to maximize the expected number of elected representatives. The platforms include public expenditure, redistributive transfers, the tax rate, and the level of public debt. Voters cast their vote after seeing the platforms and elect representatives according to a majoritarian winner take all system. The level of debt, by affecting the budget constraint in future periods, creates a strategic linkage between electoral cycles. We characterize the Markov equilibrium of this game when public debt is the state variable and study how Pareto efficiency depends on the electoral rule and the underlying fundamentals of the economy.","Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Battaglini, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",mbattagl@princeton.edu,,"Battaglini, Marco/0000-0001-9690-0721","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1465042] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,54,15,18,1,14,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Similarly to the legal restrictions theory of the demand for money, we assume that Government bonds are subject to a minimum purchase requirement. Differently from this theory, however, we assume that intermediaries, when issuing private notes, cannot commit to always redeem them. First, we study an environment with legal restrictions to intermediation and show that cash and interest bearing bonds both circulate in the economy. Then, we drop the legal restrictions and show that also with active intermediation, under limited commitment, there is an equilibrium with rate of return dominance.

Using results of the robust regression estimator (mimic the instrumental variables model estimation), the statistically significant elasticities of life expectancy are 0.033 (t-ratio=2.45) with respect to per capita real GDP, 0.41 (t-ratio=2.54) with respect to daily visits to the physicians and is -0.026 (t-ratio=-2.26) with respect to the illiteracy rate. That is, income and daily visits to physicians are positively linked to life expectancy while the illiteracy rate stifles life expectancy production.

Our empirical results indicate that the quantile causal relations vary across different quantiles and different periods. Although the causal effects of exchange rate changes on stock returns (or stock returns on exchange rate changes) are heterogeneous across quantiles, the overall evidence suggests that most stock and foreign exchange markets are negatively correlated. The result shows that there are more bidirectional causal relations in accordance with this method than the conventional least square (LS) estimation. The symmetry of these quantile causal effects (the averaging effect') helps to explain why conventional LS method usually obtains an insignificant result of causality.","[Yang, Zheng; Zeng, Yong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Tu, Anthony H.] Minjiang Univ, New Huadu Business Sch, Fuzhou, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Minjiang University,"Tu, AH (通讯作者)，Minjiang Univ, New Huadu Business Sch, Fuzhou, Peoples R China.",atu1106@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,36,35,40,2,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The responsibilities of each sector in terms of its emissions are decomposed into an own component, generated during the activities of the sector, and an indirect component, generated by the induced activities in other sectors. This has important implications for the design of mitigation polices, as the appropriate policy measures are contingent on the nature of the pollution. Technical improvements and best practices are effective only when applied to directly polluting sectors, while demand policies may be more appropriate for indirectly polluting sectors. In addition, we analyze pollution generated during the production of exports. The results show that demand policies are going to be effective in the Building, the Hotel and restaurants, and the Wholesale and retail trade; and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles sectors. These policies complement GHG emissions' mitigation policies in directly polluting sectors (mainly the Cattle farming and the transport-related sectors). Finally, methane and nitrous oxide emissions are mainly the consequence of production for exports, while carbon dioxide emissions are mainly driven by production for domestic consumption.","[Piaggio, Matias; Alcantara, Vicent; Padilla, Emilio] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Bellaterra, Spain; [Piaggio, Matias] Univ Republica, Inst Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay","Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Padilla, E (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Bellaterra, Spain.",emilio.padilla@uab.es,"Padilla Rosa, Emilio/J-8332-2013; Alcántara, Vicent/H-8558-2015; Piaggio, Matias/H-5685-2015","Padilla Rosa, Emilio/0000-0002-9510-8262; Piaggio, Matias/0000-0003-4770-7604; Alcantara, Vicent/0000-0002-5908-1082",,,,,18,14,15,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Thus harvesters in a single fishery, with a single total allowable catch, concurrently must respond strategically to the behavior not only of those being managed as they are but also of those facing incentives of different management. In a novel quasi-continuous time experimental environment with a contemporaneous price externality, we explore the effort timing behavior of harvesters managed under common pool (CP) management with that of subjects managed with individual quotas (IQ). Consistent with Nash equilibrium, CP-managed subjects race-to-fish, exerting high levels of effort to secure landings but selling at correspondingly low prices. IQ-managed subjects in the same fishery hold effort back until the CP fishery closes, and use their quota over the balance of the season at a lower weekly landings level, receiving higher prices. After experiencing both management systems, subjects choose to be in a group with IQ by a 3:1 margin.

In addition to the standard labor productivity shock, we introduce shocks to matching efficiency and job separation. We estimate the multiple-shock model and then simulate its properties. Although it generates significantly more volatility while preserving the Beveridge curve relationship, the multiple-shock model generates counterfactual implications for the cyclicality of job separations. Using a business cycle accounting approach, next we show that the model requires significantly procyclical and volatile matching efficiency and counterfactually procyclical job separations to render the observed data without error. We conjecture that the basic Mortensen-Pissarides model lacks mechanisms to generate sufficiently strong labor market reallocation over the business cycle, and suggest nontrivial labor force participation and job-to-job transitions as promising avenues of research.","[Beauchemin, Kenneth] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Tasci, Murat] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44101 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland,"Tasci, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Res Dept, POB 6387, Cleveland, OH 44101 USA.",Murat.Tasci@clev.frb.org,,"Tasci, Murat/0000-0003-0619-6203",,,,,46,5,6,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

SWB impacts are to be used as an additional indicator in the assessment of innovation, not as something to be maximised.

In this paper, we engage in the issue of countries' roles and positions in international trade using the latest complex network theories. On a mid-level structure, countries are classified into three communities that reflect the structure of the core/periphery using the weighted extremal optimisation algorithm and the coarse graining process. On a micro-level, countries' rankings are provided with the aid of network's node centralities, which presents world trade as a closed, imbalanced, diversified and multi-polar development. Further, we firstly introduce the improved bootstrap percolation to simulate cascading influences following the breaking down of bilateral trade relations. We find that the breakdown of EU's export relations can more easily form a cascading reaction, which would result in a global collapse of world trade. All the results highlight the important positions of the EU, USA and Japan in the international trade system, which plays a positive role in promoting the world economy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Habermalz, S",,,,"Habermalz, Steffen",,,Rational inattention and employer learning,OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LABOR-MARKET; IMPLICIT CONTRACTS; BUSINESS-CYCLE; EDUCATION; OUTCOMES; QUALITY,"Recent research results cast doubt on the validity of the employer learning model by empirically establishing the absence of learning over time among college graduates and by documenting persistent, negative effects of graduating during a recession. This paper extends the employer learning model with the theory of rational inattention in which firms optimally allocate limited attention (i.e., information processing capacity) to learning about the productivities of different workers. I find that firms allocate more attention to workers who have a higher impact on profits (i.e., college graduates) and learn as much as possible in the current period. Taken together these results imply the absence of learning over time for college graduates and indicate that a college graduate that gets (mis)matched to a job with a lower impact on profits will find herself at a persistent disadvantage. The paper therefore resolves the discrepancy between the data and the employer learning model.","[Habermalz, Steffen] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Habermalz, Steffen] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Northwestern University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Habermalz, S (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",s-habermalz@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We extend the DBN scheme to more general cases with unknown Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and state changes. First, we summarize the basic model of DBN where the DAG can be changed and the state transition occurs. In the genetic procedure to estimate DAG changes, we utilize the mutation operation (called Evolutionary Programming: EP) to the DAG to maintain consistency. By defining the possible DAG structure and state changes as particles, we formalize the optimization as the PF procedure. The weight of a particle representing the DAG and state transition is defined as the capability to approximate the probability distribution function obtained from a table of cases. We apply the estimation scheme of the paper to an artificially generated DBN, in which the state of the variables and the changed structure of the DAG are already known, to prove the applicability of the method, and discuss its applicability to debt rating.

One of the ways in which such asset purchases could influence prices and demand is via portfolio balance effects. We develop and calibrate a simple OLG model in which risk-averse households hold money and bonds to insure against risk. Central bank asset purchases have the potential to affect households' choices by changing the composition and return of their asset portfolios. We find that the effect is weak, and that its size depends on how fiscal policy is conducted. That is not to say that the big expansion of central bank balance sheets in recent years has been ineffective. Our finding is rather that the portfolio balance channel evaluated in an environment of normally functioning (though nonetheless incomplete) asset markets is weak. That is not inconsistent with the evidence that large-scale asset purchases by central banks since 2008 have had significant effects, because those purchases were made when financial markets were, to varying extents, dysfunctional. Nonetheless our results are relevant to those purchases because they may be unwound in an environment where financial markets are no longer dysfunctional. (C) 2014 Elsevier By.

The introduction of this incentive helps explain many empirical findings that seemingly contradict a more restrictive and unrealistic version of the deterrence paradigm.

Two main questions are raised: are structural breaks in RER volatility related to changes in exchange rate regimes or financial crises? And do these two events affect the permanent and transitory components of RER volatility? To answer these, we employ two complementary procedures that consist in detecting structural breaks in the RER series and decomposing volatility into its permanent and transitory components. Our results suggest that structural breaks in RER volatility coincidence with financial crises and certain changes in nominal exchange rate regimes. Moreover, our findings confirm that RER volatility does increase with the global financial crises and detect that the more flexible the exchange rate regime, the higher the volatility of the RER using a de facto exchange rate classification.","[Morales-Zumaquero, Amalia] Univ Malaga, Dept Econ Theory & Hist, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, Madrid 28223, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Complutense University of Madrid,"Sosvilla-Rivero, S (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",sosvilla@ccee.ucm.es,"Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/H-4163-2015","Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/0000-0003-2084-0640",,,,,54,4,4,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We apply a stochastic frontier approach to 15 FSU economies over the period 1995-2008 and find that FDI and human capital improve countries' technical efficiency. Furthermore, we show that these factors also have a positive impact on total factor productivity (TFP), which, in turn, improves real GDP growth. Hence, our results suggest that FSU countries should promote public policies that provide incentives to attract foreign investment and enhance domestic education in order to improve their economic growth. Additionally, our empirical evidence argues against the resource curse hypothesis. We also show, by computing efficiency change and technological change indices at the country level, that FSU economies benefit more from exploiting technological progress than from catching up to the best practice frontier.

We single out the huge contribution of job destruction, especially due to the closing of existing firms, to the dramatic decline of total employment and increase of the unemployment rate. We also document the very large increase in the incidence of minimum wage earners and nominal wage freezes. We explore three different channels that may have amplified the employment response to the great recession: the credit channel, the wage rigidity channel, and the labor market segmentation channel. We uncover what we believe is convincing evidence that the severity of credit constraints played a significant role in the current job destruction process. Wage rigidity is seen to be associated with lower net job creation and higher failure rates of firms. Finally, labor market segmentation seems to have favored a stronger job destruction that was facilitated by an increasing number of temporary workers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The aftermath of that episode was one of constitutional change meant to constrain municipal governments from pursuing similar activities in the future. This paper empirically investigates the impact that these restrictions had on municipal borrowing costs, analyzed from bond yield data taken from several major US financial markets, so as to evaluate how binding and significant markets actually perceived these constraints to be. Overall, the results suggest that borrowing costs were lower for municipal governments that faced more stringent creditor guarantees regarding the issuing and repayment of debt, hard budget constraints, and also strict debt limits, while tax limits generally increased borrowing costs. These results not only conform too much of the current literature regarding the political economy of institutional constraints on public finance, they also add several important insights, especially when comparing defaulting to non-defaulting municipalities.","Troy Univ, Manuel H Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, Troy, AL 36082 USA",Troy University System; Troy University,"Dove, JA (通讯作者)，Troy Univ, Manuel H Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, 137N Bibb Graves Hall, Troy, AL 36082 USA.",JADove@troy.edu,,,,,,,59,12,12,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

By reducing its tax on multinational production, a host country can attract additional FDI, some of which is diverted from other host countries. The shift in FDI causes host wages to rise while wages elsewhere fall. The host country with the lower natural attractiveness for FDI (absent intervention) adopts a smaller tax on multinational production. Coordination between hosts eliminates the FDI diversion effect and leads them to impose a harmonized FDI tax that is larger than their non-cooperative tax levels.","[Glass, Amy Jocelyn] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ MS 4228, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Saggi, Kamal] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Vanderbilt University,"Glass, AJ (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ MS 4228, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",aglass@tamu.edu,"Glass, Amy J/C-9856-2009",,,,,,21,3,4,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

It involved the use of semi-open responses of 1763 Swiss individuals to develop indicators for a latent variable representing the perception of comfort of public transportation. The indicators are then incorporated into a discrete choice model of revealed mode choices. Perceptions are assumed to impact choice significantly and this research aims at capturing their complexity using adjectives and integrating them into the hybrid choice modeling framework. We exploit a quantification of the adjectives performed by external evaluators. Given the subjectivity that is involved, we analyze the sensitivity of the results across evaluators who rated the adjectives. We observe that the aggregate indicators of demand, such as market shares, elasticities and values of time, are rather robust across evaluators. This is not the case for the disaggregate indicators that may vary substantially across evaluators.

We find that what is important for efficiency is not the tax rate itself but the tax incidence on tourists. Casino tourism in Macao engages in price discrimination via market segmentation. We prove that, compared with the mass market, the VIP market will grow faster with a greater price rise if a tax hike on the VIP market is not large, but will grow less rapidly with a smaller price increase if the tax hike is very large. An empirical study is carried out using data from Macao, which is typical of segmenting markets for discriminatory pricing. We show that our theory is largely consistent with observed evidence. This paper also provides some policy recommendations useful for Macao. We propose that its casino tax should be kept low at its current rate in the mass market but be raised substantially in the VIP market if its economic growth is to be made less unbalanced and more sustainable.

Decision transparency does not make the public better informed in equilibrium. Even so, it may be socially desirable because it eliminates harmful equilibria. Postdecision transparency has ambiguous effects. It reduces output variance and the distortions stemming from heterogeneous information. In this sense, it can be used as a substitute for monetary policy. However, postdecision transparency generally raises the variance of inflation.

The extensive margin corresponds to the choice of a retirement age. The optimal allocation cannot be implemented in a decentralized economy by a standard non-linear income tax alone. It can however be implemented by a history-dependent social security system which redistributes resources across agents. A calibration of the model to the U.S. economy reveals that the retirement age should optimally be sharply increasing in productivity and that implementing the optimal life-cycle redistribution policy can generate large social welfare gains.

I show that it is optimal for firms to produce low quality products by offshoring production abroad and that high quality products will be produced using native workers, while intermediate quality level products are more likely to be produced at home using foreign born workers.","World Trade Org, Econ Res & Stat Div, F-75007 Paris, France",World Trade Organization,"Orefice, G (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, Econ Res & Stat Div, Rue Lausanne,154,1112 Geneva, F-75007 Paris, France.",gianluca.orefice@cepii.fr,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Therefore, the strategic behavior of insurers facing relatively inelastic demand is critical in explaining poor market performance.

In this paper we examine the role of ethnicity and gender by analyzing differences in the time spent on a range of activities employing the 2000 UK Time Use Survey. Based on the economics of religion and identity economic models, we hypothesize that if ethnic minority women have lower opportunity costs of time and a strong 'ethnic' or 'traditionally female' identity, they will engage more in 'traditional' home activities. Double-hurdle regression results indicate that while the effect for childcare is not significant when estimated for parents only, non-white women spend significantly more time on food management and particularly religious activities than white women, with the greatest effect of the latter being for Pakistani and Bangladeshi women.","[Zaiceva, Anzelika] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Zaiceva, Anzelika] IZA, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] Univ Bonn, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Bonn,"Zaiceva, A (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Via Berengario 51, I-41121 Modena, Italy.",anzelika.zaiceva@unimore.it; Zimmermann@iza.org,"Zaiceva, Anzelika/H-1192-2016","Zaiceva, Anzelika/0000-0001-7542-8974",,,,,46,7,8,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Results from the estimation of a number of empirical models suggest that the impact of FDI is lower in Pacific countries than it is in host countries on average. A 10% increase in the ratio of FDI to host Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is associated with higher growth of about 2% in all countries on average.

Sometimes, however, it might not be in the respondents' best interest to provide truthful information on their firm or market. This will be especially true when other firms can exploit any information they provide. Understanding when, and under what conditions, respondents answer questions truthfully is important to researchers studying these markets and to policymakers using firm surveys to identify ways of improving the business environment. Using data from two countries in South Asia, this paper uses a random response technique to identify respondents that do not answer truthfully. We label these respondents as 'reticent'. We show that respondents become more reticent when their firms face intense price competition.

Our results indicate that even if the convergence is driven by smoothly evolving processes, the dynamic adjustments of key macrovariables can be far from smooth. We also demonstrate that overly optimistic expectations about current or future productivity shifts can generate sizable boom-bust cycles.

IQ affects productivity by changing productivity-agency-cost trade-offs across heterogeneous investment projects. Such institution-induced productivity differences are shown to have effects on the investment and capital flows that are opposite of exogenous productivity differences. This implies that the overall effect of IQ could generate U-shaped responses of the investment and capital flows. Among other things, this means that capital could flow from middle-income countries to both low-income and high-income countries, and that, starting from a very low IQ, a country could experience both a growth and a current account surplus after a successful institutional reform. More generally, the results here provide some cautions when interpreting the empirical evidence on the role of productivity differences and institutional differences on capital flows. It also calls into question the validity of treating the degree of financial frictions as a proxy for the quality of financial institutions, as commonly done in the literature.","Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Matsuyama, K (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",k-matsuyama@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We utilize a unique global dataset that disaggregates workers by occupations to identify impacts across labor categories with different skill sets, complementing the widely used GTAP Data Base in the CGE framework offered by the GTAP model. To study the impacts of China's fast-paced growth, we model the counterfactual, i.e., what if China grew and opened at a more modest rate; we then compare this baseline with China's actual growth. Results indicate that a strong rise in manufacturing exports from China to the US impacts output and employment in the US. The US shifts its production away from light manufacturing sectors to more service-oriented sectors that also tend to engage higher skilled labor. There is a small decrease in the real wages of unskilled labor and a rise in the real wages of skilled labor. Interestingly, not all categories of unskilled labor lose, rather those that are more directly linked with manufacturing sectors are impacted; unskilled 'service and shop workers' and the unskilled 'agricultural workers, machine operators, assemblers, craft workers, and others' observe a small decline in real wages, while the impact on unskilled 'clerks' is insignificant. For all categories of skilled workers, there is an increase in real wages primarily driven by the shift in production to services and high-skilled labor intensive categories, resulting in the rising skill premium. Hence disaggregating the labor data provides greater depth on the understanding of the differential impacts on domestic workers resulting from trade, and thereby guides policy on how these differential impacts can be smoothed through redistribution of benefits. Consistent with other study findings, there is a positive impact on overall growth and welfare in the US, EU and Australasia. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We identify these effects by looking across regulated and nonregulated states within Hospital Referral Regions, which characterize well-defined health care markets and frequently cross state boundaries. We find that CON states use home health less frequently, but system-wide rehospitalization rates, overall Medicare expenditures, and home health practice patterns are similar.

Estimated model parameters describe the states of technology in different countries, barriers to international investment, and trade costs. It is found that the barriers to international trade and investment are highly correlated.

We find that exporters tend to be capital intensive, diversified, and showing high R&D effort. In the analysis by sectors, learning by exporting is the most frequent result.

To this end, the paper looks at two areas of reform in which new Europe has been significantly more neoliberal than old Europe-pension privatization and the flat income tax. Looking at two distinct policies and examining not just their introduction but also their resilience makes the paper's claims more robust and allows for refinement or contradiction of some existing findings in the literature. The paper's conclusion is that a more volatile political system with few veto points and weak interest groups, coupled with a developmental model reliant on foreign direct investment, can account for the difference in policy approach without resorting to cultural or value-based explanations. In addition, the influence of Europeanization and lower state capacity do not appear to be significant explanatory factors.","[Beblavy, Miroslav] Comenius Univ, Dept Publ Policy & Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Beblavy, Miroslav] Ctr European Policy Studies, Brussels, Belgium",Comenius University Bratislava,"Beblavy, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Dept Publ Policy & Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",,"Beblavý, Miroslav/AAM-8109-2020",,,,,,57,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The plan's optimal funding and investment strategies therefore depend on the desired profile of consumption over the lifetime of the member. We investigate these strategies under the assumption that the member is a rational life cycle financial planner and has an Epstein-Zin utility function, which allows a separation between risk aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We also take into account the member's human capital during the accumulation phase of the plan and we allow the annuitisation decision to be endogenously determined during the decumulation phase. We show that the optimal funding strategy involves a contribution rate that is not constant over the life of the plan but is age-dependent and reflects the trade-off between the desire for current versus future consumption, the desire for stable consumption over time, the member's attitude to risk, and changes in the level of human capital over the life cycle. We also show that the optimal investment strategy during the accumulation phase of the plan is 'stochastic lifestyling', with an initial high weight in equity-type investments and a gradual switch into bond-type investments as the retirement date approaches in a way that depends on the realised outcomes for the stochastic processes driving the state variables. The optimal investment strategy during the decumulation phase of the plan is to exchange the bonds held at retirement for life annuities and then to gradually sell the remaining equities and buy more annuities, i.e., a strategy known as 'phased annuitisation'.

We show that, when banks can adjust their capital structures, reductions in real interest rates lead to greater leverage and higher risk for any downward sloping loan demand function. However, if the capital structure is fixed, the effect depends on the degree of leverage: following a decrease in interest rates, well capitalized banks increase risk, while highly levered banks may decrease it if loan demand is linear or concave. Further, the capitalization cutoff depends on the degree of bank competition. This effect therefore should vary across countries and over time. (C) 2013 International Monetary Fund.

Further, it argues that such mixed evidence is a consequence of the exogenous imposition of the threshold that classifies monetary shocks as small or large. To address this issue, I propose an unobserved-components model of output, augmented by a monetary policy variable, which allows the threshold to be endogenously estimated. The results show strong statistical evidence that the effect of monetary policy on output varies disproportionately with the size of the monetary shock once the threshold is estimated. Meanwhile, the estimates of the model are consistent with a key implication of menu-cost models: smaller monetary shocks trigger a larger response on output.","[Donayre, Luiggi] Univ Minnesota, Duluth, MN 55812 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth,"Donayre, L (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 1318 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",adonayre@d.umn.edu,,,,,,,39,6,6,1,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Its popularity is growing not only among companies originating from developed countries, but also among companies from Central and Eastern Europe. However, the attention of researchers and politicians from the latter region is often focused on the realization of particular modules of global value chains, rather than on the optimal integration of geographical and ownership structures of the national enterprises' value chains. At the same time, there seems to be a demand among entrepreneurs (potential decision-makers of the value chain module relocation use) for the more widespread knowledge of the possibilities offered by relocation, the problems and the consequences they bring, together with empirical evidence for them. The following paper focuses on the links between value chain module relocations and the competitive position of a relocating company. While doing so, it applies the perspective of companies located in Poland and operating in the clothing and automotive industries. In the paper, both secondary and primary sources of information were used. The reasoning applied in the study represents an analytical deduction. The research from the cited works was used as the background to prepare and conduct an empirical study. The paper attempts to explain what drives the importance of value chain module relocation for the achieved competitive position, by the use of ordinary least square regression models. The findings of the study indicate that the importance of value chain module relocation for an enterprise's competitive position can be partially explained by the importance of relocation for input competitiveness, the number of benefits resulting from those relocations, the competitive position achieved by the relocating company, its age and engagement in export activity. However, while the first three variables in the sample had a positive relation with the importance of relocation for the achieved competitive position, the remaining two had a negative one.","Poznan Univ Econ, Fac Int Business & Econ, Dept Int Competitiveness, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Dzikowska, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Fac Int Business & Econ, Dept Int Competitiveness, Poznan, Poland.",,,"Dzikowska, Marlena/0000-0002-9642-7345",,,,,106,3,3,1,32,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Considering that there exist important differences between both groups of countries and within each region, we have focus on the study of the characteristics and the analysis of the existing data, in order to propose preliminary conclusions for the debate, as well as elements for continuing the research on social policies in the studied countries. Firstly, we have noted that EU countries with consolidated welfare state policies do not present serious imbalances in public finances, despite their greater level of social spending. Besides, in the case of EU countries with less developed welfare state policies we have not found direct relations between social expenditure and public finance imbalances. Therefore, we propose that the welfare state is neither the determinant aspect of fiscal imbalances in the EU, nor the origin of the current crisis and its social consequences. Secondly, comparing selected countries of the EU and Latin America we have not found common elements concerning the role of social policies, although we have detected important similarities in macroeconomic priorities, as well as in the effects of the adjustment policies implemented years ago in Latin America and nowadays in the EU.

The welfare effects of different policies are calculated by taking into account the transitional dynamics of the economy after the policy reform. Our main findings have policy implications; mainly, subsidies to research are the most welfare-increasing amongst the budget-neutral policies, and the optimal structure of subsidies entails substantially increasing the subsidy to R&D, maintaining a zero subsidy to production, and reducing the subsidy to education, so as to keep the intertemporal government budget balanced.

In 1685, religiously persecuted French Huguenots settled in Brandenburg-Prussia and compensated for population losses due to plagues during the Thirty Years' War. We combine Huguenot immigration lists from 1700 with Prussian firm-level data on the value of inputs and outputs in 1802 in a unique database to analyze the effects of skilled immigration to places with underused economic potential. Exploiting this settlement pattern in an instrumental-variable approach, we find substantial long-term effects of Huguenot settlement on the productivity of textile manufactories.","[Hornung, Erik] Ifo Inst, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Hornung, Erik] Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; Max Planck Society,"Hornung, E (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",erik.hornung@tax.mpg.de,"Hornung, Erik/ABA-1354-2021","Hornung, Erik/0000-0002-2313-7080",,,,,91,118,127,2,62,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

The content of the second hypothesis is an idea that the companies using clusters of technologies can have higher level of efficiency and better ability to response the economic depression than the other ones. The both hypotheses were verified on the base of results of the survey conducted among Czech manufacturing companies and the analysis of their financial reports during the period 2007 to 2011.

Unlike most early warning models that predict failure probabilities, this article describes a framework for predicting a broader notion of bank stress that need not rely on regulatory decisions. As such, this method can be easily applied to large institutions, and avoids the complications associated with modelling a regulatory decision such as failure or a CAMELS downgrade. Using bank reliance on Term Auction Facility funds and the out-of-sample incidence of failures and acquisitions, I demonstrate that the measure of bank stress generated here accords with other notions of bank-level distress. Finally, this method catalogues predictors of distress during the financial crisis. Thus, this article can help assess the validity of several recent regulatory proposals. I find that those banks entering the crisis with more Tier 1 capital, more liquid balance sheets, and relatively stable liabilities subsequently came under less stress. These findings support the Basel III recommended increases in banks' capital adequacy, liquidity and stable funding.","Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Kandrac, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",john.p.kandrac@frb.gov,,,,,,,27,1,4,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Unused committed credit lines capture the decline in banks' risk aversion being associated with a supply shift. As the existence of loan commitments may lead to overlending, we expect that banks with a higher share of unused committed credit lines are more prone to subsequent increase in loan loss reserves. The system and difference GMM estimations as well as pooled OLS and panel fixed effects estimations confirm that an excessive credit supply, reflected in overextension of committed credit lines, predicts increase in bank loan loss reserves two years ahead while controlling for bank asset returns, real growth in loan portfolio, country GDP, inflation and EBRD banking sector reform index. This stresses the importance of credit lines monitoring by regulatory and supervisory authorities for timely recognition of credit overextension episodes.

A firm was defined as distressed if it breached the minimum capital requirements set by law. The results demonstrate that all the investment-related factors matter for financial distress, with timing, intensity, sector, and type of investment all playing a role.

No form of outcome uncertainty (game, play-off, or across seasons) matters for attendance in hockey or baseball regardless of which game uncertainty variable is used. Under the measure of game uncertainty that recommends itself for football, only play-off uncertainty matters for attendance.

The magnitude of this debt-induced distortion varies over the business cycle, rising significantly during recessions. When debt is contracted in nominal terms, this distortion gives rise to a balance sheet channel for monetary policy. In the presence of real and financial shocks, the monetary authority faces a trade-off between inflation and output gap stabilization. The optimal monetary policy rule prescribes that the anticipated component of inflation should be set equal to a target level, while the unanticipated component should rise in response to adverse shocks, smoothing the debt overhang distortion and the output gap.","[Occhino, Filippo] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Res Dept, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA; [Pescatori, Andrea] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland; International Monetary Fund,"Occhino, F (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Res Dept, 1455 East 6th St, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA.",filippo.occhino@clev.frb.org,,,,,,,28,7,8,1,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Also significant is the negative coefficient of government debt in the SEE group results could be interpreted as a 'contagion effect' of the recent global financial crisis that spread beyond national borders.","[Pesa, Anita Radman] Univ Zadar, Dept Econ, Zadar 23000, Croatia; [Festic, Mejra] Bank Slovenia, Ljubljana 1505, Slovenia",University of Zadar,"Pesa, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Zadar, Dept Econ, Splitska 1, Zadar 23000, Croatia.",apesa@unizd.hr,"YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/F-1270-2019; Peša, Anita Radman/G-2626-2013","YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/0000-0001-5240-1023; Peša, Anita Radman/0000-0003-3767-0676",,,,,57,5,6,0,15,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON-RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The benefits of FDI are obvious: it is one of the main sources of external finance, which is especially important for developing economies. It is highly important to attract foreign direct investments for countries with rapidly growing economies. In order to direct foreign investments into the problematic business areas or problematic regions, targeted FDI policy is essential. However, because the countries with growing economies usually seek to attract foreign capital by any means, uncontrolled foreign investment can bring more harm than benefit. The aim of the article is to develop a complex-targeted FDI policy that would bring the greatest benefit to the state. The authors raise the question how to attract targeted FDI inflows. When selecting a method for the formation of FDI policy, another problem arises: the methods based on correlation-regression analysis are frequently applied in the literature. This analysis is helpful in assessing relationships between individual factors; however, it does not allow determining the complex components of FDI policy. The authors assume that FDI policy is characterized by multi-criteria, therefore one of the qualitative multi-criteria methods - ANP - has been chosen for an empirical study because of the fact that, using this method, not only the effect of a criterion or sub-criterion but also the relationships between the sub-criterion are assessed. The criteria system is based on SWOT analysis. Four alternatives to current FDI policy are suggested which account for the threats and weaknesses that are characteristic of the Estonian economy. The following alternatives for FDI policy are proposed: FDI policy focused on the service sectors; FDI policy focused on the export promotion; FDI policy focused on R&D, and FDI policy focused on the manufacturing sectors. According to the research, FDI policy in Estonia is mostly influenced by its strengths and opportunities. The main weakness is the research and innovation system that may prevent from the attraction of FDI in knowledge-intensive sectors. A repeated synthesis highlighted Estonia's potential to successfully attract FDI and to exploit them in the knowledge-intensive services, high-tech and medium-tech sectors. The research results indicate that attracting FDI to the service sector would be the most effective policy that would bring a long-term positive impact on the country's economic development.","[Simelyte, Agne; Antanaviciene, Jurate] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Simelyte, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",agne.simelyte@vgtu.lt; jurate.antanaviciene@vgtu.lt,"Simelyte, Agne/GQQ-0172-2022; Simelyte, Agne/J-2520-2016","Simelyte, Agne/0000-0002-9475-9645",,,,,42,5,5,0,32,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Through relevant analyses, I arrive at three key conclusions. First, while small countries with little rent in domestic markets set their effective tax rates at almost zero, large countries maintain much higher effective tax rates. Second, for countries that have generous capital allowance systems, tax holidays may lead to a rise in not only the effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs), but also the effective average tax rates (EATRs). Third, some Asian countries may engage in tax competition, at least over the EATR, for a limited period of time. However, while some countries have raised their effective tax rates in recent years, others have continued with tax reductions. These results indicate that the recent tax interactions among Asian countries differ from the simpler interactions seen among the European countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, little attention has been paid in business to proper utilization of tacit knowledge, a subset of intangible assets, because no specialized attempt has been made to quantify it. Once a value has been assigned to an asset, it is more easily utilized in the proper way. This paper analyzes the use of tacit knowledge in pharmaceutical industry, presents a graphical model of tacit knowledge, and finally presents and uses a simplified mathematical model that could be useful in quantifying tacit knowledge. The mathematical model was applied in the empirical study of multi-billion dollar acquisition of Genentech by Hoffman La-Roche AG. The model gives a good estimation of the value of the tacit knowledge contained in the firm, which is an important contribution to the field of finance. The quantification of tacit knowledge could be extremely beneficial for managers of pharmaceutical firms who have extremely high levels of tacit knowledge in the form of knowledge workers. By quantifying tacit knowledge, managers can get a better understanding of the real value of their firm or of the value of a firm that may be a target for acquisition.","[Thoene, Michael] Univ Warmia & Mazury, PL-10561 Olsztyn, Poland; [Buszko, Andrzej] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury; University of Warmia & Mazury,"Thoene, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Zolnierska 14C St, PL-10561 Olsztyn, Poland.",michael.thoene@uwm.edu.pl; buszko@uwm.edu.pl,,,,,,,37,3,5,3,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

There is no consensus in the literature regarding this important question. In this study, we use a political-economy model of endogenous protection to show that if individual preferences exhibit loss aversion or if the government's objective is characterized by diminishing marginal political support, a free-trade area can lead member countries to increase their external tariffs and thus act as a stumbling block to unilateral liberalization. We also argue that the stumbling block result is more likely to arise under loss aversion than under diminishing marginal political support and confirm this using a simulation. Finally, we show that the stumbling block effect can also take place under multilateral liberalization. Our results highlight a new type of mechanism through which preferential trade agreements may affect external tariffs.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Lima 32, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Tovar, P (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1801, Lima 32, Peru.",ptovar@pucp.pe,"Tovar, Patricia/AAH-9020-2019","Tovar, Patricia/0000-0002-2014-0081",,,,,36,2,2,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The main contribution of this paper is to provide a new transmission mechanism for public debt through the countercyclical markup movements induced by external deep habits. We analyze the effects of a positive shock to public debt. We show that the interest rate rises, entailing higher markups and a fall in employment and consumption. Interestingly, even without capital, a crowding-out effect of government debt is obtained in the long run.

We assume that the agent has imperfect private information regarding his/her productivity, which the signaling action provides additional verifiable information about. A higher-type agent benefits more from providing such objective, albeit imprecise, proof for the market, but may also gain less from learning about his/her productivity. When the latter effect dominates the former for the very high types, the equilibrium exhibits countersignaling: very high and low types pool on refraining from signaling, and only the medium types signal. Under certain conditions, the countersignaling equilibrium is the unique pure-strategy perfect sequential equilibrium. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores the scope for fruitful integration of work on this topic into innovation studies more generally. It examines four different theoretical perspectives used in studies of service innovation: assimilation, demarcation, inversion and integration/synthesis. Each of these throws light on particular issues confronting public services innovation, and we see that innovation in this sphere is highly diverse and that it does often display special features. But we conclude that these features do not constitute a strong case for studying public service innovation as if it were something sui generis, let alone continuing to neglect it. Instead, the case is made for developing more integrative views of innovation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Japan's capital-gross domestic product ratio continued to increase after 1991, and this increase in the capital-gross domestic product ratio must have contributed to the decline in the rate of return on capital in Japan by decreasing the marginal productivity of capital. On the other hand, Japan's accumulation of information and communication technology capital and intangible investment was very slow. Compared with large firms, which enjoyed an acceleration in the total factor productivity growth in recent years, Japanese small- and medium-sized enterprises were left behind in information and communication technology capital and intangible investment, and their productivity growth has been very low.

We make a methodological contribution to the literature by solving the continuous-time contracting problem using a discrete-time approximation approach. We obtain a simple characterization of optimal renegotiation-proof contracts in terms of the solution to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE). We then exploit the properties of the ODE to derive a number of novel implications for the dynamics of long-term contracts that alter the intuition gleaned from the previous literature. Optimism has a first-order impact on incentives, investment and output that could reconcile the private equity puzzle. Consistent with empirical evidence, the interaction between asymmetric beliefs, risk-sharing and adverse selection costs could cause the time-paths of the agent's incentive intensities to be increasing or decreasing. Our results also suggest that the incorporation of imperfect public information and asymmetric beliefs could potentially reconcile empirical evidence of an ambiguous relation between risk and incentives, and a non-monotonic relation between firm value and incentives. Permanent and transitory components of risk have differing effects on incentives, which suggest that empirical investigations of the link between risk and incentives should appropriately account for different components of risk.

Second, she can additionally use a capacity market with payments contingent on private generation investment. For the first case, we find that even absent asymmetric information, a lack of regulatory commitment can cause inefficiently high or inefficiently low investments. For the second case, we develop a standard handicap auction which implements the first best under asymmetric information if there are no shadow costs of public funds.

This question is nontrivial for many industrial countries because, with the rapid growth of emerging countries, human capital is considered one of the most important sources of comparative advantage. Theoretically, however, the answer is not necessarily obvious because of changing comparative advantage. This paper attempts to answer this question by extending the analysis of Wolff (2003) and by focusing on one of the largest OECD countries, Japan, for the period 1980-2005. The results indicate that the answer to the above question may well be no. Although Japan is still a net exporter of skill-intensive goods, the skill gap of net exports has been narrowing since the mid-1990s, mainly as a result of the changes in the composition of trade. This implies that some OECD countries, including Japan, may have been losing their comparative advantage in skill-intensive goods in recent years. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate how licensing schemes (fixed fee or per-unit royalty) and the number of licenses sold (exclusive licensing or complete technology diffusion) affect price agreements and delays in reaching an agreement. We show that, under complete information, the patent holder prefers to license by means of up-front fixed fees whatever the degree of product differentiation, the innovation size and the level of bargaining power. Once there is private information about the relative bargaining power of the parties, the patent holder may prefer licensing by means of per-unit royalties even if market competition is strong. Moreover, the delay in reaching an agreement is greater whenever the patent holder chooses to negotiate up-front fixed fees instead of per-unit royalties.","[Mauleon, Ana; Vannetelbosch, Vincent] St Louis Univ, CEREC, Brussels, Belgium; [Mauleon, Ana; Vannetelbosch, Vincent] Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [Vergari, Cecilia] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ Sci, Bologna, Italy",University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles; University of Bologna,"Mauleon, A (通讯作者)，St Louis Univ, CEREC, Brussels, Belgium.",vincent.vannetelbosch@uclouvain.be,"Mauleon, Ana/H-1970-2015","VERGARI, CECILIA/0000-0003-4585-984X",,,,,34,7,7,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

The paper distinguishes between horizontalists, verticalists, and structuralists. It argues Moore's horizontalist representation of endogenous money was an over-simplification that discarded important enduring insights from monetary theory. The structuralist approach to endogenous money retains the basic insight that the money supply is credit-driven but remedies horizontalism's omissions and over-simplifications. Twenty-five years later, horizontalism has largely morphed into structuralism. The theoretical challenge going forward is to develop the role of money and finance in a Keynesian theory of output determination. As regards monetary policy, the challenge is how to conduct policy in a world of endogenous money. These concerns emanate naturally from a structuralist perspective on endogenous money.",,,,,,,,,,,37,19,23,0,9,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

This study provides a comprehensive investigation of the contributions of ICT to Singapore's economic growth during the 1990-2008 period. It documents three key findings. First, there is a strong positive association between the intensity of ICT use and value-added and labor productivity growth at the sector level. Second, ICT investment contributed approximately 1 percentage point to Singapore's GDP during 1990-2008, and its role in driving economic growth has become increasingly important over time. Third, the contribution of the ICT manufacturing sector to Singapore's growth was notable, but it was on the decline and faced difficult restructuring challenges.

We test the predictions using panel data on Chinese provinces during the reform and opening-up period. The Chinese experience is appealing because of the symbiotic financial deregulation and inflow of FDI. We find robust evidence that there is a significant interaction effect between FDI and the level of financial deregulation that promotes economic growth.

However, the spillover effects are unidirectional from oil to some sectors for returns, but bidirectional for volatility patterns with more apparent links from sectors to oil. The optimal weights and hedge ratios for oil/stock portfolio holdings are sensitive to the sectors considered, and allow a better understanding of the links between sectors and oil for investors who seek for investment opportunities and want to diversify their portfolios.

Mezzetti circumvents this problem by designing a two stage mechanism where the decision of allocation and payment are split over the two stages. This mechanism is elegant, however it has a major weakness. In the second stage, agents are weakly indifferent about reporting their valuations truthfully: an agent's payment is independent of her reported valuation and truth-telling for this stage is by assumption. We propose a modified mechanism which makes truthful reporting in the second stage a strict equilibrium. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In fact, decision makers are reluctant to act if there is no strong and accurate data and results to support the policy position they may take. The purpose of this study is to propose an alternative method to measure energy use efficiency (Energy Efficiency) in the port industry, and more precisely, in the container terminals sector. The approach is based on the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) introduced by Farrell in 1957. The objective is to reduce the amount of energy inputs, at first step, the input variables are converted into their energy equivalents, then the energy efficiency is measured as an overall indicator using a constant return to scale model, and decomposed into technical and scale efficiencies in order to diagnose the origin of inefficiency in energy use for each unit in the selected sample. This allows us to provide more accurate results, and gives a more solid basis to decision makers in order to establish their policies, at the final step, a DEA Super Efficiency analysis is performed to achieve a full ranking in terms of energy efficiency for the units under study.","[Sabri, Hermouche Toufik; Ga-hyunKim] PuKyong Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Int Commerce & Logist, Pusan, South Korea; [Ha, Myung-shin] PuKyong Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Int Commerce, Pusan, South Korea",Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University,"Ha, MS (通讯作者)，PuKyong Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Int Commerce, Pusan, South Korea.",hermouche_toufik@yahoo.fr; msha@pknu.ac.kr; oneina10000@hotmail.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,12,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Using the alternative dynamic panel data models and panel causality tests, it examines the validity of the neo-liberal argument that strictness of employment protection hurts labour through increased long-term and youth unemployment rates. Although it finds little empirical basis for this orthodox standpoint, the article observes that the unemployment problem dampens aggregate production, which in turn aggravates the long-term unemployment problem. The policy prescription suggested is employment generation by other means than neo-liberal hire and fire labour regulations.","[Sarkar, Prabirjit] Jadavpur Univ, Kolkata 32, India",Jadavpur University,"Sarkar, P (通讯作者)，Jadavpur Univ, Dept Econ, Kolkata 32, India.",prabirjit@gmail.com,,"Sarkar, Prabirjit/0000-0001-8043-499X",,,,,41,8,9,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Thirteen copula models with different types of dependence structures and time-varying dependence parameters are considered. We find that in general the MALM copula fits our sample data best based on AIC criterion. We find that lower and upper tail dependences are both positive indicating that crude oil and refined product markets tend to move together. Using the asymmetric copulas, we find asymmetry in tail dependence between crude oil and heating oil returns and that between crude oil and jet fuel returns. Interestingly, upper tail dependence is significantly greater than the lower tail dependence for the pre-crisis period, while the result is reversed for the post-crisis period. Finally, although our data prefers the nonexchangeable MALM copula, the asymmetry in the propagation of crisis (bubble) between crude oil and refined product returns is very weak.

By employing a plant-level data set that covers the universe of Mexican export processing plants (maquiladoras) from 1990 to 2006 and relying on an instrumental variable strategy that exploits exogenous intensification of Chinese imports in the world in conjunction with the WTO accession of China, the empirical analysis reveals a substantial effect of intensified Chinese competition on maquiladoras. In particular, competition from China has a negative and significant impact on employment and plant growth, both through the intensive and the extensive margin. As the negative impact is stronger on the most unskilled labor intensive sectors, it triggers significant sectoral reallocation. Suggestive evidence on industrial upgrading among maquiladoras in response to competition with China is also provided. Overall the results provide additional insight into the way low-wage competition shapes the evolution of industries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Consumer preferences are distributed along the style and type of news coverage where the distance costs may vary across dimensions. For integrated provision of online and offline platforms we show that entering the online market reduces average profits and may even constitute a prisoner's dilemma. Specialized provision may yield polarization in the style and type dimensions. This is in contrast to the maximum-minimum differentiation result previously established in the literature on multidimensional horizontal competition. We show that maximal differentiation in both dimensions occurs due to the discrete nature of the type dimension and asymmetric advertising markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We examine two sets of causal relationship between (1) capital stock, energy consumption and real GDP and (2) capital stock, energy R&D and real GDP using panel-based fully-modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) for 20 OECD countries over the period of 1980-2010. Since different countries may respond differently to energy consumption and energy R&D, the sample is further divided into two groups: OECD countries with oil reserves and without oil reserves. Similarly, energy consumption and energy R&D are also further divided into fossil fuel energy and renewable energy. The results show that the role of energy R&D should not be overlooked and fossil fuel R&D is found to drive economic growth more than fossil fuel consumption. The findings also show that while capital stock and fossil fuels are the key factors driving economic growth, renewable energy promotes real output, specifically in the countries without oil reserves.

These shocks are identified with the sign restriction methodology recently developed in the Structural VAR literature. We find that a monetary policy shock is not effective to modify economic activity, while an expansionary fiscal shock, financed with domestic debt, can increase household consumption and construction services, without affecting the aggregate production of the economy.

We compare data where preferences are elicited using (1) purely hypothetical gambles, (2) played-out, but unpaid gambles and (3) played-out gambles with truth-revealing monetary payments. We ask whether a model of stable preferences with random errors (e.g., expected utility with errors) can explain the data. The model is strongly rejected in data collected using purely hypothetical gambles. However, simply playing-out the gambles, even in the absence of payments, shifts the data pattern so that noisy maximization is no longer rejected. Inducing risk preferences using a lottery procedure, using monetary incentives or both shift the data pattern further so that noisy maximization achieves the best possible fit to the aggregate data. No model could fit the data better. We argue that play-out shifts the response pattern by inducing value because subjects can use outcomes to keep score.

Method of moments estimation shows how measurement error in consumption eliminates excessive skewness and smoothness of consumption growth.

Our explanation is based on the notion of 'returns to specialization'. Under the model's assumptions, PMC and economic growth are ambiguously correlated when returns to specialization are decreasing, whereas population growth and productivity growth are ambiguously correlated when returns to specialization are increasing.

We find that the half-lives of sectoral real exchange rates are remarkably distorted when the grouped half-life is measured inappropriately and the cross-sectional dependence and potential trend breaks are ignored. After taking account of these problems, the bias-corrected half-life for all goods is as low as 3.00 years, close to the bottom of the consensus view of 3 to 5 years. Moreover, the bias-corrected half-life of mean reversion is 2.40 years for traded goods, and only approximately half that for non-traded goods. Finally, our findings also support the view that small-sample bias correction is critical for half-life estimations.","[Chang, Ming-Jen] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Lin, Chang-Ching] Acad Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Yin, Shou-Yung] Natl Cent Univ, Chungli, Taiwan",University of Nottingham; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Central University,"Lin, CC (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",lincc@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,"Lin, Chang-Ching/0000-0001-8471-7583",,,,,35,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Using establishment-level employment and payroll data for Texas at the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)-6 level, we analyse the differences in average wages between firms generating electricity from fossil fuels and those generating electricity from wind power. We compare relative average wages before and after the rapid expansion of wind power development that followed the ex ante renewal of the PTC in 2006. Our main finding using both the parametric and nonparametric estimation techniques proposed by Racine and Li (2004), is that average payrolls for wind power generators increased relative to fossil fuel-based electricity generators after 2006.","[De Silva, Dakshina G.; Schiller, Anita R.] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [McComb, Robert P.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Lancaster University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Schiller, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",a.schiller@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Schiller, Anita Ryu/0000-0002-7771-2589; De Silva, Dakshina/0000-0001-8820-1955",,,,,26,1,1,0,104,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our dynamic investment model extends the tradition of the knowledge capital model of Griliches (1979) that has remained a cornerstone of the productivity literature. Rather than constructing a stock of knowledge capital from a firm's observed R&D expenditures, we consider productivity to be unobservable to the econometrician. Our approach accounts for uncertainty, non-linearity, and heterogeneity across firms in the link between R&D and productivity. We also derive a novel estimator for production functions in this setting. Using an unbalanced panel of more than 1800 Spanish manufacturing firms in nine industries during the 1990s, we provide evidence of non-linearities as well as economically significant uncertainties in the R&D process. R&D expenditures play a key role in determining the differences in productivity across firms and the evolution of firm-level productivity over time.","[Doraszelski, Ulrich] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jaumandreu, Jordi] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Boston University,"Doraszelski, U (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0924282] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,64,241,270,4,110,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

These policies aim to prevent future financial crises through the adoption of far-reaching reforms that involve changing the institutional framework for monetary and financial policies, using models and indicators to monitor the buildup of systemic risks, and utilizing instruments designed to prevent the materialization of those risks. The objective of this paper is to examine the institutional aspects of macroprudential policy in Latin America. In particular, it assesses the strengths and weaknesses of existing institutional models and offers suggestions to improve the effectiveness of those models. The analysis focuses on the two main institutional arrangements that exist in this region, the Pacific model which includes countries like Chile, Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica and Mexico, and the Atlantic model, which includes countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.","[Jacome, Luis I.] Georgetown Univ, Fondo Monetario Int, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Jacome, Luis I.] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Estudios Amer Latina, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University; Georgetown University,"Jácome, LI (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Fondo Monetario Int, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",LJacome@imf.org,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,7,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Greater financial development leads to an increase in energy consumption, regardless of whether financial development stems from banking sector or stock market. By contrast, we find for the new members that the impact of financial development on energy consumption depends on how financial development is measured.

Most of the models require the incumbent to completely prevent a more efficient potential entrant from entering, and assume that the entrant is exogenously prevented from making exclusive offers. Such models cannot explain how exclusive arrangements can lower welfare when they do not completely foreclose a small rival, when the rival can make exclusive offers, nor can they identify rudimentary relationships such as how a dominant supplier's size affects his incentive and ability to exclude and lower welfare. I extend the intuition of the literature by formally modeling competition between a dominant input supplier and a small rival selling to competing downstream firms. I show that a dominant supplier can pay downstream firms for exclusivity, allowing him to maintain supra-competitive input prices, even when a small rival that is more efficient at serving some portion of the market can make exclusive offers. I also show that exclusives need not completely exclude the small rival to cause competitive harm. The payment the dominant supplier makes for exclusivity equals the incremental rents that the rival's input could generate if exactly one downstream firm sold final goods using it.

It is built on the last Spanish Symmetric Input-Output Table (IOT, 2005). It has been tested for the period 2005-2008 and used for forecasting energy demand for the years 2009-2012 under different economic scenarios. The model shares some traits of the computable and applied general equilibrium models where quantity and price systems are interwoven. The differences lie in the theories explaining output and prices. Our quantity system is based on Keynes' principle of effective demand (broad energy multipliers are derived). The price system is based on the classical (Sraffian) theory of prices of production, akin to post-Keynesian full-cost prices. The general price system can be manipulated to account for the specificities of energy prices. Historical trends of energy coefficients are computed by extrapolation of past IOTs and calibration.","[Dejuan, Oscar; Antonio Lopez, Luis; Angeles Tobarra, Maria; Zafrilla, Jorge] UCLM, Dept Econ & Finance, Albacete, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Dejuán, O (通讯作者)，UCLM, Dept Econ & Finance, Albacete, Spain.",oscar.dejuan@uclm.es,"Tobarra-Gomez, Maria-Angeles/F-7301-2015; Zafrilla, Jorge/I-2803-2015; Dejuan, Oscar/E-9203-2017; Lopez, Luis Antonio/S-4183-2018","Tobarra-Gomez, Maria-Angeles/0000-0002-4913-2544; Zafrilla, Jorge/0000-0001-7953-9006; Dejuan, Oscar/0000-0002-9319-6609; Lopez, Luis Antonio/0000-0002-9733-7106",,,,,37,7,7,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.
