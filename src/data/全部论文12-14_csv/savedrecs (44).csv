Our analysis suggests that introducing the VAT, despite the fact that it is a relatively efficient tax in comparison to the income tax alternative, has little impact on government growth due to two factors: (1) the substitution of the VAT for other tax sources, and (2) the low price elasticity of demand for public goods. In contrast, demand-side changes may have a more significant impact on government size, thus reversing the direction of causality. Using a panel of 29 OECD countries over a period of 38 years (1970-2007), we confirm these hypotheses. Our findings imply that the demand for government spending markedly influences the tax structure of society. Using a broad concept of tax costs, introduction of a VAT increases social welfare because it reduces compliance costs, rent-seeking, and efficiency costs. Accordingly, increased usage of VATs during the 20th century should be understood as a collective choice to accommodate growing demands for public expenditure.","[Lee, Dongwon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Dongil] Minist Strategy & Finance, Sejong, South Korea; [Borcherding, Thomas E.] Claremont Grad Univ, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA USA",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School,"Lee, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",danlee200@skku.edu; aleman@mosf.go.kr; Thomas.borcherding@cgu.edu,,"Lee, Dongwon/0000-0003-4568-5982",National Research Foundation Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2012S1A5A8021942],National Research Foundation Korea Grant - Korean Government,"We wish to thank three anonymous referees, editors George Zodrow and William Gentry, Jinyong Hahn of U.C.L.A. and Byeong-in Im of Chungbuk National Univer sity, seminar participants at the Seoul National University, and participants at the meetings of the Korean Association of Public Finance for valuable comments and gestions.

The remaining contributions to price discovery are shared between the CFD 200 and SPDR ETF markets; between the two markets, the contribution of the CFD 200 market is substantially greater than that of the SPDR ETF market. This study also provides evidence that innovation correlations between the CFD 200 and SPI 200 markets are considerably larger than those between index-linked instruments reported in prior studies.

We assume unsubsidized world food prices in order to derive the cost of poverty deepening and poverty expansion. We also estimate the degree to which inequality increases if no measures are put in place to offset rising food prices. Both measures are vulnerability indicators useful for social policy planning. Our results show that low-income countries experience dramatic increases in absolute poverty as a result of doubling food prices. Middle-income countries experience the greatest decrease in absolute income, which contributes most to an increase in world income inequality. The paper estimates that the global dollar value of the absolute poverty gap ($1.25/day) has the potential to increase by 400%, with poverty deepening accounting for two thirds of the increase.","[Marktanner, Marcus] Kennesaw State Univ, Coles Coll Business, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA; Kennesaw State Univ, PhD Program Int Conflict Management, Kennesaw, GA USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University; University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Marktanner, M (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Coles Coll Business, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",,,,,,,,16,4,4,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

This idea is tested using state-level ideology data derived from the voting behavior of state congressional representatives. Empirically the interaction of ideology and mean income is a key determinant of state government size. At 1960s levels of income the impact of ideology is negligible. At 1997 levels of income a one standard-deviation move towards the left of the ideology spectrum increases state government size by about half a standard deviation. Estimated income elasticities differentiated by state and time are found to be increasing with ideology and diminishing with income, as predicted by the theory.","[Pickering, Andrew C.] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Rockey, James] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of York - UK; University of Leicester,"Rockey, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",andrew.pickering@york.ac.uk; james.rockey@le.ac.uk,,"Pickering, Andrew/0000-0003-1545-2192",,,,,54,22,24,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2013,156.0,3-4,,,,,443,465,,10.1007/s11127-012-0026-x,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,184NK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321897600004,0

I consider cases where the natural processes have been replaced and also the probably more common and usually less invasive cases where they have been enhanced by technological interventions. Supporting services are probably least amenable to technology, with the major exception of nutrient cycling, which has been extensively replaced by the use of chemical fertilizers. Final services offer more examples of actual or potential replacement, including the highly controversial example of geoengineering for climate regulation. Finally, there are numerous examples of replacement technologies for environmental goods, especially in the case of energy (fossil and many renewable fuels), fibres (artificial fibres) and biochemicals (industrial pharmaceuticals). The full economic costs of replacement technologies have rarely been explored, and in some cases it appears that the replacement is more expensive than the natural service. Enhancement technologies, in contrast, supplement the output of ecosystem services and are probably in most cases more benign. The doubts about true costs and the fact that many supporting and final services seem either irreplaceable or only replaceable at huge cost adds to the need to protect them.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Fitter, AH (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ahf1@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,22,24,0,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We argue that this aid was effectively fungible and states used it to offset declines in revenue. This enables us to use exogenous variation in states' budget positions to identify the Act's employment effects. We also exploit exogenous variation across states in ARRA highway funding. According to our benchmark estimates, average state and local government employment, during the 24 months following the program's inception, was between 156,000 and 563,000 persons greater as a result of ARRA spending (90% confidence interval). The corresponding estimate for the private sector ranges from a loss of 182,000 to a gain of 1.1 million jobs. Our point estimate for the implied cost of creating a job lasting one year is $202,000, which is substantially larger than the corresponding estimate from the President's Council of Economic Advisors.

We propose a theoretical framework that links CEO risk tolerance to the expected net synergies. We empirically show that CEOs of firms located in countries with lower levels of risk tolerance, measured by Hofstede's (1980; 2001) uncertainty avoidance score, require higher premiums on takeovers, and show that uncertainty avoidance plays a greater role in relatively large takeovers. Additional testing reveals that CEOs from high uncertainty avoiding nations engage less in cross-border/cross-industry takeovers, suggesting that uncertainty avoidance captures more the CEO's risk perception than his/her risk aversion.

In each of those countries the policy maker levies pollution taxes on the polluting firms and a tariff on imports in order to correct that distortion. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the effect of a reduction in the tariff on equilibrium pollution taxes and welfare. The existing literature has investigated this problem for trade between two identical countries. This paper analyzes the problem in the more realistic context where countries are not necessarily identical and trade can be multilateral. It becomes possible to show what bias is introduced when those two realities are neglected.

The definition is operationalized into a robust measure by aggregating 14 items from the World Values Surveys. Religiosity falls by 50 % when countries pass through the transition from being underdeveloped to becoming a developed one. A formal test shows that long-run causality is predominantly from income to religiosity. The transition slope is robust to measurement error and composition of the country sample. The empirical macro relation is rationalized by some micro theory: Most components of the demand for religious goods are reduced by rising income. Churches supply religious goods directly and through three additional channels: education, healthcare, and social security. Rising income caused churches to lose control over the additional channels.","[Gundlach, Erich] Univ Hamburg, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Gundlach, Erich] GIGA Inst Asian Studies, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Paldam, Martin] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",University of Hamburg; German Institute of Global & Area Studies; Aarhus University,"Paldam, M (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Bartholins Alle 10, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",mpaldam@econ.au.dk; gundlach@giga-hamburg.de,,,,,,,26,18,19,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2013,156.0,1-2,,,,,105,123,,10.1007/s11127-012-9934-z,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,164WW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320443600008,0

The extensive academic literature on job accessibility measurements suggests that there are many ways to represent, define, quantify, and interpret job accessibility. These measurements have been increasingly employed for exploring urban issues at varied spatial scales. However, in practice, an appropriate balance is required between the complexity of representation, accuracy of measurement and ease of interpretation and use. With this in mind, this paper demonstrates a modified measurement to represent, measure, and interpret, job accessibility and job opportunity, by incorporating the effects of competition, distance decay and job diversity. The measurement integrates a probabilistic methodology with a spatial interaction model. The methodology is implemented in a GIS environment and illustrated using the Amsterdam region of the Netherlands as a case study. We argue that this measurement can improve the application of job accessibility measurement for planning support practices. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A particular emphasis is placed on isolating the role of commuting times in impeding this outcome. The city of Vienna, Austria, is used as a case study. A statistical model considers elements of an individual's neighborhood including population density and urban centrality, as well as personal characteristics and transportation-related factors. Results indicate that those with one-way commutes of 30 min or longer result in lower levels of social satisfaction. Residing in a neighborhood with high transit level of service and car ownership positively impact social satisfaction. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

I find that the effect of immigration on total public spending depends both on the degree of income inequality and on preferences for the different types of spending.

We estimate a bi-variable EGARCH model using a dynamic conditional correlation model developed by Engle (2002) in order to analyze how asymmetric monetary policy influences interest rate pass-through. We test the risks to the dynamic condition and changes in the correlation coefficient. The main empirical results are as follows. First, the long-run interest rate pass-through mechanism is unstable in the US. Second, expected monetary policy impulses are greater than the unexpected ones in the short-run. Finally, according to the one-step and N-step forecast tests, the illiquidity shocks caused by financial crises demonstrate a significant change in retail interest rate risks, but not in correlations between retail interest rates. We conclude that when the interest rate pass-through mechanism is unstable, banks may stop helping each other and will not provide loans to firms and consumers, thereby exhausting the capital of all economic systems. The characteristics of illiquidity enter into the interest rate pass-through mechanism; therefore, the relationship between illiquidity and the interest rate pass-through needs to be investigated.","Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan",,"Wang, KM (通讯作者)，Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan.",wkminn@ocu.edu.tw,"Wang, Kuan Min/H-5247-2019","Wang, Kuan Min/0000-0002-0237-0596",,,,,43,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The data used in calculations is gathered from the field surveys conducted in urban areas of those cities in 2011. The main motivation for conducting the study was the consideration that the most commonly implemented monetary approach to measure poverty lacks particularly social and physical aspects of poverty. Examining the outcomes obtained in Mersin and Erzurum, it was found that the poverty rate in Mersin is higher than that is in Erzurum. The striking finding is that number of the persons suffering from deprivation within the empowerment dimension in two cities was quite different, particularly with respect to participation of women to the decision making process in the household. This might be an indication of relatively more freedom experienced by household members in Mersin.","[Zanbak, Mehmet; Cagatay, Selim] Akdeniz Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Iktisat Bolumu, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Zanbak, M (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Iktisat Bolumu, B Blok Kampus, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",mehmetzanbak@akdeniz.edu.tr; selimcagatay@yahoo.com,"Zanbak, Mehmet/C-3112-2016",,,,,,26,4,4,1,13,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

As a first step, this paper links family business research to the theoretical notion that family involvement has an effect on the factors of production from a productivity standpoint. Second, by using a Cobb-Douglas framework, we provide empirical evidence that family labour and capital indeed yield diverse output contributions compared with their non-family counterparts. In particular, family labour output contributions are significantly higher, and family capital output contributions significantly lower. Interestingly, differences in total factor productivity between family and non-family firms disappear when we allow for heterogeneous output contributions of family production inputs. These findings imply that the assumption of homogeneous labour and capital between family and non-family firms is inappropriate when estimating the production function.","[Barbera, Francesco] Bond Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business Technol & Sustainable Dev, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Moores, Ken] Bond Univ, Australian Ctr Family Business, Sch Business Technol & Sustainable Dev, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Bond University; Bond University,"Barbera, F (通讯作者)，Bond Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business Technol & Sustainable Dev, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",fbarbera@bond.edu.au; kmoores@bond.edu.au,"Placido, Ivonete Telles Medei/P-6018-2016","Barbera, Francesco/0000-0002-1935-3151",,,,,81,46,52,0,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We use CEOs' resumes of Standard and Poor's 1,500 firms from 1993 through 2007 to construct an index of general skills that are transferable across firms and industries. We estimate an annual pay premium for generalist CEOs (those with an index value above the median) of 19% relative to specialist CEOs, which represents nearly a million dollars per year. This relation is robust to the inclusion of firm- and CEO-level controls, including fixed effects. CEO pay increases the most when firms externally hire a new CEO and switch from a specialist to a generalist CEO. Furthermore, the pay premium is higher when CEOs are hired to perform complex tasks such as restructurings and acquisitions. Our findings provide direct evidence of the increased importance of general managerial skills over firm-specific human capital in the market for CEOs in the last decades. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The main purpose of the paper is to point out that hub-and-spoke networks can be set up in different ways and to explore the different impacts that these can have on their economic feasibility. A cost model is presented which compares the cost performance of present services to the hinterland with that of the different settings in the hub-and-spoke network, i.e. type and size of vessel, the barge-handling process in the hub, the location of the hub and the handling process at the seaport terminal. The results show that hub-and-spoke has the potential to deliver a better cost performance provided the handling costs in the hub can be kept within limits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The phenomenon of offshoring is modeled by incorporating the reduced use of domestic labor in the production function. This is regarded as a characteristic feature of offshoring in the literature. We find that increased offshoring leads to an increase in the relative price of the nontraded good. Given that this relative price can be interpreted as the real exchange rate, increased offshoring leads to exchange rate appreciation. This suggests that offshoring actually makes the goods and services from the emerging economies more competitive in the world market, and thus can be a contributory factor in the positive trade balance experienced by many emerging economies since early 2000s.","Univ Memphis, Dept Econ, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",University of Memphis,"Kumar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Memphis, Dept Econ, 427 Fogelman Coll Adm Bldg, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",skumar7@memphis.edu,,,,,,,26,0,1,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We employ a recently developed monetary-policy rule estimation methodology which allows for time-varying response coefficients and corrects for endogeneity. This flexible framework applied to the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Sweden, together with a new financial stress dataset developed by the International Monetary Fund, not only allows testing of whether central banks responded to financial stress, but also detects the periods and types of stress that were the most worrying for monetary authorities and quantifies the intensity of the policy response. Our findings suggest that central banks often change policy rates, mainly decreasing them in the face of high financial stress. However, the size of the policy response varies substantially over time as well as across countries, with the 2008-2009 financial crisis being the period of the most severe and generalized response. With regard to the specific components of financial stress, most central banks seemed to respond to stock-market stress and bank stress, while exchange-rate stress is found to drive the reaction of central banks only in more open economies.

Further, we observe that our portfolio strategy achieves higher Sharpe ratios than 1/N, amounting to an average Sharpe ratio increase of 32.5% across our six empirical datasets. We find that our constrained minimum-variance strategy is the only strategy that achieves the goal of improving the Sharpe ratio of 1/N consistently and significantly.

Greater understanding of the influences that lead people to use the car, particularly for shorter journeys, may help to achieve this. This paper examines the predictors of car use compared with the bicycle to explore how it may be possible to persuade more people to use the bicycle instead of the car. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the socio-demographic, transport and health-related correlates of mode choice for work, shopping and leisure trips in Cambridge, a city with high levels of cycling by UK standards. The key findings are that commuting distance and free workplace parking were strongly associated with use of the car for work trips, and car availability and lower levels of education were associated with car use for leisure, shopping and short-distanced commuting trips. The case of Cambridge shows that more policies could be adopted, particularly a reduction in free car parking, to increase cycling and reduce the use of the car, especially over short distances.

We assessed value separation, embedding or warm glow and 'ethical' motivations. We exemplify our application by valuing an inconspicuous moss endemic to Chile's sub-Antarctic region. The choice experiment was administered to a sample of local residents of Navarino Island (southern Chile). The design isolates the existence value by requiring respondents to make simultaneous tradeoffs between moss existence value, five other biodiversity-related values and income changes. Insensitivity to scope was addressed by using degrees of extinction risks. We predominantly use a willingness-to-accept design of the payment vehicle to avoid protest responses. A meaningful marginal value for the existence of an endemic species for Navarino island residents was documented. The design, based on varying degrees of extinction risk, avoided a strong effect of warm glow. No protest responses motivated by ethical concerns were encountered.","[Cerda, Claudia] Univ Chile, Fac Forestry & Conservat Nat, Dept Forest Resource Management, La Pintana 11315, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Barkmann, Jan; Marggraf, Rainer] Univ Gottingen, Inst Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Universidad de Chile; University of Gottingen,"Cerda, C (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Fac Forestry & Conservat Nat, Dept Forest Resource Management, La Pintana 11315, Santiago De Chi, Chile.",clcerdaj@uchile.cl; jbarkma@gwdg.de; rmarggr@gwdg.de,"Barkmann, Jan/B-7928-2014; Cerda, Claudia/D-5315-2014","Cerda, Claudia/0000-0001-9478-9978",,,,,27,11,11,3,29,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

However, even if changes in ownership structures are difficult due to path dependence, anecdotal evidence indicates that some sort of transition towards the US style corporate ownership could be occurring in civil-law countries. The aim of this article is to test the so-called law and finance view, which predicts that this convergence will only happen if the appropriate regulatory framework is in place. We test this prediction using longitudinal data from Italian listed companies, assessing the effects of recent legal reforms. Our results show that an increase in the protection of investors' rights is associated with a lower use of control enhancing mechanisms and a lower separation of control and cash flow rights, while it is less evident if it is associated with a more dispersed ownership.

The history of economic thought leaves no doubt as to the fact that many of the notions of fiscal psychology as we know it today were present in the past. There are even cases, though these are not frequent, of economists and social scientists of the past who understood certain psychological aspects of the taxpayer which went out of fashion and of which contemporary fiscal psychology is not aware. Such is the fate of Amilcare Puviani (1854-1907), a marginalist in the tradition of Vilfredo Pareto and an advocate of the study of Italian Public Finance which was in vogue at the end of the 1800s and the early years of the 1900s. We have conducted a number of experiments to verify certain of Puviani's theories regarding the behaviour of the taxpayer, all of which tested positively. Of particular interest is his concept that a minor tax levied contemporaneously with a heavier tax is better tolerated than if it is levied alone. Another related concept, not yet widely known to contemporary fiscal psychology, is of undoubted interest: a tax when levied under favourable circumstances is more tolerable. Finally, we verified Puviani's hypothesis that a tax is easier to accept if split into a number of instalments of nominal amounts, and also (but this is applicable only to a certain category of tax payer) that an indirect tax is better supported if it is not specified in the price of the product or service being taxed.

The Role of Official Intervention, 1981) seems confusing. Vitale ( Journal of International Economics, 49, 1999, 245267) resolves this puzzle by employing an asymmetric information framework and an assumption of a fundamental-inconsistent target for the exchange rate. Ferre and Manzano ( International Journal of Finance and Economics, 14, 2009, 378393) follow Vitale's microstructure framework and argue that the central banks' profitability motivation offers a rationale for their secret intervention even under a target consistent with the fundamentals. However, that the authority uses its superior information to obtain speculative profits through secret intervention in the market is not a typical goal for central banks. To theoretically explain the opaqueness in non-profitmaking central banks' exchange rate policies, we employ a model of a central bank's optimization by considering that no bank really knows the exact fundamental rate and they take into account the possible bad consequences of announcing the intervention. We also show that, in passing the bank's private information to market participants, a bank's announcement of the intervention size is equivalent to revealing its target rate.

We find that the nominal wages of employees were rigid, but their real wages may have declined due to the pension reform. In addition, we find an interesting dichotomy in the incidences of pension reform. In localities with high agglomeration levels, firms' profits declined because the pension burden could not be fully transferred to employees. In less agglomerated jurisdictions, firms responded positively to pension reform, possibly because local governments over-subsidized the pension costs as a way to attract investment.

Voracity effects occur when competition for increased spending proves more effective as national income increases. Public choice theory can be applied to describe the distribution of fiscal power across different tiers of government to shed insight into competition for intergovernmental transfers. Politicians have electoral incentives to press for intergovernmental transfers but they also have electoral incentives to signal their ability to manage the economy. With this mix of incentives, the prediction is that intergovernmental transfers will be procyclical and that sub-central government spending will be more procyclical than central government spending. Public choice analysis of pressure for increased public spending predicts a specific pattern of cyclical government spending. This pattern can be observed when analyzing government expenditures in 20 OECD countries between 1995 and 2006.","[Abbott, Andrew] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Jones, Philip] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Hull; University of Bath,"Jones, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Business, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",a.abbott@hull.ac.uk; p.r.jones@bath.ac.uk,,"Abbott, Andrew/0000-0001-9320-1685",,,,,44,17,19,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2013,154.0,3-4,,,,,243,258,,10.1007/s11127-011-9816-9,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,084II,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314531800005,0

Such a form of intervention can increase efficiency in the private market, and our design of disaster insurance suggests a prominent role of catastrophe reinsurance. The model predicts buyers will increase their demand in the private market, and the seller will lower prices to such an extent that their revenues decrease upon introduction of disaster insurance. We test two predictions in the context of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). It is already known that the introduction of TRIA led to negative abnormal returns in the insurance industry. In addition, we show this negative effect is stronger for larger and for low-risk-averse firmstwo results that are consistent with our model. The seller's risk aversion plays an important role in quantifying such feedback effects, and we point toward possible distortions in which a firm may even be overhedged upon introduction of disaster insurance.","[Boulatov, Alex] Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Dieckmann, Stephan] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); University of Pennsylvania,"Boulatov, A (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",aboulatov@hse.ru; sdieckma@wharton.upenn.edu,"Boulatov, Alexei/A-7096-2014",,,,,,17,6,7,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

People of different language origins form separate urban labor submarkets and can switch between submarkets. Two types of wage differentials emerge, namely the Within-Labor-Market Wage Gap and the Within-Language-Group Wage Gap. The average wage in each market and a worker's choice of the labor market depend on the population sizes of the relevant groups. These implications are tested using the 2001 Census of Canada Public Use Micro-data. A unique feature of these data is the reported work language, which helps me to identify labor market segments.

This bias occurs primarily through differential spending on sons and daughters in the primary and middle school age groups, but through the decision to enroll sons and not daughters in the secondary school age group. Bias is substantially greater in rural than urban areas. An important mechanism through which households spend less on girls is by sending sons to private schools and daughters to the fee-free government schools. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, tax compliance depends on the factors perceived trust in the authorities and perceived power of the authorities, but trust on the one hand fosters voluntary compliance whereas power on the other hand leads to enforced compliance. The present study tested these main assumptions of the slippery slope framework in four European countries differing in terms of cultural and economic settings (Austria, Hungary, Romania and Russia) by presenting participants with different scenarios of trust and power. As predicted, the highest level of intended tax compliance and the lowest level of tax evasion were found in conditions of high trust and high power. In addition, participants in conditions of high trust indicate more voluntary compliance just as participants in conditions of high power indicate higher enforced compliance.

At the stock level, a portfolio of stocks with smart investor clientele outperforms the dumb clientele portfolio by 3.50% annually. These findings suggest that behavioral and information-based explanations for portfolio distortions apply to distinct subsets of investors.","[Korniotis, George M.; Kumar, Alok] Univ Miami, Sch Business Adm, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University of Miami,"Korniotis, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Sch Business Adm, POB 248027, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",gkorniotis@miami.edu; akumar@miami.edu,"KUMAR, ALOK/HTT-4735-2023","Kumar, Alok/0000-0002-7350-1397",,,,,68,48,52,2,36,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Building subsamples of more-developed emerging markets vs. frontier markets, addressing (non) common lender relationships and analyzing cross border lending flows during different time periods, our analysis additionally reveals that both the determinants' explanatory power and their direction of impact notably vary with respective subsamples.

Supply-side competition refers to competition among inventors and demand-side competition refers to competition among producers in the downstream product market. The main results are as follows. Competing inventors have greater average expected returns to invention when the downstream market is competitive than when the downstream product market is monopolistic, so downstream competition increases the incentive to invent. A multi-project monopoly inventor has greater incremental expected returns to invention when the downstream market is competitive than when it is monopolistic, so downstream competition again increases the incentive to invent. On the supply side, competition among inventors generates more R&D projects than a multi-project monopoly inventor when the demand side of the market for inventions is competitive. The reason for this result is that when the downstream market is competitive, the average expected returns to invention with competition among inventors are greater than the incremental expected returns to invention with a multi-project monopoly inventor.","Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Spulber, DF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",jems@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Spulber, Daniel F/A-8722-2009","Spulber, Daniel F/0000-0003-2697-6522",,,,,83,9,9,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Applying a principal-agent analysis, we find this common practice suboptimal and firms are better off linking incentive pay to average stock prices. Among other benefits, averaging reduces volatility by about 42%, making the incentive pay more attractive to risk-averse executives. Holding the cost of the option grant to the firm constant, Asian stock options are more cost effective than traditional stock options and provide stronger incentives to increase stock price. More importantly, the improvement is achieved with little impact on the option grant's risk incentives (after adjusting for option cost). Finally, averaging also improves the value and incentive effects of indexed stock options. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To our knowledge, we provide the first empirical study of the extent to which this regulation has resulted in a strengthening of small and medium sized enterprises' (to be denoted SMEs hereafter) solvency, which was one of its most prominent objectives. Results from logit regressions reveal that the probability of adopting the NID is higher for lowly leveraged SMEs, SMEs without experience with the tax-exempt investment reserve and SMEs with a sound knowledge of the notional interest deduction regulation. Results on the impact of the NID on the capital structure of SMEs based on panel and first differences regressions reveal that this measure did not result in a significant change of SMEs' leverage. In view of the discussion regarding the optimal tax and legislative framework that governments should put in place (Poutziouris et al., J Small Bus Enterp Dev 6(1):7-25, 1999), these results cast doubt on the risk capital allowance, as it stands now, being the right government instrument to contribute-at least in the short term-to creating a pro-enterprising tax and legislative climate for SMEs.

The study adopted a survey approach for which data were collected from University students of AIS from selected universities through questionnaire. Secondly, secondary data were collected in form of detailed AIS curricula from websites of universities and analyzed using tables. The study observed that MS syllabi were not compliant with IFAC's education guideline for ten (10) topics that were Technological Infrastructure Intensive but were compliant for the remaining four (4) topics that required minimal or no technological infrastructure, it was also found out that the knowledge level reported by students matched the level of coverage for twelve (12) of fourteen (14) topics except for the last two where knowledge level was adequate despite inadequate coverage in the syllabus. It was also found that AIS syllabi in South Western Nigeria were consistent in topic integration for all universities tested. The major implication of the study is that AIS knowledge in Nigeria is only compliant with IFAC guideline for topics that are more theoretical than practical. The study therefore recommends that universities serve as facilitators of AIS education especially for topics which require heavy Technological Infrastructure and also partner with foreign universities and organizations in order to ensure compliance with accepted standard for AIS education.","[Ajayi, A.

These methods, developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are used to scale remediation needed to compensate for past, current and future damages related to an incident. Two approaches to resource compensation can be distinguished: the service-service approach (or resource-resource approach) and the valuation scaling approaches (value-to-value and value-to-cost approaches).

This article examines differences in the magnitude of housing price decreases across metropolitan areas. A small number of housing market variables observable before the fall are capable of explaining over 70% of the considerable variation in price declines. An additional non-parametric analysis suggests that exceeding particular thresholds for some of the key predictors is associated with much larger price drops. These findings are consistent with historical price patterns, which raises questions about the validity of mortgage pricing policy and risk diversification norms in the United States. The analysis points to a set of stylized facts concerning the housing price bubble that need to be explained and suggests fruitful hypotheses for understanding the dramatic housing price declines.

It derives analytical characterizations of optimal Ramsey and flexible price allocations under both perfect risk sharing and financial autarky. This allows the paper to identify the crucial roles of production structure, price elasticities, and capital mobility in monetary policy evaluation. In a calibrated example, impulse-responses under PPI targeting track flexible price allocations closely, but can diverge greatly from Ramsey allocations when risk sharing is perfect and intratemporal elasticities are high. In those cases, policy rules that stabilize real exchange rates more than PPI targeting can deliver higher welfare. But PPI targeting is a clear winner under portfolio autarky.

Typically, researchers cite Rosen's (1974) seminal work, which allows one to interpret functions of the hedonic regression coefficients as the marginal willingness to pay for the environmental good. A key assumption needed for the Rosen result to hold is market equilibrium. Recent years have witnessed extreme circumstances-such as wild swings in housing prices, high levels of mortgage default, and, most significantly, high levels of foreclosure-in which this assumption is unlikely to hold. In this article, we address the issue of how we interpret the coefficient estimates for environmental goods in hedonic property value models when markets are dominated by foreclosures. We then focus on housing market conditions when interpreting the hedonic literature on (airport) noise, Superfund sites, air quality, and flood risk.","[Coulson, N.

Many countries already adopted the national standards and frameworks have proven to have a success report in increased awareness. The common elements of the standards provide the methodology to be integrated systematically.

Moreover, the industrial and technological developments devoted to the practice of advanced industrial and manufacturing processes are of essence as a part of the strategy to be considered in the proposed systematic modeling approach. In this respect, the measurement technology meets the essential information and know-how to provide solutions to the operations of industrial manufacturing industry development.

As an integral part of the corporate strategy CSR complies with the business plan and key competences of the company. It forms a part of everyday business activities of the company, and is an integral part of a corporate culture. Apart from arousing positive social changes it involves philanthropy, sponsoring, infrastructure development and environmental protection. As defined by McElhanney K. A. (2011) CSR in general means making business to create a better world. In the Czech Republic the CSR is usually compared to business ethics. It relates to the sustainable development, company conduct and also to stakeholders, i.e. all entities within and outside the company with the interests in the company (owners, investors, employees, customers, vendors, etc.). Trouble-free performance of the company or institution is closely linked with regulatory compliance (which is obligatory and enforceable), from the long-term view also with the application of ethical principles, most frequently in the form of ethical code of conduct or corporate culture standards (that are important but not enforceable). Socially responsible company has to adopt an ethical approach to all parties incl. customers - end consumers with specific demands, such as a group of consumers that suffer from celiac disease or diabetes mellitus. As a part of Trade Science and IGA PEF CZU in Prague there has been being realized a research (2012-2013) focused on the availability of food for the specific group of consumers with gluten intolerance - with celiac disease, gluten allergy or Duhring herpetiformis dermatitis. For these consumers the gluten free diet is the precondition to reduce or prevent the manifestation of the disease. In order to be able to adhere to the gluten free diet the patients have to buy appropriate food the availability, width and depths of range, merchandising (presentation) and prices of which were mapped and monitored during the first phase of the research in selected operating units of the retail trade within the Czech Republic Three types of self-service operational units were chosen (convenience store - superette, supermarket and hypermarket), one operational unit with service (variety store or specialized store) and one internet shop selling gluten-free food. During the second phase of the research an inquiry via questionnaires was performed focused on preferences of consumers purchasing gluten-free food. The results of the research and consumer gluten-free food buying preferences incl. responsible (or irresponsible) approach of the selected operational units are presented and analyzed in the following paper. The findings referred to in the paper are from IGA FEM CULS project No. 20121027 (11210/1312/3106) The Research of the Retail Trade Offer of Food Suitable for Customers with Gluten Intolerance.","[Hes, Ales; Regnerova, Marta] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Trade & Finance, FEM, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hes, A (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Trade & Finance, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",hes@pef.czu.cz; regnerova@pef.czu.cz,"Regnerová, Marta/F-3375-2017; Hes, Ales/H-3788-2018","Hes, Ales/0000-0002-9051-443X",,,,,10,1,1,0,7,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,349,360,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300032,0

Therefore, this article describes and evaluates the possibilities of solving the debt crisis of the state by empirical analysis of some relationships between debt of the state and other economic indicators. The debt level, often scaled by the country's GDP, is one of the most commonly used indicators of a country's ability to face its obligations. But in fact there is no certain percentage of GDP where the debt crisis occurs. This is the reason why is in the article also created and suggested a method how the debt crisis of the state can be measured. It concerns the hypothesis that the excessive interest payments which are connected with excessive debt means that the money are not returned to the economic cycle mechanism of the country which can be the cause of the crisis.

One of the main changes applied to this indicator was the substitution of the arithmetic mean for a geometric mean in the construction of the index, thus assuming different substitution grades between dimensions. In order to determine the impact of the aggregation formula in the distribution of the HDI, we propose the use of multidimensional generalized entropy measures, which allow us to study the evolution of well-being inequality based on different aggregation schemes. The results obtained suggest a reduction in global inequality in human development over the period 1980-2011. However different inequality patterns are observed depending on the substitutability parameter, thus pointing out the crucial role played by the aggregation formula of composite indices of well-being in the evolution of global inequality.

High transaction costs may cause the farmers to lose their share in the highly profitable fair-trade market for raisins and consequently decrease the contribution of raisin production to the livelihoods of the farmers from Eksteenskuil. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether a higher degree of vertical coordination will be more appropriate to economise the transaction costs faced by the farmers in order to allow them to continue benefitting from the fair-trade initiative. Based on the application of the frameworks of Mahoney (1992) and Peterson et al. (2001), a higher degree of vertical coordination in the form of a relation-based strategic alliance will be more appropriate than specifications contracting. The complementarity between the farmers and their buyer, created by the fair-trade initiative, contribute to the viability of a more vertically coordinated strategy. Similar incentives for private sector-buyers to procure from emerging farmers may create a similar degree of complementarity, and hence an incentive for such buyers to enter into vertically coordinated relationships with emerging farmers.","[Jordaan, Henry; Grove, Bennie] Univ Orange Free State, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Jordaan, H (通讯作者)，Univ Orange Free State, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",jordaanh@ufs.ac.za; groveb@ufs.ac.za,"Jordaan, Henry/AAF-8722-2019; Grove, Bennie/E-5395-2015","Grove, Bennie/0000-0002-5325-2637; Jordaan, Henry/0000-0003-4845-1727",Water Research Commission (WRC) [K5/1779/12/1],Water Research Commission (WRC),"The paper is based on research that was conducted as part of a solicited research project, Assessment of the Contribution of Water Use to Value Chains in Agriculture (K5/1779/12/1), that was initiated, managed and funded by the Water Research Commission (WRC).

For this, we apply an event study using OLS and GARCH market models. The results of our study show that, strategic alliances in Korea produce significant positive abnormal returns before and at the announcement date, indicating an increase in firm value. This firm value augmented by alliance announcements does not have any relationship with firms' growth but has an inverse relationship with firms' sizes. Interestingly, non-technological marketing alliances contribute to increasing firm value more than technological alliances do, regardless of partner firms' nationality. This evidence is contrasted to the cases of firms in advanced countries. Particularly, Korean firms' marketing alliances with firms in advanced G7 countries contribute to largely increasing the firm value of the former. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The study examines trading behaviors of large and small traders separated by their transaction costs and shows the lifting of price restrictions strengthens the correlation between extreme order imbalance and extreme mispricing. Also, autocorrelations of the underpricing and overpricing persist longer, in particular for big traders, and so do those of buy-side and sell-side order imbalances. However, the outcomes for the post-lifting market efficiency are mixed.

An improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is proposed to solve this problem to minimize makespan. An improved chromosome encoding schema is proposed for IGA, in which sequence-based representation segment is added to the general operation-based representation segment. The corresponding crossover and mutation operators are designed to ensure the generation of feasible offspring chromosome for SFJSP. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm is tested by computational experiments on four practical instances of a bearing manufacturing corporation.","[Ma Xueli; Liu Xiaobing] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-063-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,716,723,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BGR19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323863400128,0

The central message is that states played, and continue to play, a fundamental role in the establishment of Europe's national railway networks, regardless of EU guidelines. As a consequence, every national transport system has exhibited a series of Specific characteristics throughout its history and these must be identified if we are to improve the construction and coordination of current railway networks and their services. Railways played an important role in the process of state formation from the mid 19th century onwards, and have continued to do so in the recent introduction of the High-Speed Train. Adopting a historical perspective is therefore essential for a good understanding of the railway network in Europe, particularly as 70% of the lines currently in service had already been established by 1900. In other words, leaving aside the most recent improvements to railway infrastructure and rolling stock, we are essentially still using a 19th century network. It is therefore relevant to examine the factors that influenced this network's initial expansion and to study its subsequent transformations through a series of homogeneous data. This research is based on a new GIS dataset that includes all of the railway lines in service at 10-year intervals from 1840 to 2010. These were related to state borders - which changed quite dramatically in the 20th century - for every reference year. The combination of these two layers of information allowed us to monitor national policies and to identify periods of rail construction and closure by area. The specific path followed by each European country was then quantified. This revealed how, historically speaking, the national level has always been the one at which the most important decisions relating to railway. networks have been taken, and this remains the case today.

The aim of this paper is to suggest some arrangements to knowledge sharing support in the setting of SMEs. The paper is based on an analysis of secondary information sources and partly on the conclusions gained from interviews with managers and discussion groups. The findings suggest that the facilitation of knowledge sharing is closely related to the activities of human resource management, with work organisation, the provision of materially-technical conditions, staff development and the motivation of employees. The motivation for knowledge sharing is necessary to take into account because individuals often decide about sharing or not sharing their knowledge on the basis of a comparison between the benefits of knowledge sharing and the costs of not sharing. The choice of suitable managers can also have an important role in knowledge sharing support.","[Matoskova, Jana; Mikeska, Martin; Polcakova, Martina; Sobotkova, Eliska; Jurasek, Martin; Banarova, Michaela] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,matoskova@fame.utb.cz; mikeska@fame.utb.cz; polcakova@fame.utb.cz; sobotkova@fame.utb.cz; jurasek@fame.utb.cz; banarova@fame.utb.cz,"Matošková, Jana/H-6537-2012","Matošková, Jana/0000-0001-6944-2892",,,,,51,2,2,0,16,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,856,869,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500082,0

Here we illustrate that the comment comes from a misreading of basic details in the original discussion and in its construction and presentation of an alternative model of the KRV conditions the comment reiterates our original argument that general models and theorems are likely to fail to explain local intricacies primarily because they are not founded on local historical institutions.","[Antrobus, G.

Although CSR is mostly publicized in connection with large companies, it has been in recent years - as shown by many studies - on the rise even among small and medium-sized companies. Yet to SMEs is paid far less attention than to large and multinational companies. The role of SMEs is very often overlooked. This is mainly due to a comparison with large companies that have higher profits and provide more jobs. However, if we look at SMEs as whole, not just individual companies, they start to gain importance dramatically.

The case of this university is interesting because, on the one hand, like some other top Saudi universities, it is striving to produce highly competent graduates in all fields including management. Oh the other hand, it is located in Dhahran near Dammam, being the third big economic and industrial city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The author administered a selected online self-test to his students during a number of years. The pool consisted of more than 3000 undergraduate and graduate male students. The study found that the number of students with a good level of readiness is important. This means that potentialities are real and should be given serious consideration. One major limit of this study is its focus on Saudi male students at Kfupm, thus not covering female and the rest of Saudi students, kingdom wise. Our attempt of using printed online self-test with hard copies of questionnaire appears the first of its kind. One advantage is allowing students to get extended feedback from the instructor about the topic. Another advantage is that other questions directly and indirectly related to the issue are also discussed. Among such questions, there is the need to consider the local environment and culture. The main implication is a call for concerned authorities and decision makers to foster entrepreneurship as a strategic option for development via education.","[Oukil, M-Said] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia",King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals,,oukil@kfupm.edu.sa,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,15,26,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200003,0

We find strong evidence that the average of all forecasters' beliefs influences an individual's own forecast. This effect is stronger for young and less experienced forecasters as well as forecasters whose pay depends more on performance relative to a benchmark.

The merging of two household panels allows, for the first time, the joint analysis of the markets for fresh and frozen vegetables. The underlying panel is a unique dataset covering grocery purchases of more than 13 000 households over a period of five years. The objective of the analysis is to derive demand elasticity estimates as well as to compare the results obtained from various estimation methods. Based on a two-step LA/AIDS, additional models which take account of potential price and expenditure endogeneity as well as of seasonal, regional and quality differences, are estimated. Especially product groups with a relatively small budget share exhibit significant differences in elasticity estimates. Therefore, it seems particularly important to consider the above mentioned issues when analyzing the demand for organic food. Results suggest an inelastic demand for conventional and a somewhat elastic demand for organic vegetables. If expenditures increase, consumers raise their demand for organic vegetables at a higher rate than their demand for conventional vegetables. Cross-price elasticities appear to be asymmetric. Demand for organic vegetables is more sensitive to price changes of conventional vegetables than vice versa.","[Schroeck, Rebecca] Univ Giessen, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Schröck, R (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",rebecca.schroeck@ernaehrung.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,21,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The aim is to analyze the relationship between agricultural sector and its performance on the one hand, and the amount and structure of investment (gross capital stock) coming into agriculture on the other hand. The authors analyze the period before the global economic crisis. The results from the analysis show that the agricultural sector in the last two decades has changed dramatically its structure and its position in the national economy for the new EU Member States. In the period before the global economic crisis, in each of the analyzed country the size of its agricultural sector shrank, and also performance of this sector was decreased. Despite the significant reduction of the agricultural sector in many of the analyzed countries, it can be argued that each country has managed to streamline the agricultural sector, particularly in terms of its performance. The agricultural sector analyzed countries became more efficient and increased its competitiveness. The size and performance of the agricultural sector of these countries is closely associated with investments flowing into the sector. Structure and production performance of the agricultural sector is closely linked with the available investments (gross value of capital stock). With regard to the main objective of this paper, it can be argues that the most sensitive segments of the agricultural sector in the context of investments are livestock production and land (investment into land).

Specifically, however, the study seeks to establish the relationship between message development and political party efficiency. In pursuit of this objective, the survey method of research was employed to collect data from 278 staff and supporters of ten political parties in the six geo-political zones of Nigeria. The data were analysed with some descriptive statistics, such as frequencies, tables, percentages etc. Also, some hypotheses were formulated and tested with regression and Pearson's product movement correlation. The fmdings revealed among other things that, effective communication among a political party's hierarchies is a desideratum for success at the polls. Besides, organisational communication was found to influence and motivate the behavioural performance of party staff and supporters. It is therefore, recommended that political parties should strengthen their internal communication channels in order to achieve electoral success.","[Worlu, Rowland E.

Such substitutions introduce estimation risk, which adds to traditional financial risk. I develop a new framework to provide a feasible optimal investment rule that accounts for estimation risk. In borrowing from practitioners, I evaluate funds' allocations through their probability of defeating a chosen benchmark. More precisely, the P-value investment rule maximizes the p-value of a one-sided test, ensuring that the portfolio performance is above the given threshold. When the portfolio performance is measured by the Markowitz mean-variance criterion and when the estimation risk of the variance is ignored, the optimal investment rule is known in closed form. The P-value investment rule is a two-fund rule when the benchmark is fixed and a three-fund rule when the benchmark is estimated. In addition, ten investment strategies are compared on simulated and empirical data.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Antoine, B (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",bertille_antoine@sfu.ca,"Antoine, Bertille/AGV-6595-2022",,,,,,26,6,6,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

The literature on this topic has evolved substantially over the years, following the waxing and waning of conceptual frameworks and the changing characteristics of the financial system. In this paper, taking as a starting point a brief overview of the extant work on the interaction between capital regulation, the business cycle and the transmission mechanism, we offer some broader reflections on the characteristics of the transmission mechanism in light of the evolution of the financial system. We argue that insufficient attention has so far been paid to the link between monetary policy and the perception and pricing of risk by economic agents-what might be termed the risk-taking channel of monetary policy. We develop the concept, compare it with current views of the transmission mechanism, explore its mutually reinforcing link with liquidity and analyse its interaction with monetary policy reaction functions. We argue that changes in the financial system and prudential regulation may have increased the importance of the risk-taking channel and that prevailing macroeconomic paradigms and associated models are not well suited to capturing it, thereby also reducing their effectiveness as guides to monetary policy.

The evidence is not consistent with the argument that bondholders benefit from board classification because they are concerned about hostile takeovers. Instead, the results suggest that the lessened concern for takeovers associated with a classified board structure reduces managerial risk-taking, and increases managerial incentive for financial disclosure, with both effects inuring to bondholders' benefit. Consistent with prior literature, classified boards on average are associated with a lower firm performance. However, under the circumstances that the agency conflict between shareholders and bondholders is severe, the performance effect of classified boards appears benign. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our investigation is motivated by a number of empirical as well as theoretical considerations. Empirically. Menkhoff et al. (2012) find that foreign exchange volatility is a pervasive factor across a variety of test assets. Theoretically, Shapiro (1974), Dumas (1978), and Levi (1990) imply that foreign exchange volatility can influence firms' cash flow volatility therefore the discount rate. In terms of empirical implementation, we employ the cross-sectional regression methodology of Fama and MacBeth (1973) as well as the time-series regression approach of Fama and French (1996). For robustness, we also use the mimicking portfolio approach of Fama and French (1993). We find that foreign exchange volatility has no power to explain either the time-series or the cross-section of stock returns, which calls for more research on foreign exchange risk. Bartov et al. (1996) and Adrian and Rosenberg (2008) suggest an alternative and maybe promising direction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A natural experiment which changed regional family policy dramatically was Saarland's reaccession to Germany in 1957. Prior to this date, Saarland was part of France. After 1957, families in Saarland were subject to spouse income splitting instead of the previous family income splitting and other aspects of family policy also changed fundamentally with Saarland's reaccession to Germany. We identify the causal impact of this change by using panel data on newborn children in 45 municipalities in Saarland, and 350 municipalities in surrounding regions in Germany and France. The results suggest that the change in family policy associated with Saarland's reaccession to Germany led to a reduction of births by about one-fifth. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We test the recent operational needs theory of public equity issuance within the context of repeated private equity issues. We find that repeated PIPE issuers burn through cash quickly and do not reach the standards of information transparency or profitability needed for a successful public equity offering. This has implications for investor composition and the market response to a PIPE. Initial PIPE offerings are characterized by substantial diversity in investor type. In successive transactions firms increasingly rely upon hedge funds, who extract greater price discounts and more often require cash flow rights as opposed to control rights. As firms select a path of repeated PIPEs to raise funds, successive issues become uninformative to the market. We conclude that, for small public firms, the same motive underlies public equity offerings and repeated private equity offerings-an acute need for cash.

We find that unanticipated shocks dominate news shocks in accounting for the unconditional variance of output, consumption, and investment growth, interest rate, and the relative price of investment. The unanticipated shock to the marginal efficiency of investment is the dominant shock, accounting for over 45% of the variance in output growth. News shocks account for less than 15% of the variance in output growth. Within the set of news shocks, nontechnology sources of news dominate technology news, with wage markup news shocks accounting for about 60% of the variance share of both hours and inflation. We find that in the estimated DSGE model (i) the presence of endogenous countercyclical price and wage markups due to nominal frictions substantially diminishes the importance of news shocks relative to a model without these frictions, and (ii) while there is little change in the estimated contributions of technology news when we restrict wealth effects on labor supply, the contributions of nontechnology news shocks are relatively more sensitive.","[Khan, Hashmat] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Tsoukalas, John] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Carleton University; University of Glasgow,"Khan, H (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",Hashmat_Khan@carleton.ca; john.tsoukalas@glasgow.ac.uk,"Khan, Hashmat/AAE-9991-2020","Khan, Hashmat/0000-0002-9625-7251",,,,,23,64,71,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Inside banks, to induce effort, loan officers are compensated based on the volume of loans. Volume-based compensation also induces greater risk taking; however, due to lack of commitment, loan officers are penalized ex post only if banks suffer a high enough liquidity shortfall. Outside banks, when there is heightened macroeconomic risk, investors reduce direct investment and hold more bank deposits. This 'flight to quality' leaves banks flush with liquidity, lowering the sensitivity of bankers' payoffs to downside risks and inducing excessive credit volume and asset price bubbles. The seeds of a crisis are thus sown. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Secondly, we define and compute an equilibrium that takes into consideration the government's incentive to implement unexpected adjustments in both public debt and transfers. We show that the long run equilibrium over public debt and transfers in Floden [2001] is not stable with respect to these short term incentives.

The model implies that if population density is on an upward trajectory, rises in population and in incomes increasingly generate price responses and diminishing rises in the stock of housing. Rises in population density make high and rising levels of house prices likely; this makes alternatives to standard debt financing of home ownership become more desirable.

A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.

Where market transactions are limited, social capital is an important household asset for accessing seed and channelling information. The study is set in a drought-prone region of Ethiopia, with high rates of food insecurity and dependency on agriculture for livelihoods. The region is very rich in crop genetic diversity, particularly for sorghum. The data were collected for a production year that experienced a major drought shock. Results of the analysis indicate that social capital is an important determinant of farm level diversity and wellbeing, with opposing effects related to the two different forms of social capital. This suggests possible trade-offs between the two forms of social capital in terms of food security, production and diversity, which need to be considered in planning interventions.","[Cavatassi, Romina; Lipper, Leslie] Food & Agr Org, Agr & Dev Econ Div, Econ Dev Serv, Agr Sect, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Winters, Paul] American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); American University,"Cavatassi, R (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org, Agr & Dev Econ Div, Econ Dev Serv, Agr Sect, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",romina.cavatassi@fao.org; leslie.lipper@fao.org; winters@american.edu,"Cavatassi, Romina/IQX-1116-2023; Winters, Paul/HKE-8169-2023","Cavatassi, Romina/0000-0002-8600-5691; Winters, Paul/0000-0001-9976-4534",,,,,44,7,10,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

A merger-based natural experiment supports a causal interpretation of our results.

However, the improvement over the empirical covariance matrix is not optimal for small values of n, the estimation sample size. For typical asset allocation problems, with n small, this paper aims at. proposing a new method to further reduce sampling error by shrinking once again traditional shrinkage estimators of the GMVP. First, we show analytically that the weights of any GMVP can be shrunk - within the framework of the ridge regression - towards the ones of the equally-weighted portfolio in order to reduce sampling error. Second, Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications show that applying our methodology to the GMVP based on shrinkage estimators of the covariance matrix, leads to more stable portfolio weights, sharp decreases in portfolio turnovers, and often statistically lower (resp. higher) out-of-sample variances (resp. Sharpe ratios). These results illustrate that double shrinkage estimation of the GMVP can be beneficial for realistic small estimation sample sizes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These same arguments likely influence decision-makers as they incorporate market discipline as the third pillar of Solvency II, the European insurance regulatory scheme currently being implemented. Success for Solvency II, then, is dependent in part on the strength of influence found in market discipline. Our research indicates that the German insurance market demonstrates the existence of such discipline, although the actual effect appears smaller than previously found in the U. S. insurance market. Solvency II, therefore, seems to be following an appropriate path, although further research is needed to evaluate whether or not enhancements to market discipline within the European market are warranted.

Assuming exporters set prices following either a high or a low pass-through pricing policy, and assuming that the transition probabilities between these pricing policies depend on market concentration, exporting country's market share and monetary stability, we estimate a Markov regime-switching model, using data we have collected on imported cars to the United States. Our findings show that the low pass-through regime is characterized by: lower exchange rate pass-through, low response to misalignments in the firm's relative price, low volatility of exogenous shocks, and higher duration. When we decompose the changes in the pass-through in our sample, we find that monetary stability has been the most important factor behind the decline in the pass-through. Monetary stability explains more than 50% of the decline in the exchange rate pass-through, while country market share and market concentration explain about 25 and 10%, respectively.","[Leblebicioglu, Asli] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hernandez, Kolver] Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA",North Carolina State University; University of Delaware,"Leblebicioglu, A (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 8110, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",kolver@udel.edu; alebleb@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,38,2,3,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The multi-decomposition of an inequality measure allows us to put into perspective the role of social spending and taxation in reducing inequalities simultaneously among active people, among retirees, and between workers and pensioners. However, we question the extent to which this multidimensional inequality indicator is a relevant tool for the study of intergenerational inequalities. Does the multidimensional inequality indicator allow to deliver conclusions regarding retirement policies in the context of an aging population? In 2007, pensions explained a small proportion of the inequalities, compared with the share of retirees in the sample. Social benefits allow to reduce inequalities of 1,3% in the population. We also conclude that this inequality measure does not provide a clear picture of the inequalities between active individuals and retirees.","[Legendre, Berangere] Univ Savoie, IREGE, EA 2426, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France; [Legendre, Berangere] Univ Paris 09, LEDa DIAL, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Legendre, B (通讯作者)，Univ Savoie, IREGE, EA 2426, BP 80439, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France.",berangere.legendre@univ-savoie.fr,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,10,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

These tails determine the ex-post solvency probabilities derived from the scenarios. This paper estimates the macro-credit risk link by the traditional Wilson (1997a,b) model as well as by an alternative proposed quantile regression (QR) method (Koenker and Xiao, 2002), in which the relative importance of the macro variables can vary along the credit risk distribution, conceptually incorporating uncertainty in default correlations. Stress-testing exercises on the Brazilian household sector at the one-quarter horizon indicate that unemployment rate distress produces the most harmful effect, whereas distressed inflation and distressed interest rate show higher impacts at longer periods. Determining which of the two stress-testing approaches perceives the scenarios more severely depends on the type of comparison employed. The QR approach is revealed more conservative based on a suggested comparison of vertical distances between the tails of the conditional and unconditional credit risk cumulative distributions.

Car deficient households are defined as households with more drivers than cars. We derive some key hypotheses from the literature and use the German Mobility Panel 1994-2008 to simultaneously test some of these hypotheses in a pooled data approach with cluster robust regression techniques. We find support for the social roles hypothesis which claims that mode choice may be impacted by the gendered roles a person takes in a household. Participation in paid work does not systematically affect car use more strongly than participation in unpaid work. Thus, there is no support for the economic power hypothesis which claims that car access is a function of intrahousehold economic power. The strong effect of 'sex' leads us to conclude that there must be more behind gender differences in mode choice than just social roles. Gender differences in travel mode choice even in households with as many cars as drivers suggest that preferences may be at play. The paper concludes with an outlook on further research.

This study draws from recent research on the concept and measurement of sustainable accessibility in urban areas. The paper focuses on the particular case of small urban areas, where walking and cycling represent a significant proportion of the overall travel mode share. The methodology suggested in this paper departs from the use of traditional gravity-based measures of accessibility and sustainability, which tend to focus on motorised modes of travel. Instead, the present study suggests an extension of the Place Rank accessibility method to incorporate a measurement of sustainability through the multi-modal analysis of commuting trips for the City of Galway, Ireland. The paper concludes that the use of a multi-modal approach to the measurement of sustainable accessibility offers an additional insight into the nature of urban commuting and the spatial distribution of employment in small cities, where the understanding of non-motorised travel-to-work mode use is of great importance for urban transport planning and practice.

The results suggest that optimal eradication in finite time should be pursued when possible. However, optimal eradication is not always feasible (sometimes eradication can be only achieved asymptotically), and the ecology of the disease is of paramount importance in this respect. Also, convergence to an internal steady-state does not minimise the present value of the disease damage and control cost (a result consistent with the existing literature). Ignoring these results may lead to inadequate policy design.","MODUL Univ Vienna, Dept Publ Governance, A-1190 Vienna, Austria",,"Ceddia, MG (通讯作者)，MODUL Univ Vienna, Dept Publ Governance, Kahlenberg 1, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",graziano.ceddia@modul.ac.at,,,,,,,55,1,1,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find evidence of significant serial and cross-serial dependence in daily investment-grade and high-yield bond returns. The serial dependence exhibits a complex nonlinear structure. Both investment-grade and high-yield bond returns can be predicted by past stock market returns in-sample and out-of-sample, and the predictive relation is much stronger between stocks and high-yield bonds. By contrast, there is little evidence that stock returns can be predicted by past bond returns. These findings are robust to various model specifications and test methods, and provide important implications for modeling the term structure of defaultable bonds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our model explains why brokers are commonly compensated indirectly through contingent commissions paid by product providers, even though this compensation structure could lead to biased advice. When customers are wary of the adviser's incentives, contingent commissions can be an effective incentive tool to induce the adviser to learn which specialized product is most suitable for the specific needs of customers. If, instead, customers naively believe they receive unbiased advice, high product prices and correspondingly high commissions become a tool of exploitation. Policy intervention that mandates disclosure of commissions can protect naive consumers and increase welfare. However, prohibiting or capping commissions could have the unintended consequence of stifling the adviser's incentive to acquire information. More vigorous competition benefits consumers and reduces exploitation, but firms have limited incentives to educate naive customers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We also find that while the standard approach, which simply counts the number of significant positive (negative) timing coefficients, does not incorporate false discoveries in volatility timing, it provides quite accurate volatility timing results. Finally, we find that the performance measures for an equally weighted portfolio of procyclical timing funds are greater than for an equally weighted portfolio of countercyclical timing funds in the in-sample test, consistent with our expectation that procyclical timers earn higher returns because they take on more risk.

Overall, the results indicate that the three GC markets are integrated among themselves, as well as with the U.S. markets. The conditional correlations between the GC markets have outweighed their conditional correlations with the U.S. market, indicating closer integration between the GC markets due to geographical proximity and closer economic links. Moreover, higher levels of volatility spillovers and correlations are detected across all markets during the 2007 global financial crisis period.

In this study, we analyze how the risk of predation evolves in different political regimes. Formally, we look at the interaction between a government and citizens in which, in each period, the government has an option to predate. Citizens prefer governments that are competent and non-predatory and strive to replace ones that are not. Regimes differ in the degree to which citizens can succeed in doing so. In pure democracies, citizens can displace incumbent governments; in pure autocracies, they cannot; and in intermediate cases, they can do so in probability. After economic downturns, the posterior probability that the government is competent and benevolent declines. According to the model, in intermediate regimes, but not in others, governments can separate by type. One implication, then, is that these regimes are politically and economically more volatile, with higher levels of variation in assessments of political risk and in economic performance. Another is that in such regimes, political leadership can make an economic difference. Empirically, we test our argument by measuring the impact of economic downturns on the perceived risk of political expropriation in different regime types, using as instruments the incidence of natural disasters and unexpected terms of trade shocks.","[Petrova, Maria] New Econ Sch, Moscow 117418, Russia; [Bates, Robert H.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New Economic School; Harvard University,"Petrova, M (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Off 905,Nakhimovsky Pr 47, Moscow 117418, Russia.",mpetrova@nes.ru,"Petrova, Maria/L-2921-2014","Petrova, Maria/0000-0001-7625-5286",,,,,67,9,10,0,23,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

For problems that are influenced by heterogeneity of actors, social networks, or -the arising of a complex system from simple phenomena, such as Adam Smith's invisible handaEuroeconomists increasingly are turning to agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling is a form of computational analysis that focuses on agents rather than on aggregates. In his long career as a founding scholar of public choice, Gordon Tullock repeatedly followed the agent-oriented approach of methodological individualism. Many of Tullock's models are thus highly amenable to further exploration using that method. As agent-based modeling becomes more and more popular, the importance of Tullock's work will continue to grow.","George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Wallick, R (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",rwallick@gmu.edu,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2012,152.0,1-2,,,SI,,223,244,,10.1007/s11127-011-9887-7,0.0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,944AN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304170600016,0

An Enviroclub consists of a group of 10 to 15 SMEs involved in training sessions on environmental management and carrying out at least one profitable in-plant pollution prevention project. The objective of this article is to provide a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of this original initiative in order to inform policy-makers as to the social desirability of such programs. One of the main social benefits of this initiative is to reduce emissions of various pollutants, so that one of our largest challenges is to place a value on these environmental improvements. To do so, we use the environmental value transfer method to obtain values from previous relevant studies. We conduct our CBA at three different levels: we consider the costs and benefits first for the whole of society, then from the participating firms' point of view and, finally, from governments' perspective. We conclude that, whichever perspective we choose, the Enviroclub initiative has been highly profitable.","[Lanoie, Paul; Rochon-Fabien, Alexandra] HEC Montreal, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Lanoie, P (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,36,4,4,0,10,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

In our analysis, in addition to looking at the impact of liberalizing import restrictions, we take into account the fact that greater trade integration also leads to better and greater export possibilities. While we find that Korea's own tariffs do not have any statistically significant effects on labor-demand elasticities at the firm level, we find some evidence for the impact of imports on labor-demand elasticities when we replace tariffs with import penetration ratios. We also find a fair amount of evidence that exports increase labor-demand elasticites (in absolute value). While we find fairly strong evidence that tariff reductions in China have led to an increase in Korean firm-level labor-demand elasticities, there is no conclusive evidence showing the effect of tariff reductions by Korea's other major trade partners, namely the EU, US and Japan.

This methodology can produce the wrong answer unless one considers the ways firms compete. Because macro-level shocks reverberate differently at the firm level depending on whether a firm has a cost structure that requires significant adjustment, the quality of governance can only be elucidated accurately analyzing a firm's business strategy and their corporate governance. These differences can help one determine whether the fruits of a positive macro-level shock have been expropriated by insiders. Using the example of Indian firms, we show that an influential finding is reversed when these differences are considered.

Firms in unionized industries implement less risky investment policies and are less likely targets of acquisitions. Unionization reduces yields by more when firms' takeover barriers are lower. Hence, unions are viewed favorably in the bond market because, through their influence on corporate affairs, they protect bondholders' wealth.","[Chen, Huafeng (Jason); Ortiz-Molina, Hernan] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Kacperczyk, Marcin] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of British Columbia; New York University,"Chen, HF (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019; Kacperczyk, Marcin/AGG-9764-2022",,,,,,63,102,114,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Our analysis suggests that this is largely due to their research design, which focuses on portfolios that are subject to high estimation risk and extreme turnover. We find that mean-variance optimization often outperforms naive diversification, but turnover can erode its advantage in the presence of transaction costs. To address this issue, we develop 2 new methods of mean-variance portfolio selection (volatility timing and reward-to-risk timing) that deliver portfolios characterized by low turnover. These timing strategies outperform naive diversification even in the presence of high transaction costs.","[Kirby, Chris] Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Ostdiek, Barbara] Rice Univ, Jones Grad Sch Business, Houston, TX 77252 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; Rice University,"Kirby, C (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",christopher.kirby@uncc.edu; ostdiek@rice.edu,"Kirby, Chris/L-8634-2019",,,,,,25,133,147,4,45,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

We find evidence of a clear shift in the behavior of market participants from a convergence-trade expectation, based on market related factors, before August 2007, to one mainly driven by macroeconomic country-specific variables and an international common risk factor. There is no evidence of a significant role for the liquidity risk before or during the financial crisis period. Overall, our results give support to the Merton-type structural credit risk models and confirm that there are considerable similarities between the factors explaining the dynamics of the credit risk spreads and the factors driving the prices on the government bond markets.

However, empirical evidence does not yet support this view. In this paper, I show that a corrupt and powerful central authority can use competition among officials to amass resources for itself. While competition reduces corruption at the lower level of government, corruption at the higher level of government is increased. To avoid widespread theft from the central authority, competing officials are monitored more intensively than a monopolist. Hence, even though competition among officials generates more consumer surplus, it may reduce welfare.","Stockholm Univ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Priks, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",mikael.priks@ne.su.se,,,,,,,55,1,1,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2012,150.0,3-4,,,,,425,438,,10.1007/s11127-010-9709-3,0.0,,,14,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,858QS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297817800002,0

Our sample includes developed, developing, and transition economies. Privatization activity is measured by the number of privatization deals as well as the revenue raised and analyzed using the negative binomial regression and Tobit regression respectively. Although more privatization activity is usually taking place in countries displaying satisfactory economic performance in some respect, the role of economic factors turns out to be limited. The results identify a number of political and institutional determinants but some effects are specific to a particular type of economy. For example, in developing countries, right-wing governments are associated with privatizations while new, not necessarily right-wing governments, are behind privatization in Eastern Europe. The role of financial development is also varied, with sound financial institutions related to successful privatization in developed and developing countries but not in transition economies.","[Roberts, Barbara M.] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Roberts, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",bbr@leicester.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,22,24,0,18,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

In the analysis of high-frequency duration data, it is often the first step to remove the intraday periodicity. Currently the most popular adjustment procedure is the cubic spline procedure proposed by Engle and Russell (1998). In this article, we first carry out a simulation study and show that the performance of the cubic spline procedure is not entirely satisfactory. Then we define periodicity point processes rigorously and prove a time change theorem. A new intraday periodic adjustment procedure is then proposed and its effectiveness is demonstrated in the simulation example. The new approach is easy to implement and well supported by the point process theory. It provides an attractive alternative to the cubic spline procedure. (C) 2011 Elsevier ay.

The plausibility of a scenario is quantified by its distance from an average scenario. For a given level of plausibility, we search systematically for the most adverse scenario. This ensures that no plausible scenario will be missed. We show how this method can be applied to some models already in use by practitioners. While worst case search requires numerical optimisation we show that we can work with reasonably good linear approximations to the portfolio loss function. This makes systematic multi-period stress testing computationally efficient and easy to implement. Applying our approach to data from the Spanish loan register we show that, compared to standard stress test procedures, our method identifies more harmful scenarios that are equally plausible.

The authors propose a taxonomy that categorizes interventions depending on whether they mitigate the negative short-term impact of crises or whether they stimulate recovery. The taxonomy helps policymakers to identify winwin policies that avoid potential tradeoffs between these objectives by simultaneously serving both. Common elements of effective interventions are feasibility, flexibility (for example the capacity for scaling up and down), and incentive compatibilityand there is no substitute for being prepared.

The martingale difference sequence is called conditional mean independence in the statistical literature, implying that the asset return is purely non-predictable from its own past. This study proposes a data-driven Box-Pierce for serial correlation. The automatic Portmanteau test for serial correlation test presents higher power in simulations than the existing ones for models commonly employed in empirical finance: the researcher does not need to specify the order of the autocorrelation tested, since the test automatically chooses this number; its asymptotic null distribution is chi-square with one degree of freedom, so there is no need of using a bootstrap procedure to estimate the critical values and the test is robust to the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form. This paper examines return predictability of the daily ING unit-linked funds prices and aims at monitoring any improvement in the degree of efficiency in time. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We first study the interest rate pass-through using a multiple equation framework We then focus on retail lending to analyze the role of foreign-currency lending for the interest rate channel: to our knowledge, the link between monetary transmission and foreign currency lending has so far not been explicitly studied in the empirical literature on the CEE4 countries. We also address the question of how the interest rate channel was affected by the financial crisis in 2008/2009. The results show significant cross-country differences, partly explained by foreign-currency lending, and support the view that the impact of the crisis on interest rate pass-through is likely to be of a permanent nature. Among the CEE-4, only Poland shows full pass-through at all stages. As far as retail lending is concerned, pass-through is higher and the mark-up lower for larger loans.

This study using endogenous growth framework with human capital and technological progress hypothesized that, under education and research & development investment, human capital and technological progress can produce a higher global effect to the country in the long run. This will result in the convergence in income where poor dynasty/regions grow faster than rich dynasty/regions in the long run. From model simulation, I found that, in the poor economy, when adding a research & development investment in addition to education subsidy, convergence in income and long-run economic growth perform better than another scenario which has only education subsidy.

Auctions and work program bidding are the main ways of allocating mineral leases. In addition to the company taxes applied to all companies, governments can raise revenue from minerals owned by the state through auctions, royalties and rent taxes paid by private firms, and through dividends from state-owned firms. Indonesia uses work program bidding to allocate leases, and its production-sharing contracts are roughly equivalent to a rent tax at a high rate. This paper considers these options for raising revenues from mineral resources. It argues that efficiency and government revenue would both be increased if Indonesia relaxed direct controls on the operations of mining companies, and allocated leases by means of auctions, combined with a much lower rate of rent tax or, better still, a royalty.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Fane, G (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

We present a game theoretical model with incomplete information to account for this empirical pattern. Both terrorists and governments can be of weak or strong types. We find that the risk of terror attacks is highest at the beginning of electoral terms, because striking early allows the terrorists to collect valuable information about the government's type, and also because terrorists know that even initially weak governments sometimes retaliate to show toughness closer to an upcoming election. The model's predictions are consistent with anecdotal evidence.","[Rohner, Dominic] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hodler, Roland] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hodler, Roland] Study Ctr Gerzensee, Gerzensee, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Melbourne; Study Center Gerzensee,"Rohner, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.",roland.hodler@szgerzensee.ch; drohner@iew.uzh.ch,,"Hodler, Roland/0000-0001-8402-8243; Rohner, Dominic/0000-0003-2660-4550",,,,,36,9,9,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2012,150.0,1-2,,,,,181,193,,10.1007/s11127-010-9697-3,0.0,,,13,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,858QN,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297817200009,0

Results of the study indicate that gender, formal religious education, distance to the lender office, business formality, total sales per month, total loan received, loan monitoring and loan disbursement lag have significantly affected borrower's repayment performance. The result also shows that no pressure from Microfinance Institutions to pay the loan may cause the clients delayed their payment or just pay at a minimum amount. Besides, 11 percent of respondents also admitted that they not fully utilised the loan given for business that makes them finally default.

The firm's technology edge over the government generates endogenous property rights. Industry variation in the technology gap predicts a sectoral pecking-order of expropriations. Long-run investment distortions may be Pareto superior relative to persistent investment at the static optimum. The dynamics of investment and transfers depend on whether incentives (backloading) or efficiency (frontloading) concerns dominate at the initial division of surplus.

This paper proposes an asset pricing model where two types of rational traders coexist: short-term speculators and long-term fundamentalists, both sharing the same information set. In this framework, excess volatility not only exists, but is actually fueled by fundamental trading. Consequently, efficient markets are more volatile with a few speculators than with many speculators. Regulators should therefore be aware that efforts to limit rational speculation might, surprisingly, end up increasing volatility. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These questions have been at the core of the profession of agricultural economics since its beginning, but if agricultural economists want to provide useful answers they will need to revisit the currently dominant paradigm of applied microeconomics.

Based on empirical evidence, we model rating transition processes as piecewise homogeneous Markov chains with unobserved structural breaks. The proposed model provides explicit formulas for the posterior distribution of the time-varying rating transition generator matrices, the probability of structural break at each period and prediction of transition matrices in the presence of possible structural breaks. Estimating the model by credit rating history, we show that the structural break in rating transitions can be captured by the proposed model.

This paper documents an unintended consequence of these control strategies: they reduce regulatory agencies' ability and incentive to conduct high-quality economic analysis to inform their decisions. Using scoring data that measure the quality of regulatory impact analysis, we find that hastily adopted interim final regulations reflecting signature policy priorities of the two most recent presidential administrations were accompanied by significantly lower quality economic analysis. Interim final homeland security regulations adopted during the G.W. Bush administration and interim final regulations implementing the Affordable Care Act in the Obama administration were accompanied by less thorough analysis than other economically significant regulations (regulations with benefits, costs, or other economic impacts exceeding $100 million annually). The lower quality analysis apparently stems from the confluence of presidential priorities and very tight statutory deadlines associated with interim final regulations, rather than either factor alone.","[Ellig, Jerry] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Conover, Christopher J.] Duke Univ, Ctr Hlth Policy & Inequal Res, Durham, NC 27705 USA",George Mason University; Duke University,"Ellig, J (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, 3434 Washington Blvd,4th Floor, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",jellig@mercatus.gmu.edu; conoverc@duke.edu,,,,,,,30,9,9,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2014,161.0,3-4,,,,,305,320,,10.1007/s11127-014-0201-3,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AT7XF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345147000003,0

Two alternative specifications of the relationship between PM2.5 concentration and health impacts from Krewski et al. are analyzed: log-linear, which implies downward-sloping marginal benefits of abatement; and log-log, which implies upward-sloping marginal benefits of abatement. A standard assumption would be that the greatest benefit from cleanup would occur in the dirtiest locations. We show, however, that for the log-log (but not log-linear) relationship, the largest risk reductions are achieved from abatement of pollution in the cleanest locations. Our model demonstrates that with a log-log relationship society should prefer lower emissions and lower pollution concentrations than if the relationship is log-linear. Our model also shows that an efficient abatement policy may substantially outperform a uniform pollution standard such as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).","[Goodkind, Andrew L.; Coggins, Jay S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Marshall, Julian D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil Environm & Geo Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Goodkind, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,"Marshall, Julian/AAC-1376-2020","Marshall, Julian/0000-0003-4087-1209",,,,,35,19,26,1,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Fuel burn is also very important because it is highly correlated with emissions and contributes directly to transport externalities. This paper calibrates fuel burn in kilos per seat per nautical mile for aircraft using the EMEP/EEA aircraft inventory database. We then employ the model with OAG flight schedule data to evaluate fuel burn by flight routes and aircraft types at a global scale. The paper shows comparative fuel use among different distance based markets as well as among a variety of routes in the long-haul market. The results show geographical heterogeneity of fuel burn rates among a variety of routes, while controlling for seat configuration and stage distance. The paper finds that stage lengths centered on 1500-2000 NM have the lowest fuel burn rates under current technology, fleet composition, and seat configuration. These findings, together with comments on the viability of long range flights provide better understandings not only for the carbon taxation debates but also for operational efficiency of current aviation markets. The lower rates for moderate distance flights seems to favor networks without extreme links, and supports the use of a hub connection scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we examine the way in which the degree of regional (seven African markets combined), global (China, France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US), commodity (gold and petroleum), and nominal effective exchange rate (Euro and US dollar) spillovers to individual African countries evolved during the two crises through the econometric method introduced by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). We find that African markets are most severely affected by spillovers from global markets and only modestly from commodity and currency markets. Conversely, regional spillovers within Africa are smaller than global ones, and hence, African markets are insulated from global crises.

The most common explanation for this is that firms face nonconvex physical adjustment costs. The model developed in this paper shows that information costs make investment lumpy at the microlevel, even in the absence of nonconvex adjustment costs. When collecting and processing information are costly, the firm optimally chooses to do it sporadically and to be inactive most of the time. This behavior results in infrequent and possibly large capital adjustments.

Overall, our results reveal that long memory volatility models under Student-t distribution perform well in forecasting a one-day-ahead VaR for both long and short positions.

When the stock of a financial institution is shorted aggressively, leverage constraints imposed by short-term creditors can force the institution to liquidate long-term investments at fire sale prices. For financial institutions that are sufficiently close to their leverage constraints, predatory short-selling equilibria coexist with no-liquidation equilibria (the vulnerability region) or may even be the unique equilibrium outcome (the doomed region). Increased coordination among short sellers expands the doomed region, where liquidation is the unique equilibrium.

Using the concept of neocollectivism to characterize MAS agrarian politics, this paper examines one of its key instruments for achieving rural development: the state enterprise EMAPA. This state company, which supports small producers, envisions a new agrarian structure of production and commercialization, one that will break the power of the Santa Cruz-based agro-industrial elite. Drawing on a discussion of the mechanisms of governance employed by this state entity, we argue that new complexities in state-civil society relations and a low state capacity have constrained its ability to shift power relationships between the state and the agro-industrial elites. Instead of reducing the dependency of small producers on agro-industrial capital, the Bolivian state has increased it, thereby undermining its goal of redistribution. The paper also analyses different moments of politicization and depoliticization in the intervention process arising from the demand for political change, as well as for technically efficient and profitable agricultural production.","[Cordoba, Diana; Jansen, Kees] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Social Sci, Knowledge Innovat & Technol Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Cordoba, Diana] CIAT, Cali 6713, Colombia",Wageningen University & Research; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Cordoba, D (通讯作者)，Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Social Sci, Knowledge Innovat & Technol Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",dianamarcela.cordoba@gmail.com; kees.jansen@wur.nl,"Jansen, Kees/C-3222-2008",,,,,,72,19,20,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We analyze the cost of being a smoker, measured in annual hospital days, and compare this with the cost of being a former smoker, the cost of being obese, and the cost of a variety of other medical conditions, relative to the cost of being a never smoker, using three large recent surveys each having in excess of one hundred thousand observations. The paper also explores the cost of former smokers as determined by the number of years since quitting. Smokers as a whole are not found to be the most costly employees. Furthermore, health costs vary dramatically among smokers of different duration and intensity.

Consistent with theoretical predications, we find that informed trades in the BIST tend to be large. Our findings that price discovery appears to be fairly rapid on the BIST and that the average multi-sample stock trade price effect of less than 30 basis points is competitive with other markets have important implications for the purchase and execution decisions of investors. Our finding of positive mean price effects for short trades that are larger for seller-initiated trades and larger than for long trades has implications for the ongoing debate about the regulation of short sales since it suggest that the average short sale does not depress prices. Furthermore, the higher price effects of (especially buyer-initiated) trades in the last minutes of a trading session and the variation in price effects with whether the client-broker relationship is agency, principal or mixed have important implications for market regulators in terms of refining their surveillance systems to better control any inappropriate stealth trading or end-of-session price manipulation.

The financial integration and globalization of capital markets have facilitated the capital inflows/outflows among countries. Sovereign credit ratings have served as a signal for countries' economic, financial and political situations. Ratings are very important in the sense that they attract capital inflow and investments. This is especially vital for emerging markets. Although the rating agencies do not explicitly reveal their methodologies, it is possible to guess the effects of several variables on ratings by using various econometric models. Concerning the heavy criticisms on rating agencies' performances, we wish to examine the sovereign credit ratings within a specific country-category. In this essay, we study the effects of macroeconomic factors on the sovereign ratings of emerging markets. Using several approaches, we find that the most relevant factors are Budget Balance/GDP, GDP per capita, Governance Indicators and Reserves/GDP. Moreover, our model predicts up to 93% of all credit rating levels. Interestingly, we obtain that S&P's evaluation of the sovereign credit rating for Turkey performs poorly, especially in the highest rating levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

EVIDENCE FROM A RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENT IN URBAN INDIA,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"As an intrinsic part of the classic microfinance model, group meetings are intended to employ social capital to ensure timely repayment. Recent research suggests that more frequent meetings can increase social capital among first-time clients. Using randomized variation in group meeting frequency for 174 microfinance groups in India, we demonstrate that social capital gains associated with more frequent meetings continue to accrue across multiple lending cycles. However, these effects are reduced when group members differ in their borrowing history. In addition, clients who start with low levels of empowerment report higher social capital gains when matched with similar clients. We discuss how current microfinance policy debates overlook the creation of social capital, including through repayment meeting frequency, and we encourage regulators to undertake a holistic understanding of microfinance's impacts.","[Feigenberg, Benjamin] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Field, Erica] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Pande, Rohini] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rigol, Natalia] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Sarkar, Shayak] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Duke University; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University,"Feigenberg, B (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 601 South Morgan St,725 Univ Hall MC 144, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",bfeigenb@alum.mit.edu; emf23@duke.edu; Rohini_Pande@harvard.edu; nrigol@mit.edu; ssarkar@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,12,22,23,1,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

We measure overconfidence using overestimation of past quiz-performance and overestimation of past quiz-performance compared to peers. The results of the first experiment indicate that the effect of positive affect on both measures of overconfidence is positive and significant for male subjects. Although mood-inducement is equally successful for female subjects, their overconfidence is unaffected by positive affect. These positive affect results are robust to various specification checks. In the second experiment, we find consistent evidence of neither anger, fear, nor sadness's effect on overconfidence; the lack of a result is attributable either to a genuine lack of relationship between these affects and overconfidence or to confounded mood-inducements. The effect of positive affect on overconfidence may help explain the relationship between mood and speculative bubbles and between mood and trading volume. Further, our results have implications for the effect of happiness on overconfidence and the role of emotions in economic decision-making, in general.

Unlimited decentralized leadership is inefficient because regional governments have incentives to overspend resources in the provision of regional public goods. Selective decentralized leadership is socially efficient if commitments are restricted to regional contributions to national public goods, since in this case regional governments face correct incentives when they contribute to national and regional public goods. The model applies to different types of national public goods. Aggregation technologies include the orthodox summation, and nonlinear and asymmetric transformation functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The model is used to analyze the interactions between monetary and macroprudential policies, involving, in the latter case, changes in reserve requirements.

This article analyzes the mechanisms through which the two monetary institutions could work: Indirectly via a disciplinary effect on money growth rates or via an additional credibility effect on inflation expectations and the cost of capital. I further explain how both discipline and credibility are affected by the distinct flaws of independent central banks and fixed exchange rates: central banks lack transparency and fixed exchange rates take many shapes and are routinely devalued. The argument is tested with quarterly data from postcommunist countries for years 1991 to 2007. The findings show a strong disciplinary effect of monetary institutions on rates of M2 change and an effect on inflation controlling for money growth, but credibility does not extend to lower real short-term market interest rates. Political institutions do condition the effect of central bank independence, while the types of fixed exchange rates affect money growth rates and inflation to different degrees.","[Bodea, Cristina] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Bodea, C (通讯作者)，Dept Polit Sci, 342 South Kedzie Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",bodeaana@msu.edu,,,,,,,73,7,7,0,18,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

A key reason for this is that risk measures are subject to a model risk due, e.g. to specification and estimation uncertainty. While regulators have proposed that financial institutions assess the model risk, there is no accepted approach for computing such a risk. We propose a remedy for this by a general framework for the computation of risk measures robust to model risk by empirically adjusting the imperfect risk forecasts by outcomes from backtesting frameworks, considering the desirable quality of VaR models such as the frequency, independence and magnitude of violations. We also provide a fair comparison between the main risk models using the same metric that corresponds to model risk required corrections. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our results explain the paucity of information sharing in fisheries and suggest regulators use caution in advocating cooperatives as a solution to common pool inefficiencies in fisheries.","[Evans, Keith S.] St Lawrence Univ, Dept Econ, Canton, NY 13617 USA; [Weninger, Quinn] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Saint Lawrence University; Iowa State University,"Evans, KS (通讯作者)，St Lawrence Univ, Dept Econ, 102 Hepburn Hall, Canton, NY 13617 USA.",kevans@stlawu.edu,,"Weninger, Quinn/0000-0003-4656-105X",,,,,40,22,24,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Finally, we find a positive effect on height, being left footed and being a striker on the probability of scoring a goal.

The CRR model is a discrete analog of the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model. The 2008 credit crisis exposed the shortcomings of the oversimplified assumptions of the BSM model. Burgard and Kjaer extended the BSM model to include adjustments such as a credit value adjustment (CVA), a debit value adjustment (DVA) and a funding value adjustment (FVA). The aim of this paper is to extend the CRR model to include CVA, DVA and FVA and to prove that this extended CRR model coincides with the model that results from discretising the Burgard and Kjaer model. Our results are numerically implemented and we also show that as the number of time-steps increase in the derived tree structure model, the model converges to the model developed by Burgard and Kjaer.

This study focuses on the impacts of this partnership on Turkish economy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to analytically analyse the economic impacts of this agreement on Turkey. By using Global Trade Analysis Project database and a general equilibrium model, the effects of various scenarios on gross domestic product and exports are studied. Obtained results show that Turkey could be in a loss up to 1% of gross domestic product if present 12 countries establish the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Using a panel of 184 developed and emerging economies from 1970 to 2009, and looking at the impact of financial account structure in normal times and in situations of bank balance-sheet contagion shocks, we find that the structure of the financial account indeed has an important influence on financial stability. A bias in external liabilities towards debt appears to increase strongly the risk of a systemic banking crisis. Moreover, certain forms of international financial integration, such as integration through international bank lending, amplify contagion shocks and increase crisis risk, particularly in the case of short-term bank debt.","[Ahrend, Rudiger; Goujard, Antoine] OECD Econ Dept, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Ahrend, R (通讯作者)，OECD Econ Dept, Paris, France.",rudiger.ahrend@oecd.org; antoine.goujard@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,6,6,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

To this aim, we account for ownership-value nonlinearities. Supporting that the risk of expropriation increases with high ownership concentration, we find an inverted U-shape relation between family control and firm value. Family firms incur a value discount when family equity holdings exceed approximately 50%. The nonlinear effect of family control is attributable to family firms from a strongly protective environment. When investor protection is weak, family control has a positive impact on firm value regardless of the ownership concentration level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose a theory that generalizes this statement and finds that if there exists a coverage effect, that is, the effect of longer road length on traffic conditional on capacity, then the new equilibrium travel speed could be lower than its previous level. Given the fundamental law, the theory predicts that the elasticity of traffic to road capacity is at least 1. We estimate this elasticity for national expressways in Japan and test this prediction. Using the planned national expressway extension as an exogenous source of variation for capacity expansion, we obtain elasticity estimates ranging between 1.24 and 1.34, consistent with the prediction of our theory. We further investigate the sources of the larger-than-unity elasticity and find that the coverage effect plays a critical role, compared with the effect due to lane expansion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Gindling, TH; Newhouse, D",,,,"Gindling, T.

After profiling how worker characteristics vary by employment status, it classifies self-employed workers outside agriculture as successful or unsuccessful entrepreneurs, based on two measures of success: whether the worker is an employer, and whether the worker resides in a non-poor household. Four main findings emerge. First, jobs exhibit a clear pecking order, with household income and worker education highest for employers, followed by wage and salaried employees, non-agricultural own-account workers, non-agricultural unpaid family workers, and finally agricultural workers. Second, a substantial minority of own-account workers reside in non-poor households, suggesting that their profits are often a secondary source of household income. Third, as per capita income increases across countries, the structure of employment shifts rapidly, first out of agriculture into unsuccessful non-agricultural self-employment, and then mainly into non-agricultural wage employment. Finally, roughly one-third of the unsuccessful entrepreneurs share similar characteristics with their successful counterparts, suggesting they have the potential to be successful but face constraints to growth. The authors conclude that although interventions such as access to credit can benefit a substantial portion of the self-employed, effectively targeting the minority of self-employed with higher growth potential is important, particularly in low-income contexts. The results also highlight the potential benefits of policies that facilitate shifts in the nature of work, first from agricultural labor into non-agricultural self-employment, and then into wage and salaried jobs.

It is clear, though, that they are not simply a combination of adjacent municipalities or areas. Different methods can be used for their definition. However, especially in developing countries, the application of some methods is not possible, due to the unavailability of detailed data. Alternative approaches have been developed based on spatial analysis methods and using variables extracted from available data. The objective of this study is to compare the results of two spatial analysis methods exploring two variables: population density and an indicator of transport infrastructure supply. The first method regards Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses tools, which define uniform regions based on specific variables. The second method used the same variables and the spatial analysis technique available in the computer program SKATER - Spatial 'K'luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal.

Drawing on research on farmworkers in Zimbabwe and engaging with literature concerning farm labour in the drastic changes to large-scale agriculture in this country since 2000, the paper emphasizes the importance of examining the wider terrain of politics that influences the actions and abilities of extra-farm organizations to operate with farmworkers. Through critically engaging with the wider literature concerning the political economy of farm labour, the paper proposes the importance of attending to what it calls the 'cultural politics of belonging', which strongly shapes both the forms of attachment of farmworkers and farm dwellers to the farms and the strategies of mobilization and demobilization taken by these organizations. Through attending to such relationships and the wider terrain of politics, this paper proposes an alternative analysis to those currently found in the polarized literature on farmworkers and the Fast Track Land Redistribution Programme in Zimbabwe.","Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Rutherford, B (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",blair_rutherford@carleton.ca,,"Rutherford, Blair/0000-0003-4066-7099",,,,,86,4,4,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Canonical models emphasize the importance of labor mobility when evaluating the employment effects of the minimum wage; yet few studies address this outcome directly. Low-skilled immigrant populations shift toward labor markets with stagnant minimum wages, and this result is robust to a number of alternative interpretations. This mobility provides behavior-based evidence in favor of a non-trivial negative employment effect of the minimum wage. Further, it reduces the estimated demand elasticity using teens; employment losses among native teens are substantially larger in states that have historically attracted few immigrant residents.

J,"Klose, J; Weigert, B",,,,"Klose, Jens; Weigert, Benjamin",,,Sovereign Yield Spreads During the Euro Crisis: Fundamental Factors Versus Redenomination Risk,INTERNATIONAL FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,US,"The intensity of the euro crisis has been reflected in significant increases in sovereign bond yields in the most troubled countries. This has triggered a debate over whether this increase can be attributed solely to fundamental factors or whether part of the increase represents redenomination risk that one or more countries will drop out of the European Monetary Union and reintroduce their own national currencies. Using a novel market-based indicator from the virtual prediction market Intrade, this paper explores whether such systemic risk is present in the yield spreads of nine euro-area countries. We find that redenomination risk has played a role in the determination of sovereign yields, and that this risk is related to the expected valuations of newly introduced currencies: those of Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy are expected to depreciate, while newly introduced currencies of other countries are expected to appreciate following a break-up of the EMU. 'Risk premia that are related to fears of the reversibility of the Euro are unacceptable, and they need to be addressed in a fundamental manner.'

Major contributing factors are the rise in returns to labor, in general, and educated labor, in particular, due to the development of the nonfarm labor market.

The effect attenuates for benign forms of tax avoidance and during the recent credit crisis period. For the most profitable firms, debt and tax aggression are complements.

Our focus is on seniority, though we note that this general approach may also be deployed to understand other aspects of institutional arrangements. We have taken the initial game-theoretic model of seniority of McKelvey and Riezman (), simplified it in order to characterize its fundamental implications, generalized these results in several ways, and extended the model by deriving additional implications. The broad messages of our article, articulated by McKelvey and Riezman as well, are two. First, the endogenous choice of institutional features like seniority by self-governing groups is strategic. While the fine-grained ways of doing things in an institutional context surely serve internal functional objectives, these are not the only objectives. Agents making choices on how to govern themselves have private motivations - in the case of elected politicians they often revolve around re-election. This leads to our second broad message. The institutions through which self-governing groups conduct their business do not exist in a vacuum. They are embedded in a broader context. Those offering functional explanations for various institutional features overlook this. Particular institutional arrangements have effects outside the governance institution itself. These effects, in principle, could be accidental by-products. Our strategic approach, however, argues that they may well be the primary reasons for a practice being instituted.","[Muthoo, Abhinay] Univ Warwick, Warwick, England; [Shepsle, Kenneth A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Warwick; Harvard University,"Muthoo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Warwick, England.",a.muthoo@warwick.ac.uk,"Muthoo, Abhinay/ABB-9001-2020",,,,,,27,15,17,0,13,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The federal amendments to impaired driving law of the past 15 years have focused on penalties, narrow prosecutorial issues, and long-standing loopholes. However, significant progress requires a shift from these so-called tough laws to effective laws (i.e., those that will sharply reduce impaired driving). In response to similar problems with the persistence of impaired driving, many developed countries have enacted both a criminal .05 percent blood-alcohol concentration limit for driving and random breath testing, thereby achieving dramatic reductions in related crash deaths.

We find that respondents consider their tax refund as a whole, without differentiating the portion from the EITC; as a result, they cannot predict how their EITC refund would change if they altered their labor supply or marital status. Incentives for childbearing are better understood, but are not specific to the EITC; rather, parents respond to a combination of tax deductions and credits as a whole. Respondents would like to maximize their refunds, but most cannot or would not alter their behavior due to structural constraints they face in the labor and marriage markets. Rather than adjust work hours, defer marriage, or have additional children, respondents exhibit a different type of behavioral response to the incentive structure of the EITC: They alter their tax filing status in order to maximize their refunds. They routinely claim zero exemptions and deductions on their W-4s, file their tax returns as head of household rather than as married, and divide children among the tax returns of multiple caregivers. Although some of these behaviors qualify as tax noncompliance, they emerge because the intricacies of the tax code conflict with the complexity and fluidity of finances and family life in low-income households.","[Tach, Laura] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Tach, L (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 247 Martha van Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",,,,,,,,68,22,29,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Net producing households in rural areas benefit from price increases with households above the poverty line obtaining proportionally higher incomes.","[Caracciolo, Francesco; Cembalo, Luigi; Lombardi, Alessia] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Naples, Italy; [Thompson, Gary] Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tucson, AZ 85711 USA",University of Naples Federico II; University of Arizona,"Thompson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1110 E James Rogers Way,Chavez Bldg, Tucson, AZ 85711 USA.",garyt@ag.arizona.edu,"Caracciolo, Francesco/D-6147-2013","Caracciolo, Francesco/0000-0001-9430-7529; Cembalo, Luigi/0000-0002-3808-5797; Lombardi, Alessia/0000-0002-5862-0283",,,,,54,10,10,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Using a difference-in-difference approach, we show that banks' financial stability increases substantially after these countries reform their legal institutions, liberalize banking, and restructure corporate governance. We also find that the effects of legal and governance reforms on bank risk may critically depend on the progress of banking reforms. A further examination of alternative risk measures reveals that the increases in financial stability among banks mainly come from the reduction of asset risk. Banks tend to have lower ROA volatility and fewer non-performing loans after reforming the institutional environment. Finally, we split our sample into foreign and domestic banks and find that the enhancement of financial stability is more pronounced for domestic banks.

In previous works, we have proposed and evaluated an intelligent disaster management system based on the emerging ICT technologies such as Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) and Cloud Computing with a focus on transportation in urban environments. Also, we have developed a tool to examine previous proposed intelligent system performance in improving the transportation evacuation strategies, and Demand Strategy (DS) has been shown as one of the various evacuation strategies to measure the improvements. In this paper, we applied and evaluated another transportation evacuation strategy called Speed Strategy (SS), independently for traffic network. In addition, the driver response to the emergency situations and their behaviors in travel choices may be difficult to quantify theoretically, however, driver response to evacuation pre-plans is part of the tool design and we present the importance of this factor through various evacuation strategies.

Furthermore, the reduction in opacity tends to be larger for firms that in the pre-SOX period have lower accrual quality, less conservative earnings, lower number of independent directors, lower S&P Transparency and Disclosure ratings, and are more likely to benefit from SOX-compliance according to Chhaochharia and Grinstein's (2007) criteria.

But what makes a voluntary market exchange truly voluntary? We suggest, contra much of the economics literature, that voluntary exchange requires consent uncoerced by threats of harm, but that this is not sufficient. In particular, a person pressured to exchange by the dire consequences of failing to exchange-e.g., dying of thirst or hunger-is still coerced, and coerced exchange cannot be voluntary. The weaker party's desperation gives the other party unconscionable bargaining power. We argue for a distinction, based on a neologism: in the case of coercion by circumstance but not by threat, exchange is still voluntary in the conventional sense, but it is not euvoluntary (i.e., truly voluntary). We will argue that all euvoluntary exchanges are just, while non-euvoluntary exchanges may or may not be unjust; that in competitive markets all exchanges are just, even those that are not euvoluntary, while in bilateral monopolies some exchanges are neither euvoluntary nor just.

During the last period of time the importance of M&A in the Greek banking sector have been reinvigorated as a result of a without precedent financial and economic crisis the Greek economy and banking sector faces, and the ongoing pressure both by Greek authorities and foreign institutions (IMF), for bigger and more efficient banks. In this paper the effect of the announcement of an M&A proposal that took place in the summer of 2010, on the share prices of three major Greek banks listed in the Athens Stock Exchange Market, is assessed. The bidder was a private bank (Piraeus Bank), while the targets banks were two state owned banks (Hellenic Postbank and Agricultural Bank of Greece). The event study methodology is used to evaluate the effect the proposal had on the stock returns of the banks involved. Our results are analysed and discussed considering the financial and corporate governance characteristics, of the involved banks and the Greek banking sector. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Issues in Banjarmasin concerning the transportation facilities procurement is related to the increase of urbanization stream to the city, overflowing of private vehicles, people's low discipline level of using vehicles or many traffic offenses. To overcome the problems, the government of Banjarmasin has to establish appropriate policy concerning municipal public transport system suitable with the changes and demands of Banjarmasin people's needs. This research employs interactive planning method to manufacture future planning, based on the problems encountered, and to design planning to overcome those problems (Ackoff, 1981, 2001). The result of the study shows that, first, a firm and resolved leadership is needed in public transportation system planning in Banjarmasin. Second, the process of public transportation planning by using interactive planning method requires participative principle, continuity principle, and holistic principle in order to be sustainable. Therefore, to support the success of public transport services, Banjarmasin government should implement the planning of transportation policy based on sustainable vision in traffic and public transport systems.

Standard oil price forecasts based on reduced-form regressions or based on oil futures prices do not allow consumers of forecasts to explore how much the forecast would change relative to the baseline forecast under alternative scenarios about future oil demand and oil supply conditions. Such scenario analysis is of central importance for end-users of oil price forecasts interested in evaluating the risks underlying these forecasts. We show how policy-relevant forecast scenarios can be constructed from recently proposed structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models of the global oil market and how changes in the probability weights attached to these scenarios affect the upside and downside risks embodied in the baseline real-time oil price forecast. Such risk analysis helps forecast users understand what assumptions are driving the forecast. An application to real-time data for December 2010 illustrates the use of these tools in conjunction with reduced-form VAR forecasts of the real price of oil.","[Baumeister, Christiane] Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Bank of Canada; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Baumeister, C (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,26,40,43,0,20,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

This topic is discussed and dealt with by many experts, authors of numerous publications as well as the European Commission in the Lisbon strategy document called Europe 2020. In many organisations, continuing education of employees and innovation implementation are perceived as something necessary. On the other hand, however, these organisations declare a great amount of reasons why they cannot prove it by their activities. Only few organisational managers realise that only the strategy of continuous improvement will enable them to achieve satisfactory results. The objective of the article is to characterise the level of the focus of organisations operating in Slovakia on continuing education and development of employees. This article aims at presenting the results of research conducted in 2012 at the School of Economics and Management in Public Administration in Bratislava and at the Institute of Industrial Engineeering and Management, the Faculty of Materials Science and Technology in Trnava. The set of respondents comprised 340 randomly selected organisations operating in Slovakia. The key condition posed on them was the size of at least 50 employees. The analysis was used for information collected from literary sources or questionnaires. All the knowledge was dealt with in smaller parts in order to enable a more detailed focus. As to statistical methods, distribution characteristics were used to express the median. Most of the collected values were expressed in % upon the results summarisation. The methods of induction and deduction were used in the article upon deriving the conclusions. The method of comparison was used upon the evaluation of the present state, comparing organisations paying sufficient attention to human resources management and organisations not dealing with it at all. To evaluate the data, the SPSS 19 statistical programme and MS Excel 2007 were used. However, the research showed that only 9 % of respondents are heading towards the learning organisation successfully, i.e. 8 % of organisations apply the approach of targeted educational concept, and 1 % of organisations declared their approach to education to be the learning organisation concept. Unfortunately, more than 60 % of respondents are at the very beginning in the sphere of education, as they only restrict their educational activities to compulsory trainings enforced by legal regulations and to unscheduled courses.","[Caganova, Dagmar; Cambal, Milos] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Mat Sci & Technol Trnava, Inst Ind Engn & Management, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Stachova, Katarina; Stacho, Zdenko] Sch Econ & Management Publ Adm Bratislava, Inst Econ & Management, Dept Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Slovak University of Technology Bratislava; University of Presov,"Cagánová, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Mat Sci & Technol Trnava, Inst Ind Engn & Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",dagmar.caganova@stuba.sk; milos.cambal@stuba.sk; katarina.stachova@vsemvs.sk; zdenko.stacho@vsemvs.sk,"Stacho, Zdenko/HDM-6691-2022; Stachová, Katarína/ABE-1117-2020; Stacho, Zdenko/AAO-6036-2021; Cambal, Milos/L-7363-2016; Caganova, Dagmar/D-2946-2017","Stacho, Zdenko/0000-0001-5588-8340; Stachová, Katarína/0000-0003-4761-2509; Stacho, Zdenko/0000-0001-5588-8340; Cambal, Milos/0000-0002-4855-0277; Caganova, Dagmar/0000-0002-6834-6126",,,,,11,3,3,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,10,14,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000002,0

While we find that retail sentiment is positively related with the return volatility of IPOs on the first trading day within the whole sample period, such positive sentiment-volatility relation is the strongest during the 1999-2000 internet bubble period. Furthermore, overoptimism among sentiment investors during the bubble period results in a negative relation between retail demand and long-run post-IPO price performance. This negative relation is robust, economically significant, and can be found when the long-run post-IPO abnormal returns are adjusted by style or adjusted by industry. Overall, there is evidence that the behavior of bullish retail investors can lead to overpricing of U.S. IPO shares and price reversals in the long run. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Measuring the existing level of servicesprovided can help managersmake better decisions for improving customer satisfaction.The purpose of the present study is to (a) measure the level of services provided by the Hellenic Post and (b) evaluate the satisfaction of its customers (citizens). The evaluation was made using an enhanced approach, incorporating both customers and managers in the sample of the study. Moreover, the present study investigated the gap between customer expectations and customer perceptionswith regard tothe level of the services offered by the Hellenic Post.The empirical study was undertakenusing two structured questionnaires; the first was targeted to customers (SERVQUAL modified instrument) and the second to managers of Hellenic Post branches. In total, 406 questionnaires were collected from customers (citizens) and 86 questionnaires from the managers of a correspondingnumber of Hellenic Post branches. Results showed that customers have a negative perception about the services offered by the Hellenic Post (in comparison with their expectations) and that there is a significant difference between the actual perceptions of customers and those of managers.

The empirical analysis finds that both variables exert a significant long-run effect. However, the relation for the real exchange rate has shifted as the effect of each variable has become stronger and a positive trend is present since 1990. The effect of productivity, moreover, is opposite to that predicted by the standard Balassa-Samuelson theory. An explanation of these findings is suggested based on a general-equilibrium model that includes differentiated traded manufactures and homogeneous commodities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, the euro area is not the only economy navigating the risky waters of low inflation. Several other advanced economies have recently experienced below-target inflation as well as outright deflation. In this article, the authors collect data for nine advanced economies and document several facts about the behavior of inflation during the 2002-14 period. First, they show that the relationship between inflation rates and short-term rates displays similar changes across advanced economies with and without central bank programs designed to increase the size of their balance sheets (e.g., large-scale asset purchases). Second, they describe recent indications that headline and core inflation are below target for individual countries. They then discuss various explanations for this trend (global factors, output gaps, and changes in inflation expectations), showing that there is some important heterogeneity across countries. Finally, they show that while output has become even more synchronized across countries since 2008, the cross-country correlation of inflation is no longer higher than the cross-country correlation of output.

Different disciplines highlight diverse aspects of sociability such as trait, the state of being social, the 'third place', the result of sociability (social capital) and others. Consequently, there are various definitions of sociability in scientific literature. Thus, the terms 'sociality' and 'sociability' are used as synonyms showing differences of opinion in the use of these words.

Firms face financial constraints and many studies suggest that firms' investments depend on the availability of internal funds. Financial liberalization plays the role of relaxing financial constraints on firms and thereby reduces the sensitivity of investments to cash flow. In addition to examining whether financial liberalization affects firms' investment behavior, an innovative approach explores the role of real estate as collateral and addresses a potential censoring problem. Using panel data on Tunisian firms, we find that cash flow effects on investment decrease as financial markets are liberalized. In particular, Pulp, Paper and Cardboard industry firms are found to gain most from liberalization. However, possessing real estate is important in a firm's investment behavior but decreases with financial liberalization.

Drawing on the theory of attachment and loneliness, we examine the effect of loneliness on individuals' conspicuous consumption.

Specially, for the single, loneliness has a positive effect on conspicuous consumption; for the non-single, there is no significant effect of loneliness on conspicuous consumption (study 1 and study 2); (2) mate seeking motive mediates the interaction effect of loneliness and romantic relationship status on conspicuous consumption and materialism is ruled out as an alternative interpretation for the interaction effect (study 3); and (3) study 4 tested the moderation effect of different consumption domains (conspicuous versus inconspicuous goods), such that the interaction effect of loneliness and romantic relationship status was replicated for the conspicuous brand sports shoes, but was eliminated for the inconspicuous insoles.","[Guo, Zhaoyang] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; Tsinghua Univ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Tsinghua University,"Guo, ZY (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,47,3,3,2,30,ASIAN BUSINESS ASSOC,CENTRL HONG KONG,"9 FLR, ANTNA TOWER, 148 DES VOEUX RD, CENTRL HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2357-190X,2357-1918,,P CHIN MARK INT CONF,,,2014,,,,,,,7,29,,,,,,23,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359385500001,0

The paper also examines the trend of IC information during the crisis to see whether IC movement is signalled through related IC disclosures. Drawing data from top Malaysian listed companies consisting of 153 firm-year observations over a three-year period (2008-2010), content analyses of annual reports were conducted to examine the trend of hidden values as well as IC disclosures. The results first show a significantly widening gap between market and book values during the financial crisis, with the market values consistently higher than the book values in all three years. Second, the hidden values significantly increased over time, with the size of the hidden values in corporate values showing a similar increasing trend. Third, the findings indicate that the increase in the hidden values resulted in a simultaneous increase in the extent and quality of IC disclosures, particularly the human capital disclosure category. The widening gap between market and book values coupled with the significant increasing trend of hidden IC resources documented in this study draws regulatory attention to device an IC accounting framework for public listed companies in reporting and accounting for IC resources. This study is novel because it presents the first empirical assessment of the trend of hidden values and the differences between market and book values during a recession.","Scicom MSC Berhad, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",,"Haji, AA (通讯作者)，Scicom MSC Berhad, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",fitka7@hotmail.com,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,1,9,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000001,0

We show that: the economic significance of company age is negligible, the higher the debt the greater the efficiency, bigger companies are less efficient, and a medium-level concentration of the market benefits companies. Majority ownership, in contrast, does not lead to higher efficiency, but a combination of majority and minority ownership has a positive disciplinary influence leading to higher efficiency. As to the origins of ownership, it does not seem that foreign-(co-)owned companies imply greater efficiency in old European countries, whereas foreign ownership is a significant driver of efficiency in new EU members through FDI.","[Hanousek, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen; Shamshur, Anastasiya] Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hanousek, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen; Shamshur, Anastasiya] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hanousek, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen] William Davidson Inst, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Hanousek, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen] CEPR, London, England; [Kocenda, Evzen] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Kocenda, Evzen] IOS, Regensburg, Germany; [Shamshur, Anastasiya] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung; University of East Anglia,"Hanousek, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",jan.hanousek@cerge-ei.cz; evzen.kocenda@cerge-ei.cz; a.shamshur@uea.ac.uk,"Kocenda, Evzen/R-9674-2017; Hanousek, Jan/HOC-4951-2023; Shamshur, Anastasiya/H-2919-2014; Hanousek, Jan/H-2879-2014","Kocenda, Evzen/0000-0003-4110-1169; Hanousek, Jan/0009-0006-3997-5931;",,,,,47,1,1,0,11,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Water markets have evolved in this region so agencies could meet this growing demand. In a few instances, water agencies turned to contractual mechanisms such as options to manage supply. As demand continues to grow option markets and other novel approaches to allocating water may become increasingly popular. We utilize experimental economics to analyze the effect of annual options on water markets in the absence of sufficient real-world data for conventional econometric analysis. We find gains from trade are higher when options can be traded. Additionally, gains are more evenly distributed, particularly with a dominant buyer and many sellers.

The existence of contemporary organizations is often associated with the occurrence of conflicts between individuals and between groups. In this paper interpersonal conflicts are studied primarily in the context of the social process theory of conflicts, which sees the conflict as a dynamic process that occurs between individuals and/or between groups who arc in the situation of a mutual interdependence and of a presence of special situational and personal conditions (different interests, goals, etc.). The left hand column technique was used for recording of 68 work-related conflicts. Conflicts were analyzed using the content analysis and the original method that applied three characteristics of conflicts and nine conflict resolution components. Different parametres of work conflicts, of asymmetric conflicts (the relationship between superior and subordinate), of symmetric (equivalent) organizational and non-organizational work/task conflicts were studied. In the area of the characteristics of conflicts the most emotionally negative aspects appeared in symmetric/equivalent organizational conflicts, but the emotional characteristic of conflicts seemed to be less problematic than the characteristic of disagreement in the cognition of conflicts and the characteristic of the interference (the negative impact) on participants' behavior. In the area of the components of the conflict resolution Mutual benefits agreements and Options for mutual gain appeared as the most problematic aspects. The paper offers the original methodology for the analysis of interpersonal work conflicts, brings some assumptions for a future research on work-related conflicts and some ideas for conflict resolution and management of conflicts in the organizational practice.","Univ W Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Jermár, M (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic.",jermar@kpm.zcu.cz,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1371,1382,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300142,0

Assumption, that a certain type of organizational culture provides better performance, is one of the reasons that explain the great interest in it. However, there is still no united consensus between scholars on this relationship. The aim of this paper was set to examine the role of organizational culture in innovative performance of small and medium-sized knowledge-intensive companies in the Baltic States and two hypotheses were proposed: Adhocracy promotes the innovative performance of small and medium-sized IT companies in the Baltic States; and Hierarchy hinders the innovative performance of small and medium-sized IT companies in the Baltic States. The Competing Values Framework was used for diagnosis of organizational culture types and the innovative company indicators made by Latvian Technology Centre for measuring the innovative performance. The study covered 27 IT companies from the Baltic States. The research results reveal that the innovative performance of small and medium-sized Baltic States' IT companies is promoted by Adhocracy, as there was strong statistically significant positive correlation between innovation coefficient and adhocracy. In turn, the hypothesis that hierarchy hinders the companies' innovative performance confirmed partly - there was statistically significant relationship between innovation coefficient and hierarchy. However, hierarchy had stronger statistically significant negative correlation with adhocracy than innovation coefficient.","Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Kairisa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",madara.kairisa@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,220,228,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500021,0

This approach allows for a distinction between well diverse transmission patterns including volatility spillover, interdependence, independence and co-movements, given changes from high to low volatility regimes and vice versa. The results find evidence of different transmission patterns between the GCC and the global markets, with stronger connections with the global equity than with the oil markets. These patterns are also highly sensitive to the regimes of the selected markets which are characterized by turbulence or tranquility. For the first global market (Oil-WTI), the results show evidence of strong interdependence between Oil and each of the Kuwait and Abu Dhabi markets. Additionally, there is spillover from Oil-WTI to Dubai whose economy depends on oil, real estate and tourism. Surprisingly, we find evidence of independence between Oil and each of the Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman markets. For the second global market (the U.S. S&P 500 index), the results support strong interdependence with Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. There is also spillover from the S&P 500 index to Kuwait and Oman. More interestingly, we find spillover from Qatar to the S&P 500 index. For the third global market (MSCI-World), there is interdependence between MSCI and Dubai. We also find evidence of spillover from the MSCI-world to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Finally, we provide results in terms of inference on the regimes of high and low volatility, allowing for the interpretation of the financial shocks and the dates in which they are transmitted from one market to another. Policy implications are also provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Khalifa, Ahmed A.

The main aim of the empirical research was to map the language proficiency as a key part of their managerial competence among students of business and management in the Czech Republic. The main questions addressed in our research were that English is used as the lingua franca on the labour market and in international politics but due to a growing involvement of foreign companies in various regions of Europe, the demand for other European languages in connection with intercultural competence has been increasing on the European labour market. The processes of internationalization and globalization thus unequivocally require multilingualism, and this criterion is ever more important in decisions on HR issues. This trend clearly puts employees who speak several European languages at an advantage. An approach based on statistical testing of hypotheses was used. The respondents were students of the Czech business and management universities. A total of 257 questionnaires (N=257) in hard copy form were collected. The results of this empirical survey can be summarised as follows. The position of English has been stable over the last five years. The study of German ranks second although its position has weakened slightly. The shares of other languages are significantly lower. German thus is, in addition to English, a language the knowledge of which, according to a large segment of the respondents, increases the likelihood of success on the European labour market. The respondents are thus fully aware of the importance of knowledge of two or more foreign languages, especially English and German, as a prerequisite to success on the labour market.","[Konecna, Zdenka] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management, Brno 61200, Czech Republic; [Zinecker, Marek] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology; Brno University of Technology,"Konecná, Z (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",konecna@fbm.vutbr.cz; zinecker@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Zinecker, Marek/AAL-5760-2021",,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,947,957,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300099,0

According to UNWTO (World Tourism Barometer), tourist arrivals grew by 5% during the first half of 2013 compared to the same period of 2012, reaching 500 million and Growth was stronger in emerging economy destinations (+6%) than in advanced economies (+4%), a trend which has marked the sector for many years now The fact that international tourism, grew above expectations confirms that travelling is part of consumer patterns for an increasing number of people in both emerging and advanced economies. Moreover, it becomes evident that Tourism is one of the key pillars of socio-economic development, being a leading contributor to economic growth, exports and jobs. Even in the past there were inferences that Tourism is a major industry (40% of GDP for developing countries and 65% for developed or industrial countries) (Cooper et al. 1998, Gee et al. 1997). Corporate Strategy, seems to include the whole corporate's culture towards to its being competitive in the marketplace while strategic planning makes the firm focus on a high level productivity and profitability by promoting the firm competitive advantage (s) (Thomson et al. 2008). Taking into account the fact that Tourism is a major industry (40% of GDP for developing countries and 65% for developed or industrial countries (Cooper et al., 1998: 125, Gee et al. 1997).

Legal requirement to introduce quality management systems into healthcare institutions notwithstanding, a quality management system is equally important in regard to the provision of cross-border healthcare, which guarantees to the patients from other EU countries that they would receive treatment under clearly defined standards of quality healthcare, ensuring safe and high-quality medical services. For this very reason it has become imperative that exact criteria for the basic standards of medical services and for the needs of medical tourism be determined, as so far they have neither been defined nor harmonised. To compete in foreign markets it is necessary to possess quality certification for both healthcare facilities and business processes, with the overarching goal of ensuring as good and as safe medical services as they are possible. The institution which holds a clear classification and/or accreditation for its facilities and/ or services receives more recognition and has more competitive potential in foreign markets. Considering that the system for assurance and improvement of quality in healthcare represents one of the Croatian accreditation standards, introducing integrated systems for healthcare quality management has recently gained significant importance. The quality management system according to the ISO 9001 standard is employed today worldwide, and certifying the system is a generally accepted way of proving that the product or service meets the requirements of quality. The ISO 9001 standard is a generic standard that defines certain requirements for the quality management system which are applicable to all organizations, regardless of their type and scope, and consequently to healthcare organisations as well. Preparing to enter the demanding market of medical tourism, St. Catherine Specialty Hospital has introduced a quality management system as the first stage on its course to obtaining an international accreditation. St. Catherine Specialty Hospital received its first certification in 2013 for six quality improvement goals (diagnostics, treatment and rehabilitation of diseases and injuries of the locomotor system, magnetic resonance imaging of children and adults, minimally invasive interventions and spine surgery, acute pain treatment, one-day surgery and nursing care) and fourteen quality improvement indicators, the achievement of which was confirmed at the beginning of 2014 in the re-certification procedure which renewed its ISO 9001:2008 standard certification.",,,,nevenka.kovac@svkatarina.hr,,,,,,,6,0,1,0,7,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,670,683,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000050,0

This paper addresses the transportation problem of cross-docking network design where products are transferred from suppliers to customers through cross-docking centers without storing them for a long time. Two-dimensional truck loading constraints are taken into account for different sized products in order to find exact capacity of each truck. This assumption allows decision makers to find idle vehicle capacities and evaluate the capacity utilizations as a cost factor. The problem is formulated using mixed integer programming and solved using simulated annealing (SA) meta-heuristic algorithm which has great potential to solve NP-Hard problems. The proposed algorithm is performed for several randomly generated examples and compared with the optimum solutions. Results show that proposed algorithm demonstrates effective and efficient solutions to reduce the total transportation costs in cross-docking network design. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We find several remarkable conclusions: (1) there is no empirical evidence to suggest a Granger casual relationship between financial market and economic growth whereas Granger causality exists between banking system and economic growth; (2) Vietnam's financial system matters for its economic growth while the impact of Vietnam's economic growth on its financial system is insignificant; (3) the contribution of the shocks in banking system is greater than the contribution of the shocks in financial market to the total shocks in Vietnam's economic growth, implying that Vietnam's economy relies on a bank-based system rather than a market-based system; (4) Vietnam's financial market is mainly affected by its own shocks.","[Le Van Lam; Nguyen Huu Huan] Hochiminh City Univ Econ, Sch Banking, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ho Chi Minh City University Economics,,levanlamtcnh@ueh.edu.vn; huannguyen@ueh.edu.vn,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,5,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,358,371,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200027,0

Our results show that continuous auditing efforts are negatively associated with interim and annual discretionary accruals (DA). Moreover, the results from the positive and negative DA of annual financial reports also support the notion that continuous auditing efforts restrict upward earnings management more than downward earnings management.

The results showed that focusing on the work-life balance related to the necessity to provide some hours of one's spare time in order to finish work issues, the best situation (none of the interviewees works in his spare time and the employees' personal lives are not affected) was found in IT&C sector and R&D sector, followed by banking sector, where half of the interviewees work in their spare time, in order to finish their tasks, then higher-education sector, where the majority claims to be working frequently after finishing teaching, in order to solve work tasks preparing lectures, research or administrative activities, coordinating theses, which affects their personal life, and the advertising sector, with two-thirds of respondents claiming that they work in their spare time, after hours, which affects their personal lives.

Therefore, decisions on fertility must allow cross-fertility with labour market participation and not addressing them separately (Francesconi, 2002; Del Boca 2002; Apps and Rees, 2004; Laroque and Salanie, 2005). Researches on women labour participation, mostly empirical studies, emphasize the negative effect of fertility rates in diminishing the labour supply. Thus, a study with married couples from Bucharest County, Romania was conducted. The main objective was to assess the reproductive behaviour for the married couples. The methodology consists on a Computer Assisted Telephonic Interviews questionnaire, developed by authors. The sample size was of 201 respondents aged 25-39 years. Data was processed on unweight database, using SPSS 19.0. The case-study results show that in the decision to have a child, wage and the overall income are the most important determinants.

And also the voucher provides an incentive for the public knowledge provider to work with SMEs when their tendency might either have been to work with larger firms or to have no industry engagement at all.

D&O insurance is used extensively in top management compensation. Surprisingly, only a handful of firms listed in the US disclose their D&O insurance practices (based on our extensive search of publicly available databases on corporate disclosure). Using a sample of firms from 2004 to 2008, we focus on level of competition, threat of increase in lawsuit, and internal governance to examine the determinants of the disclosure practices. Consistent with the hypothesis, the results show that firms in competitive industries, firms with a high threat of lawsuits, big firms, and firms with weak internal governance are less likely to disclose D&O insurance. We further find that variations in the scope and nature of disclosure are associated with the firms' litigation risk and governance structure.","[Nwaeze, Emeka] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, Dept Accounting, San Antonio, TX USA; [Kalelkar, Rachana] Univ Houston, Sch Business Adm, Dept Accounting, Victoria, TX 77901 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Houston Victoria,"Kalelkar, R (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Sch Business Adm, Dept Accounting, Victoria, TX 77901 USA.",kalelkarr@uhv.edu,,,,,,,61,1,2,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

It treats communities as a collection of systems, each with its own resilience. CARRI has applied its approach to two kinds of communities: civil communities, and institutions of higher education (IHEs). For both civil communities and IHEs, CARRI carried out a pilot program. For each participant, their leadership directed an assessment of the resilience of the component systems to the types of changes most relevant to that community. Each assessment provided suggestions for filling any gaps identified as part of the assessment. The pilot for the seven IHEs followed that for the seven civil communities and was able to take advantage of lessons learned from the first. These two pilot programs led to the following conclusions: CARRI's systems-based approach is both understandable and usable by both types of communities. In practice, it seemed to provide a natural way to look at a community. In general, IHEs were able to make better use of the approach than civil communities. This is due, in part, to the improvements made in the IHE pilot program based on the civil communities' results. However, it also reflects the more hierarchical nature of IHEs, the tighter coupling of systems within an IHE and greater discretion in the use of resources in an IHE. College campuses can be crucial catalysts for enhancing the resilience of civil communities. Leadership is a key, perhaps the key, element in the success of a community resilience initiative.

The evolution of accidents before and after the implementation of the integrated system was analysed and a questionnaire was used to capture the perceptions of the technicians on the risk management system. The analysis of the findings showed that the frequency of accidents increased since 2009 but the severity has been reduced. Several interrelated causes and consequences were analysed and discussed.

The ownership by US Congress members in firms contributing to their election campaigns is higher than in noncontributors. This bias toward contributors depends on the financial incentives of politicians and the relation's value. Firms with a stronger ownership-contribution association receive more government contracts. The financial gains from these contracts are economically large. When politicians divest stocks, firms discontinue contributions to the politicians, lose future contracts, and perform poorly.

In recent years, trade balance of Vietnam is mostly deficit, however the ratio of exports and imports over GDP continuingly increase, due to flexible appliance of monetary policy. The main goals of this paper are to study the effects of monetary policy to the trade balance of Vietnam and measure other macro-economic factors, specifically the effect of monetary policy shock on the trade balance before and after year 2007 since Vietnam joined the WTO. Authors use monthly data collected from IMF, ADB, State Bank of Vietnam from 2003 to 2012 and employing the Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR), we investigate the effects of shocks from monetary policy to the trade balance in Vietnam. Our result suggests that trade balance is negatively affected by shocks of increasing interest rate, money supply and also the effect of curve J with a lag of 2-month. In addition, we find that Vietnam trade balance is strongly affected by the USD/VND exchange rate and the global oil price.","[Tram Thi Xuan Huong; Vo Xuan Vinh; Nguyen Phuc Canh] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ho Chi Minh City University Economics,,txhuong@ueh.edu.vn; vinhvx@ueh.edu.vn; canhnguyen@ueh.edu.vn,"Canh, NGUYEN Phuc/AAG-8627-2019","Canh, NGUYEN Phuc/0000-0001-8467-5010",,,,,7,0,0,0,3,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,659,669,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200048,0

So we can suppose that the increasing role of intellectual capital in modern society leads to the increasing internal company's value when it comes to generating good cash flow and keeping up sustainable growth is not enough to have visible assets. So, the investor on the stock market faces the problem when he or she makes investment decisions because of the reviewed gap between the market value and the internal value of company. The investment decision-making process is based on data from balance sheets as a traditional approach of fundamental analysis which does not consider intellectual capital. Therefore, the fundamental analysis does not respond to the modern demands showing more clearly the results of the companies' actions for making investment decisions. As a result, we need to find or propose new ways for fundamental analysis to keep up in reality. The research objective is to determine the role and the endowment of intellectual capital in creating the internal value of a company as a factor of the fundamental analysis, and also elaborate recommendations for the investment decision-making process based on updated methodology of fundamental analysis. In this research we attempt to modify a traditional approach of the fundamental analysis to increase its meaningfulness by adding a new factor - intellectual capital - and to provide recommendations for investors.

It is the first study to detail the difference in herding behaviour across A and B markets. The results indicate that investors exhibit different levels of herding behaviour, in particular, herding strongly exists in the B-share markets. We also find that across markets herding behaviour is more prevalent at industry-level, is stronger for the largest and smallest stocks, and is stronger for growth stocks relative to value stocks. Herding behaviour is also more pronounced under conditions of declining markets. Over the sample period we are examining, herding behaviour diminishes over time. The results provide some indication to the effectiveness of regulatory reforms in China aimed at improving information efficiency and market integration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Using a proprietary dataset of ESO exercise events we measure the non-marketability ESO discount. We find that the ESO value on the grant date is approximately 45% of a similar plain vanilla Black-Scholes value. The model is aligned with empirical findings of ESOs, gives an exercise boundary of ESOs and can serve as an approximation to the fair value estimation of share-based employee and executive compensation.

It relies on information contained in Stability/Convergence Programme Updates, a model of the relevant stochastic process (for example, that of real GDP) or processes, and a parameter estimate of the sensitivity of the primary budget balance to the output gap for the member state under consideration. A model of the dynamic deficit-debt relationship allows the impact of random output growth to work its way through the fiscal arithmetic in a consistent and traceable way to produce fan charts over a five-year forecast horizon. The initial set of fiscal fan charts included here for Ireland use the indicative public finance projections set out in its 2011 Update. The methodology makes the standard assumption of no fiscal policy response to any change in the budgetary position over the period such as could arise from changes in growth rates. Governments will, however, generally be in a position to adjust fiscal policy towards meeting a specific target, such as the 3 per cent Maastricht Treaty deficit target. A second set of fan charts is included that indicates how the probabilistic range of fiscal outcomes could be affected by a tightening of fiscal policy in 2013-15.","[Dowd, Kevin] Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3HP, England",Durham University,,dave.cronin@centralbank.ie; kevin.dowd@durham.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,14,1,1,1,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Consequently, we apply a structural VAR model to quantify the magnitude, historical timing of these risks, and their dynamic impacts on the permanent and transitory components of the insurance premiums. The results indicate that the enormous amount of speculative funds flowing into China has aggravated insurance premiums as well as helped accelerate market volatilities due to its uncertain nature to the domestic economy and its short-term characteristic of investing. In particular, the speculative shock is shown to be the primary factor responsible for the transitory fluctuation of insurance premiums while the supply shock explains the preponderance of insurance premiums' permanent growth in recent years.

This paper finds that the extent to which fiscal variables affect domestic bond yields in emerging economies depends on the level of global risk aversion. During tranquil times in global markets, fiscal variables do not seem to be a significant determinant of domestic bond yields in emerging economies. However, when market participants are on edge, they pay more attention to country-specific fiscal fundamentals, revealing greater alertness about default risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While a majority mentally segregate the tax component from their net income, others claim ownership of the gross income as a whole and consequently experience a loss when paying taxes. A survey (N = 172) shows that mental segregation is associated with age, income, and number of employees, and is further related to attitudes towards taxes and to self-reported compliance.

The standard least squares method produces biased coefficient estimates when the regressor is persistent and its innovations are correlated with those of the dependent variable. This article proposes a general and convenient method based on the jackknife technique to tackle the estimation problem. The proposed method reduces the bias for both single- and multiple-regressor models and for both short- and long-horizon regressions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulations. An empirical application to equity premium prediction using the dividend yield and the short rate highlights the differences between the results by the standard approach and those by the bias-reduced estimator. The significant predictive variables under the ordinary least squares become insignificant after adjusting for the finite-sample bias. These discrepancies suggest that bias reduction in predictive regressions is important in practical applications.,"[Zhu, Min] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Business, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Zhu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",min.zhu2005@gmail.com,"Zhu, Min/D-2496-2010","Zhu, Min/0000-0002-5602-2319",,,,,34,3,6,1,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Should we make our utmost effort to prevent the arbitrarily large impacts of climate change under deep uncertainty? In order to answer to this question, we propose a new way of investigating the impact of (fat-tailed) uncertainty on optimal climate policy: the curvature of the optimal carbon tax against the uncertainty. We find that the optimal carbon tax increases as the uncertainty about climate sensitivity increases, but it does not accelerate as implied by Weitzman's Dismal Theorem. We find the same result in a wide variety of sensitivity analyses. These results emphasize the importance of balancing the costs of climate change against its benefits, also under deep uncertainty.","[Hwang, In Chang; Reynes, Frederic; Tol, Richard S.

We also predicted that strengthening engagement from the high (versus low) expressed likelihood of a future event would intensify the value of present positive and negative objects (in opposite directions). Both predictions were supported. There was also evidence that this intensification effect from expressed likelihood was independent of the actual probability or valence of the future event.

Previous literature has focused on the diversification discount in corporations. However, in PE funds, diversification might increase returns by ameliorating managerial risk aversion and facilitating knowledge sharing. I examine a sample of 1,505 PE funds and show that industry and geographic diversification can increase PE fund returns. This is likely due to knowledge sharing and learning, not merely risk reduction. Diversification can reduce returns if it spreads staff too thinly across industries or is motivated by risk aversion rather than performance bonuses.","Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Humphery-Jenner, M (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",m.humpheryjenner@unsw.edu.au,"Humphery-Jenner, Mark/A-6357-2010","Humphery-Jenner, Mark/0000-0002-0541-1541",,,,,67,14,21,4,51,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

It is based on secondary analyses of six household travel surveys carried out in cities in West and Central Africa between 1992 and 2003. Vehicle ownership rates are low in these cities and the cost of public transport is a major item of expenditure in household budgets, which limits its use. Walking is therefore the main mode of transport for most urban dwellers. The paper highlights the difficulties and issues linked with trip-making to conduct the major types of out-of-home activities (work and education, household management, and sociability). Our analyses show that the shortcomings of the transport system restrict the ability of urban dwellers, particularly the poor, to travel outside their neighbourhood and play a part in maintaining social inequalities.

With rating and clustering similarities and differences between provinces have been determined and positions related to each other have been produced. In the study, data from 22 variables related to financial market including demographics variables have been used. While principal component analysis has been applied in order to rank the provinces according to financial performances, Cluster Analysis has been applied so as to define provinces which have similar characteristics. According to the results of the study, financial investment tendency rating has been found highest for the 3 provinces, Istanbul, Ankara and Karabuk. Cities having high tendency to financial investments have emerged mostly from among the socio-economically developed provinces. Istanbul and Ankara provinces take part within the top three in the ranking of socio-economic development. However, Karabuk, which has relatively low socio-economic development, take place in third place due to stock investments. On the other hand the provinces such as Gaziantep and Malatya which have higher socio-economic development take place among the provinces having the low tendency to financial investments. Besides, high socio-economic development of Istanbul in parallel with its first rank in terms of tendency to financial investments stresses how important it is a financial centre in its region. The results have provided contribution to the decision-makers in terms of policy-making according to provinces and regions. In addition, according to these results, saving incentive policies could be designed by taking the geographic and cultural characteristics into account in the level of province and region.","[Ozen, Ercan] Usak Unive, Uygulamali Bilimler Yuksekokulu, Bankacilik & Finans Bolumu, TR-64200 Usak, Turkey; [Vurur, Necmiye Serap] Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Afyon, Turkey",Afyon Kocatepe University,"Özen, E (通讯作者)，Usak Unive, Uygulamali Bilimler Yuksekokulu, Bankacilik & Finans Bolumu, TR-64200 Usak, Turkey.",ercan.ozen@usak.edu.tr; bhamarat@comu.edu.tr; serapvurur@aku.edu.tr,"VURUR, NECMIYE SERAP/AAO-9605-2021; Özen, Ercan/A-2697-2019; VURUR, SERAP/AAJ-6064-2021; hamarat, bahattin/JWG-2655-2024","VURUR, NECMIYE SERAP/0000-0003-4339-6474;",,,,,30,0,0,1,6,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Using this natural experiment and data from energy firms, we find that derivatives lead to higher valuations, investments, and leverage.

Compared to promotion-oriented people, prevention-oriented people seek to avoid losses rather than to secure gains. Employing different negotiation scenarios, three lab experiments tested the prediction that prevention-oriented buyers would thus display higher negotiation aversion than promotion-oriented buyers. Results showed that prevention-oriented people in the role of a potential buyer were willing to accept lower monetary compensation to refrain from entering the negotiation and were more likely to exit the negotiation when such an opportunity was presented to them. We discuss these findings and their contribution to our understanding of how regulatory focus influences consumers' economic decisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that the optimal form of licensing contract depends on the relative marginal costs of the two firms. If the marginal cost of the high-quality firm is relatively high (low), fixed-fee licensing is superior (inferior) to royalty licensing from the viewpoint of the licensor. Surprisingly, consumers are worse off if the quality difference between the two firms is small.

This is contrasted with a secular regime where government is contracted out to a secular ruler, and hence the church loses the possibility of observing costs and creates for itself a hidden-information agency problem. The church is free to choose between regimes-a make-or-buy choice-and we look for the range of environmental parameters that are most conducive to the superiority of theocracy and therefore to its occurrence and persistence, despite its disabilities. Numerical solution of the model indicates that the optimal environment for a theocracy is one in which the bad (high-cost) state is disastrously bad but the probability of its occurrence is not very high. Quantitative evidence on the rise of ancient Israelite theocracy and the current surge of Islamic theocratic fundamentalism provides surprisingly strong support for this prediction. Lastly, supportive evidence is suggested by two rare instances of a theocracy's peaceful demise.","Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Ferrero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice, Via Cavour 84, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy.",ferrerom@sp.unipmn.it,,,,,,,18,5,6,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2013,156.0,3-4,,,,,723,750,,10.1007/s11127-012-9924-1,0.0,,,28,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,184NK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321897600016,0

I discuss what principles should lie behind CARs if we could design these from scratch. I argue that there should be a minimum intervention point triggering official action to depose management and shareholders, and then move to resolution, with an increasingly penal ladder of sanctions as equity capital falls towards this point.

In addition, petroleum companies with more extensive pre-disaster environmental disclosures experienced a less negative reaction.

To do so, this paper utilizes the 2008 financial crisis and its impact on Japanese markets as a natural experiment. Because the Japanese banking sector remained functional while the corporate bond markets were paralyzed, the data from Japan during this period provide us with an ideal environment to examine this hypothesis. I specifically examined whether firms with large holdings of corporate bonds maturing in FY2008 were financially constrained, by comparing the changes in their capital investment expenditures and borrowing conditions with those of bank-dependent firms. The main empirical results indicate that (1) firms with large holdings of corporate bonds maturing in FY2008 did not reduce investment expenditures; (2) instead, they exhibited higher increments in bank loans; and (3) firms that maintained relatively close bank-firm relationships had greater access to bank loans with low borrowing costs. These findings demonstrate that Japanese firms were able to substitute bank loans for public debt during the crisis and imply that the Japanese banking sector worked efficiently to replace public debt markets during the crisis.

Moreover ensuring rational economic behaviour and an efficient and competitive market outcome does not require general access to information at a very detailed level or with a high degree of immediacy.

Both have their origins in Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986). This paper uses the theory of estimating functions (EF) as a semi-parametric method for estimating the parameters of this type of model. As an example, we consider the class of ACD models with errors from the standard Weibull distribution to develop an estimation procedure. This method could equally be applied to GARCH models. Using a simulation study, it is shown that the EF approach is easier to use in practice than the maximum likelihood (ML) or quasi maximum likelihood (QML) methods. The statistical properties of the corresponding optimal estimates are investigated and it is shown that the estimates using both the EF and QML methods are comparable. However, the EF estimates are easier to evaluate than the ML and QML methods. Nevertheless, ML based estimates are superior and perform better when the true distribution is known, when this is not so EF estimates are a powerful tool. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Since there are various limitations in the Black-Scholes pricing formula, we propose a new method to obtain an explicit self-financing trading strategy expression for replications of claims in a general model. The main advantage of our method is that we propose using an orthogonal expansion method to derive a closed-form expression for the self-financing strategy that is associated with some general underlying asset processes. As a consequence, a replication strategy is obtained for a European option. Converse to the traditional Black-Scholes theory, we derive a pricing formula for a European option from the proposed replication strategy that is quite different from the Black-Scholes pricing formula. We provide an implementation procedure and both numerical and empirical examples to show how the proposed trading strategy works in practice and then compare with a replication strategy based on the Black-Scholes theory.

One process by which this might be brought about is if large companies based in the core of the economy buy up and remove small dynamic enterprises from peripheral regions, thereby suppressing development outside the core. This hypothesis is investigated by analysing the very large UK administrative firm-level Business Structure Database. Contrary to the experience of big firms, more productive small businesses are more subject to takeover-although this effect is weaker if they are located in peripheral regions. Takeovers also increase the chances of a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) closing, but the exit consequence is greater for the core region. Takeovers raise productivity after acquisition in all regions but by less for the most productive SMEs. Ignoring any productivity gains to acquiring firms, the positive impact in the core region during the years considered is slightly larger than in the periphery, principally because takeovers are more common in the core. As this impact is a contributor to regional divergence, policy should aim to improve the operation of the market for SMEs in the periphery.","[Foreman-Peck, James; Nicholls, Tom] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Foreman-Peck, J (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",Foreman-PeckJ@cardiff.ac.uk,,"foreman-peck, james/0000-0001-9826-5725",,,,,73,5,6,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper examines the impact of these changes on drug safety using adverse drug reaction data for FDA-approved drugs in 1990 to 2004. Results show two different effects. First, drugs having longer U.S. launch lags (more foreign market experience) have fewer post approval drug risks compared to drugs with shorter launch lags. This result implies that foreign market experience prior to U.S. entry provides information to help alleviate drug-related risks for U.S. patients. Second, drugs that are first launched in the U.S. have fewer serious drug reactions compared to those that were first launched abroad. This result is surprising, and may suggest that first U.S. drug launch signals information about unobserved application quality, which translates into lower post approval drug risks.","Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Tulane University,"Olson, MK (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",molson3@tulane.edu,,,,,,,30,9,11,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We estimate changes in the dispersion of the entire conditional distribution of body mass index (BMI) associated with changes in fast food prices for adults using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 in cross-sectional and longitudinal quantile regression models. We find that the ordinary least squares estimate for men underestimates the negative relationship of fast food prices with BMI at the 50th and upper quantiles in cross-sectional models although the statistical significance disappears in the longitudinal individual fixed effects quantile regression. Among subpopulations, we find that a 10% increase in the price of fast food is associated with 0.9% and 0.7% lower BMI for low-income women and women with any children, respectively, at the 90th quantile in a longitudinal individual fixed effects model. Our results imply that fiscal pricing policies such as fast food taxes might have a greater impact on the weight outcomes of low-income women or women with children in the upper tail of the conditional BMI distribution (JEL I00, I19).","[Han, Euna] Gachon Univ, Coll Pharm, Inchon 406799, South Korea; [Powell, Lisa M.] Univ Illinois, Inst Hlth Res & Policy, Chicago, IL 60608 USA",Gachon University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Han, EN (通讯作者)，Gachon Univ, Coll Pharm, Inchon 406799, South Korea.",eahan@gachon.ac.kr; powelll@uic.edu,,"Han, Euna/0000-0003-2656-7059",,,,,40,8,8,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

The framework is in the form of seven principles, which collectively articulate the entire range of factors that affect choice, including all aspects of individual behavior and of the social contextthe communitiesthe actor is a member of. Traditional economic analysis is shown to be a special case of homo communitatis analysis in which key variables are omitted. Using the principles, we show that experimental results such as loss aversion, framing effects, mental accounting, and judgment biases are not irrational and that the apparent irrationality is in every case an illusion arising from incomplete specification and control of independent variables elucidated in the principles. Several implications for future work are discussed, including high-fidelity models of socioeconomic systems, significantly more powerful and detailed economics simulations, and adoption of significantly different approach to design of economic experiments, one that takes into account all the variables involved in human choice.","[Jeffrey, H.

While arguably more efficient than open access, private property often comes at a distributional cost (Weitzman, M. (1974), 'Free access vs private ownership as alternative systems for managing common property', Journal of Economic Theory 8(2): 225-234) as traditional users of the resource lose income and employment in the process. The present paper demonstrates that, in the case of renewable resources, traditional users may gain from privatization even if they are denied ownership of the resource. Indeed, a private owner maximizing profits tends to preserve the resource, which results in long-term increases in employment. We derive the conditions under which these long-term gains more than compensate traditional users for the short-run fall in labor demand and resource rents.","[Baland, Jean-Marie] Univ Namur, CRED, Namur, Belgium; [Bjorvatn, Kjetil] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",University of Namur; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Baland, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, CRED, Namur, Belgium.",jean-marie.baland@fundp.ac.be; Kjetil.Bjorvatn@nhh.no,,"baland, jean marie/0000-0002-7985-2518",,,,,13,10,11,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Although we can find some very refined definitions of the concept, we also find a wide range of empirical phenomena being described as path-dependent. We argue that more detailed accounts of the positive feedback mechanisms that form paths can take path dependence beyond this state of being overdetermined, but under-specified. Reviewing three well-described cases of path-dependent dynamics in technology markets, regional clustering, and organizations, we define a core set of positive feedback mechanisms that constitute path dependence at different analysis levels and clarify the relationship between positive feedback and increasing returns. We show that path-dependent processes, that is, processes driven by positive feedback that veer toward rigidity or lock-in, can be (but do not have to be) found under many labels, including structural inertia, coevolution, or institutional persistence. We conclude that a precise definition of path dependence does not need to be at odds with the concept's widespread use in understanding organizational and industrial development processes.","[Dobusch, Leonhard; Schuessler, Elke] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Management, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Schüssler, E (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Inst Management, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",leonhard.dobusch@fu-berlin.de; elke.schuessler@fu-berlin.de,"Dobusch, Leonhard/J-6573-2019","Dobusch, Leonhard/0000-0002-5448-4683; Schuessler, Elke/0000-0002-7505-4148",,,,,124,75,80,8,127,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

I found that the likelihood of cancellation of the TPP for missing documentation was higher for those who were current on their mortgage payments, compared to those 30 days delinquent, prior to entering the plan both types of homeowners entered the program because they were in danger of imminent default. This finding, which is consistent with servicers steering homeowners with low credit risk away from HAMP to their own (proprietary) modifications, is more likely for loans owned or guaranteed by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) than non-GSE loans-the GSE loans have relatively more homeowners with low credit risks. The outcome, not widespread across servicers, is possibly related to the lack of standardization across servicers in identifying borrowers in danger of imminent default. Missing documentation is also associated with severely delinquent homeowners who had less incentive or were unable to submit complete documentation. This cohort of borrowers could benefit from financial education and Treasury's proposal that servicers provide a single point of contact for borrowers would help reduce the problem of missing documentation.

Decomposing C-efficiency for EU members into a policy gap (in turn divided into effects of rate differentiation and exemption) and a compliance gap (reflecting imperfect implementation) suggests that the former are in almost all cases far larger than the latter, with rate differentiation and exemptions playing roles that differ quite widely across countries.","[Keen, Michael] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Keen, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mkeen@imf.org,,,,,,,25,35,37,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

To investigate this question I use economics to analyze Gypsy law. Gypsy law leverages superstition to enforce desirable conduct in Gypsy societies where government is unavailable and simple ostracism is ineffective. According to Gypsy law, unguarded contact with the lower half of the human body is ritually polluting, ritual defilement is physically contagious, and non-Gypsies are in an extreme state of such defilement. These superstitions repair holes in simple ostracism among Gypsies, enabling them to secure social cooperation without government.

Data were collected in Canada at the height of the recession as part of a larger international investigation on the economic downturn and psychological health. Results showed the FTS is unidimensional and highly reliable. The FTS' validity was supported by showing its relations with (1) psychological health outcomes, financial situation measures, and individual differences measures, all in the expected directions. The FTS also showed incremental validity by accounting for variance in psychological health outcomes above-and-beyond that of either the financial situation measures or individual differences measures.

Considering that in the last decade there has been a growing desire among higher education graduates to study abroad after their mobility period and showed the willingness to engage in the labor market in other european countries, we think that the proposed research theme fully justify its relevance, in terms of the need to create medium and long term strategies in order to ensure compliance with the next european regulations framework and a set of elements that have the capacity to regain the qualified romanian human resources employed abroad. Without a european workforce that is able to respond promptly to training tasks throughout life, Romania and after that Europe will not gain the skills needed to achieve an competitive advantage among other world economies. In this respect, we think that the present theme is sufficiently anchored in the realities of our contemporary society on the one hand and on the other hand requires to identify the concrete measures that could be put in place in order to improve the issues presented.","[Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai; Stoika, Radu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paraschiv, DM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",dorel.paraschiv@ase.ro,"Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/O-9071-2016","Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/0000-0002-4559-3466",,,,,8,0,0,0,12,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2013,15.0,34,,,,,532,543,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,156XV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319858100017,0

The analysis uses difference-in-difference matching techniques and controls for spillover effects by excluding households from the control group if members departed or joined for reasons related to prime-age mortality. The latter is required because per-adult equivalent incomes of non-afflicted households may be indirectly affected, e.g., by hosting orphans. We find evidence of negative spillover effects on non-afflicted households. However, the death of a prime-age member has no significant short-run effect on per-adult equivalent income of afflicted households. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These will be higher the higher the inflation, and the more levered the firm. The behavior of abnormal returns of US stocks on dividend-announcement days from 1955 to 2007 supports these predictions.

The value of reputation, however, depends on economic fundamentals that vary over the business cycle. In a model of ratings incorporating endogenous reputation and a market environment that varies, we find that ratings quality is countercyclical. Specifically, a CRA is more likely to issue less-accurate ratings when fee-income is high, competition in the labor market for analysts is tough, and securities' default probabilities are low. Persistence in economic conditions can diminish our results, while mean reversion exacerbates them. The presence of naive investors reduces overall quality, but quality remains countercyclical. Finally, we demonstrate that competition among CRAs yields similar results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To unravel the ambiguity in findings reported in the literature, the main objective of this paper is to obtain an accurate assessment of how weather forecasts trigger changes in Flemish activity-travel behavior. To this end, data were collected by means of a stated adaptation experiment, which was administered both on the Internet and via traditional paper- and-pencil questionnaires. To address the main research question of this paper, two statistical techniques were adopted. The first technique is the computation of Pearson chi-square independence tests. The second approach is the estimation of a GEE-MNL-model. The results from both techniques underscore the dual role of weather forecasts on changes in activity-travel behavior. On the one hand, the results clearly illustrate the significant effect of forecasted weather; the likelihood of changes in activity-travel behavior significantly depends on the weather forecasted. On the other hand, different methods of acquiring weather information (exposure, media source, or perceived reliability) do not impact the probability of behavioral adaptations. This duality may be partially attributable to the discrepancy that exists between weather forecasts and true traffic and roadway conditions. Therefore, the implementation of a road weather information system that is directly linked to the weather forecasts is recommended. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The study is carried out through a combination of secondary and survey-based data. We conclude that the neoliberal agenda of uncontrolled, outward-looking growth has not resulted in significant reduction of poverty or malnourishment in rural areas. Furthermore, while land ownership is officially used as a proxy for wealth distribution, class position appears a better predictor of poverty status in the rural areas than landownership per se. At the policy level, there is a need to revive the agrarian economy and create new non-agricultural assets, and the primary focus in the state must shift to the distribution of created assets rather than a single-minded focus on growth.","Azim Premji Fdn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",,"Dixit, A (通讯作者)，Azim Premji Fdn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",anidixit@gmail.com,,,,,,,54,2,2,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In this paper, a new method for quantifying public transit performance, the Transit Opportunity Index (TOI), is presented. This measure accounts for both transit accessibility (the level of access to the transit system) and transit connectivity (the system's provision of services between origins and destinations) by combining measures of spatial coverage, temporal coverage, and trip coverage. Spatial and temporal coverage measures are calculated using an origin-destination (O-D) representation of the transit network and then combined to create a transit accessibility score for each O-D pair. Transit accessibility is weighted by a binary connectivity parameter and a connectivity decay factor. The connectivity decay factor is derived from a travel time-based logistic function to reflect the decreasing connectivity with increasing travel time. The binary connectivity parameter and the connectivity decay factor are used to account for trip coverage, or transit connectivity. The Transit Opportunity Index (TOI) is then applied to the bus network of the city of New Haven, Connecticut. The results of this case study suggest that the TOI is a more complete and practical measure of public transit service performance than previously established measures. This method also has the potential to identify transfer zones for public transit trips between O-D pairs without direct connections. However, the TOI is most powerful when used in conjunction with a public transit demand measure to identify underserved areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We then derive sufficient conditions for the existence of the optimal reinsurance treaties in a wide class of reinsurance policies and under a general reinsurance premium principle. These conditions enable one to design optimal reinsurance contracts in different forms and under different premium principles.

In the present study, we propose a method to implement no-arbitrage constraints in estimating the implied and local volatility surfaces extracted from data on option prices. With the aid of multiple local bandwidths, we increase the functional flexibility of estimators and provide a simple method by which to construct no-arbitrage volatility surfaces, such that the ready-in-computation advantage of the derivatives in local quadratic smoothing is preserved. To show the effectiveness of the arbitrage-free models, we perform a comprehensive empirical study on the performance of the competing models using the KOSPI 200 index options from January 2001 through December 2010. Using experiments, we examine the performance of the models based on three measures: in-sample pricing, out-of-sample pricing, and hedging errors. We find that implied and local volatility modeling under arbitrage-free conditions show better performance in terms of estimation, pricing, and hedging near the out-of-the-money with short maturities. From the range depicted in the findings, we often observe clear differences between the models with and without no-arbitrage conditions imposed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We show that firms in the larger region in terms of demand invest more in R&D (i.e.: they are bigger in size and have lower marginal costs) than firms in the smaller region, since the former exploit larger economies of scale in production to pay for the costs of R&D. As a result, when the return on R&D is high, the larger region does not employ disproportionately more labor nor attracts a disproportionately larger share of firms in the IRS in relation to share of demand it hosts, i.e.: negative home market effects (HMEs) in employment and in the number of firms. When this occurs, only partial agglomeration of the IRS in the larger region is sustainable in equilibrium. Even so, the larger region always runs trade surplus in the IRS, i.e.: HME in trade patterns. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, t-and F-statistics are less likely to detect whether the risk premiums are significantly different from zero.

These findings contradict the common economic assumption that people maximize their own payoffs. Here we take the approach that human altruism is shaped by a set of cognitive models for distinct types of relationships. Specifically, we apply relational models theory which distinguishes between communal relationships based on need, authority relationships based on power, and trade relationships based on reciprocity. We test whether relational models theory can explain altruism in the dictator game, a standard method for observing altruism. For each relational model, we manipulate its key variable (need, power, or reciprocity) by varying hypothetical descriptions of the dictator game, while holding constant real monetary incentives. In the communal scenario participants transfer more money to recipients with greater need for the resource (Experiment 1), in the authority scenario participants transfer more money to recipients who were higher status (Experiment 2), and in the exchange scenario, participants transfer more money to recipients who previously delivered goods to the dictator. In sum, we find that relationships, even when hypothetical, strongly affect altruistic behavior modal dictator contributions range from 0% to 100% - and relational models theory correctly predicts these effects.

In the last 15-20 years, academics and practitioners were oriented towards increasing the speed, cost reduction on supply chain material's flow, oriented towards 3RP (3 Resource Planning) logistics solutions and management solutions such as outsourcing or collaborative management. In terms of information flow, there has been a real revolution with the rise of the Internet and information technology standards introduced by the VICS (Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Standards), CSCMP (Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals), SCC (Supply Chain Council) si ECR Europe (Efficient Consumer Respons). The objective of this paper is to identify new ways of working together on supply chain financial flows. Methods used are the documentation in the literature and the practices of transnational companies under recession. Results refer to the identification of new solutions such as reverse factoring. A comparative analysis regarding the european and national regulations gets us to the conclusion that Romania is still tributary to traditional commercial credit. We propose that the Collaborative management, as a modus vivendi in a globalized and super computerized world, must be included within all Romanian organizations life, within the Supply Chain, but also those which are 3PL (Third Part Logistics) and 4PL (Four Part Logistics) organizations, where not only information services are included, but also financial services (banks and specialized financial institutions).","Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Romania",Valahia University of Targoviste,"Popa, V (通讯作者)，Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Romania.",virgilp51@yahoo.com,"Rosa, Raquel/ACY-6683-2022",,,,,,25,26,31,1,93,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2013,15.0,33,,,,,140,153,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,087FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314746900011,0

Interestingly, the mathematics score was more responsive to this education reform than other subjects. We also find that textbooks, instructional training of teachers and new classroom constructions particularly contributed to these outcomes.

Literature on the issue of public debt considers it sustainable if the growth of debt is not greater than growth of GDP. Debt sustainability in the economy of Pakistan is tested by estimating fiscal reaction function where a positive relationship is found between surplus-to-GDP ratio and lag debt-to-GDP ratio. The small coefficient of debt-to-GDP indicates an existence of sustainability in its weak form. Afterwards, extended fiscal reaction function is estimated and results show that the value of coefficient of lag surplus-to-GDP ratio is positive and marginally significant which confirms the role of past surpluses in future. Debt dynamics is also analyzed. To analyze the effects of expenditure and revenue adjustment to debt, revenue and expenditure reaction functions are estimated and results are in support to inter temporal budget constraint as government has its role in fiscal adjustments by working on both the aspects i. e. revenue and expenditure. The dynamic analysis of affects of government spending and revenue shocks on debt-to-GDP ratio and other macro-economic variables through Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model is also the part of this study for period 1971-2008 and results indicate that consumption and output reacts negatively to the innovations in government spending refers to the similarity with Ricardian behavior. Lastly, the long run relationship between surplus-to-GDP ratio and debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated through Johansen co integration to confirm sustainability and results suggest the existence of long run association among the two series.

These obstacles manifest themselves in low rates of female labor participation, entrepreneurship, and ownership. Recent research suggests a connection between international trade and female labor participation. In this article, the authors focus on the relationship between international trade and gender in the MENA countries. They first analyze female labor as a production factor and then focus on female entrepreneurship and firm ownership. The authors use country- and industry-level data to identify countries and industries characterized by a comparative advantage in female labor. They find evidence suggesting a strong link between a country's specialization and its measures of female labor participation consistent with theories of brain-based technological bias and factor endowments trade theories. Using firm-level data, the authors then study whether trade empowers female entrepreneurs in country/industry pairs that exhibit comparative advantage. They conclude that the evidence supports the view that exposure to trade disproportionately affects firms in country/industry pairs with a comparative advantage in female labor-both in terms of female employment and female entrepreneurship and ownership-for the MENA countries and the period they study.

If large organizations can have in their Information Technology (IT) departments systems and network security specialists, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) typically can't; they have only some computers science broadband IT collaborators that respond by the maintenance of the IT resources, and, in some cases, accumulate with some software development. We make of this view the start point of our research, allying the growing need of securing the IT resources and the information sources which are becoming more and more valuable for every single organization. For SMEs the solution for implement security is, many times, an outsourcing task. The problem is that implementing security is an exercise that overflows the common IT domain, but it starts by fully understanding the organization culture, policies and procedures. This knowledge is something that collaborators learn day by day and not something that we can put on paper easily and tell some outsourced specialists to secure. Even if that could be done, the daily maintenance of the security would be a very hard task. This paper makes considerations about security on SMEs reality and presents a framework that permit a high level approach for implement security, more focused on the organization vision of what we want to do than on a technical vision of how to implement it. The framework hard core is one abstraction layer focused on the organizations perspective and a translator layer of them into technical rules capable of been applied on the IT resources, like servers, computers and network equipments.","[Cunha, Carlos Rompante; Morais, Elisabete Paulo; Gomes, Joao Pedro] Polytech Inst Braganca EsACT, Mirandela, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico de Braganca,,crc@ipb.pt; beta@ipb.pt; jpgomes@ipb.pt,"cunha, carlos/AAA-5734-2020; Cunha, Carlos Rompante/H-2678-2014; Paulo Morais, Elisabete/W-1757-2017","Cunha, Carlos Rompante/0000-0003-3085-1562; Gomes, Joao/0000-0001-9308-0027; Paulo Morais, Elisabete/0000-0002-1923-2341",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,888,892,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100094,0

We use quarterly data from 2001 until 2012. The standard flexible-price monetary model is extended to allow for differences in the relative prices of nontradeables. This correction relaxes the assumption about the law of one price - it need not hold for nontradable goods and allows for the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Empirical analysis is divided into two steps. First, using panel cointegration techniques we find evidence of cointegration between the nominal exchange rate and fundamentals implied by the monetary exchange rate model. The signs of estimated long-term coefficients for fundamentals are in line with those implied by the model. Second, the error correction model is used to explore causality. The null hypothesis that the exchange rate fails to Granger-cause fundamentals is rejected for the relative price of nontradables. In addition, the null hypothesis on a lack of reverse causality between relative money and exchange rate is rejected as well. These findings lend support to the monetary model for the Central European countries.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Papiez, Monika; Smiech, Slawomir] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl; papiezm@uek.krakow.pl; smiechs@uek.krakow.pl,"Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018; Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018; Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811",,,,,15,5,5,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,289,298,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100030,0

The main objective is to examine spatial interactions between regions by means of a non-homogeneous Markov model with transition probabilities conditioned by variables reflecting region's position in its neighbourhood. The attention focuses on disparities of GDP per capita related to European average to include differences in regional economies value and their levels of well-being. Data referring to GDP per capita on NUTS3 in 2000 - 2010 are taken from Eurostat regional database and national statistic offices. Analysis starts with studying cross-sectional distribution of regional GDP per capita by means of parametric and non-parametric estimation. Regional spatial effects are measured by Moran spatial statistics, using wage matrices of k-nearest neighbours and maximal distance. Several Markov models are estimated to examine dynamics of GDP and identify patterns of income distribution evolution and to explain how neighbourhood affects region's current and future position.","[Decewicz, Anna] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,,adecew@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,299,309,,,,,,11,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100031,0

These conditions imply reduced monitoring and lower penalties for initiating inefficient mergers. Therefore, merger waves may foster agency-driven behavior, which, along with managerial herding, could lead to worse mergers. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the average long-term performance of acquisitions initiated during merger waves is significantly worse. We also find that corporate governance of in-wave acquirers is weaker, suggesting that agency problems may be present in merger wave acquisitions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Fuzzy logic becomes more and more important in modern science. It is widely used: from data analysis and forecasting to complex control systems. In this article we consider clustering based on fuzzy logic, named Fuzzy Clustering. Clustering involves the task of dividing data points into homogeneous classes or clusters so that items in the same class are as similar as possible and items in different classes are as dissimilar as possible. (Rezankov, 2013). In hard clustering, data is divided into crisp clusters, where each data point belongs to exactly one cluster. In fuzzy clustering, the data points can belong to more than one cluster, and associated with each of the points are membership grades which indicate the degree to which the data points belong to the different clusters. There are many methods of Fuzzy Clustering nowadays. In our work we review the Fuzzy c - means clustering method in MATLAB.","[Elena, Makhalova] Univ Econ, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,makhalova007@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,6,6,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,905,914,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100089,0

We analyse levels of MDG indicators and progress towards achieving the MDGs between 1990 and 2008 of fragile and non-fragile countries. We focus particularly on the widely used World Bank approach to define fragility, but also compare it with other definitions. We show that fragile countries are, indeed, performing worse in terms of achievement levels of MDG indicators. However, progress in these measures is, on average, not slower in fragile states using most definitions of fragility, and highly heterogeneous among the both fragile and non-fragile countries; only if fragility is defined very narrowly do we see lower progress towards the MDGs. As a result, we suggest that current definitions of fragility are not useful aggregations to predict, monitor and explain development progress using MDG indicators.","[Harttgen, Kenneth] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Human Social & Polit Sci, Nadel, Switzerland; [Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth Dev & Transi, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Klasen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Pl Gottingen Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",sklasen@uni-goettingen.de,,"Harttgen, Kenneth/0000-0002-8499-5281",,,,,49,13,15,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The experiment consists of two stages. In the first stage, paired subjects play a standard public-good game; in the second, each of them evaluates his or her partner's contribution in the first stage and sends a free-form written message to him or her. The experimental results show that the mere presence of an opportunity to praise or blame is not enough to promote cooperation. However, once subjects actually experience being blamed, they contribute significantly more in the following round. When disapproval is expressed in the subject's own words, unlike in previous studies, social sanctions were found to have a stronger impact on cooperation. The experience of being praised, in contrast, does not have such an effect. These results suggest that subjects may be more sensitive to the disutility of being blamed than to the utility of being praised.","[Kumakawa, Takehisa] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Kumakawa, Takehisa] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan",Osaka University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"Kumakawa, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan.",kumakawa@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,35,1,4,0,16,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The paper is focused on the usage of a general approach UML (Unified Modelling Language) and an innovative approach BORM-II (Business Object Relation Modelling, second generation) as communication standards within research projects. The first part of this paper describes the framework, laying out the main aspects of both notations, metamodel and theoretical background as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The paper analyses practical examples from agriculture, rural and organization modelling domains. These innovation processes in both approaches are applied on the same business process description and evaluates the impact on researchers and users of research. The main part is focused on the transformation model to model based on BORM-II. The transformation is in line with UML and SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules) standards from OMG (Object Management Group). My predecessor worked on model transformation and published Splichal problem of transformation BORM to UML. This work follows Petr Splichal's work and goes further. This transformation will be composed into a modelling tool and will be based on approach HOT (High Order Trasformation). The objective of this research is to achieve documentation output like SBVR, and bridge the gap between business people (users) and designers (researchers) of information systems (IS). The paper concludes that the gap between IS designers (software engineers) and domain experts can be bridged by automated transformation of previously mentioned models. The main goal is to achieve a documentation output similar to SBVR, and ICT Accessibility for business people.","[Merunka, Vojtech; Milena, Sandra; Arvilla, Choles; Plas, Martin; Tuma, Jakub] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Informat Engn 1Dept, FEM, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Merunka, V (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Informat Engn 1Dept, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",merunka@pef.czu.cz; choles_arvilla@pef.czu.cz; plasm@pef.czu.cz; jtuma@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,155,163,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300015,0

We find that while macroeconomic shocks have been the main real oil price upward driver since mid-1980s, financial shocks have sizably contributed since early 2000s as well, and at a much larger extent since mid-2000s. Even though financial shocks contribute 44% out of the 65% real oil price increase over the period 2004-2010, the third oil price shock is a macro-finance episode: macroeconomic shocks actually largely account for the 2007-2008 oil price swing. While we then find support to the demand side view of real oil price determination, we however also find a much larger role for financial shocks than previously noted in the literature.

Since, both equity and debt contracts be present in the financial market, Islamic financial institutions expose to the same issues as discussed in the financial intermediation theory. Therefore, in contractual agreement additional monitoring, supervision and alignment of incentives are required to minimize transaction costs and asymmetrical information.

However, cooperatives like their business cousins in the public corporations have been plagued with governance issues (Shaw, 2006). This has prompted studies to isolate the probable causes of their predicament. The issue of corporate governance of cooperatives has begun to become mainstream in research and conventional wisdom dictates that governance procedures and processes that abound in the corporate world can prudently be applicable in the governance of cooperatives (Cornforth; 2004). In a cooperative the Board of Directors plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the collective interest of the members (Jussila, Goel, & Tuominen, 2012). Board of Directors need to demonstrate adequate and effective monitoring of organizations they are helming. This paper examines how the board of directors can act as a custodian against financial fiasco in cooperatives organizations. Our study focuses on the association of size of Board of Directors of cooperatives and the frequency of board meetings with performance. Outcomes from the study indicated both the size of the board and the frequency of board meetings has no relationships with performance of cooperatives organizations in Malaysia. The results suggest that the board of directors may no longer be effective in managing the cooperatives towards achieving their members' objectives. Various literatures supported this finding. This result lends the conclusion that governance of cooperatives is in dire need of revision to increase its effectiveness and eventually rightly positioning cooperatives as a bona fide catalyst of national development as well protect the interest of the members.","[Othman, Rohana; Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul; Arif, Siti Maznah Mohd; Choo, Huang Ching; Ismail, Norashikin] Univ Telcnol MARA, Accounting Res Inst, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Othman, Rohana; Embi, Roslani; Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul; Arif, Siti Maznah Mohd; Choo, Huang Ching; Ismail, Norashikin] Univ Telcnol MARA, Fac Accountancy, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Othman, R (通讯作者)，Univ Telcnol MARA, Accounting Res Inst, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",rohana799@salam.uitm.edu.my; roslani@salam.uitm.edu.my; nooraslinda@salam.uitm.edu.my; maznah542@salam.uitm.edu.my; Ching599@salam.uitm.edu.my; shikin673@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Othman, Rohana/B-7340-2016; Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul/S-9876-2017; Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul/ABG-6280-2020; Ismail, Norashikin/AAP-1811-2021","Othman, Rohana/0000-0002-4223-1435; Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul/0000-0001-7369-5091; Ismail, Norashikin/0000-0002-1889-7800",Accounting Research Institute; Ministry of Education Malaysia,"Accounting Research Institute; Ministry of Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)",We would like to thank Accounting Research Institute and Ministry of Education Malaysia for the grants to finance this research.,,51,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1431,+,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500139,0

We chose indicators in relation to the rural development and to the rural policy goals from economical, social, demographic, infrastructural and geographical areas. Subsequently they were utilized to group the municipalities by hierarchical cluster analysis using Euclidian distances and Ward method of clusterization. The villages were ranked according to their development state into three groups. The impact of subsidies on the development level was assessed by logit model. It was proved that obtained subsidies lower the odds that the village will belong to the group of less developed municipalities against the odds that it will fall into the category of the most developed.

This research will try to demonstrate that implementation of the quality strategic approach model that we propose, is able to lead to: a) Allowing more varied learning options for students and adapting more strong to their needs; b) Allowing a higher level of flexibility to universities to changes that occur at the social level; c) Providing opportunities for social mobility, more appropriate cover of needs on different labor markets (e.g. demand for different specialties), and providing the necessary opportunities for innovation To make this research we collected and analyzed data from different sources: -Sociological surveys, commissioned by the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ARACIS) in 2010 to measure perceptions of teachers, students and employers on the state of quality education; -Interviews in-depth -conducted in 2010, with experts ARACIS who have interacted in external evaluation visits to the various institutional arrangements developed by universities in what concerns the quality of education; -Experimental benchmarking exercise developed by ARACIS during 2009 - 2010 Quality Barometers.

In recent years, the program has expanded rapidly and now constitutes the largest and most expensive agricultural subsidy initiative in the United States. Similar programs have been introduced around the world. All these programs have one common denominator: Absent generous subsidies, participation is minimal. Such subsidies introduce the potential for a wide range of distortions. Intensive margin distortions may result from moral hazard as insured growers alter their production practices. Distortions at the extensive margin may arise as acreage decisions reflect the presence of subsidized risk management, resulting in lands with alternative uses being planted to crops. Arange of environmental effects may arise as a result of these distortions. Not all those effects are negative, because subsidized insurance may result in less intensive use of chemical and fertilizer inputs.

Since 1995, liberalization of the electricity market in Japan has been phased in and regulations on entry have been relaxed three times. One motivation for these regulatory changes has been to improve the efficiency of electricity production by introducing competition. Using a panel data set on the nine main power companies in Japan over the period 1970-2010, estimates of fixed-effects and stochastic frontier models of the cost function are obtained and compared. Estimates of the cost function show that liberalization has improved cost efficiency. Economies of scope are found to exist for all firms. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

This chapter focuses upon the role of public education policies in advancing the employability of lifelong learners. A deep understanding of what is required by the labor market needs to be matched by a common understanding of the learning outcomes achieved in education. This chapter explains how the Catalan education system is working to align education and job requirements.

The approach of the Balassa index monitors the revealed comparative advantage of each economy. The results show that the distribution of the RCA is relatively wide among the surveyed economies and that there is always one pair of economies having most of its comparative advantages in the same groups of goods. From the analysis it is also clear for some economies that if they have a comparative advantage in the export of certain raw materials, they achieve comparative advantage in export of products made from these materials as well. There are also various hypotheses about the RCA index of each country.","[Vahalik, Bohdan] Tech Univ Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Vysoka Skola Banska, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Vahalík, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",bohdan.vahalik.st@vsb.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,5,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3802-2,,,,2013,,,,,,,758,775,,,,,,18,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BD8CD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363789300084,0

Complex social norms have developed around water management and competing users have established political (governance) and economic cooperative relationships. Water resources will steadily decline because of population growth, pollution and expected climate change (Hemson et al., 2008). It has been estimated that the global demand for water doubles approximately every two decades (Meyer, 2007) and that water will even become as expensive as oil in the future (Holland, 2005). In the year 2000, global water use was twice as high as it was in 1960 (Clarke and King, 2004:19). Unfortunately this trend is expected to continue. The aim of this research is to identify whether efforts that were made to improve the capacity component of the water poverty index (WPI) in a region have been successful. It builds on a previous study on a region in Southern Gauteng and the Northern Free State provinces of South Africa, and utilizes the latest Census data to draw a comparison. In the 10 year period from 2001 to 2011 the capacity component of the WPI in the region increased by roughly 15%, which was caused by a significant increase in the educational subcomponent. The research concludes that interventions made to increase the educational level of the regions residents have been successful, and that future research should focus on continuously analysing the results of interventions involved in the WPI, thereby ensuring their effectiveness.","[van der Vyver, Charles] North West Univ, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,,Charles.vandervyver@nwu.ac.za,"Van der Vyver, Charles/AAK-7130-2021","Van der Vyver, Charles/0000-0002-2623-7853",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,82,94,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500006,0

They are disturbed to find in their cross sections that faster economic growth statistically goes together with intolerance of homosexuals. In this comment, we revisit the issue and demonstrate that the concern expressed by BE is unwarranted if we properly account for conditional convergence in the regressions for economic growth. Other things being equal, a country grows faster if it starts from a poorer initial position. In the BE dataset, China since the Deng reforms is a prime example. At about the same time, another group of countries managed to accelerate their economic growth after a long period of stagnation: the ex-communist countries in central and Eastern Europe. Many of these nations also grew exceptionally fast for a number of years, once freedom had been regained and the initial chaos overcome. With simple modeling of these historical initial conditions, we find no statistical pattern that associates bias against homosexuals with weaker economic growth.

On average, the annualized return can be as high as 12.5%, though requiring trading on days a pair is traded lowers the return approximately by three percentage points. On the other hand, lowering the threshold for opening a pair is found to increase returns even after accounting for trading costs, indicating that there might be a more optimal trade initiation threshold available than that presented in earlier literature.

Using a panel of Chinese export data at the detailed commodity level over the period of 1988-2006, we show that China's regional specialization follows a U-shaped pattern: both the interior and coastal regions diversify from 1988 to 1994 but specialize during the later reform period of 1994-2006. A theory of tariff reductions is proposed by constructing the Dornbusch-Fischer-Samuelson (1977) continuum of goods Ricardian model in a setup of two countries and three regions. The U-shaped pattern of specialization can be obtained from foreign tariff reductions followed by Chinese tariff reductions. This finding is supported by simulations, US-China trade policy review, and the pattern of China's coast-inland wage ratio. J. Japanese Int. Economies 26 (4) (2012) 561-577.

The data come from a survey conducted in Seattle (WA) which elicited stated preference-contingent ratings for different recycling programs relative to status quo, with experimental variation in the overall community recycling rate achieved and expected household cost. The recycling rate is interpreted as capturing the public benefits of recycling programs and constitutes the most common measure used by policy agencies for setting waste management objectives and evaluating policy initiatives. The analysis begins with fixed parameter models that explore different ways of handling rating data and mixed logit estimations that capture household preference heterogeneity both within and across different recycling programs. This analysis yields unique estimates of willingness to pay for an increase in the community recycling rate. Predicted individual-specific utility parameters are then regressed on household background information to explicitly examine the nature of preference heterogeneity. Overall, this paper generates interpretable policy-relevant insights into the public and private good dimensions of community recycling programs.","[Kipperberg, Gorm] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Larson, Douglas M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Kipperberg, G (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",gorm.kipperberg@uis.no; dmlarson@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,55,19,20,1,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

First, who bears the short-run costs of programs to subsidize the generation of electricity from renewable sources varies with the organization of the electric power industry, and this variation may be a significant contributor to such programs' political attractiveness in U.S. states. Second, despite the greater popularity of feed-in tariff schemes worldwide, renewable portfolio standard (RPS) programs may involve less long-run social risk. Third, in contrast to the European Union's approach to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, its renewables program is almost certain not to minimize the cost of achieving its goals. Fourth, state RPS programs in the United States are also almost certain to cost more than necessary, even though most use market mechanisms. To support this last proposition I provide a fairly detailed description of actual markets for renewable energy credits and their shortcomings.","MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Schmalensee, R (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rschmal@mit.edu,,,,,,,25,84,96,0,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

By building on the rich social capital literature, we hypothesize a positive effect of VCs' social capital, derived from past syndication, on the amount of money that start-ups receive. Specifically, we argue that both structural and relational aspects of VCs' social networks provide VCs with superior access to information about current investment objects and opportunities to leverage them in the future, increasing their willingness to invest in these firms. Our empirical results, derived from a novel dataset containing more than 1,500 first funding rounds in the Internet and IT sector, strongly confirm our hypotheses. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of venture capital and entrepreneurship, showing that the role and effect of VCs' social capital on start-up firms may be more complex than previously argued in the literature.","[Block, Joern H.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Res Inst Management, Erasmus Sch Econ, Ctr Adv Small Business Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Alexy, Oliver T.; Ter Wal, Anne L.

Of the three main approaches considered, the first stresses the importance of innovation based on science and technology (STI) drivers, such as research and development (R&D) and human capital, whereas the second approach emphasises innovation based on learning by doing, by using and by interacting (DUI); the third, more recent approach is conceived as a combination of the former two (STI + DUI). In this paper, the three models are tested on a sample of 409 SMEs that have been supported by a public programme for innovation promotion developed by the Basque Government in Spain. The result is quite different from what is expected, yet it is insightful and potentially useful for both academics and policy-makers. Contrarily to what one would expect, SME innovation output is in fact more sensitive to STI drivers than to DUI drivers.","[Davide Parrilli, Mario; Elola, Aitziber] Univ Deusto, Basque Inst Competitiveness, San Sebastian 20012, Spain",University of Deusto,"Parrilli, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Deusto, Basque Inst Competitiveness, Camino Mundaiz 50, San Sebastian 20012, Spain.",m.d.parrilli@orkestra.deusto.es,"Elola, Aitziber/F-3049-2016","Elola, Aitziber/0000-0002-6787-6862",,,,,50,50,56,2,116,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The in-sample fit to the VIX term structure shows that the second (stochastic long-term volatility) factor is required to fit the VIX term structure. Out-of-sample tests on the fit to individual option prices, as well as in-sample tests, show that the inclusion of jumps is less important than allowing for non-affine dynamics.

This pape assumes consumers cannot assess quality prior to purchase and cannot, at reasonable cost, identify who produced the good they are considering. Many products (meats, fruits, vegetables, fish, grains) sold both in formal groceries and, less formally, on the street fit this description. This paper also assumes that producers can adjust quality at a cost and only firms in the formal sector are subject to government regulation. In the long run, producers migrate to the sector that is more profitable. Using this model, we demonstrate how regulations in the formal sector can lead to a quality gap between formal and informal sector goods.

Manpower systems differ primarily in how they distribute costs: the volunteer system shares the war's manpower costs broadly, whereas the draft forces a subset of the population to bear a disproportionate share of the load. This difference affects an office- and policy-motivated politician's decision to go to war. The draft induces prowar policy-makers to pursue more wars than the volunteer military does, whereas the volunteer system induces antiwar policy-makers to pursue more wars than the draft does. The manpower systems cannot be generically ranked by efficiency because each makes errors the other avoids, but the volunteer system induces selection of more efficient wars for a large class of plausible preference distributions.","Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Clemson University,"Warren, PL (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, 228 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",patrick.lee.warren@gmail.com,"Baltutyte, Gerda/AGH-5630-2022",,,,,,26,1,5,0,16,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Bank-related, independent and domestic leasing companies are more able to control costs than their captive and foreign counterparts.

Our analysis focuses on special needs students that may be underserved. The results show average achievement gains of 0.36 standard deviations in math and 0.12 standard deviations in reading for each year spent at KIPP Lynn, with the largest gains coming from the LEP, SPED, and low-achievement groups.

We also introduce a suitable framework to test this model empirically. Using a sample of six emerging markets and three mature markets, we find that the degree of stock market integration varies through time and that most of the sample emerging markets have become more integrated in the recent years. The local risk premium for emerging markets represents the most important component of the total risk premium, but its relative importance has decreased recently.

Our key idea is to purge the effect of estimating the conditional mean-and-variance parameters on the estimated higher moments by suitably using the first and second moments of the standardized residuals. The resulting higher-moment tests have a simple invariant form for various conditional mean-and-variance models, and are also applicable to the symmetry or independence hypothesis that does not involve a complete standardized error distribution. Thus, our tests are simple and flexible. Using our approach, we establish a class of skewness-kurtosis tests, characteristic-function-based moment tests, and Value-at-Risk tests for exploring the standardized error distribution and higher-order dependence structures. We also conduct a simulation to show the validity of our approach in purging the estimation effect, and provide an empirical example to show the usefulness of our tests in exploring conditional non-normality.

The findings suggest that the average High Street business could expect up to 10 core goods and 7.6 service visits per week, in non-peak trading periods with 25% additional activity during the build up to Christmas. Vans (light goods vehicles') were the dominant mode, responsible for 42% of delivery activity with a mean dwell time of 10 min. Where possible, load consolidation should be encouraged by methods such as Delivery and Servicing Plans and using out-of-town freight consolidation centres to bring in goods over the last mile in shared vehicles. Where this is not possible, loading bay monitoring and control, and preferred lorry routes can help manage the movement of vehicles in and out of dense urban areas. Service vehicle activity is a significant contributor to urban freight movements and often requires vehicles to be parked close to the premises being served. Centrally coordinating elements of service provision (e.g. for cleaning, equipment maintenance, recyclate collection), or providing improved, more flexible parking provision for service vehicles could be as or more beneficial in reducing overall freight impacts than focusing on core goods deliveries. In the case of the latter, 'pay-as-you-leave' car park charging systems could encourage short-stay service vehicles to park off-street. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Between 2004 and 2007, a significant house price bubble emerged in Ireland, while the real economy was enjoying persistently strong growth rates. The sharp decline in house prices post 2007 coupled with the significant increase in unemployment has generated a combination of difficulties for the Irish residential market. To date, much of the analysis and discussion of the Irish market has tended to focus on either the concept of mortgage repayment distress or potential negative equity. By examining the issue of credit default in the Irish mortgage market, we focus on the interaction between delinquency (repayment distress) and solvency (negative equity). Building on earlier work, which used the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), we marry existing estimates of repayment distress with estimates of negative equity for a representative sample of Irish households. Using copula modelling we then examine the dependence structure across the distributions of mortgage delinquency and solvency for these households. As a result, we are in a position to estimate the probability that a household experiencing repayment distress might also be in negative equity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We find that more attorneys per capita and more heavily Democratic courts were both associated with higher prices for mold and slab coverage.","[Garven, James R.; Gwin, Carl R.] Baylor Univ, ISR, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Baylor University,"Garven, JR (通讯作者)，Baylor Univ, ISR, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",James_Garven@baylor.edu,"Garven, James/B-7558-2012","Garven, James/0000-0003-3291-8476",,,,,25,0,1,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We use a theoretically founded gravity model to shed light on MERCOSUR's possible creation and diversion effects as well as its preference erosion effect on trade among Brazilian states. Using data on interstate trade over a 4-year period, including 1 year prior to the MERCOSUR period (1991), we deliver empirical evidence at state level with a focus on the impact of MERCOSUR which can vary across Brazilian regions. We show that MERCOSUR increased Brazilian states' trade with member countries, but had no effect on either interstate trade or Brazilian states' trade with third countries. The paper finds that MERCOSUR's impact varies across Brazilian regions and that Center West region did not benefit from the integration to MERCOSUR.

This paper explores to what extent these global trends can be understood as a reaction to three structural shocks to the macro-financial environment of the global economy: (i) monetary shocks (excess liquidity hypothesis), (ii) preference shocks (savings glut hypothesis), and (iii) investment shocks (investment drought hypothesis). In order to uniquely identify these shocks in an integrated framework, we estimate structural VARs for the two main regions with widening imbalances, the United States and emerging Asia, using sign restrictions that are compatible with standard New Keynesian and Real Business Cycle models. Our results show that (US) monetary policy shocks explain the largest part of the variation in imbalances and financial market prices. We find that savings shocks and investment shocks explain less of the variation. Hence, a liquidity glut may have been a more important driver of real and financial imbalances in the US and emerging Asia that ultimately triggered the global financial crisis.

We show that option trading is mostly driven by differences of opinion, a finding different from the current literature that attempts to attribute option trading to information asymmetry. Our conclusion is based on three pieces of empirical evidence. First, option trading around earnings announcements is speculative in nature and mostly dominated by small, retail investors. Second, around earnings announcements, the pre-announcement abnormal turnovers of options seem to predict the post-announcement abnormal stock returns. However, once we control for the pre-announcement stock returns, the predictability completely disappears, implying that option traders simply take cues from the stock market and turn around to speculate in the options market. Third, cross-section and time-series regressions reveal that option trading is also significantly explained by differences of opinion. While informed trading is present in stocks, it is not detected in options. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting indoor air pollution has severe health consequences for children who are close to the fire while their mothers cook. We use survey data from Guatemala to examine the effects of firewood consumption on the health of children up to five years of age. We also investigate the impact of cooking inside the home, the importance of a mother cooking while caring for her children and the role played by the smoke permeability of housing construction materials. We find that children living in households that use more wood, and where exposure to indoor air pollution is higher because the mother cooks while caring for children or because cooking takes place inside, are more likely to have symptoms of respiratory infection. Simulations indicate that policies that target cooking habits in order to directly reduce exposure, particularly by reducing the number of women who simultaneously cook and care for children, may be more effective for improving young children's health than policies to accelerate the adoption of gas stoves.","[Edwards, John H.

We investigate both the determinants of non-interest income and the impact of diversification on various profitability and insolvency risk measures for public sector, private domestic, and foreign banks. We document that ownership does matter in the pursuit of non-interest income. Relative to private domestic banks, public sector banks earn significantly less fee-income, while foreign banks report higher fee income. Public sector banks with higher levels of governmental ownership are significantly less likely to pursue non-interest income sources. Fee-based income significantly reduces risk, measured by profitability variables, for public sector banks. Default risk is also reduced for these banks. From a regulatory perspective, it appears that diversification benefits India's public sector banks.

During the last quarter of the 20th century, some community banks reduced their traditional reliance on correspondent banks for upstream products and services by joining bankers' banks, a form of business cooperative. Research on vertical integration focuses primarily on firm-specific investment, market power, and government regulation. However, this case is difficult to explain in terms of these standard vertical integration motives. Our evidence suggests that bankers' banks are a response to technological change and deregulation that results in increased costs faced by community banks in dealing with correspondent banks as both suppliers and potential competitors. For instance, loan participations require sharing proprietary information about major loan customers, something a community bank would not want to provide to a potential competitor.

We use the standard description of monetary transmission as a benchmark to identify aspects of the transmission mechanism that may operate differently in LICs. In particular, the paper focuses on the effects of financial market structure on monetary transmission. The weak institutional framework prevalent in LICs drastically reduces the role of securities markets. Consequently, traditional monetary transmission through market interest rates and market-determined asset prices are weak or nonexistent. The exchange rate channel, in turn, tends to be undermined by heavy central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market. The weak institutional framework also has the effect of increasing the cost of bank lending to private firms. Coupled with imperfect competition in the banking sector, this induces banks to maintain chronically high excess reserves and to invest in domestic public bonds or (when possible) in foreign bonds. With the financial system not intermediating funds properly, the bank lending channel also becomes impaired. These factors undermine both the strength and reliability of monetary transmission, which has important implications for the conduct of monetary policy in LICs.

Expected returns and conditional Sharpe ratios from liquidity provision spike during periods of financial market turmoil. The results point to withdrawal of liquidity supply and an associated increase in the expected returns from liquidity provision, as a main driver behind the evaporation of liquidity during times of financial market turmoil, consistent with theories of liquidity provision by financially constrained intermediaries.","[Nagel, Stefan] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, NBER, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University,"Nagel, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, NBER, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Nagel_Stefan@gsb.stanford.edu,,,,,,,44,251,286,4,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The main hypothesis is that IT usage increases efficiency to a higher degree in diversified and internationalized firms compared with single-market SMEs. This hypothesis is tested using a large sample of more than 2,000 Spanish SMEs. Overall, intensive use of IT in operations processes is found to be associated with substantial increases in productivity of firms following both related and unrelated diversification. Also, exporting firms with more intensive use of IT have higher productivity. These results are consistent with previous theoretical arguments on the relationship between IT and efficiency of firms and open future research directions related to the role played by IT in the management control systems of both diversified and exporting firms.","[Sandulli, Francesco D.; Fernandez-Menendez, Jose; Rodriguez-Duarte, Antonio; Ignacio Lopez-Sanchez, Jose] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Org Empresas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Sandulli, FD (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Org Empresas, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",sandulli@ccee.ucm.es; jfernan@ccee.ucm.es; duarte@ccee.ucm.es; jilopez@ccee.ucm.es,"sandulli, francesco/AAA-8103-2019; Rodriguez-Duarte, Antonio/K-5674-2017; Lopez-Sanchez, Jose Ignacio/H-5473-2015","sandulli, francesco domenico/0000-0003-0831-9959; Rodriguez-Duarte, Antonio/0000-0002-7392-5683; Lopez-Sanchez, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-4096-0992",,,,,67,23,23,3,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Households and/or the government are assumed to face model uncertainty and desire robustness against alternative models. Welfare gains from optimal taxation are small if the government trusts its model of household expectations, whether those expectations are altered by model uncertainty or not; in contrast, welfare losses are large if the government is uncertain about the household's probability model.

A comparison of the main effects produced by the countercyclical asset with the simple equity-debt capital structure, the non-countercyclical contingent capital and the countercyclical callable bond is conducted. We demonstrate that this type of asset reduces the spread of straight debt and is effective in reducing the asset substitution incentive. The reduction of bankruptcy costs is strong only when the countercyclicality feature is removed. Contingent capital is useful for macroprudential regulation and we show that the countercyclical feature is important depending on priorities (moderate the asset substitution incentive or reduce bankruptcy costs).

Ironically, cap-and-trade seems especially well suited to addressing the problem of climate change, in that emitted greenhouse gases are evenly distributed throughout the world's atmosphere.

In the model, rating agencies seek to maximize their reputation and protect their market power. They observe public information and obtain either precise or noisy private information about a firm. Reputational concerns dictate that a rating reflects private information when it is precise. However, when private information is noisy, two situations arise. In a monopoly, the rating agency may ignore private information and issue a rating that conforms to public information. Under some conditions, it may even become cautious and issue bad ratings ignoring both types of information. With competition, however, it has incentives to contradict public information as a way to pretend that it holds precise private information. Moreover, it may become more likely to issue good ratings in an attempt to protect market power. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reframes the question in terms of cohort size. Using national data, we find that a 10% increase in kindergarten enrollment yields a 0.5% increase in cohort shrinkage across early grade transitions, which implies that larger cohorts feature higher rates of retention. Consistent with previous work on class and school size in more restricted settings, this cohort-tracking exercise provides robust evidence at the national level that smallness confers benefits.

This viewpoint discusses the utility of high-speed rail, as well as some major challenges facing its application to the transport geography of the US. High-speed rail has the potential to alleviate automobile and short-haul air traffic congestion in several regional corridors throughout the US, which would have significant economic, environmental, and quality-of-life benefits. Though a national network may not be feasible, a series of interconnected regional corridors would make a de facto national high-speed network that would represent a significant improvement over existing national rail operations, which outside of the Northeast and Pacific Coast are virtually non-existent. However, before this can be achieved major issues of engineering and track right of way, service provision, and stop access require resolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the measurement of airport market power is not a trivial issue, not least given the wide range of different market segments airports operate in. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology for the assessment of airport market power which can be applied to the European airports. First, we provide an overview of existing methodologies applied in empirical studies that try to assess the degrees of airport market power. It is found that, while the literature provides some very detailed assessments for specific airports, no comparative studies for a wider range of European airports, based on uniform and transparent criteria, has so far been undertaken. Therefore we develop a transparent modelling approach for the estimation of airport market power in the local passenger market segment, which requires detailed regional GDP data on NUTS 3 level, airport-region distances and flight supply on the airport level, as reported by the Official Airline Guide (OAG), as main input data. We show and discuss the results for the 50 largest European airports. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyses to what extent and for which trade lanes the Cape route could develop into a competitive alternative to the Suez route. The market potential of the Cape route is analysed using a distance analysis, a transit time analysis and a generalized cost analysis for a large set of O/D relations. We compare vessel interlining via the port of Algeciras with interlining via the new port of Ngqura in South Africa. The results show that the Cape route has the potential to serve as an alternative to the Suez route on 11 trade lanes. A scenario and sensitivity analysis reveals that interlining via a hub near the Cape is expected to become more competitive due to a combination of higher Suez Canal transit fees, better vessel economics, higher bunker costs, slow steaming practices and subject to a more competitive terminal pricing strategy of southern African transhipment facilities. The expected emergence of the Cape route should be seen as the embodiment of a promising development of south-south trade volumes between Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and South America.

Understanding Water Sales to the Australian Government,ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Water entitlements; Environmental water sales; Murray-Darling Basin; Irrigators,,"In 2007-2008 the Australian federal government committed $3.1 billion over 10 years to purchase water from irrigators in the Murray-Darling Basin and to deliver this water to key environmental assets. Given that water entitlements often represent one of the most valuable assets owned by irrigators, this study investigates irrigators' willingness to sell water, and their actual water sales, to the government. It uses 1,570 surveys from 2008-2009 and 2010-2011 in the southern Murray-Darling Basin. Water sales can be classified as either last resort or strategic. Overall, the results suggest that farmers who do not hold strong traditional farming attitudes, and have higher debt, lower farm income, larger high security water entitlements, lower water allocations over the past 5 years, and those who have been net sellers of water allocations are more likely to have sold water or are thinking of selling water to the government. A dynamic comparison of how water sale preferences change, and an estimate of the total amount of water entitlements irrigators are willing to sell, indicates that it is probable that there will be enough water offered to the program in the future, at least to meet initial minimum environmental water targets. However, other concerns indicate that a potential restructure of the program may be required.","[Wheeler, S.; Zuo, A.; Bjornlund, H.; Miller, C.

In this paper we show also the presence and importance of calibration risk. More particularly, we point out that a variety of plausible calibration methods lead again to serious price differences for exotics and different distributions of the P&L of the delta-hedging strategy. This is illustrated under the popular Heston stochastic volatility model, which is used among practitioners to price all kinds of exotic and structured products.

All land use regulations considered in this study, including exclusive farm use zoning, forest zoning, urban growth boundary designation, residential density zoning, commercial zoning, and industrial zoning, are found to affect land values and land use patterns both inside and outside of the designated zones. The framework is applied to measure the costs of the regulations versus the value of individual exemptions at the parcel level to illuminate the controversy surrounding Oregon Measures 37 and 49, which were passed to provide just compensation for unfair regulatory burdens. The cost of regulation is found to be lower than the value of an individual exemption for most regulations contested in the Measure 37 claims. However, governments tend to overregulate from the perspective of landowners. Although some land gained value under the six regulations and some lost value, the aggregate loss of land value was estimated to be several times larger than the gain. This does not necessarily mean that the governments overregulate from the perspective of society because land use regulations also generate public goods such as wildlife habitat and water quality protection.

We focus on the merger of Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e Porto (Portuguese Stock Exchange) with Euronext in 2002 (that created Euronext Lisbon). To investigate this question we perform numerous statistical tests: serial correlation test (ACF test), runs test, unit root test (Kwiatkowski, Philips, Schmidt, & Shin, 1992). multiple variance ratio test (Chow & Denning, 1993) and ranks and signs test (Wright. 2000). The results indicate that the Portuguese Equity Market is inefficient in weak form during pre-merger period implying that investors possessed an opportunity to earn abnormal returns though small in magnitude. The results, sensitive to the methodology used, indicate a mixed evidence of improvement in market efficiency during the post-merger period. Although the findings are mixed, yet most tests show a tendency of improved efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, participation has been reserved for a few investors and the hedging of exposures remains difficult. This paper proposes to overcome these problems by introducing a call option on an art index, derived from one of the most comprehensive data sets of art market transactions. The option allows investors to optimize their exposure to art. For pricing purposes, non-tradability of the art index is acknowledged and option prices are derived in an equilibrium setting as well as by replication arguments. In the former, option prices depend on the attractiveness of gaining exposure to a previously non-traded risk. This setting further overcomes the problem of art market exposures being difficult to hedge. Results in the replication case are primarily driven by the ability to reduce residual hedging risk.

School closings raise concerns about the possible negative impacts on student achievement, neighborhoods, families, and teaching staff. This study examines an anonymous urban district that, faced with declining enrollment, chose to make student achievement a major criterion in determining which schools would be closed. The district targeted low-performing schools in its closure plan, and sought to move their students to higher-performing schools. We estimate the impact of school closures on student test scores and attendance rates by comparing the growth of these measures among students differentially affected by the closures. We use residential assignment to school as an instrument to address non-random sorting of students into new schools. We also statistically control for the contemporaneous effects of other reforms within the district. Results show that students displaced by school closures can experience adverse effects on test scores and attendance, but these effects can be minimized when students move to schools that are higher-performing (in value-added terms). Moreover, the negative effect on attendance disappears after the first year in the new school. Meanwhile, we find no adverse effects on students in the schools that are receiving the transferring students. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

FDI is negatively associated with pollution emissions in provinces with the higher levels of human capital, whereas FDI is positively related to pollution emissions in provinces with the lower levels of human capital. This suggests that pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) holds only in those provinces with low human capital.

The first one focuses on the effect of variables at the individual level, while the second raises questions regarding specific regional factors through the introduction of macro variables. In conducting this analysis, discrete choice models, including both single and competing risks frameworks, are applied to data drawn from the European Community Household Panel from 1994 to 2001. Different destination states are considered: paid employment, unemployment and inactivity. This allows us to search for the underlying determinants of these different hazards. The results suggest a positive impact on survival of formal education and previous experience within the labour market. In addition, we find that entering self-employment from unemployment has a strong negative effect on survival within self-employment. However, our results also show that the expenditure on start-up subsidies decreases the risk of exiting self-employment specifically for the group of individuals entering self-employment from unemployment. Therefore, the availability of these incentives might be seen by policymakers as not only a route to increase entry into self-employment, but also as an adequate instrument for equalising survival chances across individuals entering self-employment from unemployment and those entering with a different starting status.","[Maria Millan, Jose; Congregado, Emilio; Roman, Concepcion] Univ Huelva, Huelva, Spain",Universidad de Huelva,"Millán, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Huelva, Huelva, Spain.",jose.millan@dege.uhu.es,"Congregado, Emilio/AAE-2138-2019; Tapia, José María Millán/S-6187-2019; Millan, Jose Maria/K-1656-2013; Roman Diaz, Maria Concepcion/K-6782-2017","Congregado, Emilio/0000-0001-7409-0799; Tapia, José María Millán/0000-0002-5884-8106; Millan, Jose Maria/0000-0002-5884-8106; Roman Diaz, Maria Concepcion/0000-0002-2757-2274",,,,,81,112,125,0,86,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Communication has been shown to be more truthful and revealing than predicted in equilibrium. Because talk is preference-revealing, it may effectively frame bargaining around a logic of fairness or competition, moving parties on a path toward or away from equal-division agreements. These endogenous framing effects may outweigh any overall social utility effects due to the mere presence of communication. In two studies, we find that non-binding talk about fairness within a three-party, complete-information game leads toward off-equilibrium, equal division payoffs, while non-binding talk focusing on Competitive Reasoning moves parties away from equal divisions.

Many features of governance and compensation that have caused consternation among commentators arise naturally in this dynamic setting, even though boards are rational and managers are powerless. Compensation changes depend on changes in the evolution of a latent state variable outside the manager's control. Board passivity is positively correlated with both the value of management compensation and the firm's good fortune. Managerial opportunism tends to follow sudden reversals of good fortune. Moreover, managerial private benefits, by increasing managers' stake in the long-run viability of the firm, may actually ameliorate agency conflicts.

The purpose of this paper is to thoroughly explore the ecological behaviour of tourists during their holidays and the consequences of it. We currently notice a barrier between the classic and modern tourism services. It was necessary to analyse the ecological behaviour of the tourists because, on one hand, Romania has got such a tremendous natural and cultural potential, which should be preserved and transferred from one generation to another, and on the other hand, because the methods of transferring ecological behaviour knowledge are so scarce. The novelty of the research consists in identifying the potential consequences of the level of tourists' education and information on their ecological behaviour. The findings of our survey reveal that the Romanian tourism has followed the right path as concerns ecology, given that people as both citizens and tourists have been increasingly concerned about environmental issues.","[Stanciulescu, Gabriela Cecilia; State, Olimpia] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stanciulescu, GC (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",gabriela_stanciulescu@yahoo.com,"STĂNCIULESCU, GABRIELA CECILIA/AAI-2108-2021; State, Olimpia/AAF-2322-2019","STĂNCIULESCU, GABRIELA CECILIA/0000-0003-4791-1111; State, Olimpia/0000-0002-9737-867X",,,,,16,2,2,0,25,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2012,14.0,31,,,,,114,128,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,900SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300910600009,0

The aim of this study is to identify the relevant risks in managing abandoned housing project and formalized the ways to manage these risks. To achieve this end, a semi-structured interview will be conducted. The sample of this study is obtained from the on-going and completed abandoned projects managed by the Syarikat Perumahan Negara Berhad (SPNB), a wholly owned company of the Ministry of Finance. The expected finding is the identification of relevant risks pertaining to abandoned project and the ways to manage these risks. The finding provides two contributions. First is the contribution to the additional knowledge on risk management in reviving abandoned projects. Second is that this study provides insights to the governing agencies on how to manage the risk of completing abandoned project. It is envisaged that the identification of the relevant risks would furnish preliminary inputs required to further develop the framework of risk of abandoned project undertaken by SPNB and other similar entities.

While acknowledging that the analysis doesn't prove that banks are lying or manipulating Libor, it nevertheless conjectures that these banks may have been low-balling their borrowing rates to avoid looking desperate for cash. In this paper we compare Libor with other short-term borrowing rates, analyze individual bank quotes, and compare these individual quotes to CDS spreads and market capitalization data during three periods: 1/1/07-8/8/07 (Period 1), 8/9/07-4/16/08 (Period 2), and 4/17/08-5/30/08 (Period 3).

Results of the study are consistent with predictions about the functioning of the enterprising family derived from research using social capital theory and group dynamics, especially with respect to teams. Family governance practices (family constitution, family code of conduct, clear selection and accountability criteria, family council, formal family communication mechanisms and family reunions) are hypothesized to build a strong and unified business-owning family functioning as a team. Results show that these practices are positively associated with financial performance. This relationship is mediated by a focus on preserving and growing business wealth as a family.

Post credit crisis valuations are 73% of the pre credit crisis five-year levels, implying the markets are evaluating the industry differently in view of the many new challenges that it now faces.","Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England",Durham University,"Broby, D (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England.",daniel.broby@silkinvest.com,,"Broby, Dr Daniel/0000-0001-5482-0766",,,,,21,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

J,"Burke, PJ; Resosudarmo, BP",,,,"Burke, Paul J.; Resosudarmo, Budy P.",,,SURVEY OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS,BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TOURISM,"The Indonesian economy is maintaining its momentum at a time of ongoing uncertainty in the global economy and slowing economic growth in China. Strong domestic demand saw output grow by 6.4% over the year to June, despite a steep fall in net exports. Inflation is safely within Bank Indonesia's target range, although food prices have increased relatively quickly. The current account deficit widened to 3.1% of GDP in the June quarter due to continued growth in imports and falling prices for commodity exports. The trade environment has deteriorated in 2012, and new divestment and domestic processing requirements are likely to further reduce investor interest in the mining sector. President Yudhoyono has recently made several speeches calling for a 'green growth agenda'. Some progress has been seen in slowing deforestation and in establishing mechanisms for facilitating payments to reduce emissions from deforestation, but loss of natural forests remains rapid. Carbon dioxide emissions from energy are growing quickly, stoked by increasing use of coal. The proposed 2013 budget continues to be heavily burdened by energy subsidies, which encourage over-consumption of fossil fuels. In most respects, therefore, the business-asusual trajectory of the Indonesian economy is unlikely to be particularly green. A barrier to subsidy reform is its perceived unpopularity, including the threat of public protests such as those witnessed in March. To gauge current opinion we carried out a survey of Jakarta-based university students. The results indicated majority support for the removal of fuel subsidies, but some respondents said they would protest against fuel subsidy reductions, highlighting the politically sensitive nature of the issue. Indonesia has witnessed booms in the coal and palm oil sectors in recent years, becoming the world's largest exporter of both commodities. We review the benefits from these two booms and the tensions between the development of these sectors and environmental goals. We also review the tourism sector, which remains relatively under-developed outside Bali. Tourism is a potential source of long-run growth that may be aligned with a green economy. The development of the sector would be aided by infrastructure improvements and a renewed focus on the conservation of natural assets.","[Burke, Paul J.; Resosudarmo, Budy P.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Burke, PJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Burke, Paul/G-3757-2010; Resosudarmo, Budy/K-1129-2017","Burke, Paul/0000-0003-2715-2672; Resosudarmo, Budy/0000-0003-2273-9765",,,,,56,29,31,1,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Calculating structural budget balance requires three steps: Firstly, the elasticity of budget items with respect to the gross domestic product is estimated. Secondly potential output and the corresponding output gap series are obtained. Finally, structural budget balance is calculated. The findings of the study can be summarized as follows: The weighted tax elasticity is estimated to be 1.07. We find that the share of primary structural budget surplus in the GDP has decreased in the recent years. On the other hand, fiscal policy can be described as pro-cyclical in 2007, counter-cyclical in 2009 and a cyclical in 2008 and 2010. It is observed that fiscal authority gave more importance to economic stabilization in 2009 due to global financial crises.","[Cebi, Cem] Turkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankasi, Arastirma & Para Politikasi Genel Mudurlugu, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Ozlale, Umit] TOBB Ekon & Teknol Univ, Uluslararasi Girisimcilik Bolumu, TR-06560 Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Prime Ministry Turkey; TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University,"Çebi, C (通讯作者)，Turkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankasi, Arastirma & Para Politikasi Genel Mudurlugu, Istiklal Caddesi 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",cem.cebi@tcmb.gov.tr; uozlale@etu.edu.tr,"Ozlale, Umit/AAE-5222-2019",,,,,,23,3,3,1,4,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We show that the total takeover premium, the pre-announcement target stock price run-up, and the post-announcement stock price markup are all higher when investors have higher divergence of opinion. We obtain identical results with higher market-level investor sentiment. When divergence of opinion is higher, a firm is less likely to be a takeover target, although takeover synergy in successful takeovers is higher. Our results suggest that takeovers may play a role in explaining high contemporaneous stock prices in the presence of high divergence of investor opinion.","[John, Kose] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Chatterjee, Sris; Yan, An] Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",New York University; Fordham University,"John, K (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",kjohn@stern.nyu.edu,"Yan, An/JPA-0307-2023",,,,,,37,47,59,2,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Therefore, it is based on economic simulations, a type of alternative approach that uses mathematical techniques and deductions to solve an objective model. The economic simulation of this work reflects that the trade opening level is an important factor of weight for possible institutional alterations in the economies. It is noticeable that, in the countries with low opening level, the cost of the capital is the main setback for the economic growth. And, in those economies with high opening level, the largest dynamics would compensate the problems caused by the cost of the capital. When compared the two types of reforms (continuous versus punctual), the continuous reform will bring a more expressive gain quality of the relative product than the punctual reform.

The opportunity of establishing permanent two-way contact and creating a varied communication with the consumers using social networks proved to be appropriate in tourism marketing and destination marketing as well. However, in order to manage efficient marketing communications, marketers need to know a series of aspects. One of them is that even though online communication it's often characterized by simplicity and flexibility, the implementation of marketing campaigns on these types of applications should always take into consideration an essential fact: in the case of social networks, the public is the key element. Due to this, implementing a social networking campaign must be creative and perfectly adapted to the environment, and it should use the right message and establish a transparent relationship with the consumer.

It suggests that a significant portion of the closely synchronised price dynamics in commodity and financial markets is explained by market liquidity cycles in global finance, as financial investors manage their portfolio at ease through 'virtual' stock holdings of commodities in derivatives dealings and markets. The article further argues that this has generated price volatility well in excess of what could be explained in demand-supply fundamentals, and that under such conditions futures markets would cease to perform their intended functions - that of price discovery and risk hedging for physical commodity stakeholders. It explores the development impacts of excess price volatility and the case for innovative price stabilisation mechanisms.","Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Fac Law & Social Sci, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Nissanke, M (通讯作者)，Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Fac Law & Social Sci, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",mn2@soas.ac.uk,"Nissanke, Machiko/AEL-8172-2022",,,,,,35,41,43,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This price gap covers both profit and pure dead weight loss. The empirical part of the paper evaluates this price gap on Czech data from 2009 and 2010. This evaluation uses both average market price of electricity and a shadow market price of photovoltaic electricity. This shadow market price was evaluated as 1091.5 CZK/MWh (43.7 EUR/MWh) in 2010. The results show that average feed-in tariff is about twelve times higher than the market price, and about three times higher than final consumer price of electricity.

Huge opportunities in Agribusiness are attracting investments in primary production as well as on the output side in food processing and distribution. Organized retail is growing at 35% CAGR and so are many input industries, all of whom are demanding more capable people to manage growth. This is resulting in a shortage of trained agribusiness talent.

There is an important role of international trade in this process, which appears in much more heterogeneous forms than in the past. While the classical theory of foreign trade basically assumed commodity trade with the final products, due to fragmentation of production chains the major part of trade is performed with intermediate goods and also the trade in services becomes more and more dynamic. Increasing volume of the trade between countries is carried out without changing the ownership of traded goods, and vice versa - changing the ownership of goods without crossing the border of the country. There is important role of multinational enterprises, which are currently behind most of the economic operations.

Two sets of outcomes are considered: school enrolment rates and school performance in national examinations. Public spending appears to have a negligible effect on school enrolment in highly corrupt regions, but a statistically significant, positive and relatively large effect in less corrupt regions. In contrast, public spending has no significant effect on school performance. The main lesson from this paper is that pouring more public funds into the education system is unlikely to bring about improvement unless it is accompanied by efforts to improve governance in the sector.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Suryadarma, D (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Suryadarma, Daniel/ABI-3288-2020",,,,,,37,27,32,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The variables included are socio-demographics, access to biotechnology information, trust in information sources on biotechnology innovations, attitudes towards the importance and impact of science and technology on society, perceptions of the risks and benefits of the applications of biotechnology innovations and attitudes towards their implementation in practice. Results between the different EU countries are comparable and, alongside other determinants, trust in information sources will significantly impact perceptions of risks and benefits of the applications of biotechnology innovations, and attitudes towards their implementation in practice. This underlines the importance of information and knowledge to acceptance of biotechnology innovations, which should be a key point on policy-makers' agenda of developing the economic and environmental efficiency in the agricultural sector and rural sustainability in Europe.

Thus, a high performing employee will be targeted to remain within the company as long as possible for the benefits he brings and for the positive image he creates. But together with high performance, also the expectations increase, for both the employee and employer. This paper aims to underline those aspects that influence employees' performance, the strategies that are being used to stimulate their potential and to retain them, to show how their performance results contribute to company's growth and development, as well as management's implication in this process.

Using a theoretical model which identifies repression and appeasement as the primary alternatives to democratization, it argues that aid revenue should not produce a political curse because it is less fungible, more conditional, and less constant than state oil revenue, making it difficult for recipient governments to use their aid to fund either repression or appeasement. Using several different measures associated with repression and appeasement, the statistical results show that aid cannot be associated with any of these dependent variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

I expand on the design of Dana, Weber, and Kuang (2007) to better study information avoidance in an experimental setting. Subjects are given the chance to avoid information about a recipient's payoffs in a dictator game. I vary the probability that a dictator's payoffs will be aligned with the recipient's in order to assess the role of beliefs on avoidance and test contradictory models. The within-subjects approach shows that even people who are generous in a stark choice will make self-serving decisions when they can avoid knowing the recipient's outcome. People avoid information more often when the self-serving choice is unlikely to hurt the recipient, which supports Rabin's model (1995) of moral rules and moral preferences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the widely used positive correlation test for asymmetric information, which searches for a positive correlation between insurance demand and risk experience, the unused observables test is not confounded by heterogeneity in individual preference parameters that may affect insurance demand. We identify residential location as an unused observable in the U.K. annuity market of this period. Even though residential location was observed by all market participants, the decision not to condition prices on it created the same types of market inefficiencies that arise when annuity buyers have private information about mortality risk. Our findings raise questions about how insurance companies select the set of buyer attributes that they use in setting policy prices. In the decade following the period that we study, U.K. insurance companies changed their pricing practices and began to condition annuity prices on a buyer's postcode.","[Finkelstein, Amy; Poterba, James] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Finkelstein, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E17-214, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",afink@mit.edu; poterba@mit.edu,,,,,,,47,45,52,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Accordingly, the cycle will exert a varying impact on policy instruments of different salience. Using a panel data set of tariff decisions by Austrian local governments we identify a stable and sizable electoral cycle in water tariffs. Tariff increases are both less frequent and less strong before elections. The cycle effect is, however, not constant: Small increases are not affected by elections or even more likely. This is consistent with advances from prospect theory suggesting that visibility may depend on the size of a policy. Consequently, small tariff changes may not be salient, particularly if they are below inflation as a reference threshold. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We consider two types of constraints: non-negative equity premia and bounds on the conditional Sharpe ratio, the latter of which incorporates time-varying volatility in the predictive regression framework.

At first sight, public theaters and orchestras appear an unlikely domain for such tactics. Highbrow culture is elitist and provides few jobs to artists as voters (patronage). However, we argue that policymakers indirectly target a larger highbrow culture-consuming voting public, as this public is more likely to go voting, to actively engage in politics, and to influence other voters' political behavior through political and sociological multiplier effects. We find evidence of such manipulation tactics in Germany, 1993-2010. Artist numbers increase during state-level, and even more during municipal-level, election years (electioneering). More tentatively, leftwing party power increases cultural subsidies and jobs in Eastern states. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a probabilistic reversal learning paradigm (PRL), the neural correlates of flexibility have previously been associated with brain regions implicated in cognitive control, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lateral prefrontal cortex, and with the nucleus accumbens (Nacc) implicated in reward. The current study on healthy young males (n = 40) extends this previously published work in 3 ways. First we corroborate the involvement of ACC, VLPFC, and DLPFC at the exact moment of behavioral switches. Second, we report increased activation of the dACC and caudate head with increasing number of perseverating errors preceding a behavioral switch. Third, better performance on the task is associated with increased activation of rACC and VLPFC during switching, suggesting that these regions contribute to individual differences in behavioral flexibility. These findings cannot be extended to individual differences in a self-reported measure of self-regulation.","[Waegeman, Anja; Declerck, Carolyn H.; Boone, Christophe] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Management, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Seurinck, Ruth] Univ Ghent, Dept Data Anal, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Parizel, Paul M.] Univ Antwerp Hosp, Dept Radiol, Edegem, Belgium; [Parizel, Paul M.] Univ Antwerp, Fac Med, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp; Ghent University; University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp,"Waegeman, A (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Management, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",anja.waegeman@uantwerp.be,"Declerck, Carolyn H/A-1508-2016; Boone, Christophe/K-4945-2015","Boone, Christophe/0000-0001-7311-0217; Parizel, Paul M./0000-0002-0221-2854",,,,,53,10,12,2,38,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The existing literature documents that charitable giving is very responsive to tax subsidies, but often ignores the spillover effects of such policies. On the other hand, a growing body of literature documents that giving to others reduces stress and strengthens the immune system, which results in better health and longer life expectancy. These findings imply that tax subsidies for charitable giving may have positive spillover effects on health. This paper investigates this hypothesis using data from Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (COPPS), the philanthropy module of the Panel Study Income Dynamics (PSID). Understanding the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on health is quite important given the existing literature that links health status to several important economic outcomes. The results show that charitable subsidies have positive spillover effects on health. In particular, the implied cross-price elasticity of health index with respect to giving is -0.13. These results are robust to potential endogeneity of income and highlight the positive externalities created by tax subsidies for charitable giving. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Surprisingly, past studies have found mixed evidence that various labor market and industry attributes of workers affect their trade policy preferences, even though recent studies have found that trade policy can have substantial impacts on workers' incomes. This paper provides the first analysis of the extent to which task routineness affects trade policy preferences using survey data from the American National Election Studies. We find significant evidence that greater task routineness leads workers to be much more supportive of import restrictions, consistent with recent evidence on how trade openness puts downward pressure on employment and wages for workers whose occupations involve routine tasks. In fact, other than education levels, task routineness is the only labor market attribute that displays a robust correlation with individuals' stated trade policy preferences. We also provide evidence that there are some interactions between the economic and non-economic factors in our study. For example, women's trade policy views are much more invariant to their labor market attributes than men, suggesting that women's views on this issue are driven more by personal and ideological beliefs than men.","[Blonigen, Bruce A.; McGrew, Jacob] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Blonigen, Bruce A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Oregon; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Blonigen, BA (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 1285 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",bruceb@uoregon.edu,"Blonigen, Bruce A/B-4517-2013",,,,,,12,10,11,0,13,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

We develop a theoretical model of international environmental outsourcing that focuses on the roles played by firm size and productivity, transport costs and environmental regulations. We test the model's predictions using a firm-level dataset for Japan and do find evidence of an 'environmental outsourcing' effect.","[Cole, Matthew A.; Elliott, Robert J.

We ask if the implied bivariate relationships are rational in the sense used by Muth (1961) and if they are consistent with the good-begets-good heuristic proposed by Leiser and Aroch (2009). We also ask if they are consistent with the actual operation of economic and especially monetary policy in Australia.

Does this imply that a goal to boost wildlife on agricultural land is best met through a general reduction in intensity? We argue that such an approach may not be optimal, since cost functions for provision of wildlife on agricultural land may be non-convex, due to fixed costs associated with such provision. This implies that, even when farms are identical, it may be preferable to split them into groups of high providers and low providers. We test our hypothesis in a study of the optimal management of mown grasslands in southern Sweden, where the two products are silage and successful reproduction of ground-nesting birds, and the variable controlled by the farmer is the date of the first mowing. We show that the optimal solution is likely to involve some farmers maintaining profit-maximizing practices while other-identical-farmers delay their first mowing significantly.

In the data, the correlation between corporate debt and stock market valuations is low. The model accounts for this via the opposing effect of unpriced earnings risk on levered debt and equity prices. The model also explains the low (or nonexistent) risk-reward relation for the market portfolio of levered equity via the opposing effects of unpriced and priced uncertainty (both components of stock volatility) on the levered equity risk premium. Versions of the model calibrated to empirical measures of both types of fundamental risk can quantitatively substantiate these explanations. Variation in residual earning dispersion accounts for a significant fraction of observed disagreement between debt and equity valuations and of realized stock volatility. The implication that the two components of risk should forecast the levered equity risk premium with opposite signs is also supported in the data. The results are a notable advance for risk-based asset pricing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For example, a firm's inadequate ability to identify a pool of potential employee candidates or to provide them comprehensive firm- or job-specific information tends to worsen labor shortages, and an employee's ex-ante incomplete knowledge of on-the-job training or education opportunities tends to increase ex-post turnover intentions.

However, studies generally assume the method of crossing into the United States is exogenous with respect to migration duration. Using data from the Mexican Migration Project, this paper finds that the migrant's decision to hire a coyote (smuggler) to cross the border is endogenous with respect to duration. Instrumental variable estimates provide evidence that migrants who incur the cost of hiring a coyote have longer migration durations as they need to work longer in the United States. The migrants most likely to hire coyotes have less education, little migration experience, and/or come from rural communities. Results suggest that continuing to increase guest worker programs could actually decrease the number of Mexican immigrants in the United States by eliminating the need for coyotes which would reduce migration durations. This would better utilize the immigrant population in the United States by encouraging immigrants to stay while employed and to migrate home when unemployed, with the knowledge they can later return. Reducing coyote use would also reduce income flowing to Mexican cartels which have profited from human smuggling.","Bentley Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02452 USA",Bentley University,"Quinn, MA (通讯作者)，Bentley Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02452 USA.",mquinn@bentley.edu,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

This paper challenges this critique by explaining why such cosmetic improvements are of interest to rural people. Using a case study of the peasant community of Allpachico, I argue that these projects encourage the return of pensioners and visits from migrants. Residents and migrants are mutually dependent as a result of livelihood strategies based on agriculture and the foreign-controlled resource extraction sector over the past 80 years. The relative position of these two groups in the social reproduction of the vernacular community has changed with the Peruvian political economy. Currently, in the neoliberal resource extraction economy, residents pragmatically opt to maintain relations with those who have stable wage or pension incomes.","St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Anthropol, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada",Saint Francis Xavier University - Canada,"Vincent, S (通讯作者)，St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Anthropol, POB 5000, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",svincent@stfx.ca,,"Vincent, Susan/0000-0001-9166-1477",,,,,62,10,10,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Our results suggest that both economic and non-economic variables shape attitudes towards immigration, but the relative importance of these factors depends crucially on the race/ethnicity of the arriving immigrants. While fears over labour market competition are more likely to shape attitudes towards the arrival of same race immigrants, more exposure to immigrants reduces opposition towards the arrival of different race immigrants. These findings persist after controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, and after exploiting the data to allow for cohort-specific effects.","[Bridges, Sarah; Mateut, Simona] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Bridges, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,,"Mateut, Simona/0000-0002-3737-5952; Bridges, Sarah/0000-0002-1471-1116",,,,,38,22,25,2,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

These include logrolling, towing the party line, or political favor trading. However, it has proven difficult in the existing literature to uncover the magnitude of the interaction among politicians. This paper takes a spatial approach to the problem, using a spatial autoregressive model to not only uncover the magnitude of interactions, but also the direction of the interactions. In contrast to most applications of spatial econometrics, I allow the elements of the spatial weights matrix to be estimated as parameters. The political spatial weights matrix is calculated for 96 senators in the 110th U.S. Congress. Furthermore, in a marginal effects simulation, I calculate the overall effect on voting from flipping a senator's vote, allowing flipped votes to have a cascading effect. I apply these measures to study political fundraising, mildly suggesting that political interest groups direct donations to senators with the most influence.","Illinois State Univ, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Illinois State University,"Chupp, BA (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Campus Box 4200, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",bchupp@ilstu.edu,"Yoon, DongJoon/E-9146-2014",,,,,,41,0,2,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2014,160.0,3-4,,,,,521,538,,10.1007/s11127-013-0111-9,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AL7VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339344600013,0

The method may be useful wherever new housing development is of sufficiently large scale and homogeneous. Such circumstances characterize many emerging market countries, and here we apply the technique in China. We match two very similar new sales within a defined matching space. Here we test three versions of matching spaces - complex, phase, and building. We then regress the within-pair price differentials onto time dummies and the differentials in unit-specific physical attributes. Locational and community variations, as well as many unobservable or difficult to measure physical attribute variations, are cancelled out in the model, and thereby controlled for. The building-version ps-RS index does the best job in this regard because its within-pair differential is the smallest. We further introduce a hedonic value distance metric criterion so that one can deal flexibly with the trade-off between the within-pair similarity and the sample size. We explicate and demonstrate formal signal-to-noise oriented metrics of index quality, which can be superior to traditional standard errors based metrics, and we use the new metrics to compare index construction methodologies. The ps-RS approach addresses the problem of lack of repeat-sales data in emerging markets and newly constructed properties and the omitted variables problem in the hedonic method. It also addresses the traditional problems with the classical same-property repeat-sales model in terms of small sample sizes and sample selection bias. The present paper tests the ps-RS method using a large-scale micro transaction data set of new home sales from January 2006 to June 2011 (444,596 observations) in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. The resulting complex-based ps-RS index essentially parallels the hedonic index, suggesting that the hedonic index is not superior to that version of the ps-RS index in terms of systematic results. The phase-based ps-RS index has a lower growth trend and the building-based version lower still, indicating omitted variables relating to the physical quality of the units are not well controlled for in the hedonic, and suggesting that the building-based version of the ps-RS index provides the greatest control for such quality differences. Building-based ps-RS indices with different distance metric thresholds are almost the same. Compared to the hedonic, the ps-RS provides a smoother index indicating less random estimation error (or noise). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This paper attempts to assess the impacts of a management training program on the business performance of small enterprises in a metalworking cluster in Nairobi, Kenya. A previous study of this cluster observed that while several enterprises had successfully expanded operation, the majority had been experiencing declining profits due to increasing competition with imported products and with new entrants in the cluster. Based on the observed differences in management between successful and less successful enterprises, we designed a management training program featuring the basics of KAIZEN, an inexpensive, commonsense approach to management emphasizing the reduction of wasted work and materials, for the less successful enterprises. Although our initial intention was to use this training program as a randomized experiment, we had to abandon randomization and allow every business owner interested in the program to participate in it, due to circumstances beyond our control. This paper finds that business owners operating smaller enterprises tended to be self-selected into training participation. The training effects combined with the self-selection effect, which we estimate with panel data, were statistically significant and particularly stronger on profits than on sales revenues, while other training programs that did not teach KAIZEN had positive effects on sales revenues, not profits. As a result, the participants caught up with and overtook the non-participants in terms of average sales revenues and average profits, respectively.

We find strong countercyclical net worker flows into regulatory jobs, driven largely by higher gross outflows into the private sector during booms. These worker flows are also driven by state-specific banking conditions as measured by local banks' profitability, asset quality and failure rates. The regulatory sector seems to experience a retention challenge over time, with shorter regulatory spells for workers, and especially those with higher education. Evidence from cross-state enforcement actions of regulators shows gross inflows into regulation and gross outflows from regulation are both higher during periods of intense enforcement, though gross outflows are significantly smaller in magnitude.

The idea to use cable cars as feeders to the metro was integrated into an ambitious urban project that, to date, has improved accessibility dramatically for some low-income residents. Using data before and after the project's implementation, we evaluate the impact on social equity for the population in the zone of influence, considering changes in accessibility to employment and in housing-related costs. The access provided by the project to the main high-employment centres has doubled the number of opportunities that can be reached by the target population, even though travel-time savings and costs have seen only small changes. In fact, prior access to the CBD was poor and expensive, but time and costs were reduced with the Metrocable, although this reduction was not equal for all locations in the metropolitan area. In general, we argue that the main benefits, in terms of accessibility that differentiates the areas analysed from those used for comparison, are related to a localised ease of access to specific centres of activity according to the centralised development of the city's job market along the mass transit lines. In terms of housing costs, we developed a set of difference-in-difference models that considered rent, transport, and public utilities costs; however, none of them have allowed us to conclude that there was a statistically valid relationship between the Metrocable and the changes in costs between the two analysed populations.

Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the groups were divided spatially into typical walking and bicycling zones from campus. Descriptive analysis was first used to determine attitudinal differences and similarities among the divided groups regarding hypothetical walking and bicycling conditions. It was found that all groups generally favored most bicycling interventions within a bicycling zone versus those who lived outside the zone. Accordingly, most walking facilitators were viewed positively among all groups. A binary logit model was then utilized to understand how distance from campus affected the likelihood that a bicycle or pedestrian mode shift would occur among faculty, students, and staff. Model results indicated that bicycle safety and education may cause faculty to bicycle, whereas higher automobile costs may cause staff to bicycle, and a visible bicycle culture would cause students to bicycle more in a bicycling zone. The probability that staff and students would walk more was linked to increased perceived personal safety. Increased automobile costs and traffic enforcement appeared to be the largest incentive to increase faculty walking activity in a walking zone. The results indicate that a commuter university contains a diverse population, with equally diverse utilitarian non-motorized travel needs. Therefore, effective TOM strategies should reflect this variety by incorporating appropriate bicycling and walking incentives and automobile disincentives that encourage active commuting.

From the best-track TC data, we examine the changes in frequency, intensity, and economic damage of the TCs that made landfall since 1970. From the detailed individual TC reports, damage estimates are constructed based on reported damages. We find that the TC frequency has significantly declined over time. The intensity, however, does not show a significant trend. Average damage per TC has declined significantly from 43 million AUD in the 1970s to 11 million in the 1990s. This paper finds that 1 % decrease in minimum central pressure leads to 32.7 % increase in economic damage, which is more than three times larger than that found in the US hurricane study with regards to maximum wind speeds. For future damage projections, characteristics of the 14,000 TCs generated under seven different AOGCM climate models are applied. All seven climate models predict a decrease in TC frequency in the Southern Hemisphere but intensity predictions vary. By the end of the twenty second century, changes in climate are expected to increase the TC damage under the MRI (94 %), the MIROC (73 %), and the CSIRO (66 %) model due to increased intensity. However, TC damage is expected to fall under the GFDL (92 %) and the CNRM (85 %) model due to decreased intensity and frequency. Adaptation will be a key determinant of the future vulnerability to TCs in the Southern Hemisphere.","Univ Sydney, Fac Agr & Environm, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia",University of Sydney,"Seo, SN (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Agr & Environm, Biomed Bldg,Rm 216,1 Cent Ave, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia.",niggol.seo@sydney.edu.au,,"Seo, S.

The first stage results show that rainfall on election day decreases turnout. Second stage results show that conservatives are greatly hurt by higher turnout. Surprisingly, I find that the main leftwing party is not the beneficiary of higher turnout, but rather other smaller parties. In both stages, I control for local economic conditions and find that higher unemployment increases turnout, and that increases in unemployment benefit the conservative party at the expense of leftwing parties.

Dividend cuts and omissions have been suggested as one possibility to improve the financial strength of banks by retaining earnings. However, there are fears that investors could interpret a reduction of dividends as a sign for future problems. The dividend signalling and dividend smoothing hypotheses quite clearly are the theoretical basis for these worries. The basic idea of this study is that without empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis dividends did matter in the past, banks should not fear dividend cuts or even dividend omissions. The empirical evidence from the European banking industry reported here does not indicate that dividend signalling and dividend smoothing are relevant economic phenomena. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Statistical findings confirm that our sample population exhibits the Environmental Attitudes & Behaviours (A-B) and Behaviours & Behaviours (B-B) Splits observed in past studies. Those most likely to report environmentally friendly attitudes/behaviours are also the most likely to commute longer distances and in larger cars. Moreover, the least-compensated university sub-population, non-professional staff (i.e., office support, grounds keepers), is significantly more likely to contribute to a dramatically larger per-capita percentage of the university's carbon footprint from commuting. University pro-environment transportation alternatives at the time of this study did not consider directly this commuter sub-group's structural disadvantages.

Maryann Feldman is well known for her contributions to the study of the geography of innovation. A central focus of her work is on the role of entrepreneurial activity in the formation of regional industry clusters. She has studied entrepreneurial events involving both individuals and teams and the role of knowledge spillovers and finance in geographical clustering. She has also addressed other important aspects of contemporary entrepreneurship research, such as how academic entrepreneurship is influenced by intellectual property rights and modes of finance and how high-technology entrepreneurship aligns with public policy and the geography of innovation. The most significant impact of Maryann Feldman's scientific output lies in research on firm location, inter-firm knowledge spillovers, and clusters/regional development. Her research addresses macro aspects of industry evolution, micro-level aspects of firm strategy and organization, as well as meso-level aspects of institutions, infrastructures, and policy.

J,"Moro, B",,,,"Moro, Beniamino",,,Lessons from the European economic and financial great crisis: A survey,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financial crises; Sovereign debt crisis; European crisis,,"This paper discusses several key issues regarding the current European economic and financial Great Crisis, which essentially is a twin sovereign debt and banking crisis. The shift of the recent world financial crisis into a European sovereign debt crisis is tackled by analyzing how via the banking system the financial contagion was extended from the US to Europe. The explanation focuses on the imbalances of European Monetary Union (EMU) countries balance-of-payments. The European crisis has shown that it can spread quickly among closely integrated economies, either through the trade channel or the financial channel, or both. In this context, TARGET2 payment system of EMU countries became crucial, reflecting funding stress in the banking systems of crisis-hit European countries. The paper concludes that, in the medium term, a successful crisis resolution requires more political integration, Which should include a fiscal union and a banking union. However, in the short run, a prompt recovery is essential to get out of trouble, and this requires that surplus countries (particularly Germany) expand aggregate demand and let domestic wages and the ensuing inflation rate increase.

Attention is given to the influence of industry and firm characteristics on the creation of capabilities and on the returns from IT investments. Our work makes three principal contributions. First, the IT diffusion patterns reveal that these technologies have a dual nature. Some capabilities derived from IT use (i.e., administrative capabilities) diffuse evenly across industries because the underlying technologies easily adapt to industry- and firm-specific conditions. In contrast, the use of IT in supporting other capabilities (such as those related to product development) is less developed and more concentrated in the high-tech and information service sectors. Second, using a resource-based perspective, this articles shows the positive effects that firm-specific preconditions have on the accumulation of IT resources and capabilities that exhibit a rare diffusion at the industry level. Third, given industry-level differences in competitive environments, we show how the value appropriation of capabilities that firms have developed using IT depends on industry type, with hi-tech and information services industries exhibiting lower profit returns.","[Neirotti, Paolo; Paolucci, Emilio] Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn, Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Neirotti, P (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn, Turin, Italy.",paolo.neirotti@polito.it,"Paolucci, Emilio/AFD-5843-2022","Paolucci, Emilio/0000-0003-1249-8179",,,,,88,9,9,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

I use structural econometric methods to examine these anti-competitive concerns in the Spanish mortgage market. I estimate a mixed-logit model of mortgage demand and recover bank-level cost information with a strategic model of price competition. Counterfactual experiments reveal that the observed increase in concentration is associated only with small variations in mortgage rates and market shares, staying far from collusive levels. This moderate change in industry conduct implies a small direct effect of consolidation on bank exposures to mortgage risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We model EU membership as a reduction in 'distance' between countries. Precise predictions about reaction functions' intercepts and slopes are derived. In particular we find that joining the Union lowers the intercept and that all countries react more to member countries than they do to non-members. These predictions are largely confirmed using a panel data set of statutory corporate tax rates on Western European countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that foreign aid may worsen the recipient nation's terms of trade. Furthermore, it may also raise illegal immigration, if the terms of trade effect on immigration flows dominates the other effects identified in our analysis. Empirical analysis of the effect of foreign aid on illegal immigration to the USA broadly supports the predictions of our theoretical model. Foreign aid worsens the recipient's terms of trade. While the terms of trade effect tends to reduce illegal immigration, countervailing effects are found to dominate. The paper contributes to the related literature by establishing that there are unintended consequences of foreign aid and, while some of them are reminiscent of the classical transfer problem, others are new and arise as a result of endogenous illegal immigration flows.","[Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Chambers, Dustin; Munemo, Jonathan] Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University,"Munemo, J (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",bandyopadhyay@stls.frb.org,"Chambers, Dustin L/A-8328-2009; Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/I-5739-2016","Chambers, Dustin L/0000-0001-7722-2240; Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/0000-0003-1626-6543",,,,,14,3,3,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The firm may induce legislators to support the policy by suggesting that it is more likely to invest in a district where voters or their representative support the policy.

Within this context, we find strong evidence that firms choosing to over-invest in financial transparency are rewarded with enhanced liquidity, as measured by lower bid-ask spreads.

We use this natural experiment to examine the effect of government guarantees on bank risk-taking. The results suggest that banks whose government guarantee was removed reduced credit risk by cutting off the riskiest borrowers from credit. Using a difference-in-differences approach we show that none of these effects are present in a control group of German banks to whom the guarantee was not applicable. Furthermore, savings banks adjusted their liabilities away from risk-sensitive debt instruments after the removal of the guarantee, while we do not observe this for the control group. We also document that yield spreads of savings banks' bonds increased significantly right after the announcement of the decision to remove guarantees, while the yield spread of a sample of bonds issued by the control group remained unchanged. The evidence implies that public guarantees may be associated with substantial moral hazard effects.","[Gropp, Reint] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Gruendl, Christian] EBS Business Sch, Oestrich Winkel, Germany; [Guettler, Andre] Univ Ulm, D-89069 Ulm, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; European Business School (EBS) University; Ulm University,"Gropp, R (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,"Guettler, Andre/0000-0003-2743-5250",,,,,42,112,119,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

The DMS is the best overall across all forecast horizons. While some predictors matter more than others over the forecast horizons, there are few that stand the test of time. The US-China interest rate differential has a superior predictive power among the 13 predictors considered, followed by the nominal effective exchange rate and the interest rate spread for most of the forecast horizons.

Using a sample of 4,540 Korean ventures in 2002 we investigated the effects of three firm characteristics-resources, industry, and regional location-on firm performance. Results indicate that firms started by male entrepreneurs, compared to female, have greater firm assets, compete in high-technology manufacturing industries, and are more likely to locate in clustered regions. Further, these firm characteristics are positively associated with domestic and international firm performance. Findings suggest firm resource and context characteristics fully mediate the entrepreneur gender-firm performance relationship.

We investigate the introduction of individual choices into a collective pension system without affecting the generally accepted advantages of a collective agreement. Increasing individual choices can be beneficial, as it prevents pension plans from making decisions for the average plan participant that may not be optimal for individual participants. We argue for a system in which individuals choose from a set of low-cost balanced index funds, together with a level of intergenerational guarantees that are exchange-traded. This system maintains the two primary advantages of collective agreements: risk sharing and low implementation costs, while facilitating different risk taking behavior at the individual level. To facilitate individual choices within collective pension schemes, it is important to enhance the transparency associated with intergenerational guarantees to all participants in the scheme, both in terms of their price and quantity. We argue that the current system, in which long-term guarantees are given by the young to the old within a specific fund but not across pension funds, is not transparent and we argue that it can be suboptimal. We propose a system of Pension Guarantee Exchanges (PGEs) that increase transparency and allow pension funds with different age distributions to trade with each other. Knowing the price of such guarantees facilitates the introduction of individual portfolio choices within collective pension schemes.","[Van Binsbergen, Jules H.] Stanford GSB, Stanford, CA USA; [Van Binsbergen, Jules H.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Van Binsbergen, Jules H.] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Broeders, Dirk] Nederlandsche Bank, Supervis Policy Div, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koijen, Ralph S.

Based on Quebec's historical public health-care spending data and mortality rates for 20 age groups over the period 1998 to 2009, an econometric model is developed with the aim of differentiating ordinary health-care spending from end-of-life care expenditures. Numerical simulations reveal that the average annual growth rate of future health-care spending projected over the period 2009-2056 diminishes by about 0.19 to 0.23 percentage points. This implies a cumulative health-care savings of about 8.4 to 10.3 percent in 2056, independent of other health-related factors.","[Dao, Ha; Godbout, Luc] Univ Sherbrooke, Chaire Rech Fiscalite & Finances Publ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Fortin, Pierre] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",University of Sherbrooke; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Dao, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sherbrooke, Chaire Rech Fiscalite & Finances Publ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,3,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Three main results emerge. First, while there is some convergence in country-level market power during the pre-crisis period, the onset of the global crisis has put an end to this process. Second, bank-level market power appears to vary significantly with respect to ownership characteristics. Third, asset quality and capitalization affect differently the margins in the pre-crisis and the crisis periods. While in the pre-crisis period the impacts are similar for all banks regardless of ownership status, in the crisis period non-performing loans have a negative effect and capitalization a positive effect only for domestically-owned banks.

Analyzing 36 Latin American and Caribbean jurisdictions between 1960 and 2010, we find that poor institutional performance by a jurisdiction (AML ratings, blacklists with non-cooperator countries, and corruption indicators) affects negatively the investment ratio to GDP, the FDI ratio to GDP, and financial development (ratio of credit markets to GDP).

In efficient markets, even skilled managers cannot generate excess returns. In less efficient markets, skilled managers can exploit inefficiencies and generate higher performance than unskilled managers. Fund families seem to be aware of the relation between skill, efficiency, and performance, and allocate more skilled managers to inefficient markets. They pursue this strategy when hiring new fund managers and when reassigning managers to funds within the family. Overall, we conclude that fund families allocate fund managers in an efficient way.

That is, banks with high exposure to off-balance sheet activities are able to insulate their loan supply against a monetary policy shock thus creating a buffering effect on monetary transmission. We also suggest that these effects are substantial for small, highly-liquid and well-capitalised banks. The buffering effect of off-balance sheet banking on monetary transmission raises important policy issues, particularly with regard to the effectiveness of monetary policy and the definitions of monetary aggregates.

This is the case of online social networks users, who must disclose a certain amount of personal data in order to gain access to these online services. Taking into account privacy calculus model and the risk/benefit ratio, we propose a model of users' trust in online social networks with four variables. We have adapted metrics for the purpose of our study and we have assessed their reliability and validity. We use a Partial Least Squares (PLS) based structural equation modelling analysis, which validated all our initial assumptions, indicating that our three predictors (privacy concerns, perceived benefits and perceived risks) explain 48% of the variation of users' trust in online social networks, the resulting variable of our study. We also discuss the implications and further research opportunities of our study.","[Catoiu, Iacob; Orzan, Mihai; Iconaru, Claudia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Macovei, Octav-Ionut] Lumina Univ South East Europe, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Catoiu, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mihai.orzan@ase.ro,,,,,,,54,13,14,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,289,302,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300020,0

Here we test experimentally these aspects of shaming theory with a repeated tax-payment game, in which the shaming ritual consisted of displaying the evader's picture in addition to charging monetary sanctions. Results show that when cheating is made public and the contravener is not successively reintegrated, the total amount of cheating is significantly increased compared to when cheating is made public but publicity is immediately followed by reintegration. The former condition is associated with more intense negative emotions related to cheating. This suggests that the employment of a social shaming mechanism may be an effective, albeit very sensitive, tool in the hands of policy makers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

New evidence for Europe,SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Employment growth by size class; Employment creation; Firm employment decisions,SIZE CLASS; DESTRUCTION,"In this paper, we argue why, in our view, the so-called dynamic classification method should be favored when determining the contribution of small businesses towards job creation. First, it is the only method that consistently attributes job creation or loss to the size class in which it actually occurs. In addition, dynamic classification has two other advantages: (1) it is not vulnerable to the so-called regression to the mean bias, and (2) only a small number of aggregated data are required for its application. Using the dynamic classification, we analyze job creation within the different size classes for the 27 Member States of the European Union. Our main findings are as follows. For the EU as a whole, smaller firms contribute on a larger scale towards job creation than do larger firms. Net job creation rates decrease with each firm size class. This pattern occurs in most industries, however, not in all; the manufacturing industry and trade industry show different patterns. At the level of individual countries, the net job creation rate also tends to decrease with each firm size class. However, this relationship is not perfect.","[de Wit, Gerrit; de Kok, Jan] Panteia EIM, NL-2701 AA Zoetermeer, Netherlands",,"de Kok, J (通讯作者)，Panteia EIM, POB 7001, NL-2701 AA Zoetermeer, Netherlands.",j.de.kok@panteia.nl,,,,,,,17,59,79,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We use two definitions to identify fast-growing firms. High-growth firms (HGF) are firms with the highest growth rates, while high-Birch firms (HBF) are the firms that contribute most to job creation. Matching as nonparametric preprocessing is used to construct control groups consisting of firms that were similar in terms of size, age, and industry affiliation to the fast-growing firms. We run survival, persistence, and growth regressions on the balanced data sets. The results point to differences between the two definitions but also show similarities in outcomes. We find that HBFs have a substantially larger probability of repeating their fast-growth event than HGFs. For survival we find small differences between the definitions. With regard to firm growth, we find that growth after the high-growth period is rather modest for both definitions when compared with the growth rates achieved during the fast-growth episode. However, both HBFs and HGFs have much higher growth rates than control firms.","Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Hölzl, W (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",werner.hoelzl@wifo.ac.at,,"Holzl, Werner/0000-0001-8365-9924",,,,,59,95,99,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

This finding is found to be stronger for emerging and developing countries. However, being located near financially very open countries, being in currency unions with creditor countries, or being highly integrated through financial and trade linkages with a 'core' country facilitates net external borrowing. We also find evidence that remoteness affects primarily the gross liability side of the external balance sheet and has a stronger impact on the net equity position than on the net debt position. Consequently, the paper demonstrates the important role of geographic and bilateral factors for a country's net external wealth.","European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Schmitz, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",Martin.Schmitz@ecb.int,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We analyse the consequences of these shocks on the spatial distribution of the population in Northern Sumatra, building on the approach developed by Davis and Weinstein (2002). We conclude that there have been no significant changes in the relative position of regions in Aceh and North Sumatra, considering their population size. Our model of estimated population growth suggests that the twin disasters had only a temporary impact, which supports the locational fundamentals theory. Our results also reveal that the peace deal is important in explaining the dynamics of population growth in the region. Setelah bencana tsunami yang terjadi di Samudra Hindia pada 2004, Sumatra Utara mengalami tiga guncangan (shock): guncangan sebagai dampak negatif dari tsunami itu sendiri dan gempa bumi Nias yang terjadi selanjutnya pada 2005, guncangan positif dari alokasi dana perbaikan yang berjumlah besar, serta guncangan berimplikasi positif akibat perjanjian perdamaian antara pemerintah Indonesia dan Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) yang juga terjadi pada 2005. Penulis menganalisis konsekuensi dari guncangan-guncangan ini pada distribusi spasial dari populasi masyarakat Sumatra Utara dengan menggunakan pendekatan Davis dan Weinstein (2002). Dengan mempertimbangkan ukuran populasinya, penulis menyimpulkan bahwa tidak terjadi perubahan yang signifikan ditinjau dari posisi relatif kabupaten/ kota di Aceh dan Sumatra Utara. Model yang penulis bangun mengenai perkiraan pertumbuhan populasi menyatakan bahwa bencana ganda tersebut hanya memiliki dampak temporer dan oleh karenanya, sesuai dengan teori fundamental lokasi. Hasil penelitian juga menyimpulkan bahwa perjanjian perdamaian dengan GAM merupakan faktor penting yang menjelaskan dinamika pertumbuhan penduduk di daerah kabupaten/ kota.","[Brata, Aloysius G.; de Groot, Henri L.

The employment of Zimbabwean migrants, rather than relatively permanent Venda families, suggests a potentially greater variety of people participating in the sexual economy. While families as units of employment have declined, black supervisors increasingly serve as a primary locus of coercion on the farm and in the sexual economy. The monetization of erstwhile paternalistic services places pressure on women to earn income however they can, including transactional sex. Contested interpretations over the causes of infant deaths on the farm, in the form of hygiene, blood-mixing and infanticide, provide an ethnographic framework for a deeper analysis of the sexual economy and its social effects. While the sexual economy presents opportunities for women to increase their income, it also exposes them to the risks of HIV/AIDS and unwanted pregnancies, resulting in contradictory implications for the status of women on farms.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Anthropol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Addison, L (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Anthropol, 131 George St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",lincolnaddison@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,4,4,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Results show plausible evidence of the positive impact of households' membership of farmers' groups on the adoption of improved technologies, particularly in the adoption of techniques such as making use of improved seeds, organic fertilizer and improved livestock breeds. However, for farmers to start making use of inorganic fertilizer, the impact is insignificant unless the farmer decides to use both organic and inorganic fertilizers simultaneously.

Although urban communities are quite capable of responding to frequent disaster events, there is a need for conducting advanced contingency planning to handle extreme events. One reason for conducting contingency planning is to facilitate a rapid emergency response by allowing planners to have more time for advanced preparedness measures. Before an earthquake emergency, planners will be able to consider different risk scenarios in order to develop a coordination structure, identify spatial planning needs for reducing the risk, consider likely post disaster needs, conduct capacity assessment to identify the key resource requirements (both human and physical), identify the critical gaps for immediate action, and define the policy changes/revisions, new strategies and approaches for responding to large city-level emergencies.

In addition to expressing their identity through the everyday choices they make, consumers will often seek new ways in which they can express their personal identity. As a result, consumers can use brands as a relevant mean of self-expression and also as a lifestyle beacon. The purpose of this article is to examine the role of brands in this circumstances and to highlight the possible implications. Using two different experiments, the authors provide strong evidence that customers rely on brands with a desirable brand identity to express their own identity and they tend to prefer brands that are convergent with their identity as the primary mean of expressing an unique image about their personal lifestyle.

To do so we develop a model of a local trade area with an incumbent retail tenant that makes non-contractable specific investment at the time of initial contracting and a monopolist landlord that controls the timing of follow-on entry. We show that a two-part share contract is optimal, in which a positive fraction of sales revenues is passed from the retail tenant to the landlord. The standard percentage rent contract is, however, dominated by an enhanced contract that includes a lump-sum payment made by the landlord to the incumbent tenant at the time of competitive entry.

All the countries are seeking the equilibrium between revenue and expenditure, being important for each of them in promoting a sustainable economic growth. The main responsibility to obtain this balance between revenue and expenditure is held by fiscal policy. Even if many economists believe that, in general, crises are a deviation from the normal trend of the economy, we think that crisis is normality, being directly related to economic stages: recession and expansion. That is the reason for why having a sustainable fiscal policy is important for a country in order to diminish the crisis' negative effects. This paper is emphasizing fiscal policy in European Union (EU) countries, because through keeping the control over the balance between expenditures and revenues, a country is able to promote a stable macroeconomic and financial environment. For this purpose, we use the cointegration relation between revenues and expenditures of each EU country for the period 2000 - 2013. Moreover, we want to see if revenues respond better to shocks caused by structural changes in expenditure, or the opposite case. Another aspect we want to highlight is to see if financial crisis affected the fiscal policy sustainability by analyzing the sustainability of fiscal policy before crisis and the entire period which include the financial crisis.","[Dornean, Adina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania; [Oanea, Dumitru-Cristian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,amartin@uaic.ro; oanea.cristian@gmail.com,"Dornean, Adina/H-7626-2019","Dornean, Adina/0000-0002-8009-4961",,,,,11,0,0,0,12,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-021-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,115,121,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346752000015,0

This complexity of computational algorithms is usually due to the fact that people are unaware of the entire range of possibilities MS Excel offers.

Based on internal research I have conducted while training referents in companies, I have reached the conclusion that about 95 % of them do not know about the possibilities MS Excel provides through VBA. In general, companies which provide regular training for their employees indirectly increase their competitiveness by increasing their employees productivity of work. Although may be quite understandable that a referent who has no experience with programming or algorithmization is unlikely to create his own user functions, the employees should be aware of these possibilities and work together with the ICT department on fulfilling their requirements.

Statistical multilevel models are applied to Swedish National Travel Survey data from 2005-2006. Travel purposes are categorized by considering time-spatial constraints and hypothesized factors of personal freedom of choice. Results indicate that the influence of residential location on daily distance travelled is highly conditional on trip purpose in a nationwide Swedish context. Although statistically significant proportions of the variation in daily distance travelled to work, on service errands, and on weekdays were dependent on residential location, daily travel distances for leisure activities and on weekends varied greatly among people living in the same neighbourhood. From a policy perspective, these results suggest that measures intended to alter the built environment to reduce the volume of travel will be most efficient as regards work trips, while trips taken during free time are unlikely to be much affected. In addition, the multilevel models applied reveal several important interactions between the variation in travel distances across residential locations and individual characteristics of which researchers should be aware, especially when examining service trips.

The authors find that the factors do have significant predictive content, both in and out of sample, for net interest margins but significantly less predictive content for net charge-offs. Overall, it seems reasonable to conclude that the variables used in the Fed's bank stress tests are useful for identifying stress at the industry-wide level.

Even Activity Based Costing is relatively new paradigm in literature in bussiness practice the idea of cost allocation is not new at all but it is just different view of costs than classical accounting. Activity-based costing is based on the concept that products consume activities and activities consume resources. All costs are than allocated to specific products or customers. This concept leads to results which corresponds with reality more than classical costing of direct material and direct labor with overhead added as a plant wide percentage.

This regulation reflects the effort of the EU to support the development of PDO, PGI and TSG at Union level and to ensure their protection in third countries within the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The producers of foodstuffs and agricultural products labelled PDO, PGI and TSG meet the demands of consumers for quality foodstuffs with clearly declared geographical origin. The quality schemes for foodstuffs can thus contribute to the development of rural areas, provide producers with the right tools to better identify and promote their products and protect those producers against unfair practice.

Default funds play a crucial role as a risk mitigant in this framework. Furthermore, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (together abbreviated as CPSS-IOSCO) produced a set of 26 principles for financial market infrastructures. For a CCP to be deemed a qualified CCP, it has to abide by these principles. Clearing member banks with trade exposures to a qualified CCP will get preferential capital treatment under the BCBS framework. None of the principles or the policy framework requires, or forces a CCP to have a default fund. However, regulators prefer CCPs to have default funds in place to enhance their credit risk management practices, as required by principles 4 and 6 of the CPSS-IOSCO, before they will be qualified. We consider the merits of the BCBS's requirements for a clearing house, in a developing country such as South Africa, to become a qualified clearing house and conclude that a CCP with prudent risk management processes and controls, should not be disqualified if a default fund is not established.

In theoretical part both macroeconomic and microeconomic aspects of changes in inventories are discussed in the context of expected and unexpected demand shocks. In empirical part sources of GDP variability are analyzed using trend and cyclical data. Trend variability of changes in inventories is less important for trend GDP variability than in case of cyclical variability and vice versa for cyclical GDP and changes in inventories. Parameters of VAR model of cyclical changes in inventories, savings and import are also estimated. The results show that change in savings is a source of unexpected demand shock with impact on inventories. Reaction of import confirms that savings influence more domestic products consumption than imported products which are more driven by exports.","[Kucera, Lukas; Bruna, Karel] Univ Econ Prague, CZ-10368 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Kucera, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-10368 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",kucera-lukas@email.cz; bruna@vse.cz,"Bruna, Karel/AAD-9178-2020","Bruna, Karel/0000-0003-3690-1364",,,,,23,1,1,0,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In so doing, it acknowledges the importance of the transformations of happiness according to different socioeconomic conditions alongside the urban-rural continuum. The importance for this research stems from the current debate for a more suitable and alternative index, compared to the Gross Domestic Product, which can actually reflect the progress of a society in a more pervasive manner. The study applies content analysis and multivariate statistics in a large scale database of empirical data, undertaken from January 2013 to March 2013 from the Prefecture of Thessaloniki; calculate statistical indicators and quantification of the spatial and inequal distribution of happiness between rural and urban areas.

This theoretic contribution is based on the critical analysis of mainstream economics theories dealing with public goods as market failure (neoclassical economics and neoliberalism) and on the results of own economic experiment examining the free-riding behaviour in the voluntary provision of public goods. The free rider problem is one of the main reasons for government intervention in the market. However, there is an inefficiency of public decision making on public provision and financing of selected goods because of the estimating goods values (ex-post consumer utility) problem. Moreover, the results of economic experiments do not support the pure free rider theory. However, the economic experiment simulates the real public good consumption that is why this paper contains also the survey of consumers' willingness to pay for specific public goods (public library services) in real terms based on the methodology of contingent valuation method.","[Merickova, Beata] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystr, Fac Econ, SK-97590 Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Stejskal, Jan] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, CZ-53210 Pardubice, Czech Republic",Matej Bel University; University of Pardubice,"Mericková, B (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystr, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, SK-97590 Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",beata.merickova@umb.sk; jan.stejskal@upce.cz,"Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/AAN-7235-2021","Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/0000-0002-3187-9201",,,,,54,30,30,0,27,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The objective of the paper is twofold; firstly, to determine the valuation methods used by financiers in determining the value of agricultural land used as collateral, and secondly, to determine the correlation between the agricultural land value and the amount of financing provided. Interviews were conducted with five respondents representing the Land Bank, three of the four largest commercial banks and an agricultural company. It was found that the market value approach and the income capitalisation approach are considered to be the most suitable valuation techniques. It was furthermore found that the amount of finance provided is based on varying percentage adjustments made to the value of agricultural land. The practical policy implication is that it is imperative that reliable governmental statistics on agricultural farm values and sales be re-established to encourage conformity among financiers in market value valuations.","North West Univ, Sch Accounting Sci, Mahikeng, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Middelberg, SL (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Accounting Sci, Mahikeng, South Africa.",sanlie.middelberg@nwu.ac.za,"Middelberg, Susanna Levina/K-7281-2018","Middelberg, Susanna Levina/0000-0002-4196-7002",,,,,39,4,5,0,10,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2014,53.0,3,,,,,101,115,,10.1080/03031853.2014.922033,0.0,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AS5HK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344302200005,0

Secondly, the study analyzes the impact of 10 typical financial factors of listed companies and main shareholder on estimated adverse-selection component. The findings present that asymmetric information is accounted for 25.97% of bid/ask spread in Ho Chi Minh stock exchange during the studied period. Besides, regression results provide strong evidence on the correlation between 10 financial factors of firms and main shareholder with adverse-selection component. Particularly, average daily trading volume, market-to-book ratio and market value have negative relationship with adverse-selection component, whereas positive relationships are found between adverse-selection components and estimated remaining variance, standard deviation.

There is further concern that LGBTQ people may be a highly vulnerable group due to pre-existing social and cultural discrimination. The case is also similar for youth. Much research exists on the needs of children post-disaster but very little addresses those who could be classed as 'young adults.'

The Competing Values Model was employed to diagnose the organizational culture and to illuminate the relationship of culture and motivation in the organization studied. The research has shown that the dominant culture type is Hierarchy (Bureaucracy) while motivation level was found to be low, demonstrating a negative association between the two variables. Also found was a positive relationship between the desired culture (clan) and motivation.

It is assumed that countries that have considerable shale deposits will be better placed in the 21st century competition between states. The United States have one of biggest deposits of shale gas, underscores a domestic production boom and is on the verge of becoming a gas exporter in Western Europe. The United States still has few capabilities to export shale gas to Europe. It would have to build new liquefaction facilities to do that. On the other side, Russia is, for the moment, the energy giant of Europe, its massive exports of natural gas to the area, acting as a powerful political leverage especially on the eastern and central European space. But in Europe, at least 10 countries are believed to hold significant shale gas reserves; among them, Romania is assumed to have huge unconventional gas reserves, whose exploitation could ensure its medium-term energy independence, and combined with newly discovered gas in the Black Sea, and energy efficiency improvement measures, provide not only the energy independence but transform Romania into a regional power pole. The interesting fact is how each country in Europe, will choose to convert resources in shale gas reserves and to exploit them to the benefit of the economy, the society and the environment. Besides some clear positive effects (decreasing energy imports, creating a stronger negotiating position against external (fossil fuel) suppliers and diversifying Europe's energy mix) will shale gas extraction succeed to decrease gas bill for population, by reducing prices, or will it stick only to royalties and fees collection, as well as with some local social and economic effects, with the consequence of prolonged pollution or even potentially devastating effects on the environment? In order that gas-gas competition begins to act effectively and exert a strong competitive pressure on gas import prices in Europe (by changing their base and weaken the link with oil prices, up to a possible decoupling of it) it is necessary that Europe will benefit from a big inflow of gas supplies, shale gas included, from different sources than Russia. This goal requires large investment in large infrastructure projects enabling EU countries access to diverse sources of supply, as well as in interconnections, allowing dissemination of gas within the Union.

We develop a novel measure of VC investors' failure tolerance by examining their willingness to continue investing in underperforming ventures. We find that IPO firms backed by more failure-tolerant VC investors are significantly more innovative and VC failure tolerance is particularly important for ventures that are subject to high failure risk. We show that these results are not driven by endogenous matching between failure-tolerant VC firms and start-ups with high ex ante innovative potential. We also examine the determinants of the cross-sectional heterogeneity in a VC firm's failure tolerance. We find that both capital constraints and career concerns can negatively distort a VC firm's failure tolerance. Less experienced VC firms are more exposed to these distortions, making them less failure tolerant than are more established VC firms.","[Tian, Xuan] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Wang, Tracy Yue] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Wang, TY (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, 321-19th Ave S,Room 3-123, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",wangx684@umn.edu,"Tian, Xuan/JOZ-0963-2023",,,,,,44,423,513,52,482,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

While the overwhelming majority of reforming communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) set out to pursue a path of swift transition to economic liberalism, largely devoid of former welfare state vestiges, certain governments favored amalgams of state interventionism and private enterprise. The key research proposal addressed herein relates to the purported linkage between socioeconomic liberalism and intellectual capital (IC) output. Cognizant of significant limitations (e.g. structural overlap, time lags, amalgamation among the measures), one can detect an intriguing relationship between the two paradigms. Thereby, IC output appears to be - to a large extent - driven by the effectiveness of national strategies. In other words - socioeconomic liberalism per se does not guarantee the growth of intellectual assets. Conversely - state interventionism, if specifically geared to IC creation (or elements of broadly defined immaterial infrastructure), can act as a powerful stimulus for the development of intellectual assets.","[Wisniewski, Piotr] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Corp Finance, Warsaw, Poland; [Dumay, John] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ E4A, Dept Accounting & Corp Governance, Ryde, Australia",Warsaw School of Economics; Macquarie University,"Wisniewski, P (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Corp Finance, Warsaw, Poland.",piotr.wisniewski@sgh.waw.pl; john.dumay@mq.edu.au,"Wisniewski, Piotr/AAV-5199-2020; Dumay, John/A-2262-2014","Wisniewski, Piotr/0000-0002-3255-6180; Dumay, John/0000-0001-6896-850X",,,,,21,0,0,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,326,335,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000040,0

Different from prior strategic management theories, such as Michael Porter's Five Forces, the resource-based view of strategy, strategic conflict approach, the most new theory of dynamic capabilities is aimed to build and adjust firms' competencies and successfully sustain their performance while external environment is changing rapidly. The findings suggest that dynamic capabilities helps a firm sense opportunities in a changing circumstances, and seize them by redistributing existing assets and competencies. Managers of firms should cultivate their strategic insight to sense the change of relational complements in the marketplace. Intangible assets also have a great impact on the performance of the company. And building capabilities are necessary to close the performance and opportunities gap from the leadership model.

Some small and medium sized enterprises experience growth, while others do not. Why? One of the possible explanations is how human capital is developed. The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into how an induction process for new employees affects intellectual capital in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This issue is little researched, especially from the perspective of intellectual capital (IC). Furthermore, this subject seldom receives careful attention from companies. Besides, small business owners / managers might argue that they do not have enough new employees to warrant introducing them to the organization. This is contrary to the view that of the various categories of intellectual capital, human capital is regarded as the most valuable asset. There is a need for induction arrangements in SMEs. A well-planned induction process can help to decrease turnover. It can also help to obtain effective output from the new employees in the shortest possible time. The induction process involves not only newcomers, but also supervisors and co-workers. A staff member who acts as a supervisor (mentor) plays a crucial role in this process. His or her contribution makes it possible to accelerate the progress of new employees up the learning curve. His or her support affects the creation and flow of knowledge in a company. According to the Nonaka and Takeuchi model (SECI), it seems reasonable to assume that the support which new employees receive from the supervisor and co-workers enables socialization, externalization and combination to take place. This in turn should lead to a company's growth. The concept of intellectual capital, which quantifies the knowledge, skills, relationships, processes etc., brings a good schema for analyzing the impact of induction programs and the role of a supervisor (mentor) in particular. The article provides an overview of the literature on an induction process and then analyses the impact of this process on the development of IC in SMEs. The paper focuses on human and structural capital. By using a balanced scorecard concept (Kaplan and Norton, 2001) the article shows how induction arrangements and the role of a supervisor, in particular, affect human capital, customer capital and process capital, and therefore, the value of IC. A theoretical model is proposed to analyze this relationship. Owners and managers in SMEs could benefit from the capability to manage and use induction programs for effective knowledge sharing and the development of IC.","Bogdan Janski Sch Management & Entrepreneurship, Lomza, Poland",,"Zalesna, A (通讯作者)，Bogdan Janski Sch Management & Entrepreneurship, Lomza, Poland.",aleksandrazalesna@wp.pl,,,,,,,37,0,0,1,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,342,349,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000042,0

It is completely new approach to the description and evaluation of the Czech economy even though the effort to include the factor of time in this evaluation is abroad for quite long. In the Czech Republic are these efforts at the beginning. The method used to achieve the goal is based on the Supply and use tables expressed in time units, which is compiled using relevant data sources. The described results inform about the achieving of this goal. The method leads to the compilation of the symmetric time input-output tables. Some problems are discussed and have to be solved before the derivation of the input-output models from the time input-output tables.","[Zbranek, Jaroslav; Fischer, Jakub] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zbranek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague, Czech Republic.",jaroslav.zbranek@vse.cz; fischerj@vse.cz,"Fischer, Jakub/J-7874-2012","Fischer, Jakub/0000-0003-4658-1974",,,,,21,2,2,1,6,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Firstly, the paper presents the background of the EU emissions trading system and an overview of different methods used in current research connected with CO2 emission allowances trading. The great contribution of presented paper is the simulation model. This model consists of submodels like model of emission allowances trading of agents - companies and model of ministerial supervision. Each model is described in terms of unconventional modeling methods (like soft computing and decision making methods). In the discussion part, the possibilities of practical usage of created multiagent simulation model in decision making process in companies and public economics are suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our results suggest that depending upon the index used and the base date chosen for comparison, different implications emerge for the linkage between external sector imbalances, perceived future instability and hence the possible onset of a financial crisis. The implication we drawn is that links between imbalances and best policy response to 2008 crisis asserted by the G20 may be more tenuous than claimed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We argue that the characteristic link between accruals and earnings may be nonlinear, since both the incentives to manipulate income and the practical way to do so depend partially on the relative size of earnings. Given a sample of 15,268 US banks over the period 1996-2011, the main results in this paper suggest that, depending on the size of earnings, bank managers tend to engage in earnings-decreasing strategies when earnings are negative (big-bath), use earnings-increasing strategies when earnings are positive, and use provisions as a smoothing device when earnings are positive and substantial (cookie-jar accounting). This evidence, which cannot be explained by the earnings-smoothing hypothesis, is consistent with the compensation theory. Neglecting nonlinear patterns in the econometric modeling of these accruals may lead to misleading conclusions regarding the characteristic strategies used in earnings management.

These firms beat the capital asset pricing model in periods of increasing aggregate volatility and thereby provide a hedge against aggregate volatility risk. The aggregate volatility risk factor can explain the abnormal return differential between high- and low-disagreement firms. This return differential is higher for firms with abundant real options, and this fact can be explained by aggregate volatility risk. Aggregate volatility risk can also explain why the link between analyst disagreement and future returns is stronger for firms with high short-sale constraints.","Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Barinov, A (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, 438 Brooks Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",abarinov@terry.uga.edu,,"Barinov, Alexander/0000-0003-1199-3274",,,,,25,21,23,3,46,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.
