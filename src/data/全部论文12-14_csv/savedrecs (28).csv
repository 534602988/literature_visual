In most studies to date, farm efficiency is measured by land productivity. Thus, the IR actually measures the relationship between farm size and land productivity. The purpose of this paper is to examine and understand the IR from a novel angle by using multiple definitions of farm efficiency indicators like labor productivity, profit ratio, total factor productivity (TFP) and technical efficiency (TE). Design/methodology/approach - By using the farm-level panel data from Hubei province in China from 1999 to 2003, this paper employs the two-way fixed effect model of panel data and the stochastic frontier analysis of Battese and Coelli model to investigate the relationship between farm size and its production efficiency derived from the multiple definitions of production efficiency indicators including land productivity, labor productivity, profit ratio, TFP and TE. Findings - The study confirmed the IR between land productivity and farm size, as in many formal studies. However, the relationship between farm size and other agricultural efficiency indicators may be positive, negative or uncorrelated at, depending on how the farm efficiency is defined. Therefore, the paper concluded that the relationship between farm size and its production efficiency is mixed. This paper provides economic explanations for the IR through the comprehensive study using the expansion of agricultural efficiency indicators. Practical implications - Because different agricultural efficiency indicators have different policy implications for China's future agricultural and land policy, the findings have tremendous policy implications, particularly in terms of the current debate on large or small farm development strategy, the also so-called go big or small agricultural strategy. In this sense, the Chinese household responsibility system has played a critical role in its agriculture and will continue to play a critical role in terms of social security and social equality. Any reform to this system should proceed with caution. Originality/value - While most existing studies only try to explain the IR from the perspective of land productivity, this paper attempts to propose a novel angle to examine the IR by using multiple definitions of agricultural efficiency and hopes to find some new conclusions.","[Li, Gucheng; Feng, Zhongchao] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [You, Liangzhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Fan, Lixia] Wuhan Polytech Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Wuhan Polytechnic University,"Li, GC (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",lgcabc@yahoo.com.cn,"WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023","You, Liangzhi/0000-0001-7930-8814","National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [70903027]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of China (NCET); Research Project for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China [09YJC790105]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (New Teacher's Fund) [20090146120004]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [2010PY032, 2011PY133]","National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of China (NCET)(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Research Project for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (New Teacher's Fund); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","The research was financially supported by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (No. 70903027), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of China (NCET), the Research Project for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China (No. 09YJC790105), the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (New Teacher's Fund, No. 20090146120004), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (No. 2010PY032, 2011PY133).

This paper aims to make a measurement of agricultural bilateral trade costs of China. Design/methodology/approach - Based on Novy model, this paper makes a measurement of agricultural bilateral trade costs before and after China joining the WTO (1995-2007). Findings - This paper finds that China's agricultural trade costs with its five major trade partners have not got a pronounced downward trend during 1995-2007. In ascending order, these are: Malaysia, the USA, Japan, Brazil and Argentina in 2007. Otherwise, there is an obvious corresponding relationship between the trade potential and costs of agricultural products, which is that high costs lead to inadequate trade. With a simple regression, distance and free trade agreement are found to be main factors influencing agricultural trade costs. Originality/value - Based on the revised gravity model, this paper especially calculates the agricultural bilateral trade costs before and after China joining the WTO, which expands the understanding of trade costs in an industrial perspective. It can prove the agricultural market opening extent, and also help us to learn more about how China participates in the division of the world farm produce market.","[Wen, Simei; Zheng, Jing; Liu, Xiaoli] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University,"Zheng, J (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",bettyzheng@scau.edu.cn,"Liu, Xiaoli/HGE-7614-2022",,,,,,23,6,6,3,46,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The results of the adoption analysis confirm that size, education as well as specialization are positively correlated with early adoption. In addition, these results also show that farms that are mostly worked by family labor but hire some off-farm labor are more likely to adopt GM seeds earlier in the diffusion process. The productivity analysis demonstrates the superiority of stacked varieties. At the same time, we find no evidence of a direct impact of experience on yields. Given the previously documented impact of early adoption on the use of stacked varieties, we conclude that experience plays a role through the adoption of these new technologies but does not play a role in allowing the producer to use the technology more efficiently, once it has been adopted.","[Aldana, Ursula] Inst Estudios Peruanos, Lima, Peru; [Barham, Brad; Foltz, Jeremy] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Useche, Pilar] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Aldana, U (通讯作者)，Inst Estudios Peruanos, Horacio Urteaga 694, Lima, Peru.",utaldana@gmail.com,"Foltz, Jeremy/AAX-6903-2021",,"Program on Agricultural Technology Studies core budget, a UW-Hatch grant; Illinois Missouri Biotechnology Alliance grant from the USDA","Program on Agricultural Technology Studies core budget, a UW-Hatch grant; Illinois Missouri Biotechnology Alliance grant from the USDA","This work was funded through the Program on Agricultural Technology Studies core budget, a UW-Hatch grant and the Illinois Missouri Biotechnology Alliance grant from the USDA.

As one of the largest biofuel markets worldwide, the German biodiesel market is of particular interest. It has grown rapidly since the beginning of the new millennium, with this growth being driven mainly by political interventions. Vertical price transmission channels along the biodiesel supply chain are analyzed in this study. We examine the relationship between diesel and biodiesel prices, and between rapeseed oil, soy oil, and biodiesel prices between 2002 and 2008. Due to pronounced changes in market conditions and the policy framework, a regime-dependent Markov-switching vector error-correction model is used. The regimes are characterized by markedly different price adjustment behaviors. Before 2005 and from late 2007 onward, a regime characterized by the strong orientation of biodiesel prices toward diesel prices dominates. Between 2005 and 2007, biodiesel and rapeseed oil prices are mutually interdependent. Frequent switches between the regimes of the price dynamics during this period indicate a high extent of uncertainty and instability in the market.","[Ihle, Rico] Univ Gottingen, Chair Agr Policy, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Busse, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Chair Agr Market Anal, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Ihle, R (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Chair Agr Policy, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",rihle@gwdg.de,"Ihle, Rico/AAI-9565-2020; Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009","Ihle, Rico/0000-0002-7970-7054; Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346",Federal State of Lower Saxony; Georg-August-Universitat Gottingen,Federal State of Lower Saxony; Georg-August-Universitat Gottingen,Rico Ihle thanks the Centre for Statistics at the Georg-August-Universitat Gottingen and the Federal State of Lower Saxony for providing a Georg-Christoph-Lichtenberg PhD scholarship.,,40,34,36,0,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Findings show that the certification of coffee cooperatives has in total a low impact on small-scale coffee producers livelihoods mainly due to (1) low productivity, (2) insignificant price premium, and (3) poor access to credit and information from the cooperative. Differences in production and organizational capacities between the local cooperatives are mirrored in the extent of the certification benefits for the smallholders. Good cooperatives have reaped the benefits of certification, whereas bad ones did not fare well.

Our findings show that improvements in technical efficiency would result in both lower production costs and better environmental performance. It is, however, not costless for farms to move from their current operation to the environmentally efficient operation. On average, this movement would increase production costs by 119% but benefit the water system through an approximately 69% reduction in eutrofying power (EP). The average estimated cost of each EP kg of aggregate nutrient reduction is approximately one thousand two hundred won. For technically efficient farms, there is a trade-off between cost and environmental efficiency. We also find that the environmental performance of farms varies across farms and regions.

Recently, China has taken various measures including the rural taxation reform (RTR) to promote grain production and to increase farmer incomes. In this study, we investigate whether the Chinese policy of abolishing rural taxation has improved farm households incomes and affected their production decisions. Using household survey data obtained from three regions in China, we estimate the effect of the RTR on farmers income. Results show that the RTR has significantly improved farmers post-tax net income by 9.2% in Shandong, 16.9% in Shanxi and 16.8% in Zhejiang. These increments, mostly from farm income rather than from off-farm income, are much higher than the direct income increase from the tax savings. In addition, we examine the dynamic impact of farmers net income, and find that the RTR has a sustained positive income effect in Shandong and Shanxi, whereas its positive effect in Zhejiang appears temporary. We also examine farmers production responses to the RTR. Results show that farmers in the three regions respond in different ways: farmers in Shandong significantly increase their labour input, farmers in Zhejiang increase intermediate inputs, whereas Shanxi farmers augment their intermediate inputs and enlarge their crop acreage. It appears that the farmers responses to the taxation reform vary due to the agronomic and economic factors in these three regions, suggesting that diverse post-RTR supplemental policies should be implemented in different regions.","[Wang, H.

The static model with discrete non-auctioned quota trade shows that the obligation for quota sellers to entirely stop their production stimulates structural change.

This study is based on the data contained in the Farm Accounting Data Network and covers the first four years following the extension of the European Union in 2004. The adopted units comprised average farms representing 80 regions belonging to eleven countries of the EU-15 and four new EU member states. The estimation of technical efficiency was conducted using the data envelopment analysis, separately for each of the two types of farms taking into account their economic size. The main findings indicate that the highest efficiency is achieved by the biggest farms, but those from the regions belonging to the new EU members at the same time had a low efficiency of scale, while those belonging to the countries. of the EU-15 were operating at a scale close to the optimal. Moreover, it is confirmed that a longer period of farming under relatively stable conditions promotes a higher efficiency independently of the type of farm production. On the other hand, contrary to the relatively common opinion that a higher specialization promotes a higher efficiency, it was found that field crop farms in average are less efficient than mixed farms, although the difference between efficiencies decreases with an increase of their economic size.","[Blazejczyk-Majka, Lucyna] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, PL-61809 Poznan, Poland; [Kala, Radoslaw] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Math & Stat Methods, Poznan, Poland; [Maciejewski, Krzysztof] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Prod Ecol, Poznan, Poland",Adam Mickiewicz University; Poznan University of Life Sciences; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Blazejczyk-Majka, L (通讯作者)，Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Ul Sw Marcin 78, PL-61809 Poznan, Poland.",majkal@amu.edu.pl,"Błażejczyk-Majka, Lucyna/I-6326-2019","Błażejczyk-Majka, Lucyna/0000-0002-4439-8351",Funds for Sciences [111 114034],Funds for Sciences,This paper was supported by the Funds for Sciences 2008-2011 under the grant No. 111 114034.,,22,34,34,0,18,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The review of literature points out the significance of subsidies for the economics of agriculture and also for the evaluation of the financial position and performance of entrepreneurial entities. The current national and supranational approaches to reporting subsidies within the farm accounting and financial statements are analyzed. The result of the analysis is an identification of distortions in the reported production power and the value of the company property, caused by the yield method which is based on the matching principle. This is also negatively reflected in the income tax base of the entities. Therefore, for a more real view of the situation in financial statements, two models suitable for reporting subsidies were proposed. These are based on the capital approach. The new approaches represent a transparent reporting of subsidies by their recipients in the form of a long-term financial source; they do not allow them to report unearned yields and, on the other hand, they do allow them to report a subsidized property at an unreduced purchase cost. Thus it is possible to compare economic data of the particular companies. This also has a positive effect on the burden of the subsidy recipients laid by income taxes.","[Sedlacek, Jaroslav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Kourilova, Jindriska; Psencik, Jiri] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Econ, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Sedlácek, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",sedl@econ.muni.cz,"Sedláček, Jaroslav/AAF-8051-2021","Sedláček, Jaroslav/0000-0001-6238-8619",European funds,European funds,"In the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic, the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy from the European funds and national subsidies is controlled by the State Agricultural Intervention Fund headquartered in Prague.",,18,4,4,0,20,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

An important finding of our study is that small farms have higher household income if they choose both income diversification strategies rather than a single strategy. Results suggest that education, age of the operator, financial condition, and location of the farm are important factors driving income diversification alternatives.

Marketing strategies for such wines are changing in an attempt to tap this increasingly crowded market segment. Despite its importance, the basic wine segment has not been studied in-depth and is often assumed to have no product differentiation. This paper tried to ascertain the existence of a possible degree of heterogeneity within nonpremium wines and to measure, by means of elasticity computation, the relationships among categories of wines aggregated with criteria that go beyond price. A demand system (censored QUAIDS) was estimated, using a statistically representative panel of 6,773 Italian households, to see to what extent, if any, substitution occurs in home consumption of basic wines, which is the main channel of distribution of inexpensive wines in Italy.

Given the irreversibility of migration decisions and uncertainty in the economy, potential migrants might choose to postpone migration, even in the face of positive wage differentials.

Targeted food and beverage taxes and subsidies are prominent examples of such potential intervention strategies. This paper examines the differential effects that taxing sugar-sweetened beverages by calories and by ounces have on beverage demand. To properly measure the extent of substitution and complementarity between beverage products, we developed a fully modified distance metric model of differentiated product demand that endogenizes the cross-price effects. We illustrated the proposed methodology in a linear approximate almost ideal demand system, although other flexible demand systems can also be used. In the empirical application using supermarket scanner data, the product-level demand model consists of 178 beverage products with a combined market share of over 90%. The novel demand model outperformed the conventional distance metric model in non-nested model comparison tests, and in terms of the economic significance of model predictions. In the fully modified model, a calorie-based beverage tax was estimated to cost $1.40 less in compensating variation than an ounce-based tax per 3,500 beverage calories reduced. This difference in welfare cost estimates between two tax strategies is more than three times the difference estimated by the conventional distance metric model. If applied to products purchased from all sources, a 0.04-cent per kcal tax on sugar-sweetened beverages is predicted to reduce annual per capita beverage intake by 5,800 kcal.","[Zhen, Chen] Res Triangle Inst, Food & Nutr Policy Res Program, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Zhen, Chen] New York State NYS Dept Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Brissette, Ian F.] Bur Chron Dis Evaluat & Res, Houston, TX USA; [Ruff, Ryan Richard] NYU, Coll Dent, Dept Epidemiol & Hlth Promot, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Ruff, Ryan Richard] New York City NYC Dept Hlth & Mental Hyg, Bur Chron Dis Prevent & Tobacco Control, Res & Evaluat Unit, New York, NY USA",Research Triangle Institute; New York University,"Zhen, C (通讯作者)，Res Triangle Inst, Food & Nutr Policy Res Program, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",,,,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthy Eating Research [66971]; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [3U58DP001963-01S4]; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institute of Health [1R21HL108121]","Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthy Eating Research(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","Chen Zhen is a research economist in the Food and Nutrition Policy Research Program at Research Triangle Institute, North Carolina.

First, key aspects of the cotton sector institutional environment are discussed, including input and credit access, and producers' organisations. Then, a stochastic frontier production function, which incorporates technical inefficiency effects, is applied to farm level data collected in Benin, Burkina Faso and Mali. The survey includes farmers' evaluations of the cotton sector institutional environment. Results suggest that institutional level features influence producers' TE, besides farm-level characteristics. Cotton growers who report a negative experience with the joint liability programme, who identify the cotton price mechanism or access to credit as the main constraints to performance, and who cultivate more hectares of cereals are technically more inefficient in producing cotton. Findings suggest that cotton farmers in Mali are less technically efficient in producing cotton than in Burkina Faso and Benin. Agricultural development policies focusing on reducing farmers' financial stress, particularly through the establishment of adequate price mechanisms (i.e. higher farm-gate prices and timely payments to farmers) and improvement in the input-credit markets should be encouraged to improve TE in West Africa.","[Theriault, Veronique] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Serra, Renata] Univ Florida, Ctr African Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Michigan State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Theriault, V (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr,Rm 213-B, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",theria13@msu.edu,,,DfID; Irish Aid; FQRSC,DfID; Irish Aid(CGIAR); FQRSC,"We also wish to thank the Editor and two anonymous referees for their helpful suggestions on earlier versions of this article.

Drawing upon a rural household panel data set collected in Zhejiang, Hubei, and Yunnan Provinces from 1995 to 2002, we estimate the effects in two steps. First, we estimate the effect of land fragmentation on labor productivity. Second, we estimate the effect of land fragmentation on off-farm labor supply. The production function results show that land fragmentation indeed leads to lower agricultural labor productivity, implying that land consolidation will make on-farm work more attractive and thus decrease off-farm labor supply. However, the effect of land consolidation on off-farm labor supply is not significant. One likely explanation for this result may be the potentially imperfect labor markets.","[Jia, Lili] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany; [Petrick, Martin] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany",University of Bonn; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Jia, LL (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany.",lili.jia@uni-bonn.de,"Petrick, Martin/AAI-1154-2020; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019",,Pakt fur Innovation und Forschung des Bundes und der Lander,Pakt fur Innovation und Forschung des Bundes und der Lander,"The authors are grateful to Stephan Brosig, Jikun Huang, Heinz Hockmann, Kelly Labar, Daniel Mueller, Scott Rozelle, and Xiaobing Wang for helpful suggestions in the course of conducting the analysis.

Such models ignore the possibility of family members' divergent preferences for non-market goods. This study proposes a novel approach-the collective travel-cost model (CTCM)-to eliciting individual preferences for a non-market good, such as a recreation site, by using revealed preference data. This approach accounts for the intra-household resource allocation and the role of each household member's preferences. We show that the collective travel-cost model can be applied to estimating a recreation demand model that yields individual welfare estimates appropriate for policy analysis of non-market goods, such as the willingness to pay to access a recreation site.

The large gap between dairy farm-gate price and consumer price gives rise to worries that China's dairy industry is characterized by strong degree of oligopoly. The purpose of this paper is to take the dairy processing industry as an epitome of China's food industry, and use a new approach to investigate whether it is oligopolistic and/or oligopsonistic. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a new proposed Primal-Dual Solow Residual model, the authors first test the hypothesis that there are significant oligopoly and oligopsony powers in China's dairy sector, and the latter is stronger. The authors then turn to measure these two kinds of market power using regressions of the model. Findings - The estimation results show that firms in the sector have both strong oligopoly and oligopsony power, but the latter is stronger than the former. Meanwhile, with the continuous reinforcement of competition in China's dairy sector, market power in both the upstream and downstream has decreased slightly. Originality/value - This paper is the first to simultaneously test oligopoly and oligopsony power in China's dairy sector. The empirical results explicitly imply that more attention should be paid to the raw milk purchase market.","[Dai, Jiawu; Wang, Xiuqing] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Wang, XQ (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",wangxq@cau.edu.cn,"Dai, Jiawu/AAV-5017-2021",,,,,,35,12,13,3,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial to measure the effect of life teacher training on student health, behavior, and academic performance among 839 boarding students in ten central primary boarding schools in Shaanxi. And the authors also tried to identify why or why not life teacher training works. Both descriptive and multivariate analysis are used in this paper. Findings - The authors find significant improvements in health and behavior. Specifically, compared to boarding students in control schools, 15 percent fewer students in treatment schools reported feeling cold while sleeping at night. The results also showed that student tardiness and misbehaviors after class declined significantly by 18 and 78 percent, respectively. However, the in-service life teacher training program had no measurable impact on boarding students' BMI-for-age Z-score, number of misbehaviors in class, and academic performance. The analysis suggests that improved communication between life teachers and students might be one mechanism behind these results. Originality/value - This is the first empirical work which explored how to improve the welfare of boarding students via their life teachers. Because of the sudden increase in boarding students in rural China, it is almost certain that school personnel lack experience in managing boarding students. As such, one promising approach to improving student outcomes might be in-service training for life teachers.","[Yue, Ai; Shi, Yaojiang; Chang, Fang; Yang, Chu; Wang, Huan] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Yi, Hongmei; Luo, Renfu; Liu, Chengfang; Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, CCAP, IGSNRR, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chu, James Yanjey; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",Northwest University Xi'an; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Stanford University,"Yi, HM (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, CCAP, IGSNRR, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yihm.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022","Chu, James Y./0000-0003-2702-470X; Yi, Hongmei/0000-0002-6934-0498","National Natural Science Foundation of China [70903064, 71033003, 7333010728]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge the funding of National Natural Science Foundation of China (70903064, 71033003, 7333010728).",,37,8,8,3,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

During this time, policies changed from liberalization, with both private and public sector participation, to a government monopoly over imports along with exclusive marketing through farmers' cooperatives. This article presents estimates of detail costs and margins in the value chain, econometrically derived profitability and yield responses, as well as costs of the government's fertilizer promotion policies. Results suggest that (a) irrespective of the methods of calculation, fertilizer use in major cereal is profitable; (b) while there is no official subsidy program, fertilizer promotion has involved large fiscal costsestimated at US$40 million per year since 2008; and (c) there has been a mismatch between government's policy targets and the effective fertilizer demand, resulting in large carryover stock with estimated implicit costs of US$30 million per year during 2008-2011.

The emergence of the bioeconomy is a continuing evolutionary process of transition from systems of mining nonrenewable resources to farming renewable ones. This transition benefits from the modern tools of molecular biology that have expanded the human capacity to breed new organisms and utilize them to increase productivity in agriculture and fisheries as well as produce a wide array of products that were extracted in the past. This transition is leading to the integration of the agricultural sector with the energy and mineral sectors. The introduction of biotechnology has already improved the productivity of medicine as well as agriculture but, in the case of agriculture, has encountered resistance and regulatory constraints. The evolution of the bioeconomy requires continuous public investment in research and innovation as well as the establishment of a regulatory framework and financial incentives and institutions that would lead to continuous private sector investment in the development and commercialization of new products. One of the biggest challenges is the development of a regulatory framework that would control possible human and environmental externalities from new biotechnology products and, at the same time, not stifle innovation.","[Zilberman, David; Kim, Eunice; Kirschner, Sam; Kaplan, Scott] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Reeves, Jeanne] Cotton Inc, Cary, NC 27513 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Cotton Incorporated,"Zilberman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Giannini Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",zilber11@berkeley.edu,,"Kaplan, Scott/0000-0002-5492-4693",EBI; Cotton Inc.,EBI; Cotton Inc.,The research that led to this paper was supported by the EBI and Cotton Inc.,,27,60,63,2,88,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Only one out of seven exited poverty by migrating to the big cities, even though those moving to the city experienced on average faster consumption growth. Further analysis of a much larger cross-country panel of 51 developing countries cannot reject that rural diversification and secondary town development lead to more inclusive growth patterns than metropolitization. Indications are that this follows because more of the poor find their way to the rural nonfarm economy and secondary towns, than to distant cities. The development discourse would benefit from shifting beyond the rural-urban dichotomy and focusing more instead on how best to urbanize and develop its rural nonfarm economy and secondary towns.","[Christiaensen, Luc] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Todo, Yasuyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",The World Bank; University of Tokyo,"Christiaensen, L (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",lchristiaensen@worldbank.org,"Todo, Yasuyuki/N-2336-2019","De Weerdt, Joachim/0000-0002-5572-3332",,,,,49,78,91,8,165,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In this article, we study the impact of basis risk on the demand for index insurance under risk and compound risk aversion. We simulate the impact of basis risk on the demand for index insurance by Malian cotton farmers using data from field experiments that reveal the distributions of risk and compound risk aversion. The analysis shows that compound risk aversion depresses demand for a conventional index insurance contract some 13 percentage points below what would be predicted based on risk aversion alone. We then analyze an innovative multiscale index insurance contract that reduces basis risk relative to conventional, single-scale index insurance contract. Simulations indicate that demand for this multiscale contract would be some 40% higher than the demand for an equivalently priced conventional contract in the population of Malian cotton farmers.

Age and education have a significant impact on consumer demand for diet quality, but income does not. The own-price elasticities of demand for diet quality are inelastic.

Wine can be considered an ideal product to examine these issues given consumers' highly subjective sensory preferences towards wine, and a winegrape production process that is relatively intensive in the use of chemical inputs for the control of disease and infection. Semi-dry Riesling wines made from field research trials following environmentally friendly canopy management practices were utilised in a lab experiment to better understand preferences for environmental attributes in wine. A combined sensory and monetary evaluation framework explicitly considered asymmetric order effects. Empirical results revealed that sensory effects dominate extrinsic environmental attributes. Once consumer willingness to pay (WTP) was conditioned on a wine's sensory attributes, the addition of environmentally friendly information did not affect their WTP; however, adding sensory information significantly influenced WTP initially based only on environmental attributes. The results confirm the idea that promoting environmentally friendly winegrape production practices would increase demand and lead to higher premiums for the products, but are only sustainable if consumers' sensory expectations are met on quality.","[Schmit, Todd M.; Rickard, Bradley J.; Taber, John] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Schmit, TM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",tms1@cornell.edu,,,"USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service funds through the Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education grant programme [NYC-123266]; Institute for Social Sciences Small Grant Competition at Cornell University; USDA funds","USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service funds through the Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education grant programme; Institute for Social Sciences Small Grant Competition at Cornell University; USDA funds","The authors would like to thank Justine Vanden Heuvel, Anna Katharine Mansfield, Gavin Sacks, Wayne Wilcox and Tim Martinson for their assistance in developing the winegrape production and winemaking information for the laboratory experiments.

Their study demonstrated that the rents extracted during the initial years of the limited-entry program were gradually dissipated as a result of overcapacity and price declines caused by aquaculture. In this study, the Valderrama and Anderson (2010) econometric model is used as a framework to evaluate the economic benefits of rights-based management in the Bristol Bay fishery. The analysis illustrates the efficiency gains that management schemes such as harvesting cooperatives could generate by lowering the level of effort in the fishery. Given that growth in world aquaculture is expected to continue in the foreseeable future, improving efficiency in the fisheries sector is an essential step to restore some of the rents lost to competition with the aquaculture sector. Lorsque la peche au saumon rouge est evaluee selon des criteres d'ordre biologique, elle figure parmi les peches commerciales les mieux gerees de la planete. Et pourtant, la performance economique de cette peche s'est deterioree au cours des dernieres annees en raison de la baisse prolongee des prix au bateau attribuable a la croissance exponentielle de la salmoniculture dans le monde. Ces prix ont atteint des creux historiques vers la fin des annees 1990 et le debut des annees 2000. En s'appuyant sur le modele de libre acces reglemente aux ressources renouvelables elabore par Homans et Wilen (1997), Valderrama et Anderson (2010) ont effectue un examen approfondi du jeu des forces du marche dans le cas de la peche au saumon rouge dans la baie de Bristol et du secteur mondial de l'aquaculture. Leur etude a demontre que les revenus realises au cours des premieres annees du programme a acces limite se dissipaient progressivement en raison de la surcapacite et de la baisse des prix attribuables a l'aquaculture. Dans la presente etude, nous avons utilise le modele econometrique de Valderrama et Anderson (2010) pour evaluer les avantages economiques de la gestion fondee sur des droits dans le cas de la peche dans la baie de Bristol. Les resultats de notre etude montrent les gains d'efficience que des modeles de gestion, comme celui des cooperatives de pecheurs, pourraient generer en diminuant les efforts de peche. Compte tenu du fait que l'aquaculture mondiale est appelee a progresser dans un avenir previsible, ameliorer l'efficacite du secteur des peches demeure une etape fondamentale pour recuperer une partie des revenus perdus au profit des concurrents du secteur de l'aquaculture.","[Valderrama, Diego] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Anderson, James L.] World Bank, Agr & Rural Dev, Washington, DC 20433 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; The World Bank,"Valderrama, D (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",dvalderrama@ufl.edu; janderson8@worldbank.org,,"Valderrama, Diego/0000-0003-1497-2954; Anderson, James L./0000-0003-2942-8345",Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station (RIAES) [W-1004C],Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station (RIAES),"Financial support for this research was provided by the Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station (RIAES), Hatch Regional Project W-1004C.

Governments make efforts to facilitate the use of research in the development of policy advice. This address reviews some of the literature on the policy relevance of research, with a focus on agricultural economics research. Based on the literature, the address identifies 20 elements that researchers may want to consider when seeking to make their research relevant for policy advice. The importance of each of the elements is highlighted by using them to examine the views expressed by 41 analysts and policy advisors in six symposium settings organized over five years on the topic of What makes agricultural economics research relevant for policy advice? The key elements for researchers include understanding the policy-making process, communicating effectively with the right audiences, doing high-quality work, and paying attention to timeliness and windows of opportunity. The application of the elements is illustrated by several examples of policy-relevant research. The address suggests that the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society (CAES) seek to increase the valuation of policy relevance in research funding and academia and outlines steps the CAES could take to better enable individual members to increase the policy relevance of their research.

Using data from 1,079 consumers from the United States, we examined consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for Canadian and Australian beefsteaks. We also estimated WTP for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)tested traceability-enabled, tenderness-assured, and natural beef. The results from both a mixed logit model and a latent class model (LCM) revealed unobserved taste heterogeneity and important differences in the WTP between the imported and domestic steak. The LCM, for instance, estimated the range of discount needed for consumers to switch from U.S. to Canadian steak as $1.09 to $35.12 per pound. This strongly suggested that U.S. consumers prefer domestic-originated beef to imported beef. In addition, consumers were found to be willing to pay significant amount for BSE-tested, traceability-enabled, and tenderness-assured beef.

Using propensity scores, we apply the (a) stratification-multilevel method of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects; and the (b) matching-smoothing method of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects proposed by Xie et al. We find that the incidence of higher yields, lower insecticide use, and reduced seed utilization in the Philippines diminishes progressively as a farmer's propensity to adopt Bt corn increases. Farmers with a low propensity to adopt Bt are those who farm smaller, nonirrigated farms located farther from seed suppliers and farmers without previous training on pest identification. In most cases, while these farmers are typically poorer farmers in smaller parcels, cannot afford irrigation and are situated in remote areas away from easily accessible seed suppliers, there is no evidence, however, that profits differ across farmers with varying propensities to adopt the Bt variety.","[Mutuc, Maria] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Rejesus, Roderick M.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Yorobe, Jose M., Jr.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Dept Agr Econ, Laguna 4031, Philippines",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; North Carolina State University; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Mutuc, M (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",maria.mutuc@ttu.edu,,,,,,,19,14,16,0,114,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Using data provided by the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) for six crop years, results indicate that producers were not able to profitably use all marketing contracts offered by the CWB, earlier pricing tended to generate better performance, there was a negative relationship between activeness and performance (suggesting overconfidence in marketing skills), and performance was generally worse in volatile crop years. Further analysis reveals some of these findings differ when outperforming and underperforming producers are investigated separately, particularly with respect to activeness and volatility.","[Mattos, Fabio L.; Fryza, Stefanie A.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Mattos, FL (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",,,,,,,,10,1,2,0,15,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

Meanwhile, the demand for agricultural labor in Mexico is rising. In the future, U.S. agriculture will compete with Mexican farms for a dwindling supply of farm labor. Since U.S. domestic workers are unwilling to do farm work and the United States can feasibly import farm workers from only a few countries in close geographic proximity, the agricultural industry will eventually need to adjust production to use less labor. The decline in foreign labor supply to farms in the United States ultimately will need to be accompanied by farm labor conservation, switching to less labor intensive crops and technologies, and labor management practices that match fewer workers with more farm jobs.","[Taylor, J.

The TCM component of the study produced average per-trip consumer surplus (CS) values of $39 and $18 for single- and multiple-site visitors, respectively, for each botanic garden, resulting in an estimate of approximately $194 million for the total social welfare generated by trips to the three sites. Marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for access to botanic gardens was also investigated through payment vehicles of entry fees or higher parking charges using the CVM component. The analysis revealed a positive mean WTP of between $3 and $5 per trip per person. The difference between the CVM and TCM results reflect the different underlying concepts of value under investigation: average CS per visit for the TCM and the utility arising from a marginal visit for the CVM. Marginal changes in CS from the TCM were derived. The confidence intervals from the TCM marginal values overlap the WTP estimates from the CVM. These findings will be useful for resource management decisions in the botanic gardens collection in Australia.","[Mwebaze, Paul; Bennett, Jeff] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Mwebaze, P (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",mpaul48@hotmail.com,"Mwebaze, Paul/J-5905-2013; Bennett, Jeff W/A-1084-2008",,"Australian Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities through the Commonwealth Environment Research Facilities","Australian Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities through the Commonwealth Environment Research Facilities(Australian Government)","This study was funded by the Australian Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities through the Commonwealth Environment Research Facilities.

The analysis assesses economies of diversification using a certainty equivalent measure. It identifies two components: one associated with expected income, and one associated with risk exposure. This integrates two lines of research explored in previous literature: economies of scope and risk management. We examine the roles played by complementarity, scale and concavity effects in economies of diversification. The approach is applied to diversification decisions made on Ethiopian farms, with a focus on production uncertainty. The econometric analysis finds large complementarity benefits, providing incentives to diversify. But this is tempered by (non)-concavity effects that provide incentives to specialise. The analysis also documents how risk affects diversification, including both variance and skewness effects. It provides new insights on economic tradeoffs between farm diversification and specialisation.","[Di Falco, Salvatore] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Chavas, Jean-Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Di Falco, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.difalco@lse.ac.uk,,,Ethiopian Development Research Institute,Ethiopian Development Research Institute,"Jean-Paul Chavas is Professor, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, Taylor Hall, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA.

The impact of increased number of CEECs agro-food product varieties on agro-food export to the EU is positive.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia; [Ferto, Imre] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary",University of Primorska; Corvinus University Budapest; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Cankarjeva 5,Pp 345, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si; imre.ferto@uni-corvinus.hu,"Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372; Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964;",National Scientific Research Funds; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [37868],National Scientific Research Funds; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),This paper was prepared within the bilateral project between the Hungarian and Slovenian Academies of Sciences entitled 'Agro-food trade between Central-European Countries and the European Union'.

In the case of the time domain, the analysis identification of cycle lengths is based on the dating process of the growth business cycle. Thus, the right and left variant of the naive techniques and the Bry-Boschan algorithm are applied. In the case of the frequency domain, the analysis of the cyclical structure trough spectrum estimate via the periodogram and the autoregressive process are suggested. Results from both domain approaches are compared. On their bases, recommendations for the cyclical structure identification of the growth business cycle of the Czech Republic are formulated. In the time domain analysis, the evaluation of the unity results of detrending techniques from the identification turning point points of view is attached.

The purpose of this paper is to study farmers' perception of pesticide residues, as well as the main factors affecting their perception from the viewpoint of farmers. Additionally, this research attempts to explore the basic characteristics of pesticide residues arising in the process of producing agricultural products under the prevailing policy background, so as to provide decision-making references for the Chinese government to deepen the security management system of agricultural products. Design/methodology/approach - The structural equation model (SEM) is an analytical tool for the observation and treatment of latent variables that are difficult to observe directly, and for the consideration of inevitable errors. This paper investigates the main factors affecting farmers' perception of pesticide residues in the investigated regions based on the SEM and samples of 241 farmers in six counties (cities and regions) of three districts in the Jiangsu Province of China. Findings - According to the research, regional difference, farmers' gender, age, years of education, pesticide training and their own demand for safe agricultural products had different influences on their perception of pesticide residues. Additionally, it was difficult to measure the influence of family characteristics on farmers' perception of pesticide residues. Although the present paper only shows a preliminary study, its conclusion provides a reference value for the Chinese government to deepen the reform of the quality and safety regulatory system of agricultural products. Originality/value - There are many similar studies in overseas countries, but the application of SEM in the study of the main factors affecting farmers' perception of pesticide residues has not been completely reported previously in domestic literatures. The research assumption of this paper has practically verified that corresponding research conclusions of foreign scholars in this field have universality in China.","[Wu, Linhai] Jiangnan Univ, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Hou, Bo] Jiangnan Univ, Coll Food, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Hou, Bo] Hunan Univ Sci & Engn, Coll Life Sci & Chem Engn, Yongzhou, Peoples R China; [Hou, Bo] Anhui Univ Sci & Engn, Bengbu, Anhui, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University,"Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi, Peoples R China.",wlh6799@vip.163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71073069]; Ministry of Education of China [10YJC790240]; Jiangnan University [20090120],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Jiangnan University","This paper was supported by Study of the Dynamic Decision Model of Multiple Information Sources in the Process of Traceable Food System Construction, a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Approval No. 71073069), and Study of Farmers' Pesticide Application Behavior, and Plant Area and Export Quality of Agricultural Products, a general program of humanities and social sciences of the Ministry of Education of China in 2010 (Project Approval No.10YJC790240), and the doctoral fund of Jiangnan University (Project Approval No.20090120) in 2009.

Theory suggests that increased liquidity as well as changing time allocations resulting from migration may influence obesity outcomes. Natural disasters are used as an identification strategy. Results suggest that older boys in urban areas are more likely to become obese when either a male or female migrates from the household, while girls in urban areas are less likely to become obese. Both changes in food expenditure patterns and time use changes after migration are likely pathways that affect childhood obesity. While there are some changes in food expenditures, we find more importantly that urban girls engage in more housework and screen time after migration, whereas urban teen boys do not substitute for adult work as much as girls. These changes in strenuous activities, particularly for girls, likely explain the differential effect that migration has on boys' and girls' obesity outcomes in Mexico.","[Damon, Amy] Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN 55406 USA; [Kristiansen, Devon] Univ Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",Macalester College; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Damon, A (通讯作者)，Macalester Coll, 1600 Grand Ave, St Paul, MN 55406 USA.",adamon@macalester.edu,,,,,,,34,5,6,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

After introducing a novel stock-to-use proxy that may be used to represent inventory variations at the intra-month level, we show that speculators, contrary to index investors, are sensitive to commodity-specific fundamental information. Their endogeneity to commodities markets hinders the estimation of their market impact. Regarding the market impact of index flows, the endogeneity problem is alleviated in two ways: first, we restrict the scope to agricultural commodities, for which index flows are more exogenous to market prices; second, we introduce two novel instrumental variables that are computed from index flows outside the market under analysis. We find that index investment flows are offset by commercial players, not speculators. The serial correlation of index flows may explain the tendency of speculators to synchronize with index investors. There is strong evidence of an index flows' impact in those commodities markets where speculative and index positions are the most correlated. The market impact of index flows is located in periods of liquidity stress, as is the correlation between speculative and index positions. Overall, our results demonstrate an impact of index investors on some agricultural prices and suggest that the synchronicity between speculative and index positions is an important determinant of this impact.","[Guilleminot, Benoit; Ohana, Jean-Jacques] Riskelia, F-75008 Paris, France; [Ohana, Steve] ESCP Europe, F-75011 Paris, France",heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Ohana, S (通讯作者)，ESCP Europe, 79 Ave Republ, F-75011 Paris, France.",sohana@escpeurope.eu,,,,,,,32,15,16,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

National self-sufficiency in food, especially the main staple, rice, is a core objective of economic policy. Poverty reduction is also a core policy objective. Since the 1970s, Indonesia has used agricultural input subsidies, especially on fertilizer, to stimulate agricultural production, largely in pursuit of the goal of rice self-sufficiency. More recently, it has also used output protection, especially in rice, for the same purpose. This article utilizes a multisectoral, multihousehold general equilibrium model of the Indonesian economy to study the trade-offs between the goals of self-sufficiency and poverty reduction when two alternative means are used to achieve them: a fertilizer subsidy, on the one hand, and output protection, on the other. It does this by analyzing the aggregate and distributional effects of these two sets of policies and by comparing their effects with nonintervention. The analysis shows that, in terms of its effects on poverty, a fertilizer subsidy can be a more effective instrument for achieving the goal of rice self-sufficiency than final product import restrictions.","[Warr, Peter] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Yusuf, Arief Anshory] Padjadjaran State Univ, Ctr Econ & Dev Studies CEDS, Bandung 40115, Indonesia",Australian National University; Universitas Padjadjaran,"Warr, P (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Coombs Bldg 09, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",Peter.Warr@anu.edu.au,"Yusuf, Arief Anshory/AAA-5839-2020","Yusuf, Arief Anshory/0000-0002-3126-3853",,,,,23,17,23,2,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

With nationally-representative, Living Standards Measurement Survey-type data for the years 1998, 2001, and 2005, we employ Markov chain methods within an information-theoretic framework in an attempt to advance the analysis of structural transformation in developing countries beyond the examination of trends in mean farm sizes or Gini coefficients, approaches ill-suited to the detection of the apparent complexities of structural change. Further, while Markov chain analysis has witnessed relatively widespread application in the investigation of structural transformation in developed nations, we offer a novel methodological extension by allowing for the simultaneous exploration of structural transformation across multiple dimensions-namely, structural change in both the distribution and use of agricultural landholdings-as well as the incorporation of microlevel determinants of farm size and land use change. The results of the inquiry, above all, suggest that Nicaragua's agricultural and livestock sector is characterized by a definitive persistence of smallholders. While a moderate tendency toward bifurcation in the distribution of landholdings would appear to obscure any immediate relationship between operational landholdings and land productivity, we contend that such trends are, in fact, consistent with the often observed inverse farm size-productivity relationship.","Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Inter-American Development Bank,"Henderson, H (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",heathh@iadb.org,,,Info-Metrics Institute at American University,Info-Metrics Institute at American University,"The author would like to thank Paul Winters, Amos Golan, and Alan Isaac for the numerous comments and discussions they so graciously provided throughout the duration of the project.

Employing an adoption index for each farm and a time trend with farm-level data on production costs of grain corn and soybeans from 2000 to 2007, a translog cost function and the associated input-share equations are estimated. The use of the adoption index improves the estimates of technological change and multifactor productivity (MFP) growth. The results demonstrate that the adoption of GE corn and soybean reduced the variable costs of production by 0.62% per year. The MFP of corn and soybean grew by 2.0% per year during the study period, and 31% of this growth is attributable to GE varieties of these crops. The results also reveal that the adoption of GE varieties reduced the cost shares of fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides, and machinery in corn and soybean production. While the adoption of GE varieties increased the cost shares of seeds and custom works including labor, only the former was statistically significant.","[Saha, Bishnu] Yukon Bur Stat, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2C5, Canada; [Sarker, Rakhal] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Mitura, Verna] High Commiss Canada, Singapore 049145, Singapore",University of Guelph,"Sarker, R (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",bishnu.saha@gov.yk.ca; rsarker@uoguelph.ca; verna.mitura@international.gc.ca,,,"Institute for the Advanced Study of Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Guelph; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","Institute for the Advanced Study of Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Guelph; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","An earlier version of this paper was presented at the Joint Annual Meetings of AAEA, CAES, and WAEA in Denver, Colorado, July 24-27, 2010.

Hydrologic and economic modeling are integrated to conduct basin-wide cost benefit analysis to address the market failure of reciprocal conjunctive use externalities. An n-node partial equilibrium model was formulated in which economic equilibrium was defined by a system of complementary slackness equations. The general model was applied to a three-node example of a ground water pumper that enjoys the positive externality of canal seepage while inflicting a negative externality of pumping-induced seepage upon a canal water user. Exogenous demand, supply, and canal conveyance variables were parameterized using site-specific functional forms and data. The example was solved using mixed complementary programming for the endogenous equilibrium water prices which in turn were used to calculate consumer and producer surplus in the respective surface and ground water markets. A Pigouvian tax/subsidy policy was contrasted against two real-world policies; eliminating the externality through conservation infrastructure and aquifer recharge. The Pigouvian tax/subsidy aligns prices to erase the wedge between social and private costs. The reciprocal externality produces feedback between the surface and ground water markets that reinforces or cancels the tax/subsidy effect. The recharge payment prices canal seepage via a payment from pumper to canal user that matches the decrease in total pumping cost attributable to the seepage resulting from canal diversion. The Pigouvian tax/subsidy yielded the highest social welfare, followed by the aquifer recharge payment. Conserving water by lining the leaky canal decreased social welfare.","[Taylor, R.

In this context, the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure is applied to the censored linear approximate almost ideal demand system (LAIDS) for 12 food products, using data from the Turkish Household Expenditure Survey. All own-price elasticities are negative and expenditure elasticities positive. Uncompensated own-price elasticities for rural households are generally much higher than those for their urban peers, though demand for most food products are own-price elastic for both types of households. The differential patterns in demand elasticities between urban and rural households become even more evident (almost twice) as relatively more expensive foodstuffs are consumed, showing that accessibilities to alternative products have made rural Turkish households more cognizant toward price changes in foods. Household characteristics play a key role in food expenditures, notably so in urban areas, and regional and seasonal differences are also present.","[Bilgic, Abdulbaki] Ataturk Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-25240 Erzurum, Turkey; [Bilgic, Abdulbaki; Yen, Steven T.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",Ataturk University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture,"Yen, ST (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",syen@utk.edu,"Bilgic, Abdulbaki/AAH-9111-2019",,Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [2219],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"This research was conducted while the first author was a post-doctoral fellow at the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, the United States, during 2011-2012.

The results show how much the crisis has involved all the countries bringing, on the whole, a reduction of the competitive potential in the international market which has been less strong in Turkey, the country characterized by a low per capita income and a low public debt.

The authors first estimate a behavioral model explaining farmers' joint decisions on which commodities to produce and which marketing channels to use when selling their outputs. The authors then use the estimated model to quantify the benefits to farmers from using AMAs. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use the discrete choice random utility maximization model to examine farmers' choices on production regimes, where a regime is defined as a possible combination of all the individual commodity/marketing arrangement channels that the farmer can choose to use. The farmer is assumed to compare the utilities he gets from each of the possible production regimes and then selects the production regime that yields the highest utility to him. The benefit of having access to a particular AMA is measured as the negative of the welfare loss associated with forcing the farmer to abandon that particular AMA. Findings - The results indicate that AMAs yield an economically significant amount of benefits to farmers who rely on them to market their outputs. At the national level, the benefit of using production contracts to hog farmers is valued at $336.4 million. The benefits of using marketing contracts are valued at $374.2, $156.6 and $92.1 million for corn, soybeans and wheat producers. Originality/value - The paper is the first study that uses the farm-level data to study the welfare effects of marketing contracts in the grain sector. The results show that considering a multi-enterprises farm, farmers' welfare loss might be smaller when the hog production contract is no longer existed.","[Hu, Wu-Yueh] Providence Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Phaneuf, Daniel] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Zheng, Xiaoyong] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Providence University - Taiwan; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; North Carolina State University,"Hu, WY (通讯作者)，Providence Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan.",wyhu@pu.edu.tw,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This ratio has actually increased in some areas such as the Latin America. As such, there is an increasing importance of microfinance institutions (MFIs) focusing on the activities associated with agriculture and encouraging entrepreneurship in agriculture and in the rural communities in general. The contribution of microfinance institutions consists mainly in providing special-purpose loans, usually without collateral. However, questions exist as to the magnitude and the adequate level of risk of providing micro-credit loans in relation to the interest rates being charged. We review two main approaches to setting interest rates in the MFIs. One approach takes the view that interest rates should be set at a high level due to the excessive risk that these institutions undertake. The second approach is to convince the public of the possibility of reducing these rates through cost savings, increased efficiency, and sharing best practice, etc. Subsequently we econometrically analyse the impact of macroeconomic factors on the microfinance interest rates in Latin America and the Caribbean. We show that these results depend on the chosen indicator of interest rate.","[Janda, Karel; Zetek, Pavel] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague 13067, Czech Republic; [Janda, Karel] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Charles University Prague,"Janda, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",Karel-Janda@seznam.cz,"janda, karel/A-3951-2008; janda, karel/GNP-1410-2022","janda, karel/0000-0001-7096-6300;","Czech Science Foundation [403/10/1235, 402/11/0948]; University of Economic, Prague [IG102023, IP100040]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); University of Economic, Prague","Supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Grants No. 403/10/1235 and 402/11/0948) and by University of Economic, Prague (Grant No. IG102023 and institutional support No. IP100040).",,48,3,3,4,38,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Areas with higher concentrations of older people were not correlated with vulnerability except where there was also deprivation. This contrasts with wide-spread qualitative and quantitative evidence of sub-optimal care of older people within the health service. This suggests there may be an over-reliance on using activity, which was proportionately higher in the least vulnerable areas, to determine funding and quality markers rather than outcomes.

Results suggest that Asian policies differ from the current wave of African input subsidy programs in three important ways: (i) instead of focusing mostly on seed and chemical fertilizer, input promotion in Asia involved a package approach involving investments in agricultural R&D, irrigation, promotion of domestic fertilizer, and investments in rural roads; (ii) farmers in three of four countries paid higher prices (net taxed) for fertilizer during the height of the green revolution, suggesting that it was the profitability, not the subsidy, that was central to increasing fertilizer use; and (iii) Asian countries did not target input subsidies, but given leakage and diversion estimates of targeted programs, it is unclear whether targeting would have been more cost-effective. Both continents have two challenges in common: degradation of soil health and increasingly larger shares of public spending on input subsidies. The first challenge calls for paying attentions to improving fertilizer use efficiency, which is an achievable target, with high pay off in the long run. The other challenge is now a historical factthat is, once introduced, subsidies are hard to eliminate, even if they no longer contribute to agricultural productivity growth.","[Rashid, Shahidur; Dorosh, Paul A.; Malek, Mehrab; Lemma, Solomon] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Rashid, S (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",S.Rashid@cgiar.org,,"Rashid, Shahidur/0000-0001-6719-2201; Dorosh, Paul/0000-0001-6049-6018",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; European Union; IFPRI,United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIARNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); European Union(European Union (EU)); IFPRI,"The authors are thankful to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the European Union for supporting this study as part of other research programs at IFPRI; to M.K.

In this paper we attempt to establish a possible connection between the problems of loan non-repayment in the formal credit market and credit accessibility from informal sources in India. The latter appears to flourish in many developing countries despite various government-initiated formal lending programs. Scholars often examine how poorer households become the victim of usurious interest rates charged by informal lenders and thereby lose their valuable securities. Our approach, however, suggests that the more unfavorable the terms of loan from an informal moneylender compared with a formal lending agency, the better are the chances of a borrower making a timely repayment, and thus obtaining the benefits of a formal loan on a recurring basis (which is not available in the case of default). The paper uses the National Sample Survey Organization database (59(th) round, All India Debt and Investment Survey) to empirically examine the impact of interest rate in the informal sector on formal sector repayment. In addition to revealing a positive and significant impact of the informal sectors interest rate on the repayment of formal loans, the empirical analysis reveals a plausible negative impact of expectation regarding a loan waiver, as well as the moral hazard problem faced by formal lending agencies.","[Bhattacharjee, Manojit] Jain Univ, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Rajeev, Meenakshi] Inst Social & Econ Change, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Jain University,"Bhattacharjee, M (通讯作者)，Jain Univ, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",manojit850@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,3,4,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

While the former group dominates in terms of numbers of fishers, a disproportionate share of the nominal quota is held by the substantially smaller non-Islander fleet. In 2011, the nominal quota allocation was 54:46 between Islanders and non-Islander, with the Islander share increasing substantially since 2005 through a buy-back of around half the non-Islander fleet. Despite this increase, there is pressure within the Islander communities to further increase their share of the total quota. In this paper, we consider the relative value of a unit of quota to the Islander and non-Islander fleets and the likely impact this will have on potential quota trade. We estimate production frontiers for the two groups of vessels to derive estimates of the marginal value product of the different fleet segments. From this, we determine if there are efficiency arguments for transferring additional quota to the Islander fleet. We conclude that economic incentives for individual Islanders to purchase quota from non-Islanders are limited, and that some other form of reallocation system may be more successful in achieving the objective of an increased quota share to Islanders. La peche a la langouste ornee dans le detroit de Torres est exploitee par des pecheurs locaux et des pecheurs de l'exterieur. Bien que le nombre de pecheurs locaux soit superieur a celui des pecheurs de l'exterieur, ces derniers, dont la flottille est substantiellement plus petite, detiennent une part disproportionnee du quota nominal. En 2011, le ratio d'allocation du quota nominal entre les pecheurs locaux et les pecheurs de l'exterieur etait de 54:46, la part des pecheurs locaux ayant augmente considerablement depuis 2005 en raison du rachat de pres de la moitie de la flottille des pecheurs de l'exterieur. Malgre cette augmentation, les communautes insulaires souhaitent accroitre davantage leur part du quota total. Dans le present article, nous examinons la valeur relative d'une unite de quota pour les flottilles de pecheurs locaux et de pecheurs de l'exterieur ainsi que l'impact probable de cette valeur sur les echanges eventuels de quotas. Nous avons estime les frontieres de production des deux flottilles afin d'etablir des estimes de la valeur du produit marginal de chaque flottille. partir de ces resultats, nous avons determine s'il existait ou non des arguments d'efficience appuyant le transfert de quotas supplementaires a la flottille de pecheurs locaux. Nous concluons que les avantages economiques que retireraient les pecheurs locaux en achetant des quotas aupres des pecheurs de l'exterieur sont restreints et qu'un autre systeme de reallocation permettrait peut-etre mieux aux pecheurs locaux d'accroitre leur part du quota.","[Pascoe, Sean; Hutton, Trevor; Dennis, Darren; Plaganyi-Lloyd, Eva; Deng, Roy] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, EcoSci Precinct, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [van Putten, Ingrid] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Pascoe, S (通讯作者)，CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, EcoSci Precinct, POB 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",sean.pascoe@csiro.au; trevor.hutton@csiro.au; ingrid.vanputten@csiro.au; darren.dennis@csiro.au; eva.plaganyi-lloyd@csiro.au; roy.deng@csiro.au,"Plaganyi, Eva E/C-5130-2011; van putten, ingrid/AAV-1301-2021; Hutton, Trevor/E-3066-2017; Deng, Roy/U-3502-2019; Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011","Plaganyi, Eva E/0000-0002-4740-4200; van putten, ingrid/0000-0001-8397-9768; Hutton, Trevor/0000-0002-8747-6196; Deng, Roy/0000-0001-9368-1332; Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649",AFMA,AFMA,This study was part funded by the AFMA funded project An Integrated Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for the Torres Strait tropical rock lobster population.,,31,10,11,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Thus, the combined effect of the two factors is not simply the sum of their separate effects, but either more than this sum (synergistic interaction) or less than this sum (antagonistic interaction). A 3 factor interaction between the factor f(1), f(2), and f(3) occurs when the nature of the interaction between f(1) and f(2) is different at the various levels of f(3). Higher order interactions can be similarly defined but these become increasingly more difficult to interpret. A disadvantage of this approach is that it explores each of the agricultural sub-process unrelated to the follow-up sub-process (e.g., this approach optimizes the process of fertilization without links to the crops distribution process and unrelated to the price optimization). This is because each sub-process has a different response unit that is the subject of optimization. Therefore, it is appropriate to investigate the interaction of agricultural production in its integrated form, through a universal response of variables (e.g., in the form of utility from the response). This new approach is introduced in the paper. Thus, the objective of the paper is to present a new method for the formal determination of synergistic effects of the agricultural enterprises management.","[Hron, Jan; Macak, Tomas] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hron, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",hron@pef.czu.cz; macak@pef.czu.cz,"Macak, Tomas/G-7396-2014; Hron, Jan/C-6378-2017","Macak, Tomas/0000-0002-6737-239X; Hron, Jan/0000-0001-6618-7136",Czech Science Foundation [GACR P403/12/1950],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Grant No. GACR P403/12/1950).,,13,3,3,0,9,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The methodological approach rests largely in the theory of industrial organisation combined with the new institutional economics. Establishing marketing cooperatives, dairy farmers balanced market power with processing industry. It is showed on six case studies that the Czech milk marketing cooperatives follow traditional objectives ( securing sales, fair price and payment discipline); however, their priorities and strategies differ according to their market environment. If the concentration of the dairy industry continues, there will be a need for reconsidering the objectives of milk marketing cooperatives toward a more vertical coordination in the dairy chain.","[Ratinger, Tomas] Technol Ctr ASCR, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic; [Boskova, Iveta] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Ratinger, T (通讯作者)，Technol Ctr ASCR, Struhach 27, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic.",ratinger@tc.cz,,"Boskova, Iveta/0009-0008-6099-0946; Ratinger, Tomas/0000-0003-1379-2177",,,,,31,9,9,1,18,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We assess the effectiveness of two strategies for coping with systemic risk: regional diversification and securitization with catastrophe (CAT) bonds. The analysis is conducted in an equilibrium pricing framework which allows the optimal price of the insurance and the number of traded contracts to be determined. We also explore the role of basis risk and risk aversion of market agents. The model is applied to a hypothetical area yield insurance for rice producers in northeast China. If yields in two regions are positively correlated, we find that enlarging the insured area leads to higher insurance premiums. Unless capital market investors are very risk averse, a CAT bond written on an area yield index outperforms regional diversification in terms of certainty equivalents of both farmers and insurers.","[Shen, Zhiwei; Odening, Martin] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Shen, ZW (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",zhiwei.shen@agrar.hu-berlin.de,"Odening, Martin/AAV-9918-2020","Odening, Martin/0000-0001-6427-1641",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the Collaborative Research Center 649,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the Collaborative Research Center 649,The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers and the editor for valuable comments.

The current production potential of the Czech Republic is 19 633.45 hectares of vineyards. Since 1960, the production potential of Czech vineyards has increased approximately three times. This increase equals the optimum production of 90 million litres of wine. Two thirds of the total demand for wine must be covered by imports. This paper analyses the development of the wine market within the period of the campaign years 2004/2005 to 2011/2012 and tries to predict the development in 2012/2013. The authors analyse developmental trends in the sales of this commodity with regard to the home production of wine after the entry of the Czech Republic into the European Union. In the Czech Republic, the wine trading is oriented nearly exclusively to seven EU member countries. The highest volumes of wine are imported from Italy and Hungary. Exports are mostly directed to Slovakia and (with a great gap) Poland. As far as the prices are concerned, this corresponds to CZK 3.5 bill. got for 170 million of sold litres. The management of wine production involves the restructuralisation of the varietal assortment in vineyards caused by a changing demand for white, rose and red wines.","Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Management, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; Winegrower Assoc Czech Republ, Velke Bilovice 69102, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Tomsík, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",tomsik@mendelu.cz; jiri.sedlo@svcr.cz,,,,,,,15,6,7,0,16,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The paper highlights the regional differences of impacts by estimating output elasticities (with respect to climate change) for different grain crops and different regions. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses production function to investigate the responses of grain output to climate variables as well as other traditional input variables. The use of production function approach allows us to do away with the competitive land market assumption as required in the Ricardian approach. The paper will use interaction terms of climate variables and regional dummies to capture the regional differences of climate change impact on grain crops. Findings - The results indicate that the overall negative climate impacts on the PRC's grain output range from -0.31 to -2.69 percent in 2030 and from -1.93 to -3.07 percent in 2050, under different emission scenarios. The impacts, however, differ substantially for different grain crops and different regions. Originality/value - This paper addresses the limitations of existing literature by highlighting regional differences and crop varieties using the most recent nationwide rural household survey data. The results indicate pronounced regional differences and crop differences in the impacts of climate changes on PRC's grain output.","[Xin, Xian] China Agrigultural Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Tun; Wan, Guanghua] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines; [Liu, Xiaoyun] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yongsheng] State Council, Res Dev Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Asian Development Bank; China Agricultural University,"Xin, X (通讯作者)，China Agrigultural Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xinxian@cau.edu.cn,"Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023",,ADB [43068],ADB,The authors would like to thank Jing Cui and Yongwei Cui for their assistance in data processing and the Research Center for the Rural Economy (RCRE) at the PRC's Ministry of Agriculture for providing the rural household survey data.

There is a lack of information about the marketing strategies that are most effective, and there is also a lack of consensus in the literature about whether some types of marketing strategies can consistently perform better than others. This paper uses a simulation model based on daily cash and futures prices to compare returns and risk over time from specific marketing strategies for corn and soybean producers in Ontario. This paper also examines whether there are differences in the relative effectiveness of strategies between higher-price years and lower-price years. The results indicate that preharvest marketing strategies for both corn and soybeans tend to generate prices that are much higher than selling everything at harvest (the baseline strategy), particularly for the higher-price years; however, these differences are not always statistically significant. Preharvest strategies are also found to reduce downside risk relative to the baseline.","Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Ridgetown, ON N0P 2C0, Canada",University of Guelph,"Vyn, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Ridgetown Campus,120 Main St E, Ridgetown, ON N0P 2C0, Canada.",rvyn@ridgetownc.uoguelph.ca,,,"Ontario Corn Producers' Association, Grain Farmers of Ontario; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food Rural Affairs","Ontario Corn Producers' Association, Grain Farmers of Ontario; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food Rural Affairs","The author gratefully acknowledges funding received for this project from the Ontario Corn Producers' Association (now part of the Grain Farmers of Ontario) and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food & Rural Affairs.",,20,0,1,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

This paper explores, from a national perspective, important economic differences that arise when a mining boom, such as the current one, is generated by sustained export price increases (trading gains) rather than export volume increases. Since 2003, the terms of trade changes through their direct trading gain effect and indirect real GDP effects have increased Australian living standards. The increase, measured from official data and relative to the United States, is about 25 per cent; an increase that probably places Australian living standards well above those of the United States. But official data inadequately adjusts for foreign ownership of mining resources suggesting that this estimate is probably a little too high.","[Gregory, Robert G.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Gregory, Robert G.] Victoria Univ, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",Australian National University; Victoria University,"Gregory, RG (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",bob.gregory@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,55,23,23,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

A Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) model is used to estimate game models of bilateral trade between Brazil and its major partners (United States, European Union, and Japan). From the viewpoint of strategic games, the results suggest that the Brazilian notifications are forms of retaliation against the United States, and, regarding the European Union, the best result for Brazil was conciliation. On the other hand, if the results are interpreted as equilibria of bargaining games, they suggest that Brazil has great bargaining power in trade with the United States and that cooperation characterized agricultural trade between Brazil and the European Union in the period analyzed.

This paper develops an innovative Positive Mathematical Programming model that takes into explicit consideration the risk aversion behaviour. This is used to investigate the implications of participating in the crop revenue insurance scheme. In particular, a quadratic mix integer program has been developed on a small group of crop farms in Italy and it has been used to simulate the impact of changes in the level of the insurance premium. The objective of this paper is to assess the soundness of the proposed approach and to identify its limitations. The obtained results suggest that this could be a useful tool to investigate the impact of participating in insurance schemes on production patterns, farm profitability and the role of public support.","[Cortignani, Raffaele] Univ Tuscia, Fac Agr, DAFNE, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University,"Cortignani, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tuscia, Fac Agr, DAFNE, Via San Camillo de Lellis Snc, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",cortignani@unitus.it; severini@unitus.it,"Cortignani, Raffaele/ABF-9897-2021; SEVERINI, Simone/A-6944-2017","Cortignani, Raffaele/0000-0002-2685-9783; SEVERINI, Simone/0000-0001-5501-3552",,,,,11,20,21,1,27,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The influx of foreign workers into the economy increases the supply of labour in the host country. Increasing labour supply resulting from increased immigration may hamper inflationary tendency for wages. Moderate wage pressures and low inflationary tendencies are generally suitable economic environment for the policies of central banks at low interest rates to support investment and economic growth. Lower wages lead to lower production costs, and therefore potentially also to reduce retail prices of goods and services for final consumers. However, the consequences of immigration can be very broad and are not limited to problems of growth and productivity, but should be considered in the broader economic and socio-cultural context. It depends also on the degree of integration of immigrants into mainstream society, their ability to deal with different economic, cultural and social conventions or practices in the target country.","[Palat, Milan] Mendelova Univ Brne, Ustav Teritorialnich Studii, Zemedelska1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Palát, M (通讯作者)，Mendelova Univ Brne, Ustav Teritorialnich Studii, Zemedelska1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",mpalat@mendelu.cz,"Palat, Milan/C-6084-2013",,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-652-9,,,,2012,,,,,,,202,208,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics,BG8OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392530500028,0

Design/methodology/approach - Alternative regression models are estimated using the time-series data of 1960 to 2010 from ERS/USDA to address the research questions. Findings - Regression results suggest that current direct government payments had negative influences on US agricultural production and exports, and the lagged influences were positive, but as a whole the impacts of direct government payments were very limited. Practical implications - Findings from this study provide useful information to agricultural policymakers in the USA, as well as other nations such as China. China may learn from the US experience in developing agricultural subsidies that are effective and allowed under WTO. Originality/value - While many agricultural trade disputes under WTO are related to the question of whether domestic government supports have boosted agricultural production and exports or reduced imports, this paper addresses the question based on empirical analysis.","[Zou, Yang] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qingbin] Univ Vermont, Dept Community Dev & Appl Econ, Burlington, VT USA",Nankai University; University of Vermont,"Zou, Y (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",yzou33@nankai.edu.cn,,"ZOU, Yang/0000-0003-2096-2402",,,,,24,2,2,2,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The paper explores the sources of market, and non-market, (regulatory) failure related to the consumption and production of healthier foods. The Canadian approach to regulating health claims is compared to regulatory frameworks in the United States, the European Union, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

Men are in charge of grazing and managing the livestock herds. Women take care of the family, administer food supplies, and are responsible for milking. For them, balancing home consumption of milk (for the family and for the calves), milk sale, and food purchase is a major task. In this article, we first investigate how different milk sales groups vary regarding the use of different food items and the respective quantities consumed by the enkaji, i.e., a Maasai subhousehold. Then, we address the commercialization decision and assess the effect of milk sales on the enkaji's food item use and food consumption. Using the data of Maasai enkajijik in the milk catchment area of a milk collection center in Ngerengere, Tanzania, we estimate the effects by employing propensity score matching procedures. Our findings suggest that milk sellers, especially those selling to the milk collection center, have a more diverse diet. In terms of per person consumption, the groups are markedly similar. Therefore, we conclude that income generated by milk sales is invested in diet diversification rather than in increasing the quantity of food consumed, hence the enkajijik appear not to make use of caloric terms of trade.","[Loos, Tim K.; Zeller, Manfred] Univ Hohenheim 490a, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Loos, TK (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim 490a, Wollgrasweg 43, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",loostk@googlemail.com,,,Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development through the German Society for International Cooperation,Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development through the German Society for International Cooperation,"The data analyzed for this article were collected in the context of a research project jointly carried out by the International Food Policy Research Institute, the University of Hohenheim and the Sokoine University of Agriculture.

We use a partial equilibrium model of global agriculture incorporating a food security module that links changes in the average dietary energy intake to shifts in the full caloric distribution, allowing us to compute changes in the incidence, headcount and average depth of malnutrition. After validating the model against an historical period, we implement a series of future scenarios to understand the impacts of key exogenous drivers on selected food security outcomes. Our results show improvements in global food security for the period 2006-2050. Despite growing population and increased biofuel demand, baseline income growth, coupled with projected increases in agricultural productivity lead to a 24 per cent rise in global average dietary energy intake. Consequently, the incidence of malnutrition falls by 84 per cent, lifting more than half a billion people out of extreme hunger. However, these results hinge heavily on agricultural productivity growth. Without such growth, there could be a substantial setback on food security improvements. Climate change adds uncertainty to these projections, depending critically on the crop yield impacts of increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere.","[Baldos, Uris Lantz C.; Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Baldos, ULC (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ubaldos@purdue.edu,,,,,,,36,88,90,3,171,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

It is not sufficient to rely solely on aggregate economic growth or reductions in poverty incidence to deliver improved food security. But the evidence also shows that higher food prices significantly increase the rate of undernourishment. It is therefore important to stimulate agricultural output without raising domestic food prices. Improvements in agricultural productivity achieve that, but agricultural protection aimed at food self-sufficiency does not, because the objective of reducing imports is achieved through an increase in domestic food prices. Although this process delivers benefits to those food insecure people who are net sellers of food, in most poor countries their number is exceeded by the food insecure people who are net buyers of food. Increased food prices make the latter group more food insecure. Food self-sufficiency does not imply food security.","Australian Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Coll Asia & Pacific, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",Australian National University,"Warr, P (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Coll Asia & Pacific, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",peter.warr@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,16,20,27,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Views of African agriculture over the last 130 years have changed from optimism to pessimism and at least halfway back again as the performance of the sector has fluctuated. Fortunately it seems the deep pessimism about agricultural prospects expressed in the 1980s and 1990s has receded. The performance of African agriculture since 1990 suggests that neither those who doubt that any significant advances are taking place, nor those who see advances in some remarkable but perhaps isolated cases of rapid transformation of farming and agricultural supply chains, have sufficient evidence - either from national data or small-scale studies - to support their positions. Hence policy has to rely largely on general principles and historic lessons, rather than more clearly proven propositions. Policy debates over African agricultural development may sharply divide on some topics, but there is little debate over the importance of basic conditions for agricultural development of an enabling investment climate and the provision of rural public goods. Beyond these basics, the challenge is to remedy the failings of markets that deny most smallholders access to inputs, financial services and insurance. Here opinion divides between whether to return to public provision, as with fertiliser subsidies, or whether private and collective institutional innovations will be sufficient. Recent initiatives to test and scale up the latter look promising, but most have yet to be evaluated. If agricultural development is first and foremost about establishing the basic conditions for growth, then most countries in Africa may be better placed than they have been in the past. Given the many examples that show African smallholders investing and innovating when they have the chance, then there are reasons to hope that the modest growth of production and productivity seen in the last two decades may accelerate in the future - thereby allowing African countries to make the transition from agrarian to urban economies.","Overseas Dev Inst, London, England",,"Wiggins, S (通讯作者)，Overseas Dev Inst, London, England.",steve-wiggins@ntlworld.com,,,,,,,92,20,23,0,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Current depletion rates will soon exhaust currently known reserves of iron ore and coal. This paper presents a dynamic optimisation model of a growing open economy where a social planner chooses the time path for depletion of a non-renewable resource during a demand-led resources boom. We find that for particular functional forms and in the absence of extraction and social costs, the optimal depletion rate equals the difference between the price elasticity of export demand times the world interest rate and growth in export demand. In contrast to the existing literature, we show that the optimal depletion rate is unaffected by a temporary increase in price, but reduced by growth in demand which is in turn sustained by offshore steel production and urbanisation. The main theoretical implication is that growth in export demand from China reduces the depletion rate. Australian iron ore exports, simulated using this theory, move together with actual volumes over the period 1995-2011, and the error between simulated and actual iron ore exports is lower for the model in this paper than it is for the model without growth in export demand.","[Allen, Creina] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Day, Garth] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Allen, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",creina.allen@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Prices are profoundly influenced by residential characteristics and accessibility to urban amenities. Spatial heterogeneity is found for both regional and local levels, and a large spatial spillover effect is found between neighbouring farms.

Considering the structure and economic importance of agriculture for the generation of Montenegrin GDP, the balanced trade deficit, the reduction of poverty and the regional disparities in development and reversing the negative demographic trends, the proposed reformed agricultural budget of Montenegro in the period 2014-2018 outlines significantly higher levels of the funding both as a share of the state budget and the GDP. The proposed proportions of financing of the key measure groups in the subsequent tables utilize as a starting point the model defined in the Montenegrin National Program of Food Production and Rural Development 2009-2013. Some changes in the proportion of the measures are also proposed according to the agricultural sector needs and the institutional capacity building for the next phase of the EU accession negotiations. In order to prepare the Montenegrin agriculture to cope with the competitive pressures of the EU single market, the indisputable conclusion of this study is that the proposed future levels of agricultural funding in the agricultural budget should be at least near to those (in the relative terms) of the comparable economies of the Western Balkans countries.","[Djurovic, Gordana] Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro; [Bulatovic, Branko] Minist Agr & Rural Dev, Podgorica, Montenegro",University of Montenegro,"Djurovic, G (通讯作者)，Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Jovana Tomasevica 37, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro.",gordana@t-com.me,"Djurovic, Gordana/R-7869-2019","Djurovic, Gordana/0000-0002-4999-3010",,,,,20,1,1,1,8,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Two types of indices are constructed to measure the rural-urban income gap: the intra-provincial index and the inter-provincial index. A provincial panel data from 1978 to 2010 and growth accounting method are used to estimate the size of the adverse effect of rural-urban income gap on agricultural growth in China. Findings - The empirical results show that both indices of rural-urban income gaps are negatively associated with agriculture output, but the inter-provincial rural-urban income gap produces a larger adverse effect than the intra-provincial rural-urban income gap. Growth accounting analysis further shows that such adverse effects are decreasing over time and are larger in the central provinces. The results represent resource diversion effects of rural-urban income gap on agriculture. Originality/value - This paper bridges the gap in existing literature on the relationship between sectoral income gaps and agricultural growth, which confirms Schultz's argument that agricultural activities are efficient even in developing countries and the rural resources diverted out by income gap are not surplus. The results imply that equalized rural-urban and regional policies are required to maintain sustainable agricultural growth in China.","[Gao, Yanyan] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Jianghuai] Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bu, Maoliang] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Nanjing University; Nanjing University,"Gao, YY (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",adamesky@gmail.com,"BU, Maoliang/B-3777-2008; Gao, Yanyan/AAE-6607-2022; Gao, Yanyan/AAL-7187-2020","BU, Maoliang/0000-0002-3290-4181; Gao, Yanyan/0000-0003-0326-504X; Gao, Yanyan/0000-0003-0326-504X","National Social Science Foundation of China [12CJY040]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) [11YJC790047]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2011M500834, 2012T50452]","National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); MOE (Ministry of Education in China)(Ministry of Education, China); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","Yanyan Gao owes very much to Professor Yew-Kwang Ng and Russell Smyth at Monash University for their helpful comments.

Previous studies of agricultural land-use futures have been published indicating large uncertainty due to different model assumptions and methodologies. In this article we present a first comprehensive comparison of global agro-economic models that have harmonized drivers of population, GDP, and biophysical yields. The comparison allows us to ask two research questions: (1) How much cropland will be used under different socioeconomic and climate change scenarios? (2) How can differences in model results be explained? The comparison includes four partial and six general equilibrium models that differ in how they model land supply and amount of potentially available land. We analyze results of two different socioeconomic scenarios and three climate scenarios (one with constant climate). Most models (7 out of 10) project an increase of cropland of 10-25% by 2050 compared to 2005 (under constant climate), but one model projects a decrease. Pasture land expands in some models, which increase the treat on natural vegetation further. Across all models most of the cropland expansion takes place in South America and sub-Saharan Africa. In general, the strongest differences in model results are related to differences in the costs of land expansion, the endogenous productivity responses, and the assumptions about potential cropland.","[Schmitz, Christoph; Popp, Alexander] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [van Meijl, Hans; Tabeau, Andrzej; Kavallari, Aikaterini] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, NL-2585 DB The Hague, Netherlands; [Kyle, Page; Wise, Marshall] Pacific NW Natl Lab, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Nelson, Gerald C.; d'Croz, Daniel Mason] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Nelson, Gerald C.] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61801 USA; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Hasegawa, Tomoko] NIES, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Gurgel, Angelo] Sao Paulo Sch Econ EESP FGV, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Havlik, Petr; Valin, Hugo] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Heyhoe, Edwina] ABARES, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Sands, Ron] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [van der Mensbrugghe, Dominique] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [von Lampe, Martin] OECD, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Blanc, Elodie] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Wageningen University & Research; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Schmitz, C (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Telegrafenberg A 31, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",schmitz@pik-potsdam.de,"Mason-D'Croz, Daniel/M-4254-2016; Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Kyle, Page/AFP-3602-2022; Gurgel, Angelo C/D-9446-2013; van Meijl, Hans/G-6223-2015; Hasegawa, Tomoko/AAB-2616-2019; Popp, Alexander/N-7064-2014; Valin, Hugo/Z-1557-2019; Nelson, Gerald/L-5903-2019; Tabeau, Andrzej/AAE-8214-2019","Mason-D'Croz, Daniel/0000-0003-0673-2301; Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; van Meijl, Hans/0000-0002-2455-6869; Hasegawa, Tomoko/0000-0003-2456-5789; Popp, Alexander/0000-0001-9500-1986; Valin, Hugo/0000-0002-0618-773X; Gurgel, Angelo/0000-0001-8331-9508; Havlik, Petr/0000-0001-5551-5085; Kyle, Page/0000-0002-1257-8358; Sands, Ronald/0000-0002-2864-0339; Blanc, Elodie/0000-0003-1997-8212","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); British government through AgMIP; EU","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); British government through AgMIP; EU(European Union (EU))","This article is part of a global economic model intercomparison activity undertaken under the initiative of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and as a part of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP-www.agmip.org).

The overall development in the period 1948-2012 is demonstrated through the linear trend: QCW(T) = -340.77 + 0.1788xT + u(T). The growing consumption of wine was examined in relation to the development of the prices of wine, beer, and rum in the period 1991-2012. The achieved negative values of the own price elasticity coefficients (ranging from -0.2957 to -0.1624) suggest, that there worked normal price reactions. Cross price elasticity coefficients of the gross demand for wine showed complementarity between the consumption of wine and beer or wine and rum. The cross price elasticity of the gross demand for wine related to the price of 10 beer was -0.2757 in average, and -0.2074 in the case of rum.","[Syrovatka, Pavel] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Chladkova, Helena; Zufan, Pavel] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Management, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Syrovátka, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",pavels@mendelu.cz; chlad@mendelu.cz; pavel.zufan@gmail.com,"Pavel, Syrovátka/E-3536-2018; Zufan, Pavel/AAQ-1875-2021; Zufan, Pavel/B-9688-2008; Chladkova, Helena/Q-5643-2016","Pavel, Syrovátka/0000-0002-3915-4328; Zufan, Pavel/0000-0002-9184-545X; Chladkova, Helena/0000-0002-9037-2689",,,,,14,4,6,0,21,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Thus, reliance on voluntary approaches in agriculture is likely to be effective only if there is sufficient market demand for certain product characteristics, significant public funds are committed to pay for voluntary actions, or the political will exists to impose regulations if voluntary approaches fail.","Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Segerson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",kathleen.segerson@uconn.edu,,,,,,,135,27,31,0,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

This article reviews the Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP) and other GRZ input subsidy programs since structural adjustment. It then synthesizes existing and presents new empirical evidence on the programs' targeting outcomes and effects. Results suggest that although 73% of smallholder households cultivate less than 2 hectares of land, and that these households constitute 78% of the smallholder farms below the US$1.25/capita/day poverty line, the majority (55%) of FISP fertilizer goes to households that cultivate larger areas. Other factors constant, wealthier households receive more subsidized inputs. Subsidized fertilizer promotes maize intensification and extensification (at the expense of fallow land), but an additional kg of subsidized fertilizer only raises maize output by 1.88 kg on average. As a result of low maize-fertilizer response rates, poor targeting, crowding out, and diversion of fertilizer intended for the program, financial benefit-cost ratios for FISP fertilizer are well below one. The article concludes with recommended reforms to FISP, including that it be downsized and the savings invested in known drivers of pro-poor agricultural growth.","[Mason, Nicole M.; Jayne, T.

Specifically, we examine the impact of eradication policies when opium is used as a means of obtaining credit, and when the crops are cultivated in sharecropping arrangements. The analysis suggests that when perfect credit markets are available, an increased risk of eradication will lead to less land being allocated to opium poppy. However, when opium is used as a means of obtaining credit, an eradication policy can rather increase land under poppy cultivation. Furthermore, the unintended effects of eradication can be augmented in sharecropping arrangements.","[Andersson, Camilla I.

A kernel regression is used on data of mixed cropping systems to study the determinants of production including different factors that have been identified in literature as missing variables in the testing of the inverse relationship such as soil quality, location and household heterogeneity. Household data on farm activities and crop production were gathered from 640 households in 2007 in two Northern provinces of Burundi. Our results do not reject the findings of an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity. However, we find that size returns vary substantially with farm size, that is, between 0.2 for the smallest farms and 0.8 for the largest farms. Other factors that significantly affect production include soil quality.

Production results in terms of several crops will be considered in this game, together with the necessary parameters to implement different linear programming problems. In the game with perfect information with the hierarchical structure established between the four considered players (a management center and three production units), a Nash equilibrium point is reached, since once the strategies of the rest of the players are known, if any of them would use a strategy different to the one proposed, their earnings would be less than the ones obtained by using the proposed strategies.

Offering security-differentiated water rights can make the market more efficient and allow water users to manage the risks of supply uncertainty better. We conduct a laboratory experiment which compares two designs for water rights; one with a single security level and another with two security levels. We find that a two security level system increases overall profits when transactions costs are lower on the water rights market than on the water allocation market. It also improves risk allocation by allowing subjects to trade-off profits variability against expected profits according to their risk type and this result is robust to the existence of transactions costs on either market.,"[Gangadharan, Lata] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Thoyer, Sophie] Montpellier SupAgro, UMR 5474 Lameta, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Lefebvre, Marianne] European Commiss, DG Joint Res Ctr, IPTS, E-41092 Seville, Spain",Monash University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Gangadharan, L (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",marianne.lefebvre@ec.europa.eu; Lata.Gangadharan@monash.edu; thoyer@supagro.inra.fr,"Lefebvre, marianne/AAH-6280-2020; Gangadharan, Lata/X-9890-2019","Lefebvre, marianne/0000-0003-2876-1226; Gangadharan, Lata/0000-0003-3827-3090",ANR project RISECO [ANR-08-JCJC-0074-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-08-JCJC-0074] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),ANR project RISECO(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We would like to thank audiences at the Asia-Pacific Economic Science Association Meeting, the International Meeting on Experimental and Behavioral Economics, the Conference of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society and the Societe Francaise d'Economie Rurale annual conference, the staff at the Victorian Department of Primary Industries (Melbourne, Australia) and anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Local and regional general equilibrium approaches have become increasingly popular because they can extend predictions of policy shocks obtainable from partial equilibrium sectoral models to identify the wider effects. However, agriculture is usually described as a single sector in inputoutput accounts, whereas policy shocks that affect constituent commodities with differential impacts will have inter-industry effects that are different to those implied by average inputoutput coefficients. Regionalisation of aggregated inputoutput tables adds further to these difficulties. The objective of this study is to develop a practical method for dealing with these problems. It describes the theoretical basis of aggregation bias and shows how it can be measured, in two contrasting case study regions in the UK and Sweden. Having established that this is a significant issue, a simple but effective procedure is demonstrated, based on additional information on variable costs, which transforms policy shocks from a direct change in agricultural output to that transmitted to the suppliers of inputs. This method provides an impact close to that which could be calculated if the general equilibrium system had indeed been disaggregated, and supports use of this approach in impact studies where insufficient time or funding are available for complete disaggregation of an agricultural sectors regional accounts.","[Midmore, P.] Aberystwyth Univ, Sch Business & Management, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Lindberg, G.] Nord Ctr Spatial Dev, Nordregio, Stockholm, Sweden; [Surry, Y.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden",Aberystwyth University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Midmore, P (通讯作者)，Aberystwyth Univ, Sch Business & Management, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.",pxm@aber.ac.uk,,,European Communities Framework Programme Projects: CARERA (The Impacts of CAP Reform on the Employment Levels in Rural Areas) [022653]; FACEPA (Farm Accountancy Cost Estimation and Policy Analysis of European Agriculture) [212292],European Communities Framework Programme Projects: CARERA (The Impacts of CAP Reform on the Employment Levels in Rural Areas); FACEPA (Farm Accountancy Cost Estimation and Policy Analysis of European Agriculture),"Gunnar Lindberg is with Nordregio, Nordic Centre for Spatial Development, Stockholm, Sweden.

Governments have responded by introducing a range of measures, mainly targeting information and education, largely to children. However, more interventionist measures have been advocated and, in the past year, various food taxes have been introduced in Denmark, Hungary and France. The Address discusses evaluation of policies, particularly in the light of alternative theories of diet choice (rational choice, systematically irrational, automatic). The public health approach uses quality adjusted life years but fails to distinguish between private and social benefits and takes no account of the drivers of food choice behaviour. The economic approach, based on informed choice, makes the distinction between private and social benefits (if not always explicitly) but struggles to evaluate policies that change utility functions and with behavioural assumptions other than traditional rationality. Alternative assumptions and approaches could put the cost of unhealthy eating anywhere between 10 pound billion and 100 pound billion per annum in the UK. Evidence suggests that information measures (to perform or persuade) do not much change diets, nor do they tackle the externality element of unhealthy eating. They may, however, help change long-term social norms. More interventionist measures like taxes improve social welfare (according to the compensation principle) and reduce health inequalities but are regressive, like all sin taxes. Almost all interventions pass cost-effectiveness tests.","Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Traill, WB (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",w.b.traill@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,74,27,28,0,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Quarterly data are available from 1975.I through 2007.IV for Illinois/Purdue and 1975.I-2010.IV for Iowa, Missouri, and USDA forecasts, which allow for a relatively long out-of-sample evaluation after permitting model specification and appropriate composite-weight training periods. Results show that futures and numerous composite procedures outperform outlook forecasts, but no-change forecasts are inferior to outlook forecasts. At intermediate horizons, OLS composite procedures perform well. The superiority of futures and composite forecasts decreases at longer horizons except for an equal-weighted approach. Importantly, with few exceptions, nothing outperforms the equal-weight approach significantly in any program or horizon. In addition, the equal-weight approach as well as other composite approaches can generally produce larger trading profits compared to outlook forecasts. Overall, findings favor the use of equal-weighted composites, consistent with previous empirical findings and recent theoretical papers.","[Colino, Evelyn V.] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Escuela Econ Adm & Turismo, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Irwin, Scott H.; Garcia, Philip; Etienne, Xiaoli] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Colino, EV (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Escuela Econ Adm & Turismo, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Etienne, Xiaoli/0000-0003-4519-9028",Aurene T.

However, various studies have recently shown that protest beliefs are as well held by respondents who state a positive willingness to pay (WTP). Using latent class (LC) models, we investigate the extent of heterogeneity with respect to protest beliefs among all respondents of two contingent valuation studies. The advantage of LC models is that classes of individuals are endogenously identified and no selection bias is introduced by ad hoc definitions of protesters. Further we investigate whether it is possible to identify a class of non-protesters. Finding a group of pure non-protesters could indicate how strongly stated WTP in the whole sample is affected by protest beliefs. For both samples, we find a class with strong protest beliefs but no pure non-protest class. Overall, our results suggest that LC models might not be the first choice to determine unbiased WTP measures, but they provide valuable insights into the degree of protesting expressed by different groups and corresponding determinants of group membership.","[Meyerhoff, Juergen] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berlin, Germany; [Bartczak, Anna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw Ecol Econ Ctr, Warsaw, Poland; [Liebe, Ulf] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Liebe, Ulf] Univ Kassel, Chair Rural Sociol, Witzenhausen, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; University of Warsaw; University of Gottingen; Universitat Kassel,"Meyerhoff, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berlin, Germany.",meyerhoff@imup.tu-berlin.de,"Meyerhoff, Juergen/M-5640-2019; Bartczak, Anna Małgorzata/AAZ-9274-2020; Bartczak, Anna/AAN-1875-2021","Meyerhoff, Juergen/0000-0003-4333-8514; Bartczak, Anna Małgorzata/0000-0001-5917-5989; Bartczak, Anna/0000-0001-5917-5989",Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany (Forest conversion: Ecological and socio-economic assessment of biodiversity (FOREST)) [Fkz. 01 LM 0207],Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany (Forest conversion: Ecological and socio-economic assessment of biodiversity (FOREST)),The authors would like to thank the editors and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions for improvements.

An optimal sharing contract is developed between a grape grower and a winery, when a risk-averse grower allocates efforts among multiple activities that differ in measurability, while double-sided moral hazard is assumed to be present. Several comparative static results regarding the Pareto optimal share are in line with certain production practices and properties of observed contracts that are found in markets where residual claimancy is used, namely in Australia, California, New Zealand and France.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Steiner, B (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, 2nd Floor,ORahilly Bldg, Cork, Ireland.",b.steiner@ucc.ie,,"Steiner, Bodo/0000-0002-5357-8856",Volkswagen Foundation; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I thank Jeff LaFrance, Ben Hermalin, Urvashi Narain, Carlo Cafiero, Maximilian Auffhammer, Ethan Ligon, Rob Weaver, Aaron Green, Peterangelo Vallis, Kirby Moultondagger, Dale Heiendagger, Jim Lapsley, Andy Beckstoffer, James Omond and Karen Ross for very helpful discussions and suggestions.

A survey questionnaire was administered by means of telephone interviews to a stratified sample of 300 cattle farmers in annually bTB-tested areas in England and Wales. Farmers felt that bTB was a major risk for the cattle industry and that there was a high risk of their cattle getting the disease. The CE estimate produced a mean WTP of 35 pound per animal per single dose for a vaccine that is 90% effective at reducing the risk of a bTB breakdown and an estimated 55 pound for such a vaccine backed by 100% insurance of loss if a breakdown should occur. The CV estimate produced a mean WTP of nearly 17 pound per dose/per animal/per year for a vaccine (including 100% insurance) which, given the average lifespan of cattle, is comparable to the CE estimate. These WTP estimates are substantially higher than the expected cost of a vaccine which suggests that farmers in high risk bTB hotspot areas perceive a substantial net benefit from buying the vaccine.","[Bennett, Richard; Balcombe, Kelvin] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Dept Food Econ & Mkt, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Bennett, R (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Dept Food Econ & Mkt, POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",r.m.bennett@reading.ac.uk,"Balcombe, Kelvin G/F-8418-2010","Balcombe, Kelvin/0000-0001-7224-9233","Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA))","The authors acknowledge with thanks funding from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to undertake the research reported here.

Private and public benefits per dollar spent are estimated for 15 target restoration sites. The results of this study show the potential for increased benefits to the community from reforestation projects, but those benefits can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including the area of the target reforestation site, the number of houses surrounding the target site, property values, and the proximity of houses to the site. Much of the private benefit accrues to households living close to the reforestation site while public benefits are mainly generated by indirect use values associated with the cleansing of air and water pollutants. Assuming the explicit cost of reforestation is paid by local governments, the sites generating the most public benefit per dollar could be considered high-priority reforestation sites based on equity. Alternatively, the sites with the highest private return per dollar could be viewed as high-priority sites if the payment system allows direct payment for reforestation of private land. The latter payment system could be implemented through a conservation easement program that restricts the development rights of private landowners and permits private donations to support the program.","[Chadourne, Matthew H.; Cho, Seong-Hoon; Roberts, Roland K.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Chadourne, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, 325D Morgan Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",mchadour@utk.edu; scho9@utk.edu; rrobert3@utk.edu,,,,,,,43,8,11,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

TC banana plantlets, which are free from pests and diseases, have been introduced in East Africa since the late 1990s. Although field experiments show significant yield advantages over traditional banana suckers, a rigorous assessment of impacts in farmers fields is still outstanding. A comparison of mean yield levels between TC adopters and non-adopters in our sample shows no significant difference. However, we find evidence of negative selection bias, indicating that farmers with lower than average yields are more likely to adopt TC. Controlling for this bias results in a positive and significant TC net yield gain of 7%. We also find that TC technology is more knowledge intensive and more responsive to irrigation than traditional bananas. Simulations show that improving access to irrigation could lift TC productivity gains to above 20%. The analytical approach developed and applied here and the finding of negative selection bias may also be relevant for the evaluation of other agricultural technologies.","[Kabunga, Nassul S.] IFPRI, Uganda Country Off, Washington, DC USA; [Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Dubois, Thomas] IITA, Kampala, Uganda",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Gottingen,"Kabunga, NS (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Uganda Country Off, Washington, DC USA.",n.kabunga@cgiar.org,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; Kabunga, Nassul/0000-0002-7563-0299",German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),The financial support of the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) is gratefully acknowledged.

Data from the Polish dairy sector show that assistance is provided not only for the traditional-channel farmers wishing to modernize, but also for farmers already included in the modern marketing channel. Two explanations can be provided to account for this phenomenon. One, even modern-channel farmers may lack sufficient funds to maintain required quality/quantity on their own. Two, it may be the case that even after undertaking necessary adjustments, modern-channel farmers are more likely to quit their relationship with a processor and turn elsewhere, in which case assistance is provided to prevent them from defecting. Using farm-level data, we investigate the impact of supply chain modernization on farmers access to credit and their loyalty toward processors. Our results do not provide compelling evidence to support either hypothesis, suggesting at most a partial explanation for the existence of vertical linkages between processors and modern-channel farmers in Poland.","[Falkowski, Jan] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland; [Falkowski, Jan] Ctr Econ Anal Publ Sect, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Falkowski, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",jfalkowski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Fałkowski, Jan/ABE-9726-2020","Fałkowski, Jan/0000-0001-6921-6342",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [N112 016 32/0572],"Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)","The author would like to thank Gerald Shively, three anonymous referees and seminar participants at Hungarian Academy of Science, LICOS and University of Warsaw for helpful comments.

We analyse the extent of the legacy of war on livelihood activities and welfare. We first identify livelihood portfolio clusters of households pursuing similar combinations of activities. These clusters are comparable to those described in more qualitative studies in the immediate post-conflict period. We then examine the determinants of livelihood portfolio choice and the consequences of these for welfare outcomes. Our results provide evidence of a relationship between a households experience of war and livelihood choice. We also identify significant selection effects on welfare for three out of four livelihood clusters, highlighting the fact that selecting into a specific livelihood portfolio changes welfare relative to expected levels. Our results show that war not only affects livelihood choices but also changes the returns to these activities.","[Douarin, Elodie; Litchfield, Julie] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Sch Business Management & Econ, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England; [Sabates-Wheeler, Rachel] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Ctr Social Protect, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Douarin, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Sch Business Management & Econ, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England.",e.douarin@sussex.ac.uk,"Douarin, Elodie/AAF-9967-2020","Douarin, Elodie/0000-0003-3915-0420; Litchfield, Julie/0000-0003-2795-9599",EU,EU(European Union (EU)),"Elodie Douarin is a Research Fellow with the Department of Economics, School of Business, Management and Economics at the University of Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RF, UK.

The results show that technical inefficiency is an important phenomenon in Czech agriculture and its individual branches. The TFP development is determined by all components, i.e., technical efficiency, scale effect, technological change and management. Their contributions differ intrasectorally and intersectorally, and also in time. Finally, the developments in the individual branches are characterized by idiosyncratic factors, as well as the systemic effect, especially in the animal production.

Therefore, how environmental managers will operate to deliver small and medium-sized inundation environmental flows remains uncertain. To assist environmental managers with the supply of inundation flows at variable times, it has been suggested that allocation trade be incorporated into efforts aimed at securing water. This paper provides some qualitative and quantitative perspective on what influences southern MurrayDarling Basin irrigators to trade allocation water at specific times across and within seasons using a market transaction framework. The results suggest that while irrigators now have access to greater risk-management options, environmental managers should consider the possible impact of institutional change before intervening in traditional market activity. The findings may help improve the design of intervention strategies to minimise possible market intervention impacts and strategic behaviour.","[Loch, Adam; Bjornlund, Henning; Wheeler, Sarah] Univ S Australia, Sch Commerce, CRMA, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Bjornlund, Henning] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada; [Loch, Adam; Connor, Jeff] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Ecosyst Sci, Glen Osmond, SA, Australia",University of South Australia; University of Lethbridge; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Loch, A (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Sch Commerce, CRMA, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",adam.loch@unisa.edu.au,"Wheeler, Sarah Ann/H-4000-2017; Bjornlund, Henning/F-4576-2013; Connor, Jeff/T-7345-2019; Bjornlund, Henning/ABB-9446-2020; connor, jeffery/G-5466-2010; Loch, Adam/F-4246-2013","Wheeler, Sarah Ann/0000-0002-6073-3172; Bjornlund, Henning/0000-0003-3341-5635; Bjornlund, Henning/0000-0003-3341-5635; connor, jeffery/0000-0002-2313-8630; Loch, Adam/0000-0002-1436-8768","Australian Research Council; Murray-Darling Basin Authority; Goulburn-Murray Water; NSW Office of Water; Department of Sustainability and Environment, CSIRO; University of Lethbridge, Canada","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Murray-Darling Basin Authority; Goulburn-Murray Water; NSW Office of Water; Department of Sustainability and Environment, CSIRO; University of Lethbridge, Canada","The authors would like to express their thanks to the irrigators who participated and offered detailed insights into their trading behaviour.

Cooperatives are seen as key vehicles in this, but little is known about their effectiveness to achieve these goals. In this article, we analyze the impact of cooperative membership on the agricultural performance of rural households in Rwanda. We use cross-sectional survey data, collected in 2012, to analyze the impact of cooperative membership on different agricultural performance indicators, including indicators on agricultural intensification, market orientation, farm revenue, and income. We use several econometric techniques to deal with potential selection bias in estimating the impact of cooperative membership, including a proxy variable method based on a willingness to pay measure and propensity score matching methods. We find that cooperative membership in general has a positive impact on farm performance but these effects are driven by specific types of cooperatives.","[Verhofstadt, Ellen; Maertens, Miet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Bioecon, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Verhofstadt, E (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Bioecon, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E Bus 2411, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",ellen.verhofstadt@ees.kuleuven.be,"Maertens, Miet/A-5509-2013","Maertens, Miet/0000-0001-7245-0375",VLIR-UOS (Vladoc scholarship program); KU Leuven Special Research Fund (OT program),VLIR-UOS (Vladoc scholarship program); KU Leuven Special Research Fund (OT program),"The authors acknowledge funding from VLIR-UOS (Vladoc scholarship program) and the KU Leuven Special Research Fund (OT program).

Differences in the effect of occasional smoking on body weight across BMI categories are small. Unlike daily smoking, the effects of occasional smoking on BMI are larger for females, exceeding 50% of the effects of daily smoking on BMI. These large effects constitute a threat as occasional smoking might be seen by females as an effective weight control strategy that carries lower health risks than daily smoking.

External linkages, ability to collect financial support from their members, management capacity, and formal governance structures all contribute to explaining relative performance in agricultural service delivery.

Such concerns arose in Melancthon Township (in southern Ontario) following the construction of a large wind farm. Existing literature has not reached a consensus regarding the nature of these impacts. This paper applies a hedonic approach to detailed data on 5,414 rural residential sales and 1,590 farmland sales to estimate the impacts of Melancthon's wind turbines on surrounding property values. These impacts are accounted for through both proximity to turbines and turbine visibility-two factors that may contribute to a disamenity effect. The results of the hedonic models, which are robust to a number of alternate model specifications including a repeat sales analysis, suggest that these wind turbines have not significantly impacted nearby property values. Thus, these results do not corroborate the concerns raised by residents regarding potential negative impacts of turbines on property values.","[Vyn, Richard J.] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Ridgetown, ON N0P 2C0, Canada; [McCullough, Ryan M.] Hlth Canada, Tunneys Pasture Ottawa, ON K1A 0K9, Canada",University of Guelph; Health Canada,"Vyn, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Ridgetown Campus,120 Main St E, Ridgetown, ON N0P 2C0, Canada.",rvyn@uoguelph.ca; ryan.mccullough@hc-sc.gc.ca,,,,,,,43,41,48,2,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

This paper uses laboratory experiments to explore the performance of the agglomeration bonus in achieving the socially optimal land management configuration in a local network environment where the information available to subjects varies and the strategic setting is unfavorable for efficient coordination. The experiments indicate that if subjects are informed about both their direct and indirect neighbors' actions, they are more likely to produce the socially optimal configuration. Thus effectiveness of the policy can be improved by implementing information dissemination exercises among landowners.

We extend existing knowledge about this relationship using the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth for adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 in the years 1996 to 2001. Fixed effect and instrumental variable models are estimated to examine endogeneity issues. We find that maternal employment is negatively related to the pathway variables. In contrast to previous research, we find little indication of a relationship between maternal employment and adolescent obesity.

However, despite considerable investment in a wide range of tools, uptake by advisers and farmers remains low. A greater understanding of the demand and the most valued features of decision support tools could improve the uptake and impact of DSTs. Using a choice experiment, we estimated the values that Australian farm advisers attach to specific attributes of decision support tools, in this case relating to weed and herbicide resistance management. Results from discrete choice models showed that advisers' preferences differ between private fee-charging consultants, those attached to retail outlets for cropping inputs, and advisers from the public sector. Advisers valued 'reliable accurate results', and also placed a consistently high value on models with an initial input time of three hours or less, compared to models that are more time demanding. Results from latent class models revealed a large degree of preference heterogeneity across advisers. Although the majority of advisers valued DST output that is specific to individual paddocks, approximately one-quarter of the respondents preferred generic predictions for the district rather than predictions with greater specificity. The choice experiments helped to identify the attributes most valued by advisers in different market segments. This has implications for those seeking to influence decision-making by allowing DST development to be better targeted towards the preferences of potential users.","[Kragt, M. E.; Llewellyn, R.

These include randomized controlled trials, comparison portals, information labels, financial incentives, sin taxes, and nudges. A taxonomy is proposed to classify such behavioral interventions. In the context of risky health behavior, each cluster of policies is then scrutinized under two respects: (i) What are its genuinely behavioral insights? (ii) What evidence exists on its practical effectiveness?

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the extent to which weather index-based insurance can contribute to reducing the revenue risk in maize production caused by yield variations. An average farm producing maize is analyzed for each of eight Chinese provinces, six of which are part of the Northern Plains of China. Design/ methodology/ approach - Data are based on the Statistical Yearbook of China and the Chinese Meteorological Administration. The used method of insurance pricing is burn analysis. Hedging effectiveness of precipitation index-based insurance is measured by the relative reduction of the standard deviation (SD) and the Value at Risk of maize revenues. Findings - Results reveal that precipitation index-based insurance can cause a reduction of up to 15.2 percent of the SD and 38.7 percent of the Value at Risk with a 90 percent confidence level of maize revenues in the study area. However, there are big differences in the hedging efficiencies of precipitation index-based insurance measured at different weather stations in the various provinces. Therefore, it is recommended for insurance providers to analyze the hedging effectiveness of weather index-based insurance with regard to the geographical location of their reference weather station if they would like to offer weather index-based insurance products. Research limitations/ implications - The absence of individual, long-term yield data in the study area prevents the evaluation of risk on individual farms. Thus, the hedging effectiveness can only be analyzed on an aggregated level of yield data and can rather be modeled for an average farm of a particular province. Originality/ value - To the author's knowledge, this paper is the first that investigates the hedging effectiveness of precipitation index-based insurance designed for reducing revenue risk of maize production in eight Chinese provinces.","[Pelka, Niels; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Finger, Robert] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Gottingen; Wageningen University & Research,"Pelka, N (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",npelka@gwdg.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021; Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742",,,,,40,10,10,4,54,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This study synthesizes recent literature on how the new generation of targeted input subsidy programs has affected national fertilizer use after accounting for crowding effects, and derives benefit-cost (BC) estimates of the fertilizer subsidy programs for Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia after accounting for crowding out and diversion. We highlight two major findings. First, accounting for the illicit diversion of program fertilizer can profoundly influence estimates of how fertilizer subsidy programs affect total fertilizer use and program impacts. Given recent evidence that 33% or more of total program fertilizer may be diverted before being received by intended beneficiary farmers, the failure to account for program diversion is shown to overestimate the contribution of the subsidy programs to national fertilizer use by 67.3% in the case of Malawi, by 61.6% for Zambia, and by 138.0% for Kenya. The second major finding is that the incremental value of maize output produced from these subsidy programs is considerably less than their costs in most years, except under unusually high maize price assumptions. Conventional BC analyses that do not account for crowding out and diversion may seriously overestimate the benefits of input subsidy programs. Greater attention to program design and implementation details to reduce problems of crowding out and diversion can substantially raise the returns to such programs.","[Jayne, T.

In this article we develop a price endogenous mathematical programming model to simulate and analyze the impacts of biofuel mandates and trade distortions on land use, agricultural commodity and transportation fuel markets, and global environment. We find that an 80% increase in total biofuel production from its 103 billion liter baseline level to the mandated 183 billion liter level in 2022 can be achieved with less than 2% increase in total cropland use in both countries. In the United States, this would occur with cellulosic biofuels meeting nearly half of the biofuels consumed and produced largely on cropland pasture and corn ethanol meeting the rest of the mandate and resulting in a 2% increase in corn price. In Brazil, the expansion in sugarcane production would be achieved by reducing land under pasture and a marginal increase in intensification of livestock production. In the aggregate, biofuel policies increase economic surplus in both countries by 1% and redistribute the benefits from agricultural consumers to agricultural producers and the fuel sector. Finally, we also find that full implementation of the mandates in North America, China, and the European Union would reduce the global life-cycle global greenhouse gas emissions by about 5%.","[Nunez, Hector M.] CIDE, Dept Econ, Aguascalientes 20313, Ags, Mexico; [Oenal, Hayri; Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

The governance systems in place for marine fisheries and for the marine environment, more broadly, will be critical in determining the extent to which these resources can be managed for sustainability. The paper focuses on the governance of internationally shared fisheries, and draws on a body of game-theoretic research to discuss present-day governance problems and to evaluate the implications of global environmental change for future efforts to maintain cooperative and effective governance of shared fishery resources. In particular, the increased likelihood of abrupt and unpredictable changes in the productive potential and migratory behavior of exploited fish stocks may threaten to disrupt cooperative management arrangements. The paper discusses the value of contingency planning based on anticipation of the possibility of such events and concludes with a discussion of future directions for both research and policy development.

Unlike previous research on the economic impacts of Bt, which mostly concentrated on financial benefits in terms of gross margins, we also quantify and monetize health and environmental benefits associated with technology adoption. Due to lower chemical pesticide use on Bt cotton plots, there are significant health advantages in terms of fewer incidents of acute pesticide poisoning, and environmental advantages in terms of higher farmland biodiversity and lower soil and groundwater contamination. Farmers themselves value these positive effects at US$ 79 per acre, of which half is attributable to health and the other half to environmental improvements. Adding average gross margin gains of US$ 204 results in aggregate benefits of US$ 283 per acre, or US$ 1.8 billion for the total Bt cotton area in Pakistan.","[Kouser, Shahzad; Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Kouser, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",skouser@uni-goettingen.de,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016; Kouser, Shahzad/ABD-7680-2020","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763;",Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan,Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan),"The Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan provided a stipend to the first author.

Common Agricultural Policy direct payments (DPs) are the main instruments to support farm income in the European Union. This article addresses their role in the concentration of farm income. This is done by calculating the Gini coefficient and its disaggregation in a large sample of Italian farms in the period between 2006 and 2007. Although this approach has been used to develop ex-post analysis in previous studies, this article is innovative given that it is used here in an ex ante analysis aimed at evaluating the likely impact of a recent reform proposal. This latter requests changing the current model to a regional model of DPs application to make payment rates (i.e., payment per hectare) homogeneous among farms in the same region. The analysis shows that DPs and farm incomes are both very concentrated but that DPs allow for an income concentration reduction in Italian farms. The shift to a regional implementation reduces DPs concentration and, to a limited extent, farm income concentration. Of the considered regionalization scenarios, those that redistribute DPs among regions are the most effective in reducing concentration. The extension of the Gini considered approach to an ex ante setting seems effective because it provides insights that could feed the policy debate regarding the forthcoming reform.","[Severini, Simone; Tantari, Antonella] Univ Tuscia, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University,"Severini, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tuscia, Via SC De Lellis, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",severini@unitus.it,"Tantari, Antonella/AAP-6191-2020; SEVERINI, Simone/A-6944-2017","Tantari, Antonella/0000-0002-5551-3618; SEVERINI, Simone/0000-0001-5501-3552",Italian Ministry of Agriculture (Mipaaf),Italian Ministry of Agriculture (Mipaaf),"The authors would like to thank the participants to the research project Analisi delle dinamiche evolutive del reddito in agricoltura attraverso l'utilizzo della banca dati RICA managed by the Istituto Nazionale di Economia Agraria (INEA) of Rome, funded by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture (Mipaaf) and coordinated by Dr. Roberto Henke.

Because Brazil is a large food producer, with a predominantly wage-earning agricultural labour force, our estimates include general equilibrium effects on market and transfer incomes, as well as the standard estimates of changes in consumer surplus. Although the expenditure (or consumer surplus) effects were large, negative and markedly regressive everywhere, estimates of the market-income effect were positive and progressive, particularly in rural areas. Because of this effect on the rural poor, and of the partial protection afforded by increases in two large social assistance benefits, the overall impact of higher food prices in Brazil was U-shaped, with middle-income groups suffering larger proportional losses than the very poor.

Although a considerable body of literature has examined income inequality between farm and nonfarm households, little is known about inequality in consumption. This research aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating consumption disparity between farm and nonfarm households. Using a nationally representative household survey from Taiwan, we apply an unconditional quantile regression-based decomposition method to decompose the differences in the distribution of household expenditure between these farm and nonfarm households. The results indicate that differences in the observed characteristics between these two types of households explain most of the consumption inequality. Moreover, the difference in the education level of the farm operator, household income, and the degree of urbanization are particularly important.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 1 Roosevelt Rd,Sec 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,"chang, hung-hao/0000-0003-2296-134X",National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC98-2410-H-002-070],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The author acknowledges funding support from National Science Council of Taiwan under Grant No: NSC98-2410-H-002-070.

Different criteriatechnical, economic, and financialare highlighted in the farmers decision to adopt this production. A farm-level model is proposed and incorporates these decision criteria. The objective is to test several incentive scenarios to encourage risk-averse cereal farmers to plant trees. A multiperiod model of investment is built and tests possible adoption by farmers based on financial and structural parameters and according to the outlook of agricultural markets. The simulations show that if the cash crop prices fluctuate in the future and if farmers are risk averse the strategy of on-farm diversification toward woody crops under contractual arrangements could be relevant for farmers to mitigate the risks in the long run.

However, the effects of these factors on the actual premium a consumer is willing to pay are quite different. Conditioned on the consumer being willing to pay a positive price premium, income level and the degree of concern over food safety are the only two factors that have significant effects on the actual premium consumers are willing to pay. A partir de donnes tirees dun sondage mene dans la province du Jiangsu, en Chine, nous avons etudie la perception et lattitude des consommateurs envers les systemes de tracabilite des aliments. A laide danalyses econometriques, nous avons examine les principaux facteurs qui influencent le consentement des consommateurs a payer un prix superieur pour des aliments dont la tracabilite est certifiee ainsi que le prix reel quils sont prets a payer. Les resultats de notre etude indiquent quune tres grande majorite de consommateurs en Chine sont preoccupes par la securite alimentaire, mais que leur consentement a payer un prix superieur pour des aliments dont la tracabilite est certifiee est limite. Le revenu, le niveau de scolaritee, la perception et lattitude envers les systemes de tracabilite, de meme que le degre de preoccupation concernant la securite alimentaire, ont des effets considerables sur le consentement des consommateurs a payer un prix superieur pour des aliments dont la tracabilite est certifiee. Toutefois, les effets de ces facteurs sur le prix reel quun consommateur est pret a payer sont tres differents. Lorsque des consommateurs consentent a payer un prix superieur, le niveau de revenu et le degre de preoccupation concernant la securite alimentaire sont les deux seuls facteurs qui influencent fortement le prix reel quils sont prets a payer.","[Wu, Linhai; Wang, Xiaoli] Jiangnan Univ, Jiangsu Prov Res Base Food Safety, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Lingling] Jiangnan Univ, State Key Lab Food Sci & Technol, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Suzhou Univ, Sch DongWu Business, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University; Soochow University - China,"Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Jiangsu Prov Res Base Food Safety, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wlh6799@vip.163.com; hualongxifeng6130@sina.com; zdhj7376@man.com; w_xiaoli@126.com,,,Study of the Dynamic Decision Model of Multiple Information Sources in the Process of Traceable Food System Construction; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71073069]; Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Project of the National Ministry of Education of P.R.C.

In recent years, milk quota values have increased dramatically, almost tripling in value since the mid 1980s. This led to the Dairy Farmers of Ontario intervening on the milk production quota exchange on two occasions: first, in November 2006 with a progressive transfer assessment and then in July 2009, replacing the former policy with a firm price ceilingfixing the unit price of quota at $25,000. These policies represent a significant redistribution of economic benefits from milk producers selling their quota to those remaining in the industry. The objective of this study is to first explore the reasons for the increase in production quota values; and second, to assess the welfare and distributional effects of each of the two quota policy schemes. Our results suggest that the increase in quota values were driven by basic economic factors and that the efficiency losses from intervention in the quota exchange are nontrivial. We conclude by suggesting there are several alternative policy options that could minimize efficiency losses while moderating the escalation in quota values.","[Cairns, Alex; Meilke, Karl] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Meilke, K (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, 307 JD Maclachlan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",acairns@uoguelph.ca; kmeilke@uoguelph.ca,,,"Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy; Competitiveness Research Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada; Ontario Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs; Canadian Dairy Commission","Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy; Competitiveness Research Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada); Ontario Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs; Canadian Dairy Commission","Financial support for this project was provided by the Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy and Competitiveness Research Network which is funded by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs, and the Canadian Dairy Commission.

We use Extreme Value Theory to model the tail returns and present results for these three different risk measures using agricultural futures market returns data. We compare estimated risk measures in terms of size and precision, and find that they are all considerably higher than Gaussian estimates.

This article investigates this conclusion using a large panel of agricultural and non-agricultural trade flows. The results are impressive: the multilateral institution has delivered significant positive effects on members agricultural trade despite its sensitive nature and the reluctance of members to undertake serious reform.

It is also not permeable and attractive for investors. The farmers are offered applicable and functional techniques, technologies and procedures. These are not used and exploited in an appropriate rate. Based on the analysis of business environment, there was found that the reason is the absence of the agroenvironmental management system in operative management of agricultural subjects. For the need of the possible implementation of the appropriate system into practice, there was developed a branch standard and subsequently a methodology for the application of agro-environmental management system on the basis of a general tool for environmental management. The methodology was developed, then implemented and tested under the conditions of a concrete farm. Before the implementation of requirements, there were established environmental indicators which were evaluated before and after the introduction of the proposed system. The results of the subsequent monitoring of the chosen environmental indicators of environmental status confirmed the functionality and accuracy of the developed management tool that can also be seen as the best available technique for the implementation of the current and prepared agricultural policy.","[Marada, Petr] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agr Food & Environm Engn, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Krikava, Lubomir; Krikava, Libor; Kutlvasr, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Forest Protect & Game Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Slama, Petr] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Anim Morphol Physiol & Genet, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Mendel University in Brno,"Marada, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agr Food & Environm Engn, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",p.marada@quick.cz,"Marada, Petr/AAF-7472-2021; Slama, Petr/L-3576-2018","Marada, Petr/0000-0002-1832-456X; Slama, Petr/0000-0003-0570-259X",Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [07/001/13200/562/000]; Ministry of Agriculture [07/001/13200/562/000],"Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic); Ministry of Agriculture(Gida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi)",Supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (Projects No. 07/001/13200/562/000).; This study was supported by the project No. 07/001/13200/562/000 Ecoagrobusiness focused on developing of non-production functions of agricultural land in the framework of the Rural Development Programme of the Ministry of Agriculture.,,26,4,4,0,18,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Using hemoglobin (Hb) levels as the outcome variable, the authors first measure the overall impact of a nutritional training program, then measure the impact separately by gender. Both descriptive and multivariate analyses are used. Findings - The results for the descriptive and econometric results were robust and consistent with the literature. Overall, we find no impact on students' Hb levels when we trained their parents about undernutrition and anemia. In both the descriptive and multivariate results, there was no difference in the change of Hb levels between control and treatment students. Parents in the treatment group did learn more about anemia than parents in the control group, but this increased knowledge did not lead to sharp changes in behavior, in general. The authors did find, however, that there was a measurable impact of parental training on the Hb levels of female students. In both the descriptive and econometric results the authors found that the Hb levels of female students rose more than those of male students, and that this difference was statistically significant. Originality/value - The paper reports the results of a randomized controlled trial that examined the effect of parental training on students in poor, rural schools in ten counties of Shaanxi province. Taken by itself, one of the policy implications of this study is that malnutrition is still a serious problem in China and it is worse among female students than male students. When parental training is given, the health status of girls improves but the health status of boys is unchanged. Parental training may not be the best way to fight anemia, but it can help narrow the nutrition gap between girls and boys.","[Luo, Renfu; Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yaojiang; Chang, Fang; Su, Xiaoqing] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rozelle, Scott] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Louvain, Belgium","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Northwest University Xi'an; Stanford University; KU Leuven","Zhang, LX (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023",,,,,,20,7,9,1,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The analysis shows the existence of agricultural price convergence among the EU member states since 1991, even including some countries were not members of the EU.

We add to the existing literature in three main directions. First, our analysis has broad coverage (150 EU regions over the 1990-2009 period); second, we work on the entire portfolio of CAP instruments; third, we rely on modern panel data methods. Results show that standard drivers, such as the relative income and the relative labour share, are important determinants of out-farm migration. Overall, CAP payments significantly contributed to maintain job in agriculture, though the magnitude of the economic effect has been quite moderate and heterogeneous across policy instruments.

This paper studies the link between such changes in landholding and household well-being during a period of rapid economic transformation in Vietnam. Using a rural household panel data set, we find a U-shaped relationship between landholding and well-being: both accumulating crop land and moving out of farming are associated with higher household income and expenditure. Notably, these relationships are greater in communes that are less developed, suggesting that the benefits of structural transformation may diminish at higher levels of development.","[Cuong Viet Nguyen] Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Anh Ngoc Tran] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",National Economics University - Vietnam; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Nguyen, CV (通讯作者)，Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam.",c_nguyenviet@yahoo.com,"Nguyễn, Cường/JDV-5253-2023; Nguyen, Cuong/L-8044-2018","Nguyen, Cuong/0000-0002-6803-3488",,,,,44,18,18,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

In this context, consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for safer, cleaner and animal friendlier beef was investigated through a choice experiment. The relative importance of WTP for these attributes shows that consumers place the highest values on food safety, followed by animal welfare and finally environmental protection. WTP for different combinations of the three attributes cannot be obtained by independent valuation and summation due to the presence of significant substitution relationships. However, some suggestions for the relationships between these attributes can be proposed through an after-survey analytical solution. The bias involved in separately valuing closely related attributes can potentially jeopardise the success of a differentiation strategy.","[Viegas, Ines; Fontes, Magda Aguiar] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med Vet, CIISA, P-1300477 Lisbon, Portugal; [Nunes, Luis Catela] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Madureira, Livia] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Dept Econ Sociol & Management, Vila Real, Portugal; [Santos, Jose Lima] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Forest Studies Ctr, P-1300477 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Universidade de Lisboa,"Fontes, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Fac Med Vet, CIISA, Ave Univ Tecn, P-1300477 Lisbon, Portugal.",magadaaguiar@fmv.ulisboa.pt,"; Viegas, Ines/N-5174-2017; Catela Nunes, Luis/G-1989-2011","Fontes, Magda/0000-0001-9267-4878; Viegas, Ines/0000-0002-1102-6885; Madureira, Livia/0000-0003-0954-9764; Catela Nunes, Luis/0000-0001-8115-6223",,,,,54,28,34,2,59,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Microeconomic analysis of water use conditions within IDs indicates that it can be economically optimal for IDs to engage in less reallocative activities compared to private water rights holders. Institutional insights combine to show that the political orientation of IDs favors irrigation over irrigators in the sense that the rewards of water marketing tend to be incompletely captured. Based on an analysis of 38 years of time series water transfer data, we found that IDs underparticipate in agricultural-to-municipal water transfers relative to non-irrigation districts in terms of water right-weighted transfers.

Several researchers, however, have observed evidence of a rotation as well, where WTP rises for some consumers and falls for others. Preference heterogeneity theory implies that this observation results from an increase in the dispersion of demand. We test this theory using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announcement data and Nielsen Homescan panel data for the fresh produce category. We find that the rotation effect cannot be disregarded, but is still dominated in welfare calculations by the shift effect of a recall announcement. Les estimations de la perte de bien-etre attribuable aux rappels d'aliments supposent, en regle generale, que l'annonce entraine des changements sur le plan de la demande ou la reduction du consentement a payer peu importe les quantites. Toutefois, plusieurs chercheurs ont observe des comportements selon lesquels le consentement a payer augmente chez certains consommateurs, tandis qu'il diminue chez d'autres. Selon la theorie de l'heterogeneite des preferences, cette observation decoule d'une dispersion accrue de la demande. Nous avons estime cette theorie a l'aide de donnees provenant des Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC - Centres pour le controle et la prevention des maladies) et de donnees provenant du panel de consommateurs Homescan de Nielsen dans les cas des produits frais. Les resultats de notre etude indiquent que l'effet de rotation ne doit pas etre neglige mais que, dans la determination du bien-etre, il est domine par l'effet de revirement que cree l'annonce d'un rappel d'aliments.","[Richards, Timothy J.; Nganje, William] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Management & Agribusiness, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA",Arizona State University,"Richards, TJ (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Management & Agribusiness, 7231 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall,San Tan 230B, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",trichards@asu.edu; William_Nganje@asu.edu,,"Richards, Timothy/0000-0001-8832-9609",,,,,25,3,3,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

In this paper, a two factor modeling framework is proposed to incorporate the impacts of these shocks. The model is used to analyze the optimal investment rule when such a composite water price process applies. It is found that ignoring the information on long-run water price, as in one factor models, can cause an exercise of the real option too early, and result in even negative investment net present value when long-run water price is low. Giving rise to closed form solutions of European option values, the modeling framework also contributes to facilitate the imminent emergence of water price derivatives in water markets. Les processus stochastiques a un seul facteur utilises pour determiner le prix de l'eau pourraient ne pas permettre de bien illustrer les impacts pertinents des chocs temporaires et des chocs permanents sur le prix de l'eau. Dans le present article, nous avons propose un cadre de modelisation a deux facteurs afin d'inclure les impacts de ces chocs. Nous avons utilise le modele pour analyser la regle d'investissement optimal lorsqu'un processus complexe de determination du prix de l'eau s'applique. Les resultats indiquent que le fait d'ignorer les facteurs de long terme sur le prix de l'eau, comme dans les modeles a un seul facteur, peut entrainer un exercice premature de l'option reelle et entrainer une valeur actualisee nette (VAN) de l'investissement negative lorsque le prix de l'eau a long terme est faible. Le cadre de modelisation, qui donne lieu a des solutions analytiques pour determiner la valeur des options europeennes, contribue aussi a faciliter l'apparition imminente d'instruments derives pour la determination du prix de l'eau sur les marches de l'eau.","Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Fac Business & Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Truong, CH (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Fac Business & Econ, Bldg E4A,Room 452, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",chi.truong@mq.edu.au,"Truong, Chi/I-2712-2016","Truong, Chi/0000-0001-6346-5516",,,,,34,1,1,0,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The translog cost function is estimated for the aggregate economy, the manufacturing sector and its subsectors, and the electricity generation subsector. The advantages of this work over previous literature relating to the Australian case are that it uses relatively recent data, focuses on energy-intensive subsectors and estimates the Morishima elasticities of substitution. The empirical evidence shown herein indicates weak-form substitutability between different energy types, and higher possibilities for substitution at lower levels of aggregation, compared with the aggregate economy. For the electricity generation subsector, which is at the centre of the CO2 emissions problem in Australia, significant but weak substitutability exists between coal and gas when the price of coal changes. A higher substitution possibility exists between coal and oil in this subsector. The evidence for the own- and cross-price elasticities, together with the results for fuel efficiencies, indicates that a large increase in relative prices could be justified to further stimulate the market for low-emission technologies.","[Shahiduzzaman, M.

Yet we know surprisingly little about SRI's socio-economic impact. Using data from Indonesia in 2009, this study assesses the impact of SRI on household incomes and child schooling. We find that SRI generates significant estimated yield gains. However, because SRI induces a reallocation of family labor from non-farm to farm, SRI users enjoy no household income gains. Despite the increased labor demand for farming, we find no evidence that SRI has a child labor effect.","[Takahashi, Kazushi] Japan External Trade Org, Inst Econ Dev, Tokyo, Japan; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Takahashi, K (通讯作者)，Japan External Trade Org, Inst Econ Dev, Tokyo, Japan.",Kazushi_Takahashi@ide.go.jp,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721",IDE-JETRO; JICA; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245038] Funding Source: KAKEN,"IDE-JETRO; JICA; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Kazushi Takahashi is an associate senior research fellow at the Institute of Developing Economies-Japan External Trade Organization.

Despite the contribution of the resources sector to economic growth, questions are frequently raised about the concomitant negative social, economic and environmental impacts. The Surat Basin in southern Queensland is a traditional agricultural region with a small but growing coal mining sector and a rapidly developing liquefied natural gas industry (mainly associated with extracting coal seam gas). In this paper, the preferences of residents in Brisbane, the State capital, are explored in relation to the relative importance of social, economic and environmental impacts of the resource boom in the Surat Basin. A choice modelling experiment was conducted to assess the trade-offs Brisbane residents would make (in monetary terms) between the economic benefits and the associated costs of increased mining activity on local communities. The results identify the strength of concerns about community and environmental impacts and can potentially be used to help evaluate the net benefits of resource development.","[Windle, Jill; Rolfe, John] CQUniversity, Ctr Environm Management, Rockhampton, Qld, Australia",Central Queensland University,"Windle, J (通讯作者)，CQUniversity, Ctr Environm Management, Rockhampton, Qld, Australia.",j.windle@cqu.edu.au,"Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017","Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040",Minerals Futures Collaboration Cluster under the CSIRO Minerals Down under National Research Flagship,Minerals Futures Collaboration Cluster under the CSIRO Minerals Down under National Research Flagship,The research outlined in this paper was funded through the Minerals Futures Collaboration Cluster under the CSIRO Minerals Down under National Research Flagship.

It is demonstrated that the coexistence of a risk premium wedge between marketing channel (live weight, dressed weight, and grid) pricing mechanisms, in conjunction with varying degrees of producer risk aversion or producer perception of carcass quality uncertainty, contributes to the coexistence of multiple marketing channels. It is also demonstrated that risk and risk preference provide the linkage between carcass quality uncertainty and producer marketing decisions. We demonstrate how this linkage can affect the structure of the fed cattle market and the variability in slaughter volume across marketing channels. We also confirm the linkage between value-based production techniques that increase seller information on carcass quality and seller increased usage of grid pricing regardless of actual carcass quality.

The paper provides an overview of policy options and a few concrete proposals, along with a summary of insights from economists on their advantages and disadvantages. Economists generally disfavor investment subsidies, but comparing other policy options, including regulatory approaches, technology mandates, and production subsidies, is complex. Excluding existing clean generation from incentive policies is tempting but can lead to perverse outcomes.","[Linn, Joshua; Richardson, Nathan] Resources Future Inc, Bristol, Avon, England",,"Linn, J (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, Bristol, Avon, England.",linn@rff.org,"Linn, Joshua/AAT-6768-2021",,,,,,16,2,3,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

A theoretical model of a two-enterprise, two-constraint farm is developed, and then, an empirical illustration for an Australian farm is provided. The methodology used builds on previous expected mean-variance (EV) models by incorporating land and budget constraints. The Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the EV model are examined to highlight that changes in resource endowments have larger effects on economic returns, than do changes in risk aversion or enterprise gross margin variability. It was also found that combinations of enterprise mixes that do not use all available resources can produce higher economic returns, relative to some enterprise mixes that use all available resources.","[Komarek, Adam M.] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [MacAulay, T.

We apply the relatively novel approach of hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) to a large panel of food economy firms to shed new light on the long-standing debate about the relative importance of industry, corporate parent and business unit effects on firm profits. Our results suggest that business unit and corporate effects are more relevant than industry effects in explaining firm performance differences in the food economy. In addition, we also explore the effect of specific strategic factors on performance within each level of analysis. In particular, we find that business-segment size, industry barriers to entry, corporate diversification, R&D intensity, capital intensity and resource availability are significant predictor variables that explain firm performance differences. Given the relatively important role of corporate effects and the positive influence of corporate strategic variables on business unit performance, our findings suggest that the environment provided by corporate parents significantly affects business unit profitability. In other words, corporate strategy does matter and thus should continue to draw attention from scholars interested in explaining profitability in the food economy.","[Chaddad, Fabio R.] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Chaddad, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",chaddadf@missouri.edu,"Mondelli, Mario U/J-5375-2016","Mondelli, Mario U/0000-0003-1811-3153",,,,,46,39,42,2,46,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

In cases where people have very different preferences for the types of input measures used, the utility of environmental protection options may be sensitive to the choice of inputs used to achieve the protection. The discrete choice experiment reported in this paper to value protection measures for the Great Barrier Reef in Australia is interesting in two important ways. First, different management policies to increase protection have been included as labels in the choice experiment to test if the mechanisms to achieve improvements are important to respondents. Second, the level of certainty associated with predicted reef health has been included as an attribute in the choice alternatives, helping to distinguish between outcomes of different management policies. The results show that protection values vary with the policy scope of the improvements being considered. Values are sensitive to whether protection will be generated by improving water quality entering the reef, increasing conservation zones or reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the level of certainty of outcomes. L'information sur les politiques de gestion mises en OEuvre en vue de realiser des objectifs de protection de l'environnement figure rarement comme variables dans les experiences impliquant des choix discrets. Dans les cas oU des individus ont des preferences marquees quant aux types de mesures employees, l'utilite des options pour la protection de l'environnement peut etre sensible au choix des mesures employees pour assurer la protection. Dans la presente etude, la methode des choix discrets que nous avons utilisee pour evaluer les mesures de protection de la Grande Barriere de corail situee au large de l'Australie est interessante pour deux raisons importantes. Premierement, des politiques de gestion axees sur l'accroissement de la protection ont ete designees comme alternatives dans la methode des choix discrets afin de verifier si les mecanismes deployes pour apporter des ameliorations revetent de l'importance pour les repondants. Deuxiemement, le degre de certitude quant a l'etat de sante prevu du recif corallien a ete inclus comme un attribut afin de differencier les resultats de diverses politiques de gestion. Les resultats de notre etude indiquent que les valeurs associees a la protection varient en fonction de l'etendue des ameliorations prevues par la politique en question.

A real option model is developed to capture risks and returns associated with the traits, and estimates are derived for drought tolerant corn. Base case results indicate a slight chance that the option value would be out-of-the-money during the discovery phase. In all other phases, the expected value is in-the-money.

In this paper, I first review how the marketing, health and nutrition claims made on packaging create health halos that make foods appear healthier than they are, thereby leading to higher consumption yet lower perceived calorie intake. I then show how packaging design (cues, shapes, and sizes) biases peoples perception of quantity and increases their preference for supersized packages and portions that appear smaller than they are. Finally, I examine the extent to which mandatory nutrition labels, stricter regulation of package claims, public promotion of mindful eating, and mindless eating nudges could limit the biasing effects of packaging on food perceptions and preferences.","INSEAD, Res Ctr, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France",INSEAD Business School,"Chandon, P (通讯作者)，INSEAD, Res Ctr, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France.",pierre.chandon@insead.edu,"chandon, pierre/D-5192-2009","chandon, pierre/0000-0002-1887-1985",,,,,132,147,160,4,231,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Although the BRIC are often grouped collectively as an emerging force in the world economy, divergent agricultural interests are reflected in different approaches towards agricultural policy both through international dispute settlement and notification of their own support. We examine the support notified to the WTO for verification of compliance with their legal commitments, which under the complex WTO rules often differs significantly from measurement of support in economic terms. We note the resulting difficulties of these disciplines in establishing limits on trade-distorting support. Implications of a Doha agreement are examined. Although the prospect of adoption of new Doha disciplines has become remote, the negotiated provisions are informative about the future policy space the BRIC sought to maintain.

The empirical results show that only two variables affect all quantiles, while their effect varies across quantiles. Some of the remaining variables affect the share of output sold at the lower quantiles (i.e. for subsistence- and semi-subsistence-oriented farmers) only, whereas other variables are only significant at the upper quantiles (i.e. for more commercially oriented farms).

The effectiveness is evaluated in a U.S. case study comparing the outbreak costs under the currently recommended HPAI control practice versus one which also includes vaccination. An integrated economic-epidemic partial equilibrium model is used to empirically simulate HPAI outbreaks in three different poultry regions within the State of Texas. The simulation results show that the effectiveness of vaccination depends on flock density in the region and risk aversion preferences of the decision maker. In regions with high flock densities, if the decision maker is less risk averse the currently recommended strategywhich includes depopulation, movement restrictions, and flock testingis more cost-effective than the same strategy supplemented with vaccination. Addition of vaccination improves cost effectiveness only if the decision maker is highly risk averse or if surveillance, carcass disposal, and cleaning costs are high. In regions with medium and low flock densities, adding vaccination to the currently recommended strategy is not cost-effective except in the case of high surveillance, carcass disposal, and cleaning costs.","[Egbendewe-Mondzozo, Aklesso] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Egbendewe-Mondzozo, Aklesso] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Elbakidze, Levan] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [McCarl, Bruce A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ward, Michael P.] Univ Sydney, Fac Vet Sci, Camden, NSW 2570, Australia; [Carey, John B.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Poultry Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Idaho; University of Idaho; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Sydney; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Egbendewe-Mondzozo, A (通讯作者)，Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Corso Magenta 63, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",emaklesso@gmail.com,"Ward, Michael Patrick/C-5758-2009; Ward, Michael Patrick/GRX-1851-2022; Ward, Michael Patrick/W-1897-2019; McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011","Ward, Michael Patrick/0000-0002-9921-4986; Ward, Michael Patrick/0000-0002-9921-4986;",USDA-ERS PREISM; Department of Homeland Security,USDA-ERS PREISM; Department of Homeland Security(United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS)),"Support of this research was mainly provided by a USDA-ERS PREISM grant, with a contribution from the Department of Homeland Security funded Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Defense (FAZD) center of excellence.

In this paper, we use a unique farm-level dataset (Agricultural Resource Management Survey from the U.S. Department of Agriculture) to examine the effect of contract farming on the farmers' average return for the corn, soybean and wheat producers. The matching estimation is used in the nature to compare the farmers' average return with or without participating contract farming. We first run a logit model to calculate the propensity score from the farmers' contracting decision problem. Then, use the propensity score to match farmers using the contracts and not using the contracts and compare their average returns. The empirical results show that contract farming has a positive effect on the corn and soybean producers' average return and insignificant effect on wheat producers:","Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 402, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Hu, WY (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 250 Kuo Kuang Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan.",wyhu@nchu.edu.tw,,,National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 100-2410-H-126-041],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This project was funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC 100-2410-H-126-041).,,16,7,7,1,24,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The analysis uses panel data for the years 2004 through 2008 from a representative sample of farm households in Liaoning province. Descriptive statistics reveal the age structure of the agricultural labor force and correlations between labor force age and production characteristics. A translog stochastic frontier production function and technical inefficiency model is employed to analyze the effect of aging of the labor force on the technical efficiency of crop production. Findings - The paper finds an accelerating trend towards aging of the agricultural labor force in the data. Results from the stochastic frontier production function and efficiency analysis reveal that household-level technical efficiency increases until maximum efficiency is reached when the average age of the household labor force is 45, after which efficiency declines. Practical implications - Aging of China's rural labor force may affect efficiency and productivity in crop production. Agricultural policies may need to pay more attention to the aging of the agricultural labor force. Some measures should be taken to address the pattern of migration, and policies to improve the social and economic environment in rural areas for younger workers should be developed. Also, extension programs could help older farmers to maintain efficient farming methods. Originality/value - This is one of very few analyses of the effects of aging on production efficiency for a developing country, as well as for China. The analysis uses a unique panel dataset that covers 24 counties, 1,890 rural households, and more than 6,000 individuals, with each household tracked for five years. Most of the literature estimating technical efficiency carries out the analysis at the individual level; in China and other developing countries, farming is carried out at the household level. We have adapted the methodology to apply to situations where the unit of analysis is the household.","[Li, Min] Shenyang Agricultual Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Sicular, Terry] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada",Shenyang Agricultural University; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Li, M (通讯作者)，Shenyang Agricultual Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China.",lm20010628@163.com,,"Sicular, Terry/0000-0003-2359-6970",Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Research [09YJC790191]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China [20092103120003],Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Research; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP)),"This paper is based on project supported by the Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Research (Grant No. 09YJC790191) and by the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (Grant No. 20092103120003).

Our results suggest that consumers are willing to pay a premium for organic milk but that this WTP decreases with the number of units purchased. Results also suggest that health issues, high price of organic foods, taste, and lack of information on organic foods are factors that influence WTP for organic milk. The type of information provided also plays a relevant role.

Improved safety of chicken production and trading is suggested as an important component of avian influenza control strategy, which aims to address the direct costs of avian influenza as well as the global public health externality. However, consumer demand for safely produced free-range chicken is unknown. Products that have credible food labeling are not common in traditional markets where the majority of free-range chicken is purchased. Valuing characteristics of products sold in informal markets is a major challenge that our experiment overcomes. As part of the experiment, we provided several vendors from these markets with safety-labeled free-range chicken. Consumer valuation of safety labeling was elicited through having experiment participants, who were representative of potential consumers, select between discount coupons for either safety-labeled chicken or regular chicken. Results indicate that consumers will pay at least $0.50, or a 1015% premium, per chicken purchase for safety labeling, which emphasizes safe production, processing, and transport conditions. This premium is smaller than the premium currently paid for traditional chicken varieties that are considered to be tastier. Consumers with more education have higher valuation of safety labeling. Hence, safety labeling for high-quality free-range chicken can play a role in controlling livestock disease and improving public health.","[Ifft, Jennifer] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Roland-Holst, David; Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Ifft, J (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, 1400 Independence Ave SW,Mail Stop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",jifft@ers.usda.gov,,,Pro-Poor Livestock Policy Initiative of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations; U.K. Department for International Development,Pro-Poor Livestock Policy Initiative of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations; U.K. Department for International Development,"We are grateful for comments from two anonymous referees which significantly improved this article.

We examine the impact of the recent massive penetration of information communication technologies (ICTs), particularly mobile phones and radios, in developing countries to investigate the role of information in economic transactions and participation in food crop markets. To fully capture market participation behaviours, the current theoretical framework on market participation and transactions costs is extended to include those households that sell and buy in the same time period. We correct for endogeneity and selectivity throughout our models. We used a novel dataset of 393 households in northern Ghana with detailed information on market transactions and ICTs usage. Results show that receiving market information via mobile phones has a positive and significant impact on market participation, with a greater impact for households with a surplus of food crops. We find that radios have a larger impact on the quantity traded. This may reflect the nature of mobile phones in reducing searching costs, whereas radios provide an updated and regular flow of information which affects the pattern of crops consumed and sold. We also emphasise that the most significant factor is how ICTs are used, rather than their ownership.",,,"Zanello, G (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Agr & Food Econ, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Whiteknights Rd, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",g.zanello@reading.ac.uk,,"Zanello, Giacomo/0000-0002-0477-1385",,,,,19,38,42,1,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

For most households retirement is anticipated and there is no decline in basic expenditures. However, for an important minority, retirement is 'involuntary' and these households experience a marked decline across the basic expenditure categories.","[Barrett, Garry F.] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Brzozowski, Matthew] York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",University of Sydney; York University - Canada,"Barrett, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",garry.barrett@sydney.edu.au; brzozows@yorku.ca,"Brzozowski, Matthew/AAA-3203-2022","Brzozowski, Matthew/0000-0003-4857-7127; Barrett, Garry/0000-0002-7669-7110","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA); Australian Research Council","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)(Australian Government); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","Garry Barrett is a professor in the School of Economics, University of Sydney, Australia (garry.barrett@sydney.edu.au).

To this end, we assess the role of irrigation in farmers' risk management. Based on the European Farm Accountancy Data Network data, we jointly estimate farmers attitudes to risk and their production decisions. We correct for sample selection bias and endogeneity. Results of the probit model show that irrigation technology serves as a self-insurance. Results of the joint estimation show that irrigating farmers have higher means but lower variance of profits than non-irrigating farmers. However, for already irrigating farmers, using more water volumes increases the variance of outcome.","[Erdlenbruch, Katrin] Irstea, UMR G EAU, F-34196 Montpellier 5, France; [Erdlenbruch, Katrin] LAMETA, F-34196 Montpellier 5, France; [Foudi, Sebastien] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Spain",INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Erdlenbruch, K (通讯作者)，Irstea, UMR G EAU, 361 Rue JF Breton,BP 5095, F-34196 Montpellier 5, France.",katrin.erdlenbruch@cemagref.fr,"Erdlenbruch, Katrin/AAG-7188-2021; Azkarate, Ainhoa/K-9087-2013; Foudi, Sebastien/I-3466-2013","Erdlenbruch, Katrin/0000-0002-5470-2636; Azkarate, Ainhoa/0000-0003-0471-3094; Foudi, Sebastien/0000-0002-8013-7853",ANR RISECO [ANR-08-JCJC-0074-01]; Cemagref; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-08-JCJC-0074] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),ANR RISECO(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Cemagref; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors acknowledge financial support from the ANR RISECO project ANR-08-JCJC-0074-01.

The article analyzes who stands to benefit and who is likely to lose if the EU liberalizes Mercosur's access to domestic beef markets. This economic assessment is performed using a partial equilibrium model for beef operating at a low level of product aggregation, paying specific attention to the role of Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs). Consultations with experts from the meat sector allowed us to identify the allocation of the quota rents to different stakeholders. Under an agreement based on the EU's negotiation proposal, trade impacts are projected to be small due to the present quota overfill. As expected, impacts are more pronounced under the conditions set out in Mercosur's proposal. The results confirm that the distribution of quota rents can be decisive in determining welfare effects.","[Junker, Franziska] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Heckelei, Thomas] Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Junker, F (通讯作者)，Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",franziska.junker@vti.bund.de,"Heckelei, Thomas/C-2714-2011","Heckelei, Thomas/0000-0002-6251-3480",,,,,33,3,3,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

As an EU member state, Slovenia is entitled to financial incentives intended to halt or at least ameliorate this trend, but the situation is nonetheless not improving. This article proceeds from the hypothesis that economic factors are not the only ones that affect succession on Slovenian farms. The hypothesis was confirmed in a study limited to mountain farms. It was determined that, although economic factors have a significant effect on succession on Slovenian farms, at the same time other factors also affect this. Among these, the factors that stand out the most are those through which tradition or traditional thought and behavioral patterns are expressed, as well as the factors that express the standpoints, perceptions, and opinions of farm owners.","UP Inst Republ Slovenia, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",,"Kerbler, B (通讯作者)，UP Inst Republ Slovenia, Trnovski Pristan 2, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",bostjan.kerbler@uirs.si,,,"Slovenian Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology","Slovenian Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology","Thanks are expressed to the Slovenian Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology, which financially supported this research.

Determinants or drivers of changes in the size of middle class are explored. Design/methodology/approach - An absolute definition of middle class, adjusted by rural purchasing power parity (PPP) and spatial price index, is employed to measure the size and geographic distribution of rural middle class in 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007. Biprobit models and OLS models are estimated to investigate the determinants and consumption behavior of middle class in rural China. Findings - Major findings include: in 2007, as many as 398 million rural residents or almost 54 percent of China's rural population belonged to the middle class; the size estimate of China's rural middle class based on income is broadly consistent with that based on assets; factors enhancing the probability of a household entering the middle class include human capital, political capital and non-farming employment while industrialization, urbanization and development of TVEs also play significant roles; and the middle class not only consume more, but also consume more durables. Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the paper is the use of 2002 data. However, more recent data are not available. Originality/value - The size of the middle-class is crucial for the stability of China, and the growth of the middle class in rural China is crucial for rebalancing the Chinese and global economy. Thus, the measurement results, the identified drivers, and the consumption behavior of rural middle class revealed in this paper can help shed light on nurturing middle class and adjusting development strategy for China to achieve a more sustainable and balanced economic growth.","[Yuan, Zhang] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Zhang] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Khor, Niny] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines",Fudan University; Fudan University; Asian Development Bank,"Yuan, Z (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhangyuanfd@yahoo.cn,,,China Natural Science Foundation [71063022]; Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project [B101]; Bairen Jihua (100 top scientists plan) of Yunnan province; 985 Project; Fudan Lab of China Development Studies at Fudan University,China Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project(Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project); Bairen Jihua (100 top scientists plan) of Yunnan province; 985 Project(Jilin UniversityXiamen University); Fudan Lab of China Development Studies at Fudan University,"The authors are grateful to Li Shi, Xin Xian and Iva Sebastian for various help and support.

The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with factorial arrangement comprising three replications. Pearl millet was sown alone and in association with cluster bean and cowpea with three sowing techniques like line sowing at 30cm apart rows, 45cm apart rows and by broadcast method. The net plot size was 8 m x 2.7 m. Data on growth, yield and quality parameters was recorded using standard procedures and was statistically analyzed by using Fisher's analysis of variance technique. Yield and quality parameters of pearl millet gave significantly better results by mix cropping with cluster bean. Results showed that maximum green forage yield (73.33 t ha(-1)), dry matter yield (15.25 t0 ha(-1)) and crude protein % age (17.98 %) was recorded by pearl millet and cluster bean sown in association with each other in 30 cm apart rows. Maximum benefit cost ratio (2.81) was calculated where pearl millet + cluster bean were sown at 30 cm apart rows.

Primary data were collected by surveys from 59 facilities. Enterprises were examined in two groups according to their cooling system, categorized as conventional and modern. During the surveys, depots with normal atmosphere were categorized as conventional cold storages and those with fully controlled atmospheres and also those with some storage rooms with controlled atmosphere were categorized as modern cold storages. The data used covers the 2010-2011 storage period. According to research results, total cost were calculated to be 245 117.90 USD per enterprise for the conventional cold storage facilities and 304 814.62 USD for the modern cold storage facilities. For conventional enterprises 60.14% of total costs are fixed costs and 39.86% are variable costs, while these rates are 62.60% and 37.40% for modern ones respectively. It was determined that economic profitability rates are 4.53 on conventional cold storage facilities and 10.39 for modern cold storage facilities; financial profitability rates are 4.91 for conventional cold storage facilities and 10.45 for modern cold storage facilities. The average break-even point was calculated to be 2 680.25 tonnes for the conventional cold storage facilities and 2 848.19 for the modern cold storage facilities.

So, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used in order to analyze the efficiency of farms producing sugarcane. Initially, when ascertaining the costs, it was found the most relevant to be related to human resources. It was found the profit to be related to productivity. Then, the average cost and breakeven point were calculated for this crop. The efficiency analysis identified the farms with 100% relative efficiency, since no losses were detected. For the inefficient farms, the analysis indicates a possible reduction in level of the inputs used. Therefore, it is recommended to implement actions that will increase the useful life of the sugarcane stand and will preserve the natural resources, as aiming at better yield from both land and inputs.

In general, these data show that every 100g of shrimp marketed, the producer of shrimp can lose on his investment up to $ 2.87. This information will serve as a parameter for setting the prices of traded commodities and also to control the reduction of costs, since every investment requires a return on invested capital.

It is hoped that this work will serve as a support informational for further studies on price volatility and study of this maximum loss acceptable and even in other commodities.","[dos Santos Felipe, Israel Jose; Rezende Mol, Anderson Luiz; de Souza e Almeida, Vinicio] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte,"Felipe, IJD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Edificio Ctr Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas CSSA,Camp, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil.",israeljfelipe@hotmail.com; mol@ufrnet.br; almeida.vinicio@gmail.com,"dos Santos Felipe, Israel José/O-3397-2015; Almeida, Vinicio/AAI-7219-2021; Mol, Anderson/H-3010-2017","dos Santos Felipe, Israel José/0000-0001-8608-0029; Almeida, Vinicio/0000-0002-1092-0332; Mol, Anderson/0000-0001-5915-8070",,,,,48,0,0,0,10,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2013,9.0,3,,,,,49,78,,,,,,30,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,251VT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326960500004,0

As for the size of the farm, it is believed that this interferes with the reduction of fixed costs of integration. Customer preferences are reasons influences the quality of the processes to maintain product quality and are met through appropriate diets and proper handling of animals during transport and accommodation. Contingency factors similarly affect all links in the value chain and it is not possible to state that the management structure of the farms is totally decentralized.","[Toigo, Leandro Augusto; Wrubel, Franciele; Diel, Fabio Jose; Facin Lavarda, Carlos Eduardo] Univ Blumenau FURB, BR-89012900 Blumenau, SC, Brazil",Universidade Regional de Blumenau (FURB),"Toigo, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Blumenau FURB, Rua Antonio da Veiga 140, BR-89012900 Blumenau, SC, Brazil.",leandrotoigo@yahoo.com.br; franciele_wrubel@yahoo.com.br; f_diel@hotmail.com; clavarda@furb.br,"LAVARDA, C.

Thus, the study aims to identify some strategic enabling cooperatives to increase its revenue and result. Through simulations, the study also shows the effects on income if the suggested strategies are implemented and projections prove accurate. The relevance of this study is justified by the growing importance of costs in decision-making organizations, as well as the difficulty that shops belonging to cooperatives face to increase its turnover due to the restriction of the market. The methodology used in this project is the case study, considering the processes related to a cooperative, showing variable costs, contribution margin and market potential. The results of the study, it appears that the cooperative can increase by 64% its sales to farmers cooperatives that supply milk, if kept the relationship shown between the cooperative and ten associates evaluated. Based on simulations, considering projections of changes in price and variations of quantities sold, the cooperative can achieve an increase of 16.02% in revenue and an increase of 30.47% in the total contribution margin.","[Eckert, Alex; Mecca, Marlei Salete; Biasio, Roberto; Sassi, Eder] Univ Caxias do Sul, BR-95070560 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil",Universidade de Caxias do Sul,"Eckert, A (通讯作者)，Univ Caxias do Sul, R Francisco Getulio Vargas 1130, BR-95070560 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil.",alex.eckert@bol.com.br; msmecca@ucs.br; rbiasio@commcenter-rs.com.br; edersassi@yahoo.com.br,"Eckert, Alex/F-7165-2012; Mecca, Marlei Salete/V-5134-2017","Eckert, Alex/0000-0002-8704-9549; Mecca, Marlei Salete/0000-0001-7545-3184",,,,,13,2,2,0,17,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2013,9.0,2,,,,,188,209,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,251VH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326958800010,0

This situation is characterized as an organizational problem, whose solution is presented by applying the decision tree, representing a proposition plan. In this sense, the estimates of the major costs and revenues associated with the production of oranges were obtained in farm Recanto das Aguas, from the choice of the region until revenue for the first crop. These data were allocated in the decision tree, revealing the main scenarios (sale to industry or market). After that, the estimated cash flows were analyzed according to three criteria diffused in the literature (payback, IRR and NPV), which indicated that the sale of the fruit to market presents more economically viable.

The results showed that the analysis can be extended CVP and adapted to the reality experienced by managers, considering the existence of multi-product and the presence of uncertainty, or generation of random numbers by simulation frequencies and to infer probabilities.","[Grespan Bonacim, Carlos Alberto; Ciampaglia Nardi, Paula Carolina; Menezes da Silva, Ricardo Luiz; Cruz Junior, Roberto; Bonizio, Roni Cleber] FEARP USP, BR-14040905 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil",,"Bonacim, CAG (通讯作者)，FEARP USP, Av Bandeirantes 3900, BR-14040905 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",carlosbonacim@fearp.usp.br; paulanardi@fearp.usp.br; rlmsilva@terra.com.br; betocruzjr@yahoo.com.br; rbonizio@usp.br,"Bonizio, Roni Cleber/W-2701-2019; Bonacim, Carlos Alberto Grespan/AAD-7222-2021; Cruz, Rosario Garcia/D-1486-2018; Nardi, Paula/M-6551-2015","Bonizio, Roni Cleber/0000-0002-2794-3274; Nardi, Paula/0000-0001-7897-3070",,,,,34,9,10,0,34,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2013,9.0,3,,,,,27,48,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,251VT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326960500003,0

Main material of the study consists of the primary data compiled by the surveys from 141 dairy cattle breeder enterprises which are determined by layered random sampling method. Data obtained from the research area in 2013 is reviewed according to the enterprises' size groups and enterprises' fair average on the basis of the number of suckling cow. According to the results of the study, in the enterprises reviewed, there is an average of 4.87 heads suckling cow and 7.85 Large Animal Unit (LAU) per enterprise. In the enterprises it is determined that an average of 27 tons of milk is produced in one lactation period. Milk yield per suckling cow is 5.6 ton/lactation. Among the enterprises surveyed, 59% of them had 1-4 head, 33% had 5-9 head and 8% had 10 head and above suckling cows. It has been also determined that the feed cost was the highest as 81.6% in the variable costs in the dairy cattle breeder enterprises according to the enterprise mean values. Following this, there were the veterinary-medicine costs (8.2%), electricity costs (2.4%), variable labour costs (1.8%), water and cleaning supplies (1.8%), artificial insemination costs (1.6%) and other costs (2.6 %). When the dairy cattle breeder enterprises are examined according to their size groups, it is seen that large enterprises (10 head and above) have produced more milk per suckling cow and gained higher milk yield and more gross margin compared to the small (1-4 head) and middle (5-9 head) enterprises.","[Semerci, Arif; Parlakay, Oguz; Celik, Ahmet Duran] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey",Mustafa Kemal University,"Semerci, A (通讯作者)，Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, POB 31034, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.",arifsemerci69@gmail.com; oguzparlakay@hotmail.com; ahmetdurancelik01@hotmail.com,"PARLAKAY, Oğuz/U-6672-2017; Semerci, Arif/HTL-3968-2023; celik, Ahmet/IAP-5710-2023","PARLAKAY, Oğuz/0000-0001-6012-0723; Semerci, Arif/0000-0003-0893-3748;","Mustafa Kemal University; Hatay Provincial Directorate of Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock [2013-9162]","Mustafa Kemal University(Mustafa Kemal University); Hatay Provincial Directorate of Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock(Gida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi)","This study was supported by Mustafa Kemal University and Hatay Provincial Directorate of Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock within the scope of the research project numbered 2013-9162.",,27,10,10,0,4,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2014,10.0,4,,,,,154,170,,,,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,CJ8OH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000355762000008,0

Climatic condition behavior patterns during each of these phases interfere directly in the productive performance of the plant. Theoretical review points out that the productivity of the crop affects the formation of the production costs of the crop. Thus, the aim was to investigate arabica coffee production cost behavior in relation to the climatic factors during the phenological phases of the coffee plant. For this investigation we used descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression (R-2). In the first stage it was observed that the cities with adverse climatic conditions showed the highest total production cost and lower productivity levels. The results of the multiple linear regressions (R-2) presented waste autocorrelation problems and multicollinearity, and therefore need further investigation. The relevance of this study is mainly associated to the theoretical contribution of the behavior of arabica coffee production costs in relation to climatic factors, due to the scarcity of studies of such nature.","[Rodrigues, Nubia Aparecida] Univ Fed Uberlandia, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [dos Reis, Ernando Antonio] Univ Fed Uberlandia, USP, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Tavares, Marcelo] Univ Fed Uberlandia, ESALQ, BR-38408100 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal de Uberlandia,"Rodrigues, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Uberlandia, Av Joao Naves de Avila,2121 Campus Santa Monica, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.",nubiarodrigues@reito.ufu.br; eareis@ufu.br; mtavares@ufu.br,"Reis, Ernando/R-6791-2019",,,,,,34,2,3,0,13,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2014,10.0,3,,,,,216,255,,,,,,40,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,CA0II,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348600800011,0

The methodology used for the investigations of yield cost was one suggested by the Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (CONAB). This methodology enables to calculate through processing of collected data in Excel's spreadsheets - the cost per acre of production, determination of revenue, contribution margin, breakeven point and statement of income. The found results demonstrate that the studied rural property had income in both periods; however, there was a large yield reduction in the second year due to drought. It is possible to conclude that the present research contributes to management of cost and incomes in small rural properties and that the methodology presented by CONAB can contribute to the managerial development in these properties.","[Battistussi, Fernando; Antonelli, Ricardo Adriano; Bortoluzzi, Sandro Cesar] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana, BR-85503390 Pato Branco, PR, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana; Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana,"Battistussi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Tecnol Fed Parana, Via Do Conhecimento,Km1, BR-85503390 Pato Branco, PR, Brazil.",fernandobattistussi@hotmail.com; rantonelli@utfpr.edu.br; sandro@utfpr.edu.br,"Bortoluzzi, Sandro César/E-6290-2012","Bortoluzzi, Sandro/0000-0003-3493-8518",,,,,22,5,5,0,7,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2014,10.0,3,,,,,180,215,,,,,,36,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,CA0II,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348600800010,0

According to the study results there is a high adoption level of farmers on apple cultivation from early warning system thus 41.6% of the farmers exactly adapt the pesticide application time from early warning system but farmers have lack of information about the system. There is a positive relation between adoption and education level, both levels increase at the same time. Early warning adoption levels also decrease unit production cost of apple. Relative profit has a statistically meaningful relation between early warning adoption level (p<0.05). Total pesticide cost increased 10.92% due to unnecessary usage.

The results show to be relevant at the moment that, through empirical evidence, were confirmed the findings of previous studies, reinforcing the need to adjust the traditional methodology of Target Costing.","[Hipolito Bernardes do Nascimento, Joao Carlos; Bernardes, Juliana Reis] Univ Fed Piaui, BR-47300000 Casa Nova, BA, Brazil; [de Sousa, Wellington Dantas] Fac Ciencias Aplicadas & Sociais Petrolina, BR-48907140 Juazeiro, BA, Brazil; [Lancini, Simone Piton] Ecoterra Consultoria Ltda, BR-95200000 Vacaria, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Piaui,"do Nascimento, JCHB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Piaui, Quadra Z 1,Lote 31, BR-47300000 Casa Nova, BA, Brazil.",jchbn@hotmail.com; jureis3d@hotmail.com; wellington.bmb@hotmail.com; slancini@hotmail.com,,,,,,,65,1,1,0,21,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2013,9.0,3,,,,,242,269,,,,,,28,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,251VT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326960500012,0

The determinant variables of the willingness to pay that were significant were evaluated. These variables were the condition of the owner and the perception of low performance derived from the erosion condition of the land, unlike variables such as yields, expenses or costs which can be due to the perception as such in the economy of the smallholder who lives off the land.

The analysis is based on calculations of average costs of chamomile production per hectare, costs of agricultural mechanization, and determination of profit in chamomile production. To structure weather put option the key issue is calculation of option payoff and evaluation of risk price (fair premium) a buyer is willing to pay for risk transfer. Fair premium is determined by burn-rate method. Chamomile revenue is calculated with use of the weather derivatives and without them using stochastic simulation method. Calculations are performed by appropriate computer software (@ Risk). Results have shown that use of weather put option is efficient only if production location is in the immediate vicinity of weather station and if the correlation between quantity of precipitation and chamomile yield is high.","[Markovic, Todor] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Univ Novi Sad Inst, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Ivanovic, Sanjin; Pajic, Milos] Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Belgrade Univ Inst, Dept Agr Econ, Zemun Belgrade 11080, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Belgrade,"Markovic, T (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Univ Novi Sad Inst, Trg D Obradov 8, Novi Sad, Serbia.",todor.markovic@polj.edu.rs; sanjinivanovic@agrif.bg.ac.rs; paja@agrif.bg.ac.rs,"Markovic, Todor Djordje/GYQ-6142-2022",,"Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III-46006, TR-31051]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia","This paper is a result of the research on the project III-46006 and project TR-31051 financed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia.",,17,1,2,0,5,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2014,10.0,2,,,,,285,295,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,AW2XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346148900014,0

The model seeks to determine prices trigger to invest and abandon the crop due to the behavior of prices and costs of starting production, maintenance and abandonment of farming the crop. The methodology used is quantitative, seeking to show how the input and output prices are affected by the behavior of market prices over time, fixed costs, variable and time the crop establishment. Since the goal of the work involves the use of time series, it is convenient that we can use the series to present the largest number of observations.

The Republic of Serbia still remains a fertile ground for numerous manipulations regarding consumer rights, particularly in terms of health claims for food products, which tend to minimize the risks of non-organic or inadequate nutrition. This manipulative minimization of risk is reflected through the presence of food products with such visual identity that could affect the consumer's choice of purchase, believing that they made a healthy choice for themselves and their environment. This paper presents the results of an empirical research of the presence of health claims on food products available on the market of the Republic of Serbia.

The absorption costing method appears to be more suitable to the reality of nurseries, since the distortions caused by the cost sharing do not drastically impact the final result.","[Vasconcelos, Yumara Lucia; de Franca, Suely Morais; da Silva, Georgia Fabiana] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Adm, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Yoshitake, Mariano] Fac Alves Faria, BR-01311300 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE); Universidades Alves Faria,"Vasconcelos, YL (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Adm, Rua Dom Manoel de Medeiros S-N, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil.",yumaravasconcelos@uol.com.br; kimimarinamariano@gmail.com; suelygeo@yahoo.com.br; georgiafabianasilva@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,5,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio,APR-JUN,2012,8.0,2,,,,,158,175,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,083IB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314455700008,0

In this sense this article aims to examine the effect of environmental costs in the economic performance of a company producing cotton. To achieve the proposed objective method was used as a case study in a company located in southern Mato Grosso. Have been calculated the costs of production of cotton per hectare without considering the environmental costs were identified and then spending on environmental protection and preservation and transferred to the cost of production. Was verified that the environmental costs when allocated to the products in the proper ratio increases the production costs of 3.3%. However, the effect on income was more than 27% in the period. In the case of economic performance environmental costs had impact of more than 29% return on investment influencing the profitability of the company.

This study investigated the peculiarities of applying fair value to biological assets in livestock farming in Brazil. This activity was selected due the existence of an active market for animals in various phases of life. The investigation conducted a case study to explore the valuation systems in use, comparatively to fair value requirements. The obtained results showed that the application of fair value in Brazilian agricultural and livestock farming would be in stages.

To this end, this is a descriptive study, based on a case study, with qualitative approach. Data were collected through observations, interviews and primary documents. The techniques used for data analysis were descriptive and documentary analysis. It was concluded that the pasture fattening has better results, whilst feedlot fattening runs the risk of losses. It can be inferred that the risk of feedlot fattening is greater because it presents greater variation in results, since, due to their high cost, the results are linked to the selling price. However, feedlot fattening has some advantages. Among them, stands out the space issue, since feedlot fattening requires a considerably smaller area; the time issue, once the cycle of feedlot fattening is twice smaller than the pasture fattening; and the issue of climate vulnerability, as the climate affects considerably less this fattening mode.","[Raupp, Fabiano Maury] Univ Estado Santa Catarina, UFBA, BR-88035001 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Fuganti, Eduardo Nery] Univ Estado Santa Catarina, BR-88035001 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Bahia; Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina; Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina,"Raupp, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Estado Santa Catarina, UFBA, Av Madre Benvenuta 2-037, BR-88035001 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",fabianoraupp@hotmail.com; e.fuganti@gmail.com,"Raupp, Fabiano Maury/GON-5913-2022","Raupp, Fabiano Maury/0000-0001-9533-2574",,,,,24,5,5,1,12,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2014,10.0,3,,,,,282,316,,,,,,35,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,CA0II,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348600800013,0

The sample consists of 72 companies listed on BM&FBovespa. After data collection was structured analysis economic/financial, through performance indicators (indebtedness, liquidity, activity and profitability). The results showed that companies had a strong impact on these indicators in 2008, with increased debt and extension of payment terms from suppliers and on the other hand, reduced liquidity and profitability. A quick recovery in 2009 and 2010 is shown with companies with values similar to pre-crisis period. Thus we conclude that the crisis has affected the Brazilian companies listed on BM&FBovespa, the agribusiness segment, in 2008, with rapid recovery thereafter.

In Brazil, the technical pronouncement - biological Assets and agricultural products (CPC 29) issued rules that introduce fair value for evaluation of biological assets, rather than historical cost. Thus, the focus of this study is to verify, by regression analysis (pooling), if the change in the measurement of biological assets brought informational content to the capitals market. For this, we analyzed the question of value-relevance of the biological assets measured by fair value and by historical cost for the publicly traded Brazilian companies that explored biological assets in the financial years of 2008 and 2009. The empirical results support the replacement of the historical cost for the fair value measurement of biological assets was not relevant to users of accounting information. A reason for this finding is the fact that the historical cost measurement is more verifiable, objective and easily understood. On the other hand, by fair value, generally calculated on the basis of estimates, principally through the discounted future cash flow, the measurement becomes more difficult to be understood and, therefore, may be less relevant to users of accounting information.","[da Cunha e Silva Filho, Augusto Cezar; Veras Machado, Marcio Andre; Machado, Marcia Reis] Univ Fed Paraiba, Ctr Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas, BR-58059900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Paraiba,"Silva, ACDE (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Paraiba, Ctr Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas, Campus 1,Cidade Univ, BR-58059900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.",cezarfilho89@hotmail.com; mavmachado@hotmail.com; marciareism@hotmail.com,"Machado, Marcio/M-5449-2014","Machado, Marcio/0000-0003-2635-5240; Machado, Marcia/0000-0003-4081-6058",,,,,44,13,15,0,63,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2013,9.0,2,,,,,27,50,,,,,,24,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,251VH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326958800003,0

The theoretical and empirical reference comprises the family farm, costs management in rural activity and characterization of the tobacco sector in Brazil. The methodology is exploratory, bibliographical, documental, and applies questionnaires directly to farmers. The approach is quantitative, using descriptive statistics. The research population consists of the tobacco producers located in the municipality of Rio Azul, State of Parana. The sample of 71 (seventy one) tobacco farmers of that county was composed by accessibility. Questions about costs, earnings, and advantages were formulated according to a modified Likert scale of 4 points. The results corroborate previous studies and indicate that the perception of farmers regarding the control of production costs is poor and rarely takes formal aspect, as usually occurs in small family farms. As a consequence, the calculation of the economic result is not performed satisfactorily. In addition, expenditures perceived as relevant by the farmers tend to be recognized as capable of influencing earnings, but the connection is not clear as one would expect if entrepreneurial attitudes were prevalent.","[Clemente, Ademir] Univ Fed Parana, BR-80210070 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Taffarel, Marines] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana PUCPR, Univ Estadual Ctr Oeste UNICENTRO, BR-84555000 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Souza, Alceu] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, BR-80215901 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Beledeli, Andrea Marcinek] Univ Estadual Ctr Oeste UNICENTRO, BR-08455500 Guarapuava, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana; Universidade Estadual do Centro Oeste; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana; Universidade Estadual do Centro Oeste,"Clemente, A (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Parana, UFPR Campus 3 Setor Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas,1, BR-80210070 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",ademir@ufpr.br; marinestaffarel@yahoo.com.br; alceu.souza@pucpr.br; andreamarcinek@hotmail.com,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,7,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2012,8.0,4,,,,,127,146,,,,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,096CD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315380500006,0

We conducted a survey exploratory well with a producer of sugar cane, in Ribeirao Preto, mapping the main costs of production of sugar cane, from planting to harvest. The cost was divided by activity, such as preparation and soil treatment; plantation of sugar cane; chemical treatment of soil; fertilization (ratoon cane), chemical treatment of soil (ratoon cane). After, some indicators were calculated, such as COE (Operating Cost Efficient), TOC (Total Operating Cost), TC (Total Cost), productivity and the amount of ATR per ton produced. These indicators aim at a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the production of small and large producers, by comparison of production costs per hectare of cane produced, and also to compare the quality of sugarcane. The indicators were extracted from the large producers of research and studies conducted by institutions and researchers. As a result, can be verified a lower cost production of lager producers, which had a gain scale against small producers, because of the large scale of production. Referring to the productivity and quality of sugar cane produced, the independent producer was better than the large producers.","[Moreira, Mariana Guidoni] FEA USP Ribeirao Preto, BR-14050230 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Bonizio, Roni Cleber] FEA USP Ribeirao Preto, BR-14040900 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil",,"Moreira, MG (通讯作者)，FEA USP Ribeirao Preto, Av Cafe 131,Bloco B,Ap 41, BR-14050230 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",mgmoreira@fearp.usp.br; rbonizio@usp.br,"Bonizio, Roni Cleber/W-2701-2019","Bonizio, Roni Cleber/0000-0002-2794-3274",,,,,12,2,2,0,9,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio,APR-JUN,2012,8.0,2,,,,,84,99,,,,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,083IB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314455700005,0

There is strong support for the extension of Heavy Rail into the North West Area of Sydney, despite an extensive network of frequent and fast bus services operating along three busways and providing single seat service between low density residential areas, regional centres and the CBD of Sydney. This has led to a number of proposals since 1998 for the North West Rail Link that is now under construction and will replace most direct bus routes with rail feeder services. Previous research demonstrated that the project would have ambiguous benefits for existing public transport users in terms of frequency, travel time and fares. This paper examines the various iterations of the project to explore whether the succession of proposals has led to a project that will provide a better or worse level of service, in terms of travel time, than either the initial proposals or the existing network of services.

Following the outbreak of the financial crisis, the average margins in the Dutch mortgage market increased sharply and reached historically high levels. In 2011, the margins fell back to pre-financial crisis levels. The historically high margins were accompanied by significant increases in concentration due to a merger between two relatively large banks and the (partial) exit of several smaller (foreign) banks. In the study, we found no indication that the temporary high margins were driven by collusive conduct. The price leadership bans of the European Commission can also not explain the margin developments around 2009, because these developments precede their introduction. There is, however, some evidence that the bans have led to higher prices in the Dutch mortgage market.","[Overvest, Bastiaan] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [Overvest, Bastiaan] Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr TILEC, Tilburg, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Tilburg University,"Overvest, B (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.",b.overvest@cpb.nl; gulbahar.tezel@nl.pwc.com,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

After many years of 'grandfathering' (continuing rollover of negotiated contracts with long-established private operators), competitive tendering has been progressively implemented for bus services in Sydney and Melbourne, and is also planned for Brisbane. All bus services in Adelaide and some services in Perth, which were previously competitively tendered, have also been retendered. The paper addresses the context for these changes, the events that have occurred and their outcomes. The empirical evidence assessed shows that procurement through competitive tendering has reduced the costs of service provision, very substantially so where the services were previously provided by government monopoly operators, and rather less so, but still significantly, where contracts were previously negotiated with incumbent private operators. In both cases, improvements in service quality and delivery have also been achieved, resulting in increased patronage. Our assessment reinforces the need for robust operator procurement processes, and for mechanisms and incentives for operators to develop their services to better match market needs. The learnings from the recent experience are very relevant to further developments in procurement/contracting policy for urban bus services, in Australia and also internationally.

Following deregulation, resource misallocation declines and the left-hand tail of the firm-size distribution thickens significantly, which suggests increased entry by small firms. However, the dominance and growth of large incumbent firms remains unchallenged. Quantile regressions reveal that the distributional effects of deregulation on firm size are significantly nonlinear. The reallocation of market shares toward a small number of large firms and a large number of small firms is characterized as the shrinking middle in Indian manufacturing.

J,"Dwyer, T",,,,"Dwyer, Terence",,,Taxation: The Lost History,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Regular, periodic taxation is a function of modern government, a practice that arose only because the rent of land and natural resources was transformed from the traditional source of public revenue in the Middle Ages to private property, starting in the 17th century. In the earlier era, taxes (special exactions on ordinary income and daily necessities) were imposed only under unusual circumstances, usually to fight wars. The French Physiocrats and their student, Adam Smith, proposed that the best form of modern taxation would be based on the same principle as the medieval system-a fee derived entirely from surpluses, not imposed as a burden on production. This was actually what Adam Smith meant by ability to pay. Smith's sophisticated understanding of economic rent was, however, simplified and distorted by numerous economists throughout the 19th century, who buried the concept under layers of obfuscation. In particular, the substitution of Paretian rent for Ricardian rent committed the fallacy of composition by shifting rent from a social concept to a private, unit-level concept, which caused social surplus to simply disappear. Bringing this lost history to light permits us to re-evaluate how modern societies might benefit from Smith's physiocratic concept of taxation. This work not only traces debates about rent-for example, whether rent arises from risk-taking, or whether a tax on rent raises commodity prices-but also discusses the practical benefits of taxing it today.",,,,,,,,,,,0,5,5,2,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We contribute to the literature by exploring whether a direct measure of mood explains the Monday effect. In line with psychological literature, a greater proportion of investors are more pessimistic in the early days of the week, and become more optimistic as the week progresses. We use novel daily mood data from Facebook across 20 international markets to explore the impact of mood on the Monday anomaly. We find that the Monday effect disappears after controlling for mood. In line with our hypothesis that mood drives the Monday effect, we find that the effect is more prominent within small capitalization indices and within collectivist and high-uncertainty-avoidance countries.

It also assesses the relationship between size and expenditure/service levels in Irish local government, drawing on available data. Contrary perhaps to popular belief, county and city councils, the primary units of local government in Ireland, are already very large by international standards. Overall, the research suggests a weak link between size and costs, and that local authority mergers may have limited intrinsic efficiency value and can involve considerable transitional costs.

This paper presents an input-output analysis on how the port sectors impact a concerned economy using the South African case. Moreover, this paper reports how a rectangular Supply and Use Table system of national accounts can be converted to a traditional square symmetric matrix type system. A range of models, such as demand-driven, supply-driven and price models, were derived for the estimation. From these models, the production effect together with the forward and backward linkage effects, price change effects and employment effects were estimated to determine the impact of port sectors. The overall forward linkage effect of the port sector was 0.97 and the backward one was 0.48, indicating that the port sector does not appear to use other sectors much in producing its activities whereas the port sector is used relatively more by other industries owing to its relatively high forward linkage effect. The overall impact effect of the port sector per unit shortage on all other products was found to be 1.1705.

This economic effort is seldom set off, which leads to subsidies with the money collected from public debt growth or tax pressure increases. The question that immediately emerges is whether the entrance of this new infrastructure generates economic spillovers at the local level and, consequently, improves local public budgets. To solve this question we use local data on economic activity, municipalities' characteristics and local financial data in Spain for the past decade (2001-2010). Our estimations by difference-in-difference analysis and using spatial data yield a general conclusion: when HSR comes to town, both local revenues and the local fiscal gap improve by mean 10% and 16%, respectively. These improvements primarily affect municipalities located within 5 km of an HSR station. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This is obviously true if the argument involves a comparison between different market forms given the level of demand. Across different routes, however, the number of carriers depends also on the level of demand for each particular pair of destinations, so that we cannot assume a priori that fares per kilometre on monopolistic routes are higher than on more competitive ones. We study the price policy during 2008 of the two main European low cost carriers, Ryanair and easylet, with reference to one hundred of the least, and one hundred of the most, dense routes among those operated by the two carriers respectively. The systematic occurrence of higher (for Ryanair), or at least no lower (for easyJet), average prices on competitive routes if compared with prices on routes with a single carrier by the same airline, surprising as it may be, supports the conclusion that a low level of demand is sufficient to impose low fares to some extent irrespective of the degree of competition.

We provide a model-free option pricing approach with neural networks, which can be applied to real-time pricing and hedging of FX options. In contrast to well-known theoretical models, an essential advantage of our approach is the simultaneous pricing across different strike prices and parsimonious use of real-time input variables. To test its ability for the purpose of high-frequency trading, we perform an empirical run-time trading simulation with a tick dataset of EUR/USD options on currency futures of 4 weeks. In very short non-overlapping 15-minute out-of-sample intervals, theoretical option prices derived from the Black model compete against nonparametric option prices through two different neural network topologies. We show that the approximated pricing function of learning networks is suitable for generating fast run-time option pricing evaluation as their performance is slightly better in comparison to theoretical prices. The derivation of the network function is also useful for performing hedging strategies. We conclude that the performance of closed-form pricing models depends highly on the volatility estimator, whereas neural networks can avoid this estimation problem but require market liquidity for training. Nevertheless, we also have to take particular enhancements into account, which give us useful hints for further research and steps.

We assume that firms must predict demand before production. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of several exogenous shocks on the model economy in our settings. A numerical simulation using our model shows the following results. When shocks that raise expected demand are given, inventory stocks increase because output exceeds demand. In the next period, firms release the inventory stock, reducing excess stock and decreasing output. Thus, inventory adjustment causes recession. This result implies that cyclical movement (economic boom and bust) continues until variables return to the steady state. Furthermore, we confirm that our model can reproduce stylized facts for inventory movements and enhance empirical fit relative to the model without inventory.","Yamagata Univ, Fac Literature & Social Sci, Yamagata 9908560, Japan",Yamagata University,"Tamegawa, K (通讯作者)，Yamagata Univ, Fac Literature & Social Sci, 1-4-12 Kojirakawa Machi, Yamagata 9908560, Japan.",tamegawa@human.kj.yamagata-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330090] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,27,1,1,1,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

With the firm as the primary unit of analysis, research long held out two promises: first, bridging the 'micro-macro gap' in development theory, meaning making valid inferences from micro-level actors (firms) to macro-sociological outcomes; and second, reconciling its firm-level organizational approach with institutionalism. This paper argues, first, that the literature is artificially constrained in bridging the micro-macro gap due to its delimited conceptualization of 'power', based on the 'agentic-strategic' behaviour of firms. It argues for broadening the notion of power to bridge the levels of analysis, based on the concept of 'emergence'. Second, while institutional critics are correct in criticizing value chain scholarship for its neglect, this paper finds that the effects of institutions are not as consistent or determinative as suggested, and hence it seeks to expand the scope for incorporating institutionalism. These points are illustrated through an intra-industry comparative study of three textile agro-industries in China.","[Dallas, Mark P.] Harvard Univ, Fairbank Ctr Chinese Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dallas, Mark P.] Union Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",Harvard University; Union College,"Dallas, MP (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Fairbank Ctr Chinese Studies, CGIS South Bldg,1730 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dallasm@union.edu,,"Dallas, Mark/0000-0002-9133-6540",,,,,109,15,15,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Illuminating the tensions arising from two interrelated reforms, namely the ambitious attempt to construct 40 million m(2) of public rental housing between 2010 and 2012, and the large-scale drive to ensure peasant migrants enjoy equal access to social benefits as current urban residents, the paper explains how the quest for equitable urbanization magnifies two nationwide dimensions of institutionalized uneven development, namely (i) the caste-like categorization of populations according to 'urban' and 'rural'; and (ii) the coastal bias in national economic development. The paper concludes that this state-driven pursuit of spatial egalitarianism in Chongqing expresses the dialecticism of economic development in China: it is a social 'counter-movement' against the effects of an uneven spatiality that was instituted to drive and deepen the marketization of Chinese society.","[Lim, Kean Fan] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Lim, KF (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",Kean.Lim@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Lim, Kean Fan/0000-0002-7979-2068",,,,,55,13,14,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

However, a Common Corporate Tax Base (CCTB), leaving consolidation and apportionment out of consideration, appears to be a more realistic proposition for corporate tax harmonization in Europe. Using the European Tax Analyzer (ETA), we simulate the impact of the CCTB on the effective tax burden in Belgium. The results show that the adoption of the CCTB increases the Belgian effective tax burden by 16%. This remarkable increase is mainly driven by the fact that national tax deductions are not allowed under CCTB. This study allows policymakers to gain insight into the size effects of certain corporate tax measures and contributes to the current discussion on corporate tax harmonization in Europe.","[Roggeman, Annelies; Verleyen, Isabelle; Coppens, Carine] Univ Coll Ghent, Fac Business & Informat Management, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van Cauwenberge, Philippe] Univ Ghent, Dept Accountancy & Corp Finance, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",HOGENT University College of Applied Sciences & Arts; Ghent University,"Verleyen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Ghent, Fac Business & Informat Management, Valentin Vaerwyckweg 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Annelies.Roggeman@hogent.be; Isabelle.Verleyen@hogent.be; Philippe.Vancauwenberge@ugent.be; Carine.Coppens@hogent.be,"Van Cauwenberge, Philippe/B-2566-2013","Verleyen, Isabelle/0000-0003-3065-5158; Roggeman, Annelies/0000-0002-7717-2447",,,,,20,6,7,3,59,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

However, there are a number of criteria influencing the possible strategies, and they often are interdependent. Therefore, a multi-criteria decision making model based on Analytic Network Process and Additive Ratio Assessment methods has been developed to systematically clarify the interdependent relationships among the evaluation criteria of brand extension and then, scientifically evaluate the feasible strategies and rank the priorities of brand extension strategies.

We also have detailed data on the evolution of expert assessments of case strength and the timing of external experts' reports that are designed to share information and that, therefore, might be expected to influence litigation outcomes. We find that litigation encourages dropping and settling of cases over time in a systematic way relating to their assessed strength; cases that involve relatively little uncertainty are resolved faster than those where liability is more unclear. We suggest that this evidence is consistent with the litigation process using time to help sort, and deal with, cases according to their strength.

It considers the case where there are N variables which might potentially enter a VAR and the researcher is interested in forecasting N* of them. Thus, the researcher is faced with 2(N-N*) potential VARs. If N is large, conventional Bayesian methods can be infeasible due to the computational burden of dealing with a huge model space. Allowing for the dimension of the VAR to change over time only increases this burden. In light of these considerations, this paper uses computationally practical approximations adapted from the dynamic model averaging literature in order to develop methods for dynamic dimension selection (DDS) in VARs. We then show the benefits of DDS in a macroeconomic forecasting application. In particular, DDS switches between different parsimonious VARs and forecasts appreciably better than various small and large dimensional VARs. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters.

Guided by the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and the Motivation-Ability-Opportunity framework, the current study examines the roles of the consumer's optimism bias and subjective health literacy in responding to the risk disclosure in DTCA. By analyzing survey data (N = 404), the study reveals that: (1) consumers who show a tendency to believe that they are at less risk of experiencing adverse reactions to prescription drugs than their peers are less likely to pay attention to the risk disclosure or intend to seek further information about the health risks of drugs, (2) the relationship between optimism bias and information-seeking intentions is stronger for consumers with high subjective health literacy than for those with low health literacy.

Using data from the European Commission's Broadband access in the EU reports covering 15 European member states for 17 semesters, we test the ladder-of-investment hypothesis. We find no empirical support for this hypothesis, that is, for the transition from local loop unbundling to new access infrastructures, and weak empirical support for the transition from bitstream access lines to local loop unbundling. These results are robust when we take into account the migration effect, the number of access rungs, the development of broadband cable, the regulatory performance, and the evolution of local loop unbundling prices.","[Bacache, Maya; Bourreau, Marc; Gaudin, Germain] Telecom ParisTech, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Paris, France; [Bourreau, Marc] CREST LEI, Paris, France",IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Bourreau, M (通讯作者)，Telecom ParisTech, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Paris, France.",maya.bacache@telecom-paristech.fr; marc.bourreau@telecom-paristech.fr; germain.gaudin@telecom-paristech.fr,,"Bourreau, Marc/0000-0003-3913-3014; Gaudin, Germain/0000-0003-3515-2306",,,,,38,44,45,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The paper investigates the role of minority status as a barrier to child participation in a range of activities. Minority status in this paper is characterised as being non-Irish born, non-Roman Catholic, or having a family member in receipt of some form of social welfare. Theassociation between such characteristics and child participation in sporting, cultural and community activities is examined using multivariate analyses. The results highlight that these factors are associated with lower participation in structured activities though the impact varies according to activity and minority grouping.

While it is widely agreed that justice requires us to go beyond loyalty to our simplest identity - being just oneself - there is less common ground on how far we must go beyond self-centredness. How relevant are group identities to the requirements of justice, or must we transcend those too? The author draws attention to the trap of confinement to nationality and citizenship in determining the requirements of justice, particularly under the social-contract approach, and also to the danger of exclusive concentration on some other identity such as religion and race. He concludes that it is critically important to pay attention to every human being's multiple identities related to the different groups to which a person belongs; the priorities have to be chosen by reason, rather than any single identity being imposed on a person on grounds of some extrinsic precedence. Justice is closely linked with the pursuit of impartiality, but that pursuit has to be open rather than closed, resisting closure through nationality or ethnicity or any other allegedly all-conquering single identity.

The analysis combines data on federal regulatory inspections, enforcement actions, and penalties with data on injuries, fatalities, property damage, and barrels of product lost through pipeline incidents for 2006-2011 for the 344 largest pipeline operators in the U.S. The results of the analysis do not provide compelling evidence that either federal inspections or civil penalties are particularly effective in increasing performance; however, the number of federal cases initiated against an operator does have a significant effect on many forms of performance, although not for incidents in general. The results also suggest that some targeting of federal enforcement resources is based on past performance, but there may be room for even more effective targeting. Finally, the analysis reveals interesting patterns between state and federal enforcement efforts. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Efficient and politically feasible policy alternatives could therefore make a very valuable contribution to solving transport challenges. Mobility management might be one such policy. We argue that a major weakness of earlier studies is that they only test bundles of different policy elements, and do not attempt to analyse how the elements work in isolation or how they interact to produce the large effects reported. Furthermore, there is often a lack of an appropriate control group against which to compare the treatment effects. We conduct a natural field experiment to test the effectiveness of tailored information, both in isolation, and in combination with free public transit passes, in encouraging commuters to shift from private cars to public transport. In our controlled experiment we find no significant treatment effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This analysis generates three distinct results. First, the productivity premium associated with persistent R&D is close to 8 per cent in nonmetro locations and about 14 per cent in the largest city. Second, a firm without any R&D engagement does not benefit at all from the external milieu in metro areas.

Evidence on the results achieved by reforms of the health insurance sector in terms of reducing out-of-pocket medical expenditure is still uncertain and contradictory, and very little is known about the effect of these measures on the consumption and saving behaviour of the Chinese population. To shed light on this issue we use data collected by Chinese Household Income Project surveys (CHIPs), through a series of questionnaire-based interviews conducted in urban areas in 1995 and 2002. Our descriptive analysis suggests that there is a positive relationship between public health insurance coverage and household saving. This empirical evidence suggests that public insurance coverage is ineffective as a source of protection against income losses and might induce households to save more.","[Atella, Vincenzo] Farmafactoring Fdn, Washington, DC 20001 USA; [Atella, Vincenzo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Econ, Rome, Italy; [Atella, Vincenzo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Macroecon, Rome, Italy; [Atella, Vincenzo] Ctr Hlth Policy, Stanford, CA USA; [Brugiavini, Agar] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Econ, Venice, Italy; [Brugiavini, Agar] Ca Foscari Int Coll, Venice, Italy; [Brugiavini, Agar] VIU, Venice, Italy; [Brugiavini, Agar] IFS, London, England; [Pace, Noemi] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Ctr Econ & Int Studies, Rome, Italy; [Pace, Noemi] UCL, Ctr Int Hlth & Dev, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Pace, Noemi] LUISS Guido Carli Univ, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Rome Tor Vergata; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of London; University College London; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Atella, V (通讯作者)，Farmafactoring Fdn, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",,"; Brugiavini, Agar/B-4988-2011","Pace, Noemi/0000-0001-6413-4890; Atella, Vincenzo/0000-0003-3566-837X; Brugiavini, Agar/0000-0002-5871-2575",,,,,17,2,3,0,3,CHANDOS PUBL,SAWSTON,"80 HIGH ST, SAWSTON, CAMBRIDGE CB22 3HJ, ENGLAND",2052-2126,,978-1-78063-449-4; 978-1-84334-768-2,CHANDOS ASIAN STUD,,,2014,,,,,,,189,204,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6UP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354492600010,0

Decisions concerning starting a company are of particular importance in this context. Business entities, due to their nature, are risky. Therefore, making a decision on creating them is inherently risky. One of the factors influencing the perception of this risk is the decision-maker's attitude to this process. The concept of this paper created against this background. The main goal of the paper, which has been set, is the analysis of the decision concerning starting up business within the context of attitude towards risk. A following hypothesis was formulated: people of high risk acceptance level perceive starting business as moderately risky. The verification of the hypothesis required accepting research methodology consisting of two tools. Firstly, the very willingness to start a business assessed using the analysis of the survey results. The second part: attitude towards risk was studied by means of an economic experiment. A group of 275 students was involved in the survey and experimental study. As a result of the methodology devised in such a way ate research hypothesis has been verified. However, the conclusions from the studies are of informative character, due to the unrepresentative size of the respondent group. The biggest part of the studied respondents, having high tendency for risk, determined by the economic experiment, perceives starting a business as a decision of low degree of risk. Simultaneously, interesting conclusions may be reached, comparing two analyzed subgroups of students: studying economics and students of non-economic studies.","[Bernat, Tomasz; Korpysa, Jaroslaw; Lakomy-Zinowik, Marta; Nagaj, Rafal; Szkudlarek, Piotr] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Microecon, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland; [Gasior, Aleksandra] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Business Anal & Strategy, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin; University of Szczecin,"Bernat, T (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Microecon, Ul Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",kontakt@tomaszbernat.pl; olag@wneiz.pl; jarek@korpysa.pl; marta_lakomy@wp.pl; wasik@wneiz.pl; tatus@wneiz.pl,"Bernat, Tomasz/J-4433-2019; Gąsior, Aleksandra/HTQ-3948-2023; Nagaj, Rafał/ABF-2791-2020; Korpysa, Jaroslaw/AAL-8369-2020","Bernat, Tomasz/0000-0003-0010-9578; Gąsior, Aleksandra/0000-0003-3959-6094; Nagaj, Rafał/0000-0002-9410-7663; Korpysa, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-2400-3308; Szkudlarek, Piotr/0000-0003-0263-7980",,,,,26,6,7,1,26,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

It was revealed through survey data and the analysis that in general, the consumer awareness in Pune city is very good, but at the superficial level; however, when it comes to the disposal practices the residents are not aware of the collection centres, the E-waste rules, and correct disposal practices. Residents therefore mix-up the E-waste generated along with municipal solid waste thereby leading to unsustainable way of disposal practices. Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has played a key role by formulating the E-waste policy and it is the high time for consumers to shoulder the responsibility in management of E-waste.

Based on geographical location and lifestyle, an individual's contribution to the global carbon footprint has been estimated in this study. Data on consumption of goods and services resulting in GHG emissions was gathered at the household level through a door to door survey from few localities in Mumbai and rural areas within 100km of boundary. Equivalent carbon emission factors were used to estimate the carbon footprint from major sources like electricity, transport, cooking fuel and food for these areas. The average annual per capita carbon footprint was estimated to be 2.5 tons CO(2)e in the urban area and 0.85 tons CO(2)e in the rural area. For each of the areas (rural and urban), substantial variation in carbon footprint has also been observed across different socio-economic classes. Limitations: Indirect emissions, emissions related to work and public place were excluded. This study looked at the sectoral contribution (activity-wise, e.g. cooking, transportation etc.) as well as the rural-urban disparity in the individual carbon footprint; which was done for the first time in India.

Additionally, the survey looked at methods used for plagiarism prevention by editors and reviewers as well as ways, in which editors managed issues related to plagiarism. The survey suggests that no unanimous decision exists regarding the originality of a manuscript and that editors expect reviewers to identify plagiarism with little use of technologies. While answering to survey questions, respondents provided numerous comments. This demonstrates that plagiarism is a burning issue and scientific misconduct policy is needed in Lithuania. The survey was conducted during the period when the Lithuanian Research Council initiated the procedure for establishing the Ombudsman position. The Lithuanian Research Council funded several projects in 2012 and 2013, the aim of which was to familiarise the Lithuanian academic community with plagiarism prevention technologies and ethical aspects in academic publishing.

On the one hand, it seems perfectly reasonable to give special weight to an agreement reached by those who have studied a topic in great detail. On the other hand, does the very same specialization that confers expert status also mean that the group is unable to consider all alternatives equally? In other words, do the shared analytic models and other practices that expert groups rely on provide an enhanced understanding or mean that they focus only on those aspects of the problem that fit neatly into their pre-conceived way of thinking? The problem for policy-makers and those who would rely on experts is thus to identify which experts they need to consult. If the boundary is drawn too tightly, reaching consensus may be easy but its practical applicability may be highly restricted. If the boundary is too porous, then consensus may never be reached and the epistemic quality of deliberations may suffer as a result of irrelevant or unfounded concerns. If we accept that non-coercive decision-making is appropriate, then the problems of expert consensus are twofold: first, the members of the expert group must be identified and, second, the relationship between these experts and the wider society must be clarified.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Study Knowledge Expertise & Sci, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Evans, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Study Knowledge Expertise & Sci, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales.",evansrj1@cardiff.ac.uk,"Evans, Robert/AAJ-8906-2021","Evans, Robert/0000-0002-7034-5122",,,,,32,5,5,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-08551-7; 978-3-319-08550-0,ETHICAL ECON,,,2014,50.0,,,,,,233,252,,10.1007/978-3-319-08551-7_12,0.0,,,20,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358528600012,0

To this end, we analyze firm survival by distinguishing Italian firms as foreign multinationals (FMNEs) domestic multinationals (DMNEs) or domestic non-multinational firms (NMNEs). The empirical analysis is based on the Kaplan-Meier survival estimator and on the Cox proportional hazard model, in which we look for the impact of ownership dummies on firm survival, controlling for several firm and industry specific covariates. Our findings reveal that manufacturing and service firms owned by foreign multinationals are more likely to exit the market than either DMNEs or NMNEs. Moreover, DMNEs show a higher chance of survival in services. By decomposing firm activities into different technological classes, we also find that foreign ownership still exerts a negative influence on firm survival in both static and dynamic industries, while domestic multinationals in less-knowledge-intensive services appear more persistent.","[Ferragina, Anna Maria] Univ Salerno, I-84084 Salerno, Italy; [Pittiglio, Rosanna] Univ Naples 2, I-81043 Capua, Caserta, Italy; [Reganati, Filippo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Salerno; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; Sapienza University Rome,"Pittiglio, R (通讯作者)，Univ Naples 2, Corso Gran Priorato Malta, I-81043 Capua, Caserta, Italy.",aferragina@unisa.it; rosanna.pittiglio@unina2.it; filippo.reganati@uniroma1.it,"Reganati, Filippo/F-4225-2011","PITTIGLIO, Rosanna/0000-0002-1717-2453; REGANATI, Filippo/0000-0002-5028-0421",,,,,36,9,11,2,36,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The research paper offers a perspective for the quantification of credit risk over the Romanian banking system illustrated by the VAR model analysis and review. By analyzing the results of the VAR model it was observed that the most powerful influence is made by the exchange, interest and unemployment rates. The GDP influence as demonstrated by the model is influencing the credit risk rate less than the other variables. The statistical test and outputs from Eviews software demonstrates the influence of the variables mentioned. The model presented has the scope to define the interactions between the quality of the credit portfolios and the macroeconomic environment from Romania. Having in view the complexity of the data aggregation and their availability, it were used 155 quarterly observations, the sample period being January 2001 - September 2013. Empirical analysis revealed an important influence of the macro-economic variables over the credit risk rate. The most significant influence is made by the exchange rate which confirms the deterioration of the credit portfolios under the big volumes of loans granted in foreign currencies.","Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Florin, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Andrei, Florin/JLM-1114-2023",,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,496,502,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100068,0

According to an econometric model, the most important variables that can affect the inflation rate is the average monthly gross salary, level of production capacity and national currency exchange rate, expressed in the largest export partner country's currency. The research results show that there is high probability that convergence criteria for inflation will be fulfilled, but there is a risk that inflation may be uncontrolled. Assuming that in period of January and June, 2014 the average gross wage and labour levels of production capability will grow at the same pace as in period of January and June, 2013 since January- April, 2014 the inflation level would increase to 1.8 percent. To high growth of inflation is possible in this case, if during 3 months the average gross wage and level of production capabilities increase by 3 percent each, respectively, the average gross wage from 2305.3 LTL up to 2386 LTL, the level of production capabilities from 73,5 up to 76.-7 percent. In this case, Lithuania would not comply with the convergence criteria. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The theoretical foundation of the current paper was the theory of planned behavior, TPB (Ajzen, 1991, 2005). The aim of the study was to identify the content of university entrepreneurship education and its impact for students' entrepreneurial intentions. The study design used was cross-sectional study and the sample consisted of the students from 17 European countries that have been grouped for the purpose of analysis by the level of economic development into two country groups: efficiency-driven and innovation-driven economies (Porter et al., 2002). Frequencies and binary logistic regression was used to analyze the impact of different factors, including participation in entrepreneurship education, for entrepreneurial intentions. Results indicate that what is offered is not necessarily the most demanded in entrepreneurship education as lectures and seminars are provided more, but networking and coaching activities are expected more by the students. Participation in entrepreneurship education was found to exert positive impact on entrepreneurial intentions. (c) 2014 The Authors.

The programs are the most significant of China's forest policies namely the Sloping Land Conversion Program (the SLCP), the Natural Forest Protection Program (the NFPP), and the Desertification Combating Program around Beijing and Tianjin (the DCBT). A fixed effect model with clustered standard errors is used to identify programs' impacts based on variation in participation across households and time. In addition to estimating the total impacts of these programs, individually and in combination, we disaggregate the effects by income source, stage of policy implementation, and duration of participation. Overall, the impacts of the KPFPs on rural households' income vary with time of enrollment and policy stage. We observe that the KPFPs in their initial stages of implementation, and for the early years of household participation, had negative, or at best neutral impacts on household incomes, in particular incomes from land. However, the later stages of the SLCP and the DCBT have tended to raise land-based incomes, and the NFPP has ceased to have a negative effect. This is likely to be in part the result of adjustments made by rural households over time in response to changes in the programs, as well as in market and environmental conditions.

Despite the mushroom enterprise gaining popularity in a number of sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, where production is dominated by rural-based small-scale farmers, no research has been done to study the nature and complexity of transaction costs encountered by these producers in attempting to participate in mainstream supply chains. This study uses cross-section data obtained in 2011/2012 from mushroom producers in Swaziland to study the effects of transaction costs on producers' choice of marketing channels and the quantity of mushrooms supplied. Having used Cragg's model for analysis, the results indicate that producers' decisions of where to sell their mushrooms are significantly affected by household labour endowment, production capacity, access to cooling facilities and market information, and producers' bargaining position. Meanwhile, the quantities of mushrooms sold are significantly influenced by the difficulty in accessing reliable transport and producers' level of uncertainty in meeting buyers' quality requirements. The study concludes by highlighting potential interventions that could minimise marketing and transaction costs and further improve the general agricultural marketing environment in Swaziland.","[Mabuza, Majola L.; Ortmann, Gerald; Wale, Edilegnaw] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mabuza, ML (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Durban, South Africa.",,"Wale, Edilegnaw/N-5292-2013; Zegeye, Edilegnaw Wale/JXY-0016-2024","Wale, Edilegnaw/0000-0003-4705-7971;",,,,,37,7,10,0,21,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The second issue I pursue in this chapter is how we should seek consensus in science. I will defend the second main thesis of this chapter: consensus should not be sought in the science, but rather among the scientists. In other words, subjective expertise is not a dispensable source of evidence in the social sciences, and one of the goals of methodologists should be to find the right place for expertise in the pursuit of scientific inquiry. The point of the second thesis is that there is no real contraposition between the value of subjective expertise, and the value of other (objective) methods, but both can and should contribute to the formation of scientific consensus.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Martini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Unioninkatu 40A,Off A509, Helsinki, Finland.",carlo.martini@helsinki.fi,,"Martini, Carlo/0000-0001-9061-8020",,,,,44,2,2,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-08551-7; 978-3-319-08550-0,ETHICAL ECON,,,2014,50.0,,,,,,115,130,,10.1007/978-3-319-08551-7_6,0.0,,,16,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358528600006,0

Furthermore, tourist destination image is defined as the sum of beliefs, ideas and impressions a tourist has on a certain destination. For these reasons, sport tourists cannot take future decisions in sport events without a prior evaluation of how the emotions, involvement and image of tourist destinations will influence their decision. The paper emphasizes the impact of globalization which itself progressively diminishes and resolves the potential and real borders and barriers, makes influence on understanding of destination and involvement. The concept of destination involvement describes different attitudes a tourist can have towards a destination: from a limited involvement qualified as awareness, to deeper types of involvement, indicated as attraction, attachment and, finally, allegiance explaining about the relation between sport events and destination image and taking into account various stages of understanding the tourist involvement process. The theoretical analysis suggests that a branding extension approach could be a feasible strategy to strengthen the image of sport events. Other two approaches, i.e. co branding and brand feature approach have been proposed in literature on the basis of the distinctiveness of sporting event brand and destination brand.","[Mikalauskas, Rimantas] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Strunz, Herbert] West Saxon Univ Appl Sci, D-08056 Zwikau, Germany; [Afifi, Galal Mohamed Hamza] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Arts & Social Studies, Tourism Dept, Omansultanate Of Oman, Arab State, Oman",Lithuanian Sports University,"Mikalauskas, R (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, Perkuno Ave 3a, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rimantas.mikalauskas@lsu.lt; Herbert.Strunz@fh-zwikau.de; galal_afifi@yahoo.com,"Afifi, Galal/K-7107-2019","Afifi, Galal/0000-0003-3830-6630",,,,,64,2,2,0,24,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

This paper showed Lithuanian banking sector asset and liability management activity and make assumptions of how sustainable the sector are during the different business cycle stages and how banks can manage their risks according to business cycles. The analysis revealed that banks tend to take more risk over time. The cycles of bank assets and liability are not identical to the cycles of business activity level, therefore it is seen that banks manage their assets and liability and attempt to influence their activity and profitability. The results indicate why the banks tend to enhance their risk levels before and during the financial crisis. (c) 2014 The Authors.

This paper tests the hypothesis of a lack of effectiveness of the existing fiscal equalization model compared to a model that would be based on alleviating the difference in the potential to collect revenue from the personal income tax and surtax. Fiscal inequalities of local government units are determined first under the current equalization system by calculating the Gini coefficients and graphically presented with Lorenz curves. Thereafter, a distribution of equalization grants is simulated based on the new (proposed) model. The effectiveness of the proposed model in alleviating the fiscal inequalities is determined in relation to the effectiveness of the current equalization system. It was found that the model based on equalizing the difference in the capacity to collect revenue from the personal income tax and surtax alleviates inequalities in fiscal capacities of local government units much better than the existing system at the same cost. The main conclusion is that the fiscal equalization in Croatia should urgently be redesigned in order to improve efficiency and fairness, but also the transparency and credibility of the equalization system.","Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Primorac, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedya 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",mprimorac@efzg.hr,"Primorac, Marko/E-5517-2017","Primorac, Marko/0000-0003-1629-3170",,,,,29,7,7,0,6,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

On the other hand, the same characteristic creates the possibility to achieve significant benefits as also the natural degree of inefficiency in the area of public administration is order of magnitude higher than it is in regular market-oriented firms. The article introduces the long-term program consisting of a series of real analytical projects in this area. Basic principles of the approach as well as starting points of the methodology are explained. Four original principles are discussed in detail: Three source areas of the community management, Life events as essential triggers of key processes, Hierarchy of human needs as a general source of life events, and Life cycles of key objects as their general context. Main relevant outputs of the program are presented in the form of examples of key processes from each of three basic areas of the community management: physical, social, and economic environment. Each key process is discussed in terms of its main value as well as the substantial change which it brings in comparison with the current state.

We show significant friendship segregation, particularly for blacks. Indeed, blacks'' friendships are no more diverse in college than in high school, despite the fact that the colleges that blacks attend have substantially smaller black populations. We demonstrate that the segregation patterns occur in part because affirmative action results in large differences in the academic backgrounds of students of different races, with students preferring to form friendships with those of similar academic backgrounds. Within a school, stronger academic backgrounds make whites'' friendships with blacks less likely and friendships with Asians more likely. These results suggest that affirmative action admission policies at selective universities, which drive a wedge between the academic characteristics of different racial groups, may result in increased within-school segregation.","[Arcidiacono, Peter; Spenner, Kenneth] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Aucejo, Esteban] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Hussey, Andrew] Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",Duke University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Memphis,"Arcidiacono, P (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,18,13,15,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Quantitative studies have not yet explained these phenomena. Given that population growth in the US is largely dependent on immigration, understanding auto ownership and use among immigrants is important for transportation sustainability. We conducted six focus groups with US residents born in India, the Philippines, and Latin America. Our findings confirm, complicate and contradict the existing literature explaining differences in auto use among immigrants and the US-born, and we identify some new hypotheses with implications for policy-relevant research. More difficult driving conditions in the US and remittances back home may contribute to the initially lower auto ownership and use among immigrants. The rapid transition to auto use may be a function of household changes having more dramatic effects among immigrants given their initially high-density residential locations. The growth of non-English speaking transit riders, an increase in private transit services, and different residential location priorities may all contribute to the persistently lower auto use by immigrants even after many years in the US.

We find evidence of agglomeration economies in both sectors, where higher female ownership among incumbent businesses within a district-industry predicts that a greater share of subsequent entrepreneurs will be female. Moreover, higher female ownership of local businesses in related industries (e.g. those sharing similar labor needs and industries related via input-output markets) predict greater relative female entry rates even after controlling for the focal district-industry's conditions. The core patterns hold when using local industrial conditions in 1994 to instrument for incumbent conditions in 2000 and 2005.

Informal networking is not primarily based on sociality ties and mutual exchange, as is often assumed; instead, publishers use informal contacts to keep an eye on each other, they share communalities with authors in more private settings and they exchange specific content in more formal ways. Personal ties involve different loyalties and motives which elevate or increase tensions between career and conglomerate and between culture and commerce. We critically employ Grabher's typology to get more understanding of how cultural mediators deal with these tensions and the integration of culture and commerce and the creation of value. By moving beyond dichotomies of emotion-business and culture-commerce, we aim to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of both networks and place in cultural industries.","[Heebels, Barbara] Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Urban Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Atzema, Oedzge; Van Aalst, Irina] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Utrecht University,"Heebels, B (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",b.heebels@uva.nl,,,,,,,58,3,3,1,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The concept accounts for the fact that modern ports operate in an increasingly complex and sophisticated transport and logistics environment, embedded within multi-scalar planning regimes. This paper addresses the role of intermodal transport in port regionalisation by reviewing the literature on the three core aspects of the concept: intermodal terminals, inland logistics and collective action problems. Results reveal that inland terminals developed by landside actors often experience a conflict of strategy with port actors (either port authorities or terminal operators). Port actors have difficulty acting beyond the port perimeter but some port terminal operators have begun to demonstrate successful investments in inland terminals in order to manage their container throughput more strategically. Inland logistics markets tend to be centralised and focus heavily on domestic flows, thus the efficiency of intermodal freight services is challenged by the need to combine port and domestic movements which have different product, route and equipment characteristics. Collective action is an arena where port actors can be influential due to the role of informal networking in managing freight corridors; however, institutional constraints limit their ability to act directly. The findings in this paper elucidate challenges to the ability of ports to control or capture hinterlands through the strategies of integration that the port regionalisation concept proposes. The paper concludes by proposing a research agenda developing from recent institutional adaptations of port actors as a result of these challenges. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We utilize the recent rounds of the Demographic and Health Surveys for 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. First, we find that an additional year of maternal education leads to a 0.37-year increase in children's years of schooling in the developing economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Second, our results show that mother's HIV status has substantial detrimental effects on inheritability of human capital. We find that the association between infected mothers' and their children's human capital is 30 % less than the general population. Finally, focusing only on noninfected mothers and their children, we show that HIV prevalence in the community also impairs the intergenerational human capital transfers even if mother is HIV negative. The findings of this paper are particularly distressing for these already poor, HIV-torn countries as in the future they will have even lower overall level of human capital due to the epidemic.","[Akbulut-Yuksel, Mevlude] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; [Turan, Belgi] Atilim Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Dalhousie University; Atilim University,"Akbulut-Yuksel, M (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada.",mevlude@dal.ca; belgituran@gmail.com,"Turan, Belgi/AAA-8193-2019","Turan, Belgi/0000-0002-5614-8587",,,,,31,16,16,0,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Under weak-form (forecast) efficiency, the correlation between the current and one-period lagged revisions should be zero. The empirical findings in the literature suggest that this null hypothesis of zero correlation is rejected frequently, and the correlation can be either positive (which is widely interpreted in the literature as smoothing) or negative (which is widely interpreted as over-reacting). We propose a methodology for interpreting such non-zero correlations in a straightforward and clear manner. Our approach is based on the assumption that numerical forecasts can be decomposed into both an econometric model and random expert intuition. We show that the interpretation of the sign of the correlation between the current and one-period lagged revisions depends on the process governing intuition, and the current and lagged correlations between intuition and news (or shocks to the numerical forecasts). It follows that the estimated non-zero correlation cannot be given a direct interpretation in terms of either smoothing or over-reaction. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters.

These advances were largely driven by extrinsic improvements of their environment (for example, the available diet, disease prevalence, vaccination, and the state of hygiene and sanitation). In this paper, we ask whether future improvements of life expectancy will be bounded from above by human life span. Life span, in contrast to life expectancy, is conceptualized as a biological measure of longevity driven by the intrinsic rate of bodily deterioration. In order to pursue our question, we first present a modern theory of aging developed by bio-gerontologists and show that immutable life span would put an upper limit on life expectancy. We then show for a sample of developed countries that human life span thus defined was indeed constant until the mid-twentieth century but increased since then in sync with life expectancy. In other words, we find evidence for manufactured life span.","[Strulik, Holger; Vollmer, Sebastian] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Vollmer, Sebastian] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of Gottingen; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Yet this trend will not continue forever. Despite technological innovation, finite fossil fuel reserves will in the long run lead to increasing costs of transport. Moreover, to fight global warming many governments have set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, and to achieve them fossil fuels must become more expensive either through market developments or by political intervention. This paper gives an overview about the drivers, feedbacks and constraints of urban mobility and location in a possible future in which transport energy will no longer be abundant and cheap. It asks whether current urban models are able to adequately model the impacts of significantly higher transport costs and demonstrates by an example how it can be done. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate the unpredictability of patent damages by conducting a large-scale econometric analysis of award values. We begin by analyzing the outcomes of 340 cases decided in US federal courts between 1995 and 2008 in which infringement was found and damages were awarded. Our data include the amount awarded, along with information about the litigants, case specifics and economic value of the patents-at-issue. Using these data, we construct an econometric model that explains over 75% of the variation in awards. We further conduct in-depth analysis of the key factors affecting award value, via targeted regressions involving selected variables. We find a high degree of significance between award value and ex ante-identifiable factors collectively, and we also identify significant relationships with accepted indicators of patent value. Our findings demonstrate that infringement awards are not systematically unpredictable and, moreover, highlight the critical elements that can be expected to result in larger or smaller awards.

Past bad actions trigger negative feelings that make people more likely to engage in future moral behaviour to offset them. Symmetrically, past good deeds favour a positive self-perception that creates licensing effects, leading people to engage in behaviour that is less likely to be moral. In short, a deviation from a 'normal state of being' is balanced with a subsequent action that compensates the prior behaviour. We model the decision of an individual trying to reach the optimal level of moral self-worth over time and show that under certain conditions the optimal sequence of actions follows a regular pattern which combines good and bad actions. To explore this phenomenon we conduct an economic experiment where subjects play a sequence of giving decisions (dictator games). We find that donations in the previous period affect present decisions and the sign is negative: participants' behaviour in every round is negatively correlated to what they did in the past. Hence donations over time seem to be the result of a regular pattern of self-regulation: moral licensing (being selfish after altruistic) and cleansing (altruistic after selfish).","[Branas-Garza, Pablo] Middlesex Univ London, London, England; [Paz Espinosa, Maria] Univ Basque Country, BRiDGE, UPV EHU, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain; [Garcia-Munoz, Teresa] Univ Granada, GLOBE, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Middlesex University; University of Basque Country; University of Granada,"Brañas-Garza, P (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ London, London, England.",,"Bucheli, Marisa/I-5639-2019; Brañas-Garza, Pablo/Q-1532-2018; Espinosa, Maria Paz/AAW-3803-2020; García-Muñoz, Teresa/J-2748-2018; Branas-Garza, Pablo/AAH-8894-2020","Bucheli, Marisa/0000-0003-0159-4712; Brañas-Garza, Pablo/0000-0001-8456-6009; Espinosa, Maria Paz/0000-0003-2189-4253; Branas-Garza, Pablo/0000-0001-8456-6009",,,,,14,52,58,5,83,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Measuring the extent of the phenomenon requires identification of the academic inventors, a data-mining operation that imposes technical as well as procedural challenges for social scientists. The heterogeneity of ownership models poses the question of whether ownership is related to the patents' quality and/or successful commercialization. Further questions concern the identity and business models of firms holding academic patents in their portfolios, and the economic and legal factors that explain a university's or PRO's choice of whether to maintain the intellectual property of its staff's inventions.

The transition densities that define the evolution of the dynamic state process are represented in parametric form, but the conditional distribution of the non-Gaussian variable is estimated non-parametrically. The filtered and prediction distributions are estimated via a computationally efficient algorithm that exploits the functional relationship between the observed variable, the state variable and a measurement error with an invariant distribution. Simulation experiments are used to document the accuracy of the non-parametric method relative to both correctly and incorrectly specified parametric alternatives. In an empirical illustration, the method is used to produce sequential estimates of the forecast distribution of realized volatility on the S&P500 stock index during the recent financial crisis.

State mandated breaches of confidentiality required of psychologists when a patient makes a credible threat to the life of another have, many argue, compromised the entire administration of mental health services. In this context, there are two possible effects through which these laws could affect mental health services. The first is an effect that directly changes how mental health professionals and patients interact spawning from a credible threat of reporting. The second is an indirect effect that could arise in the general delivery of mental health services. Using teen suicides as a measure of the direct effect, and adult suicides as the indirect effect, I estimate the impact of these laws on mental health services and find that states with these laws experience an increase in teen suicides of about 9% but that no such effect exists among adult suicides.

The Korean Government has supported technology commercialization; however, previous studies have provided limited empirical evidence on the effect of government support. This study examines the various factors that influence the commercialization strategy and performance of firms. It also identifies the determinants of successful technology commercialization and effective government programmes for commercialization performance by analysing the performance of Korean Government-sponsored firms. The results show that the determinants influence commercialization by firms according to the firm size and the degree of Korean Government support. The appropriability, innovative capabilities and investment in external R&D have significantly positive impacts on SME commercialization. This study provides empirical evidence on the effects of government support and contributes to the formulation of commercialization strategies and improved SME commercialization policy for firms.","[Kang, Jimin] Gyeonggi Inst Sci & Technol Promot, Cooperat Support Team, Suwon 443270, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Gwon, Seong-hoon] Natl Assembly Res Serv, Educ & Sci Team, Seoul 150703, South Korea; [Kim, Seungdong] SK Res Inst, Elect Ind Res Off, Seoul Finance Ctr, Seoul 100768, South Korea; [Cho, Keuntae] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Syst Management Engn, Suwon 440746, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",SK Group; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, K (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Syst Management Engn, 300 Cheoncheon Dong, Suwon 440746, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",ktcho@skku.edu,,,,,,,33,27,28,6,80,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This implies that it is important to investigate not only the factors underlying trip decision making, but also the actual experience of the trip. To that end, this paper presents an empirical test of the satisfaction with travel scale (STS) that was developed to measure travellers' satisfaction with travel. STS measures travel satisfaction in terms of two affective (positive activation versus negative de-activation and positive de-activation versus negative activation) and one cognitive dimension. The STS was applied in the Netherlands in a survey of car users. The results suggest that the reliability of the measurement scales is satisfactory to good, and that they are indicative of an overarching concept of travel satisfaction. Regression analyses carried out with the three STS dimensions as dependent variables show that STS is influenced by experienced traffic safety, annoyance with other road users, the trip being tiring, being distracted by billboards, and lack of freedom to choose speed and lane. In addition, travel purpose and personal characteristics play a role. Overall, the findings provide support for the validity of the STS as a tool to measure satisfaction with travel. It is concluded that using tools such as STS may provide relevant insights into how qualitative and design-related factors influence the attractiveness of trips made by car or other travel modes.

Since the attractiveness of residential locations may be affected by amenities of other nearby locations as well, we extend the model to incorporate these effects, using spatial econometric techniques. Our model accounts for unobserved amenities, heterogeneity of preferences among households and spatial correlation between observed and unobserved amenities.

More recently, however, a number of studies have suggested that firm-specific attributes be taken as the key to innovation. This study examines the determinants of technological innovation in China's ICT firms based on a large-scale questionnaire survey. We reveal that firm-level attributes are of great importance to innovation whereas the influences of region/relation-specific factors are modified by the types of innovation and by firms' strategies and motivations. The role of regional and relational assets should not be over-emphasized at the expense of firm-level attributes. Research emphasis should be placed on the process of how firm attributes interacted with regional environment and inter-firm relations to shape innovation. The article concludes with a plea to bring 'the firm' back to the centre and adopt an interactionist approach to understanding technological innovation.","[Wang, Cassandra C.] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Lin, George C.

Based on a unique household survey collected in Mozambique in summer 2008, a few months after a series of xenophobic attacks in South Africa that killed dozens and displaced thousands of immigrants from neighboring countries, we estimate migration intentions of Mozambicans before and after the attacks, controlling for a placebo period. We focus on the role of family and social networks in the sending community in shaping changes in the expressed intentions to migrate. We find that the migration intention of household heads decreases after the violence, especially for those household heads with many children whose families have no access to social networks. The results illustrate that networks at origin insure risks related to migration and that, when deciding to migrate, workers tend to care more about the future of their offspring than their own health.","[Friebel, Guido] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Miguel Gallego, Juan] Univ Rosario, Dept Econ, Casa Buhatdilla Bogota, Colombia; [Mendola, Mariapia] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Friebel, Guido] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Friebel, Guido] CEPR, London, England; [Miguel Gallego, Juan; Mendola, Mariapia] LdA, Milan, Italy",Goethe University Frankfurt; Universidad del Rosario; University of Milano-Bicocca; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Mendola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, Pizza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",gfriebel@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de; juan.gallego@urosario.edu.co; mariapia.mendola@unimib.it,"Gallego, Juan M./F-9009-2016","Gallego, Juan M./0000-0002-8997-1107; mendola, mariapia/0000-0001-9852-968X",,,,,34,11,13,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The design is relevant in the light of member states' concern for protecting their tax revenues, as well as for the multinational companies' tax minimizing possibilities. Moreover, it plays an important role in achieving an efficient and simple tax system. Simulating different apportionment formulas, the results show that including more factors and using more equal weights distributes the common tax base more equally, which could reduce the incentive to shift factors from high to low tax countries. The results also indicate that simplifying the factor definitions, leads to rather minor changes in the allocation. Using unpublished data, this study allows to investigate the consequences of different formulas in detail, which contributes to the current discussion on corporate tax harmonization in the EU.","[Roggeman, Annelies; Verleyen, Isabelle; Coppens, Carine] Univ Coll Ghent, Fac Business & Informat Management, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van Cauwenberge, Philippe] Univ Ghent, Dept Accountancy & Corp Finance, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",HOGENT University College of Applied Sciences & Arts; Ghent University,"Verleyen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Ghent, Fac Business & Informat Management, Valentin Vaerwyckweg 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",annelies.roggeman@hogent.be; isabelle.verleyen@hogent.be; philippe.vancauwenberge@ugent.be; carine.coppens@hogent.be,"Van Cauwenberge, Philippe/B-2566-2013","Verleyen, Isabelle/0000-0003-3065-5158; Roggeman, Annelies/0000-0002-7717-2447",,,,,19,2,2,0,33,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Then, the outputs of the first-level classifiers are utilized to create the second-level single (meta) classifier. The experiments are based on five related datasets and the results show that the proposed meta-learning framework provides higher prediction accuracy rates and lower type I/II errors when compared with the stacked generalization classifier and other three widely developed baselines, such as neural networks, decision trees, and logistic regression.

While today this standard is a quasi mandatory precondition for entering the EU market, several studies came to conclude that its high requirements led to market exclusion of most Kenyan farmers. This paper analyses how far farmers have in fact been excluded or have found alternative ways to enter the chain. Based on our own surveys, we identify and analyse different informal possibilities that are frequently used to produce for EU markets without a GlobalGAP certificate.

Employing the stated-preference method, data were collected by personal interviews in Mashhad City CBD. The respondents were requested to report their current trip to the CBD by answering a set of questions and scenarios to consider five alternatives, including two parking locations in the CBD: park inside the cordon-pricing zone or outside and access the cordon area by walking or public transport, shift to public transport (taxi and bus), or cancelling of their trip to the CBD. The two parking locations were categorised by cordon and parking tariff schedule, search and queue time for a parking space, and access time from the parking space to the final destination. The preferences regarding mode of transportation and parking choices were determined using a multinomial logit model, which was used to estimate elasticity values and the willingness-to-pay among attributes. The results indicate that drivers are highly sensitive to cordon charge (-1.145), significantly more than to parking cost, search and egress times in switching mode and parking choice. Furthermore, respondents' reactions suggest that drivers' willingness to pay for parking fees is higher than their tendency to pay for cordon tolls. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the article is to analyse anticyclical consequences resulting from internal coordination of fiscal and monetary instruments, and the main factors determining implementation of the policy mix. The paper will also discuss empirical cause-effect and time-related dependencies between the most important instruments of coordinated anticyclical policy in the economy of Poland in the period quarter I 2000 - quarter II 2011. The paper consists of three parts. The first one consists of theoretical considerations concerning the anticyclical consequences of internally coordinated fiscal and monetary tools. The second part discusses the results of analytical studies which analysed influence of anticyclical instruments on business fluctuations and cause-effect between the fiscal and monetary instruments used in the Polish economy. The final part introduces the analysis of the most significant conditions determining implementation of anticyclical policy mix in Poland.","Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny, Poznan Univ Econ, Fac Commod Sci, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Barczyk, R (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny, Poznan Univ Econ, Fac Commod Sci, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",ryszard.barczyk@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,10,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Profitability ratios show the ability of the company to generate profit and these ratios are used by the company, financial institutions, etc. to determine the performance of the company. Previous research on the relationship of capital structure with profitability has discovered that capital structure impacts profitability, but provided mixed results regarding the trend (positive/negative relationship). The aim of the research is to evaluate the impact of capital structure on profitability and, based on empirical results, to make conclusions. In the research paper, the following qualitative and quantitative methods of research are applied: the monographic method, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. The correlation and regression analyses are used to estimate the functions relating to the impact of profitability on the measures of capital structure. The results of research indicate a significantly negative relationship between profitability and capital structure. This implies than an increase in the debt ratios is associated with a decrease in profitability. During the economic downturn, an increase in the debt levels is related to an even deeper fall in profitability. The results also show that the profitability increases with size and sales growth.","[Berzkalne, Irina] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,irina.berzkalne@inbox.lv,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,9,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,67,76,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100007,0

Our country has quite a high level of emigration, which implies serious problems at different levels (especially economic, social and demographical). Of course, in these circumstances, we should analyse the meaning of the concepts used to describe this process, its causes and consequences, and we should focus mainly on possible solutions to reduce its negative consequences. The analysis of reference sources has allowed us to look more at the permanent concern about a process which was extended in large geographic areas and to find some authors and their similar or different opinions with respect to the migration of human resources.

On the other hand, in the countries with a relatively high HDI; the relationship between the HDI level and the TFR has been seen as negative but weak or flatter-sloped.

Hence, no profitability orientation exists, because retention strategies as well as marketing communication strategies are used for profitable as well as unprofitable customers (Georgi, 2005, p. 231 f.). A concept is required, which takes these aspects into consideration, as well as the customer's perspective towards retention strategies, especially concerning marketing communication. Lifecycle concept is well known from performance in kind, but is also crucial for services and service marketing. The focus of this concept is the assumption, that every performance has a limited lifetime and the selling of this performance underlies a cyclic development over time (Wiesner and Sponholz, 2007, p. 27). First of all, the purpose of this paper is to gain insights about the changes in needs and expectations in terms of communication of hotel customers during relationship lifetime and the impact on communication and hence, also retention strategies. With the help of a questionnaire, hotel customers in different customer lifecycle phases are asked for their needs and interests concerning marketing communication.

The internal structure of the enterprise sector in Slovakia is specific. It is formed by a considerably smaller percentage of microenterprises than in other countries of the European Union. Within the applied scope data for Slovakia referred to the level of average measures for the group of countries from the Middle East Europe which had undergone system transformation and are members of the European Union. Data which reflect the internal structure of the enterprise sector taking into consideration 3 basic criteria reflecting significance of the group of enterprises (number of enterprises, generated added value and number of employees) were analysed. The derivative measures (work productivity, average employment) were also analysed. The analyses were conducted from the general point of view and also included divisions into macro-sectors and sectors. Empirical studies indicate that Slovakia can be characterised by much higher strength of large subjects especially in the industry branches, or these in which a company is highly employed (the case of shipping enterprises). Therefore, the research hypothesis is proved. In case of Slovak a mediocre role is not played by a relatively higher rate of employment in an average company.","Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management & Org, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Kunasz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management & Org, 64 Mickiewicza Str, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",kunaszm@tlen.pl,"Kunasz, Marek/HLG-2836-2023","Kunasz, Marek/0000-0002-1577-0425",,,,,41,0,0,0,11,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In this area, the City of Olomouc carries out various surveys and researches.","[Lestinska, Vlasta] Statutarni Mesto Olomouc, Olomouc 77911, Czech Republic",,,vlasta.lestinska@olomouc.eu,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87533-05-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,257,262,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349887500034,0

The belief is that volume or the number of transactions conveys important information about the market that may be useful in forecasting. Our results suggest that augmenting a variety of GARCH-type models with these proxies lead to improved forecasts across a range of intra-day frequencies. Furthermore, our results present an interesting picture whereby the PARCH model generally performs well at the highest frequencies and shorter forecasting horizons, whereas the component model performs well at lower frequencies and longer forecast horizons. Both models attempt to capture long memory; the PARCH model allows for exponential decay in the autocorrelation function, while the component model captures trend volatility, which dominates over a longer horizon. These characteristics are likely to explain the success of each model.

As a result of low employee mobility, one recent research topic is the influence of expatriate spouses on relocation willingness. Seeing that more and more people live in dual-career relationships, the author would like to take a look at the specific situation that dual-career couples face when they go abroad. It is the objective of this paper to evaluate the reasons for on-assignment career support both on the employer and employee/spouse part. This paper should help to clarify why it is in a company's and expatriate's interest to spend resources on such family-friendly policies. The author conducts a literature review using books as well as articles from academic journals. Based on the research questions, the author comes to the following conclusions: 1. The main challenge for dual-career couples apart from the work-family conflict is to find adequate work in the host country. 2. Accompanying partners prefer to do further training compared to actual employment in the host country because of restrictions such as work permit requirements. 3. Dual-career support is beneficial for the trailing spouse, the expatriate and the employer. The author sees that the majority of accompanying spouses are faced with troubles when looking for a job in a new location. The author concludes that dual-career support is beneficial for all involved parties, especially in terms of increased employee mobility. This paper provides further insight into the situation of accompanying spouses. It is the aim to highlight the situation of dual-career couples on international assignments for future management decisions.","[Priesner, Katharina] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,k_priesner@hotmail.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,9,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,484,492,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100045,0

The issue of financing gap or lacuna arises due to the mismatch between the demand and supply of institutional funds for SMEs. SMEs contend that finance for SMEs are abundant, however, the supply of bank financing is largely unavailable to them. Banks, on the other hand, maintain that lending to these SMEs remains low because of lack of qualified demand. This brought to the forefront the issue of financing lacuna; a perennial issue in many developing countries, including Malaysia. The objective of this paper is to discuss the financing lacuna in Malaysian SMEs, focussing on the supply side. This paper focuses on the supply perspective to fulfil the research gap in understanding the financing lacuna, which has often been overlooked due to the tendency to analyse financing lacuna from the demand side only. This has been based on surveyed data of SME entrepreneurs. This paper outlines the theoretical approaches and practices of SMEs financing in Malaysia, followed by an analysis of the factors that shaped the financing lacuna (gap).","[Ramlee, Shamshubaridah; Berma, Berma] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Econ & Business, Bangi 43600, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Ramlee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Econ & Business, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.",sham5806@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,15,20,2,38,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In this context, the aim of our research is to investigate if the evolution of the technical efficiency of the banks from a sample of new EU member countries (two from the first wave of EU enlargement, namely the Czech Republic and Hungary and one from the second wave, namely Romania) is determined by a series of factors, such as profitability, the bank size or the foreign ownership structure. In order to achieve this we have applied a two-stage non-parametric approach, where the estimated efficiencies obtained through the Data Envelopment Analysis in the first stage, have been used in the second stage as dependable variables in a Tobit regression. The obtained results suggest that the banks efficiency in the case of the analysed countries has registered a slight increase during the analysed period (2003-2010), the Czech Republic banks being the best pet:formers, followed by the banks from Hungary and Romania. From a policy perspective, the paper highlights the importance of encouraging increased efficiency throughout the banking industry of the new EU member states.","[Roman, Angela; Sargu, Alina Camelia] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Roman, A (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B Dul Carol 1 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",aboariu@uaic.ro; alina.sargu@feaa.uaic.ro,"ROMAN, Angela/G-9223-2018","ROMAN, Angela/0000-0003-0402-7641",,,,,35,2,2,0,25,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The paper discusses the results of a survey conducted on a sample of 500 students at the University of Finance and Management in Warsaw examining entrepreneurial attitudes. The aim of the survey was to identify the factors currently determining the shape and development of entrepreneurial attitudes among students. The results indicate that male students were more likely to develop plans to engage in business activities. Another variable determining one's readiness to take up self-employment was age. The survey also revealed a relationship between the experiences of the respondents' parents or friends in operating their own businesses and the respondents' interest in being self-employed. The results demonstrate the necessity to introduce changes in the way in which students are provided with higher education. There is a significant need to conduct a greater number of workshops based on analysing case studies. Moreover, there is also a need to pursue a family policy aimed at eliminating barriers to women taking up self-employment and operating their own businesses.","[Staniewski, M.

Four different ways of conducting the critical loss analysis in a differentiated products setting have been proposed in the literature or implemented in antitrust practice: (1) the average-price-increase test, which treats the products within the candidate market as a single group and examines the profitability of the group as a result of a change in the average price; (2) the joint-price-increase test, which examines whether it is profitable for the hypothetical monopolist to impose a uniform price increase simultaneously on all products within the candidate market; (3) the single-price-increase test, in which a candidate market constitutes a relevant market if it is profitable to increase price on one product; and (4) the respective-price-increase test, according to which a candidate market constitutes a relevant market if it is profitable to impose a price increase on each and every product within the candidate market. In this article, we summarize how to implement each test and, for each test, provide the criterion that is required for a candidate market to pass the test (and thus to constitute a relevant market). Furthermore, the four tests are not equivalent in a differentiated products setting, and may lead to different results with respect to market definition. In this article, we will explore the relationships between the various tests and the limitations of some tests. This article serves as a practitioners guide to implementing the critical loss analysis in a differentiated products setting.",,,,christine.meyer@nera.com; yijia.wang@nera.com,,,,,,,11,4,4,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

A common issue arose in these cases: did the notifying state-owned enterprise operate independently of the Chinese State, or was there scope for the Chinese State to coordinate the behavior of the notifying enterprise and other state-owned enterprises in the same sector? In the latter case, all the state-owned enterprises in the same sector would be treated as part of a single entity for the purpose of merger analysis. To provide an in-depth analysis of this issue, this article first reviews the historical development of the reform of state-owned enterprises and examines their current corporate governance structure. By applying the economic theory of the firm to understand the concept of undertaking under the EU Merger Regulation, this article reveals the flaws in the European Commissions analysis of this issue. As the single-entity theory can be used as both a shield and a sword, the European Commissions decision on this issue will have far reaching implications for future antitrust cases involving Chinese state-owned enterprises.",,,,angela.angelazhang@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,14,14,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

While the new control system is a technological issue, the introduction of a new policy must also consider public preference and acceptability. The capability of system control is often not enough to lead to the success of a new policy: the successful implementation of a new policy requires study on a range of issues including identifying the public perception and acceptability. Consequently, to accomplish the analysis of public discourse and acceptability, motorist surveys were carried out with residents of Seoul Metropolitan areas who were returning home from holidays. As a result, 66% of respondents agreed with the proposed policy; 24% of them disagreed and 11% of them gave the no-comment response. Public acceptability was found to be higher with increase in age, household income, the number of family members, and in the inconvenience for using freeways during the major Korean Holidays. Additionally, the married and female respondents tended to show higher acceptability. The results can be informative and practically used for developing participatory policies to successfully integrate public discourse and preference. Also suggested is the consideration of narrative policy as a means to improve public acceptability. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, this paper finds evidence that debt service ratio does not crowd out the investment rate in developing countries. In other words, even though external debt is negatively associated with economic growth, countries are found to be safe from being in the debt overhang hypothesis. Furthermore, there is evidence to support the existence of spatial dependence in the growth model, suggesting the existence of a positive spillover effect of growth among the neighbouring countries.","[Daud, Siti Nurazira Mohd] Islamic Sci Univ Malaysia, Fac Econ & Muamalat, Nilai 71800, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia; [Podivinsky, Jan M.] Univ Southampton, Div Econ, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia; University of Southampton,"Daud, SNM (通讯作者)，Islamic Sci Univ Malaysia, Fac Econ & Muamalat, Nilai 71800, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.",nurazira@usim.edu.my,"Daud, Siti Nurazira Mohd/AAG-9843-2019","Mohd Daud, Siti Nurazira/0000-0003-0011-8140",,,,,44,10,13,0,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

An older portfolio of trademarks diminishes the ratio of market value to firm assets, but this ratio can be improved in the long term by abandoning old trademarks. Portfolios of trademarks with wide diversification do not help increase Tobin's q. Furthermore, according to an event study, the creation of a trademark has a positive effect on cumulative abnormal returns compared with no event, whereas a cancellation event has a negative impact.","[Gonzalez-Pedraz, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, Madrid 28903, Spain; [Mayordomo, Sergio] CNMV, Dept Res & Stat, Madrid 28010, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"González-Pedraz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, C Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain.",cugonzal@emp.uc3m.es; smgomez@cnmv.es,"de Lima, Andréia/G-8040-2014","Mayordomo, Sergio/0000-0001-8363-5500",,,,,38,6,9,0,18,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Transport infrastructure investment improves accessibility to input and output markets and thus increases market potential. Market potential is measured by travel time through the real transport network and takes into account the immense improvements that have taken place in Spain over the last decades. The results show a significant positive effect of market potential on firm-level productivity, which is robust to various estimation methods.

Private vehicles have typically offered better alternatives than the public bus at the cost of environmental problems. The challenge is even greater in rural areas and small cities where factors such as diverse activity locations, abundant parking lots, and non-existence of traffic jams have justified the use of private car as a commuting mode. This paper tries to address this challenge by analyzing the prospect of increasing patronage for a local public bus in Hidaka City, a small city in Japan. A questionnaire survey collected from three main residential complexes in the city was used in the analysis. The study mainly focused on work commuting trips and the respondents were categorized into train commuters and non-train commuters for the analysis. The results showed that up to a 14% increase can be expected from the train commuters with the majority share coming from motorized modes. Strategic implementation in improving the services was not as straight forward as expected. However, the findings indicated that the right direction had been pursued. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

One-third of the survey sample said they could afford another car if they wanted but chose not to (voluntary one-car households), and there were important differences between these households and those that could not afford another car (involuntary one-car households). Low-car households travelled half the daily vehicle kilometres of households with at least as many cars as adults and the majority said they had no travel problems. Voluntary one-car households lived in areas with more alternatives to car-based transport and did not experience restrictions on their mobility. However, involuntary households did not have as many transport options, relied heavily on car-based travel, faced greater restrictions on their activities, had fewer social support networks and had lower psychological well-being. This provides an important caution to policies that attempt to limit car ownership if households cannot adjust to the negative consequences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Match outcome probabilities at the start of each session are forecast using a sequence of multinomial logistic regression models. These probabilities can assist a team captain or management in considering a certain aggressive or defensive batting strategy for the coming session. We investigate how the outcome probabilities (of a win, draw, or loss) and covariate effects vary session by session. The covariates fall into two categories, pre-match effects (strengths of teams, a ground effect, home field advantage, outcome of the toss) and in-play effects (score or lead, overs-used, overs-remaining, run-rate, and wicket resources used). The results indicate that the lead has a small effect on the match outcome early on but is dominant later; pre-match team strengths, ground effect and home field advantage are important predictors of a win early on; and wicket resources used remains important throughout a match.

Privileged individuals disproportionately turn away from academics because they have many informal opportunities. The aspiring classes, conversely, are more reliant on education because they lack the advantages that come from nonacademic sources, like social networks, family relations, and other institutionalized mechanisms. Applying logistic regression to the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and its high school transcript data, this hypothesis is implied in two ways. First, when social backgrounds are controlled, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians are more likely to complete high school and go to college relative to white people. A second analysis shows that the relationship between family income and education is curvilinear. As income increases from poverty through the middle classes, the pursuit of education increases as socioeconomic barriers are removed. But among families with the highest annual incomes, there are marked decreases in rates of high school completion and transition to college. The article concludes that equality of opportunity is not achievable because numerous informal opportunities exist for traditionally advantaged segments of the US population.","Hofstra Univ, Dept Sociol, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA",Hofstra University,"Mangino, W (通讯作者)，Hofstra Univ, Dept Sociol, 202B Davison Hall, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA.",William.Mangino@Hofstra.edu,,,,,,,89,9,18,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This paper extends that line of research by utilizing intra-day data and obtaining daily volatility forecasts from a range of models based upon the higher-frequency data. The volatility forecasts are appraised using four different measures of true volatility and further evaluated using regression tests of predictive power, forecast encompassing and forecast combination. Our results show that the daily GARCH(1,1) model is largely inferior to all other models, whereas the intra-day unadjusted-data GARCH(1,1) model generally provides superior forecasts compared to all other models. Hence, while it appears that a daily GARCH(1,1) model can be beaten in obtaining accurate daily volatility forecasts, an intra-day GARCH(1,1) model cannot be.

In the formal model of that paper, fitting pro-attitudes are represented by the class of permissible preference orderings on a domain of items that are being compared. As it turns out, this approach opens up for a multiplicity of different types of value relationships, along with the standard relations of 'better', 'worse', 'equally as good as' and 'incomparable in value'. Unfortunately, the approach is vulnerable to a number of objections. I believe these objections can be avoided if one re-interprets the underlying notion of preference: instead of treating preference as a 'dyadic' attitude directed towards a pair of items, we can think of it as a difference of degree between 'monadic' attitudes of favouring. Each such monadic attitude has just one item as its object. Given this re-interpretation, permissible preferences can be modelled by the class of permissible assignments of degrees of favouring to items in the domain. From this construction, we can then recover the old modelling in terms of the class of permissible preference orderings, but the previous objections to that model no longer apply.","Lund Univ, Uppsala, Sweden",Lund University,"Rabinowicz, W (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Uppsala, Sweden.",wlodek.rabinowicz@fil.lu.se,,,,,,,36,31,36,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Many of the policies pursued by President Rafael Correa have focused on changing the relationship between nature and society. The new constitution of 2008, which grants rights to nature, adapts a new development model based on indigenous cosmology and strengthens the power and regulatory remit of the state over the economy and society, is an important statement of intent in this regard. The Yasuni-ITT (Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini) initiative to leave oil underground in exchange for international financial contributions is the most significant manifestation of this intent in actual policy. Analysis of two emblematic changes reveals that the creation of a post-neoliberal development strategy has so far produced partial and uneven results.

Thus, although mathematical/quantitative research methodologies are very relevant for science, they are insufficient to study economy and society. Due to its prejudice against non-mathematical/quantitative scientific reasoning, neoclassical economics could not be technologically prepared to reach the intangible flow dynamics of economic phenomena. Furthermore, the neoclassical solution to call people human capital or assets, besides being ethically very questionable, offers performative non-scientific metaphors that intervene in the production of the reality they claim to represent; and sabotages the study of well delimited research questions by scientific approaches outside the realm of neoclassical economics.","[Cardao-Pito, Tiago] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Accounting & Finance, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Cardao-Pito, Tiago] Univ Tecn Lisboa, ISEG, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Strathclyde; Universidade de Lisboa,"Cardao-Pito, T (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Accounting & Finance, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland.",tiago.cardao-pito@strath.ac.uk,"Cardao-Pito, Tiago/AAQ-7484-2021","Cardao-Pito, Tiago/0000-0002-0513-9306",,,,,68,13,14,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We find that at earlier forecast horizons conventional models, especially ARFIMA and ARIMA, provide better one-step ahead forecasting performance. However, unobserved components model turns out to be the best performer in terms of dynamic forecasts.

Consequently, the occurrence of spikes in the spot electricity price represents a major source of risk for retailers, and the forecasting of these price spikes is important for effective risk management. Traditional approaches to modelling electricity prices have aimed to predict the trajectory of spot prices. In contrast, this paper focuses on the prediction of price spikes. The time series of price spikes is treated as a discrete-time point process, and a nonlinear variant of the autoregressive conditional hazard model is used to model this process. The model is estimated using half-hourly data from the Australian electricity market for the period 1 March 2001 to 30 June 2007. One-step-ahead forecasts of the probability of a price spike are then generated for each half hour in the forecast period, 1 July 2007 to 30 September 2007. The forecasting performance of the model is then evaluated against a benchmark that is consistent with the assumptions of commonly-used electricity pricing models.

For both portals and their partners, the more exclusively bound one party is, the more likely its counterparty is to be granted contingent control rights. Additionally, we find that portals' alliance partners are more likely to receive contingent control rights when they are prohibited from doing business with other portals and that contingent control rights are less likely to appear as the industry matures. Our findings are consistent with theoretical explanations that exclusivity provisions and contingent control rights both provide incentives to invest in the face of potential holdup problems and also with the proposition that exclusive arrangements lead firms to seek contingent control rights to avoid lock-in when environmental uncertainty is high.","[Elfenbein, Daniel W.] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Lerner, Josh] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lerner, Josh] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Elfenbein, DW (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",elfenbein@wustl.edu,"Elfenbein, Daniel/AAX-4800-2020; Elfenbein, Daniel/IAO-3343-2023","Elfenbein, Daniel/0000-0003-1612-7113;",,,,,42,15,16,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

An adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme is developed for Bayesian estimation, volatility forecasting and model comparison for the proposed model. The model can capture sign or size asymmetry and heteroskedasticity, such as that which is commonly observed in financial markets. A mixture proposal distribution is developed in order to improve the acceptance rate and the mixing issues which are common in random walk Metropolis-Hastings methods. Further, the logistic transition function is employed and its main properties are considered and discussed in the context of the proposed model, which motivates a suitable, weakly informative prior which ensures a proper posterior distribution and identification of the estimators. The methods are illustrated using simulated data, and an empirical study also provides evidence in favour of the proposed model when forecasting the volatility in two financial stock markets. In addition, the deviance information criterion is employed to compare the proposed models with their limiting classes, the nonlinear threshold CARR models and the symmetric CARR model.

In view of the absence of literature on this aspect of commerce in Asia, a review of Western literature was conducted. The data for this study is from semi-structured in-depth interviews with Chinese retail consultants and grocery shoppers in Shanghai, China. The results of the study show that negative low price image, low perceived own brand quality, and the importance of face in Chinese culture are the key factors resulting in negative sentiment toward Chinese grocery own brands. The results of this investigation are expected to provide a basis for making recommendations for the use of both international and Chinese retailers when building Chinese grocery own brands. The findings of this study have been generated from a small group of interviewees in a single city and thus cannot be considered conclusive. Therefore further research in other cities of China and other Asian countries should be conducted.

This article examines how Canada's increased integration into North American markets has differentially affected the manufacturing sector of different Canadian regions. Using heterogeneous models of firms to inform the analysis, it asks how plant specialization, plant size and production-run length in manufacturing-three characteristics of industrial structure that affect productivity-have changed as manufacturing plants in different Canadian regions were integrated into North American markets. The data that are used for the analysis cover the period from 1973 to 1999. The study finds that plant size and production-run length were larger in regions that were closer to the American heartland. Moreover, as export intensity increased as a result of trade liberalization, both production-run length and plant size increased more in the regions that were better situated with respect to the US market. These increases were particularly large in plants that possessed a comparative advantage. The effects of trade liberalization are not the same in all locations in a country that has widely separated and disparate regions.","[Baldwin, John R.; Brown, W.

By exploiting a natural experiment arising from Toronto's imposition of a Land Transfer Tax (LTT) in early 2008, we estimate the impact of real estate transfer taxes on the market for single family homes. Our data show that Toronto's 1.1% tax caused a 15% decline in the number of sales and a decline in housing prices about equal to the tax. Relative to an equivalent property tax, the associated welfare loss is substantial, about $1 for every $8 in tax revenue. The magnitude of this welfare loss is comparable to those associated with better known interventions in the housing market. Unlike many possible tax reforms, eliminating existing LTTs in favour of revenue equivalent property taxes appears straightforward.","[Duranton, Gilles; Turner, Matthew A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Dachis, Ben] CD Howe Inst, Toronto, ON M5E 1J8, Canada; [Duranton, Gilles] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Duranton, Gilles] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",University of Toronto; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Turner, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",mturner@chass.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,20,66,75,3,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Very little is known about how transit agencies modify operations when funds become scarce, particularly when they are being asked to carry a larger share of travelers. In this paper, we examine the performance of transit agencies since 1991, including during the recent economic crisis, to assess how transit operations have changed in response to changing economic circumstances. Using California data, we find that the effect of subsidies varies by the source of funding and the size of operator. For example, state subsidies and local subsidies are associated with increasing efficiency (vehicle revenue-miles per operating expenditures). We also identify the recent economic downturn's negative effect on both efficiency and overall operator performance (unlinked passenger trips per operating expenditures). Decreasing efficiency and overall performance are evidence of service-cutting behavior in the wake of operating shortfalls. Service cuts have a direct effect on revenue vehicle miles and ridership and would tend to decrease efficiency while increasing effectiveness (unlinked passenger trips per vehicle revenue miles) for the same number of trips. This study begins to unravel the practical effects of changing subsidies and lays the groundwork for further analysis. We conclude that without increasing funds for transit operations, this mode's hoped for role in climate change mitigation will remain only a fantasy.","[Karner, Alex; Urrutia, Anamarie; Niemeier, Deb] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Niemeier, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",dniemeier@ucdavis.edu,"Karner, Alex/I-6672-2019","Karner, Alex/0000-0002-3651-8157",,,,,28,1,2,0,12,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Local authorities all too often limit themselves to pre-conceived solutions, focus on supply-side rather than demand-side polices, and are unaware of the potential of novel solutions. This is even more the case for the development of packages of policy instruments, in which each can be expected to support the others by making it more effective or easier to implement. A decision-support tool, based on the transport policy knowledgebase, KonSULT, which generates possible policy packages, is described. The tool can operate in one of two ways: by taking a single user-specified policy instrument, and identifying the other policy instruments in KonSULT which might best support it; or by taking a user-specified shortlist of up to ten policy instruments, and identifying those combinations which might perform best in the specified context. In both cases the user specifies whether the emphasis should be on synergy or on the resolution of barriers. The best performing instruments are highlighted through a scoring system. The synergy scores were initially based on professional judgment. Subsequently, a sketch planning model was used to provide improved estimates for them. The resolution of barriers scores continue to be based on professional judgement. The paper describes the development of the tool and discusses the implications of the subsequent model-based analysis. It outlines future developments and reviews the role of such tools in policy formulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We find access regulation to have a negative effect on both total industry and individual carrier investment. Thus, promoting market entry by means of regulated access undermines incentives to invest in facilities-based competition.

Appealing to J. Howkins, R. Florida and other theorists of creative economy, the author analyses such aspects of creative economy as the need for enterprise, obsession by consuming, fusion of labour and leisure, integrality of the activities, striving for individual autonomy and privacy. The response to economical changes and social challenges could be creativeness that emerges in certain social and economical environment. The author pays attention to legal aspects of creative economy and analyses the role of technologies in the creative society. The author also focuses on the contradictory aspect of the copyright and patent right in creative economy. By expressing the creators' right to just reward copyright restricts creative communication while patent right expresses aspirations to privatize social property, including nature. The relations between technologies and creative economy refer to social changes, too. Firstly, economic relations could be treated as social technologies. Secondly, technologies (especially e-technologies) are the base of creative industries that ensure economical growth. Thirdly, technologies are indispensable to the consuming that both demands new products and generates the very economy.","Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Philosophy & Polit Theory, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Kacerauskas, T (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Philosophy & Polit Theory, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",tomas.kacerauskas@vgtu.lt,"Kacerauskas, Tomas/AAG-9281-2020","Kacerauskas, Tomas/0000-0003-2761-5913",,,,,28,14,14,0,42,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The data indicate that the majority of innovations-89 percent of British exhibits in 1851-were not patented. Comparisons across British and U.S. data also show that patenting decisions were unresponsive to differences in patent laws. Cross-sectional evidence suggests that high-quality and urban exhibits were more likely to be patented. The most significant differences, however, occurred across industries: inventors were most likely to use patents in industries in which innovations are easy to reverse engineer and secrecy is ineffective relative to patents. In the late nineteenth century, scientific breakthroughs, including the publication of the periodic table, reduced the effectiveness of secrecy in the chemical industry. Difference-in-differences regressions suggest that this change resulted in a significant shift toward patenting.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Moser, P (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,83,92,109,4,38,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

We propose a calibrated model to simulate the impact of different public policies. We then use French data to estimate this model and show that the value of the licence decreases with the number of licences, but increases with the size and wealth of the city population. Applying this model, we deduce an indirect estimation of the elasticity of demand with respect to availability of the service (number of taxicabs) of 0.78. Hence a 75% increase in the number of taxicabs could occur in France before eliminating the value of the licence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The empirical results indicate that agricultural prices adjust faster to monetary shocks than industrial prices do, affecting relative agricultural prices in the short run, but strict long-run money neutrality does not hold. We also find that the exchange rate as a flexible sector variable, adjusts faster to temporary shocks than the sticky, industrial prices. This implies that in a case of monetary shocks the agricultural sector associated with flexible changes bears the burden of adjustment vis-a-vis the sectors with sticky changes. These macroeconomic effects are reflected in real agricultural price volatility and the agricultural sector incomes by reducing the financial viability of the farmers.","[Bakucs, Lajos Zoltan; Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, SI-6104 Primorska, Slovenia",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; University of Primorska,"Bakucs, LZ (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Budaorsi U 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.",bakucs@econ.core.hu; stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si; ferto@econ.core.hu,"Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372;",,,,,33,8,8,0,10,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

A firm diagnosis can be motivated not only when it have a difficult situation or malfunction, but also when the company is healthy and the management want to improve the activity. Companies characterized by a working capital with significant impairment, by the existence of financial expenses witch can not be covered; expenses with a level of 5-10% of turnover, or by a rate of 20-30% decrease in activity or loss of 10-40% compared with sales have a low chance of recovery.

We discuss pricing where the investor has information concerning the expected life expectancy of the insured as well as perhaps other medical information obtained from a medical underwriter. We show how to incorporate this information into the investor's valuation in a rigorous and statistically justified manner. To incorporate medical information, we apply statistical information theory to adjust a pre-specified standard mortality table so as to obtain a new mortality table that exactly reflects the known medical information. We illustrate using several mortality tables including a new extension of the Lee-Carter model that allows for jumps in mortality and longevity over time. The information theoretically adjusted mortality table has a distribution consistent with the underwriter's projected life expectancy or other medical underwriter information and is as indistinguishable as possible from the pre-specified mortality model. An analysis using several different potential standard tables and medical information sets illustrates the robustness and versatility of the method.","[Brockett, Patrick L.; Chuang, Shuo-li] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Informat Risk & Operat Management, Red McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Deng, Yinglu] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Managemnet, Beijing, Peoples R China; [MacMinn, Richard D.] Illinois State Univ, Katie Sch Insurance, Coll Business, Normal, IL 61790 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Tsinghua University; Illinois State University,"Brockett, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Informat Risk & Operat Management, Red McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",brockett@mail.utexas.edu; shuolic@mail.utexas.edu; dengyl@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; richard.macminn@ilstu.edu,"MacMinn, Richard D/D-1909-2010",,,,,,35,1,1,1,5,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89414-036-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,13,32,,,,,,20,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316628500002,0

The task would have not been easy in any case, given his deep knowledge of the field and his many contributions. My discussion, however, turned out to be more difficult than I anticipated, given that there was no formal paper to discuss, just some sparse notes that he had written at various different dates, but certainly before the spectacular gyrations that hit the speculative markets in mid to late October 2008 and early December 2008. During our brief encounters at the workshop, he mentioned the thought of expanding his notes and writing a full-length paper on the issue. However, his unexpected demise left this thought unrealized. The editors of this special issue thought that it would remain incomplete without his outstanding contribution, and invited me to write my reflections on his notes and his verbal presentation. If discussing the paper (in an informal setting) was already daring, writing a paper on such a wide and complicated topic was a daunting task. I had many reasons for refusing the assignment; however, in the end, I felt that I should take it, if only as a personal homage to a giant in our discipline.

Since the 1940s, teams have played an important role and today the use of formal, informal developed teams in organizations continues to increase. As the interest in Team Performance rises, empirical and theoretical attention has been focused on varying themes such as conflict, social networking, and decision-making. The new drive of Behavioral Economics into economy has given rise to the idea to measure Team Performance including behavior. This research paper presents an executive summary of how to measure the determinants behavior of an empirical research by methods of secondary analysis, survey, and a result of a validation process through a laboratory test method in an European environment. It presents a result to measure Team Performance, including the determinants of behavior, in a summarized and representative way and gives a perspective of how to set up team so that they are performing on a high level. This paper is based on the fact that Behavioral Economics is entering the economic business area. It summarizes aspects of Team Performance & Behavioral Economics, outlines a way to measure behavior by Team Performance and presents an executive result of an empirical research study. The authors define teams including behavior and develop a 12 dimension model of measuring Team Performance including the determinants of behavior. Key findings are: First, Team Performance is measured in companies on a regular basis. Due to new trends in organizations also triggered by crisis, Behavioral Economics is entering into the practical environment, linked to the increased importance of measuring Team Performance. Secondly, the research result presents evidence that it is possibility to measure behavior in Team Performance and empirically presents the impact of behavior. Lastly, an important result of a dissertation in a summarized way is presented empirically that delivers a support of the entrance of Behavioral Economics into the economy and environment in measuring Team Performance with the determinants of behavior.","[Giesa, Andreas Michael] Univ Latvia, Univ Appl Sci, Ottostrasse 1, D-40625 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Voroncuka, Inesa] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,Andy.Michael.Giesa@googlemail.com; voroncuk@lanet.lv,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,215,230,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100021,0

According to the natural trading partner hypothesis trade blocs formed along continental lines offer more hope to be welfare-improving in terms of trade than trade blocs that cross different continents. This paper examines the effect on trade of continental and intercontinental PTAs. To this end, using the gravity equation we estimate trade creation and trade diversion effects of both kinds of PTAs on a sample of 182 countries over the period 1960-2005. The use of the standard panel data techniques gives support to the natural trading partner hypothesis. However, the estimation using recent developments in the econometric analysis of the gravity equation do not provide support to this hypothesis leading us to conclude that the proliferation of both kinds of PTAs (continental and intercontinental) has positive effects on trade.","[Gil-Pareja, Salvador; Llorca-Vivero, Rafael; Antonio Martinez-Serrano, Jose] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Fac Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Gil-Pareja, S (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Dept Estruct Econ, Av Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",salvador.gil-pareja@uv.es; rafael.llorca@uv.es; j.antonio.martinez@uv.es,"Llorca-Vivero, Rafael/G-9902-2015; GIL PAREJA, SALVADOR/G-9907-2015","Llorca-Vivero, Rafael/0000-0003-1729-4204; GIL PAREJA, SALVADOR/0000-0003-3746-2228",,,,,41,1,1,0,9,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

During the process of stocks trading, liquidity risk can increase the transaction costs. At present, foreign studies generally believe that liquidity risk can lead to excess returns on the stock market. However, as an emerging market, Chinese stock market has its own unique properties in price limits, volatility, quote depth and delivery system. Researches cannot agree with each other on excess returns coming from liquidity risk, and the models of liquidity risk are inconsistent. To establish an effective model of liquidity risk to measure its impact on the stock markets is an important aspect of the current study. Based on domestic and abroad researches and the current situation of Chinese stock market, we put forward a new index to measure liquidity risk. Selecting the A-share data of more than 900 listed companies in Shanghai Stock Exchange from July 1, 2006 to December 31, 2008, we distinguish industries and study the stocks' excess return of the liquidity risk during bull and bear market periods based on the stock yield, market yield and stock liquidity risk. At the same time, the impact of the size of companies, the carrying amount of market capitalization ratio, the proportion of outstanding shares on stock returns is also taken in consideration to measure the excess returns of stocks on the basis of the multi-factor. The innovation of this paper is: At first, considering the continuity and stability, we establish new measurement of liquidity risk and combine the stock price with its volume on the day and the previous day; secondly, considering the impact of the market factor, company size, liquidity risk on the excess returns of stock, we make an empirical analysis and a comparative analysis of the excess returns coming from liquidity risk on each sector of stocks based on a panel data model. It will have great significance on investigating the efficiency of capital markets, asset pricing and liquidity risk management.","[Li Lili; Zhang Yulan] Qingdao Univ, Coll Econ, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China",Qingdao University,,,"zheng, yi/JOZ-7204-2023; zhang, xiang/JJD-7003-2023",,,,,,20,10,11,0,5,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89414-036-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,1,12,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316628500001,0

Until recently, credit risk research has focused largely on the estimation and validation of the PD parameter, and much less on LGD modeling. In this first large-scale LGD benchmarking study, various regression techniques for modeling and predicting LGD are investigated. These include one-stage models, such as those built by ordinary least squares regression, beta regression, robust regression, ridge regression, regression splines, neural networks, support vector machines and regression trees, as well as two-stage models which combine multiple techniques. A total of 24 techniques are compared using six real-life loss datasets from major international banks. It is found that much of the variance in LGD remains unexplained, as the average prediction performance of the models in terms of R-2 ranges from 4% to 43%. Nonetheless, there is a clear trend that non-linear techniques, and in particular support vector machines and neural networks, perform significantly better than more traditional linear techniques. Also, two-stage models built by a combination of linear and non-linear techniques are shown to have a similarly good predictive power, with the added advantage of having a comprehensible linear model component.

The most commonly used measure for evaluating their predictive accuracy is the Accuracy Ratio, or equivalently, the area under the ROC curve. The disadvantages of these measures are that they treat default as a binary variable, thus neglecting the timing of default events, and they fail to use all of the information available from censored observations. We present an alternative measure which is related to the Accuracy Ratio but does not suffer from these drawbacks. As a second contribution, we study statistical inference for the Accuracy Ratio and the proposed measure in the case of multiple cohorts of obligors with overlapping lifetimes. We derive methods which use more sample information and lead to tests which are more powerful than alternatives which filter just the independent part of the dataset. All procedures are illustrated in the empirical section using a dataset of S&P Credit Ratings. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study points out that factors such as brand loyalty and the adoption of policies promoting long-term competition versus a short-term approach can contribute to mitigating financial problems of the universal postal service (UPS), underscoring the importance of cost efficiency as a response to market skimming. The main conclusion is that, after fifteen years of liberalization in the sector, there is no conclusive evidence for risk of failure among existing operators in the European Union.","[Prado-Dominguez, A.

Previous debates have linked environmental upgrading processes in global value chains above all to the influence of powerful lead firms from developed countries. In this paper, we argue that the Indian automobile sector, too, shows a growing tendency for more environmental protection. However, the decisive impetus is often not given by international lead firms. Applying the concept of global value chains, this paper aims to identify both the dominating coordination mechanisms in the Indian automobile chain, and the strategies of different actors for environmental upgrading. The empirical section draws on findings from 130 qualitative interviews with eight vehicle manufactures, 54 component suppliers and several industry experts held between 2009 and 2011. Our results indicate that Indian vehicle manufacturers are presently more pivotal to driving green supply chains than international players. Our findings suggest that especially the strong technical and organizational support provided by Indian lead firms is the crucial factor to push component suppliers to improve their environmental performance. On this account, the recent debate on greening of supply chains seems to be led too much from a western perspective. Rather, it appears that many environmental upgrading processes in automobile supply chains occur independently of western lead firms. In fact, they are mostly initiated and implemented by local lead firms.","[Reps, Nicole; Braun, Boris] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Reps, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",nicole.reps@uni-koeln.de; boris.braun@uni-koeln.de,,,,,,,69,6,6,1,34,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

This study develops a contingency framework to investigate how competitive intensity affects the effect of cross-functional collaboration on product innovation performance and further to examine how the moderating role of competitive intensity in the cross-functional collaboration-performance relationship is mediated by knowledge integration mechanisms. A survey of 182 Taiwanese manufacturing firms provides the data for the analysis. The results from moderation and mediation regression analyses show that (1) competitive intensity weakens the effect of cross-functional collaboration on product innovation performance; and (2) the negative effect of competitive intensity on the cross-functional collaboration-product innovation performance relationship is explained by knowledge integration mechanisms. These findings not only demonstrate the contingency role of competitive intensity but also qualify it by the mediating role of knowledge integration mechanisms in the relationship between cross-functional collaboration and product innovation performance.","[Hsu, Teresa Tiaojung] Cheng Shiu Univ, Dept Business Adm, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Tsai, Kuen-Hung] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan",Cheng Shiu University; National Taipei University,"Hsu, TT (通讯作者)，Cheng Shiu Univ, Dept Business Adm, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",tjhsu@csu.edu.tw,,,,,,,68,7,7,4,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

A robust stylized fact in empirical finance is that the spread between the yields on long- and short-term bonds forecasts future excess returns on bonds at varying horizons positively; in addition, the short-term nominal interest rate forecasts both the stock return volatility and the exchange rate volatility positively. This paper presents evidence that movements in both the short-term nominal interest rate and the yield spread are positively related to changes in the subsequent realized bond risk and bond return volatility. The yield spread appears to proxy for business conditions, while the short rate appears to proxy for inflation and economic uncertainty. A decomposition of bond betas into a real cash flow risk component and a discount rate risk component shows that yield spreads have offsetting effects in each component. A widening yield spread is correlated with a reduced cash-flow (or inflationary) risk for bonds, but it is also correlated with a larger discount rate risk for bonds. The short rate only forecasts the discount rate component of the bond beta. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, much of the literature on networks is characterized as associative, considering them only as cumulative constructs through the constant enrollment of additional actors. Through the lens of social capital and a discussion of the limitations of the networking paradigm in economic geography, this article aims to move beyond this associative nature and introduce variance in network practices in the form of nonworking and not working. By presenting a hypothetical example of a project-based network, we introduce the concepts of nonworking and not working as latency and disassociation as dimensions of network practices. In doing so, we present a more nuanced approach to the networking paradigm in relational economic geography, one that moves beyond a purely associative understanding to incorporate nonworking and not working.","[Vorley, Tim] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England; [Mould, Oli] Univ Salford, Dept Geog, Salford M5 4WT, Greater Manches, England; [Courtney, Richard] Univ Leicester, Ctr Labour Market Studies, Leicester LE2 3TD, Leics, England",University of Sheffield; University of Salford; University of Leicester,"Vorley, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",tim.vorley@shef.ac.uk; o.m.mould@salford.ac.uk; rac16@le.ac.uk,,,,,,,90,19,19,2,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

J,"Casey, CM",,,,"Casey, Ciaran Michael",,,Averting Crisis? Commentary from the International Institutions on the Irish Property Sector in the Years Before the Crash,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Ireland has been particularly badly impacted by the current international crisis, with an unprecedented deterioration in government finances and unemployment reaching 14.9 per cent. In many ways, the economic roots of the Irish crisis are quite mundane; the country experienced a classic asset bubble. As early as the year 2000, commentators were pointing Irish policymakers to examples of dozens of property boom/bust cycles in the recent histories of developed economies. What is certainly more controversial is how an advanced social democracy sleepwalked into a crisis that in retrospect seems to have been so apparent. In many ways, the Irish crisis can be considered as having stemmed from a failure of the variety of institutions that helped influence economic policy. This paper will examine what the large international institutions published about the Irish property and construction sectors from 2000 to 2006. It will show that the European Commission published comparatively little of relevance, while the International Monetary Fund in particular produced regular in-depth analysis that challenged prevailing policy. None of the institutions, however, came remotely close to anticipating a near-total collapse of construction activity, rendering inadequate many of their policy recommendations.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Casey, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",ciaran.casey@history.ox.ac.uk,"Casey, Ciaran/ABB-2579-2021","Casey, Ciaran/0000-0001-9154-3753",,,,,24,2,2,0,7,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Acceptance and similarity are presented as key concepts when considering new PT funding measures. Norway is taken as an illustrative example in exploring the probability that a certain measure will be accepted, and what degree of similarity is necessary, if adopting new funding schemes from other countries is to be successful. Through this approach, we aim to explore how acceptance and similarity interact. We conclude that although in principle it is possible to transfer the funding measures discussed in this paper to the Norwegian setting, they will all encounter different degrees of political and cultural accept Combining measures by creating policy packages will enable policy makers to balance the weaknesses of one funding measure against the strengths of another. The mere content of a policy package is not the only factor influencing implementation barriers. The context in which the measures are presented can also generate barriers, and thus there is reason to look more closely at the relationship between measure characteristics and context.

Such careers are being developed not only in tandem, but also often in negotiation, with gender relations in the family. Much of the existing literature in skilled migration studies has concentrated on the principal migrant and work-related context, treating the family as a rather secondary terrain. Drawing on participant observation and interviews, this paper shows that these two terrains, work and family, are closely interrelated in building skilled migrant workers' career pathways. My analysis of the experiences of migrant, dual-career couples shows that their transnational career strategies have a strong bearing on the fine balancing act and negotiation of intra-family gender relations, which are neither pre-given nor fixed. Key to understanding their strategies are migrants' transnationalising cultural capital, access to childcare provision, a life-stage perspective, and the role of dual-career policies.","Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Social Sci, Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Shinozaki, K (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Social Sci, Bochum, Germany.",kyoko.shinozaki@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,,,,,,,61,33,34,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We argue that, contrary to current practice, these models do not support the derivation of policies that aim to change travel behavior by means of changing the value of a latent variable. An example of such a policy is a marketing campaign which aims to influence the latent variable 'perceived quality of public transport', and as a consequence mode choice behavior. We argue that this lack of support is due to the combination of two factors: (i) the latent variable is usually to a non-trivial extent endogenous to the travel choice, precluding inference of causality; and (ii) the data are almost without exception cross-sectional as far as the latent variable is concerned, and as such do not allow for claims concerning changes in the variable at the individual level. When data for the latent variables are cross-sectional, and to the extent that endogeneity of the latent variables cannot be ruled out, these variables should best not be used as targets for travel demand management policies although they may still be used as input for scenario studies that involve changes in the population over time.

Drawing on field-work in a village on the Great Plain, it is argued that the Hungarian variety of 'market socialism' brought about a successful balance between the Polanyian 'forms of integration', in a conjuncture which stimulated household accumulation and promoted the interests of the rural population as a whole. Since the demise of socialism, this balance has been lost. A renewed economistic fallacy can be detected in the era of neo-liberal capitalism, but in Hungary the scope for household accumulation has greatly diminished, and the high price paid by the countryside is reflected in reactionary political movements. Polanyi sometimes fell into the trap of an anti-market, 'collectivistic fallacy'. However, if the economistic fallacy was dominant in the 'nineteenth-century consciousness' which he lambasted, the twentieth century demonstrated the inadequacy of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist alternatives in their purist forms. The Hungarian case exemplifies the more general challenge: how to institutionalize substantivist mixed economies which allow individuals and households appropriate space for 'economistic' behaviour in markets to meet some of their needs, without indulging the fantasy that reduces human motivations to utility maximization and socio-cultural complexity to a generalized market rationality.","Max Planck Inst Social Anthropol, D-06017 Halle, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Hann, C (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Social Anthropol, POB 11 03 51, D-06017 Halle, Germany.",hann@eth.mpg.de,,,,,,,46,13,13,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Paired with a right for consumers to withdraw from the contract, this legal instrument seeks to protect consumers against superior skilled and knowledgeable sellers thus restoring the balance of interests. According to prior literature, cooling-off periods also serve an economic function by moderating the abuse of market power, by mitigating problems of hidden characteristics, and by promoting consumer choice. If their drawbacks-mainly the creation of consumer moral hazard and shifting of risk to the seller-can be contained, cooling-off periods are hence supposed to yield efficiency gains. By thinking out of this box, the present paper showcases that cooling-off periods also establish the perverse incentive for the seller to increase consumer compliance to a level which outlasts the cooling-off period. I argue that inevitably occurring psychological factors and transaction costs from the cooling-off regime amplify each other, thus creating a hard-lock status-quo bias. Based on behavioural insights and transaction cost theory, I predict that an inefficiently high number of consumers will enter into a doorstep contract and that, at the same time, the number of cancelled contracts will be inefficiently low. Consequently, I propose to change the default inherent in current cooling-off regimes from presumed consent to presumed withdrawal in order to debias consumers' withdrawal decision.","Humboldt Univ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Hoeppner, S (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",sven.hoeppner@gmail.com,"Hoeppner, Sven/AAX-2254-2021","Hoeppner, Sven/0000-0003-2697-4420",,,,,120,7,7,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The case described was carried out in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, between the years 2005 and 2010. A total of 43,293 on-road vehicles, which represented approximately 5% of the vehicle fleet at that time, were tested: diesel engine vehicles (21,861) were checked for their PM emission levels and petrol engine vehicles (21,432) were checked for their CO emission levels. The results show that these examinations can indicate special problems and, based on re-sampled vehicles' data, lead to benefits such as a reduction in motor emissions over time. More specifically, the share of high-emitting vehicles (i.e. vehicles that do not meet specific emission standards), especially petrol engine vehicles, is declining over the years. However, we observe a worrisome trend for high-emitting vehicles, as the average value of PM emission from diesel engine vehicles, and particularly the average value of CO emission from petrol engine vehicles, has increased over the years. In addition, a significant gap was found in the level of pollution between high-emitting vehicles and appropriate vehicles, especially for petrol engine vehicles. Monetary evaluation of externalities indicates that annually the excessive cost of PM and CO resulting from high-emitting vehicles is 9 million NIS ($1=NIS 3.846). The pollution examinations were found to be economically justified; therefore, they should serve as an efficient means of vehicle emission control. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The management of risk is important in aviation and has always been a challenge to the industry. The events of 9/11 revealed that new policy measures and initiatives were needed, both to deal with the short-term market effects and also for the long-term development inline with the European Union Treaty. A key objective behind the establishment of the European Union has always been the objective to create an internal market, where barriers are removed and existing rules simplified, yet the air transport industry in Europe lacked the mechanisms to protect it from exposure to the events and effects of 9/11. This paper provides a unique view and understanding of the EU framework concerning safety and security in the aftermath of the terrorist attack. The paper considers commercial air operations and the insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators, focusing on the development of the respective aviation liability and compensation framework. It analyses the insurance requirements for air carriers operating in the EU, as a result of Regulation 785/2004. An outline of the International dimension is also undertaken so as to contextualise the position of the European Union and the aspect of EU competence. The research is based upon a mixed method/interdisciplinary approach, predominately with the focus on a legal qualitative review. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper discusses the different approaches to ground access at airports in the UK and Australia. In the intensifying debate on how to address transport congestion and the related environmental degradation (i.e. CO2 emissions), public ground transport can be seen as a potential cornerstone in an airport's effort to address the issue. It is hence unsurprising that a key element of the UK airport approach has been to promote a shift from the private car to more sustainable transport options for both passengers and employees. Surprisingly, Australia appears (despite its relative poor environmental performance) to focus much more on the expected growth of aviation activity and measures that will aid in addressing the resulting road congestion. In contrast to UK airports, Australian airports do not use environmental targets or educational measures in their ground access plans. Our findings and the lessons learned from the UK approach suggest that more sustainable ground transport strategies could aid Australian airports in reducing their transport congestion and resulting carbon footprint.

The results are evaluated in terms of CO2, CO, HC, PM and NOx emissions. The findings show that CO2 emissions are significantly reduced in CNG buses compared to diesel powered buses. CO2 emissions can also be reduced by 7.85% in B10 blends and 78.45% in B100 blends, compared to diesel. The environmental assessment can be considered as a basis so as to investigate the viability of replacement of petroleum- based diesel with natural gas and biofuels in city transport buses.

While policymakers often focus on aggregate cost-benefit analysis to examine tradeoffs in aviation environmental policy, these analyses do not always indicate who bears the costs or who gains the benefits of aviation. We model both the net cost and distribution of environmental damages from one year of aviation operations across the three environmental domains. We find that populations living at airport boundaries face damages of $100-400 per person per year from aircraft noise and between $5-16 per person per year from climate damages (in 2006 dollars). Expected damages from air quality are dependent on the number of operations at the airport and range from $20 to over $400 per person per year with air quality damages approaching those of noise at high volume airports. Mean expected noise and air quality damages decay with distance from the airport, but for noise, the range of expected damages at a given distance can be high and depends on orientation with respect to runways and flight patterns. Damages from aviation-induced climate change dominate those from local air quality degradation and noise pollution further away from the airport. However, air quality damages may exceed those from climate when considering the impact of cruise emissions on air quality. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Population growth, increasing demand, climate change and declining water supplies present a short-and medium-term outlook where water stress and shortages may keep arising. Water stress is a situation that arises ... when water demand is more important than the amount available for a specified period or when it is restricted by its low quality. This in turn ... causes deterioration of resources fresh water in terms of quantity (aquifer overexploited, dry rivers, etc.) and quality (eutrophication, organic matter pollution, saline intrusion, etc.). (UNEP, 2012) If global patterns continue, we can see that we are headed into an increasingly complex landscape where water mismanagement increasingly compromises water availability. Added to this we have the phenomenon of climate change, which is already having an impact on water systems and cycles globally. This is why we must change the ethnocentric approach of our current development model, where resources are exploited without regard for the future. This analysis will use another approach based on sustainable development, and will go beyond ideological approaches and economic or political agendas, to treat water management and the macroeconomics of water pragmatically.

It is argued that the proposal underestimates the importance of loss of profits induced by increased prices and does little to ensure that such effects will receive a treatment equal to that of price effects in damages claims. The article suggests that the importance of such effects could have been emphasized by introducing a rebuttable presumption on lucrum cessans based on pass-on considerations-paralleling the presumption on overcharge. Furthermore, the decision to leave questions of causality to national tort laws is criticized, as a harmonized regulation of claims based on the merits of the evidence presented would have been a superior tool, in line with a more economic approach and better suited for achieving the goal of compensation for any victim due to its intrinsic flexibility. Finally, the notion that legally relevant damage only accrues within a vertical value chain is challenged.","CNRS, ISEG Sch Management LEM, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, F-75700 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Maier-Rigaud, FP (通讯作者)，CNRS, ISEG Sch Management LEM, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, F-75700 Paris, France.",frank.maier-rigaud@nera.com,,,,,,,20,11,11,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Previous studies on the impact of high-speed rail on air travel in Europe and Asia have primarily examined the impact of travel time and price on market share for a specific city pair (or a handful of city pairs). There has been little focus on the extent to which high-speed rail (HSR) has reduced total short-haul air travel demand (versus market share), or on the potential impacts of high-speed rail on system-wide air travel demand. This paper presents an empirical, econometric analysis of air travel demand in Europe, utilizing an expanded data set to explore: (1) the impact of rail travel times, population density, and market characteristics on air traffic; and (2) the impact of high-speed rail and low-cost-carriers on system-wide air traffic. Although improvements in rail travel times have resulted in reductions in short-haul air travel, variations in city and airport characteristics significantly influence the substitution between air and rail. This paper also finds that HSR substitution has resulted in a modest reduction in system-wide air travel demand, whereas the expansion of low-cost carriers has led to a significant increase in total European air traffic. As concerns about the climate impacts of transportation grow, these results have significant implications for future transport and energy policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we find evidence supporting the hypothesis that ethnic diversity may facilitate firms' patenting activity in several ways by (a) increasing the propensity to (apply for a) patent, (b) increasing the overall number of patent applications, and (c) by enlarging the breadth of patenting technological fields, conditional on patenting.

We find that there are two types of equilibria: For some parameter values, sellers will target all potential buyers, hence their targeted ads or purchase recommendations provide no benefit to the consumer.

In the wireless telecommunications standard-setting organization we study, firms develop new technical specifications in small committees. Our panel data analyses demonstrate that interorganizational network connections influence firms' decisions to support committees. Additionally, firms are more likely to support committees when they are technologically distant from the firm that initiated the committee.

Using Hodrick-Prescott filter for extracting cycles from selected macroeconomic variables for the period 1994-2013, this paper gives a reflection on the past relationship between the characteristics of Croatian fiscal and monetary policies by testing whether these two economic pillars are in fact coordinated over a business cycle. We found that both fiscal and monetary variables exhibit counter-cyclical behaviour with relatively weak correlation to the real GDP suggesting that they are coordinated during a business cycle but their reach is ambiguous. Finally, we conclude that fiscal and monetary policies in Croatia are constrained by internal and external factors, and thus they often cannot accomplish their counter-cyclical role.","[Benazic, Manuel; Tomic, Daniel] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Benazic, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",mbenaz@efpu.hr; dtomic@efpu.hr,"Tomić, Daniel/N-7647-2019; Tomić, Daniel/AAD-8845-2020","Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096; Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096",,,,,54,5,6,0,11,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

It is likely that KIBS aim to locate proximate to (internationally operating) MNEs because of agglomeration externalities. The impact of MNEs on the birth of KIBS has rarely been examined, and the research on the new formation of KIBS has mainly adopted a case study approach, thus limiting the opportunity for generalization. We have taken a more quantitative approach using a continuous space framework to test whether proximity is important for the co-location of KIBS and MNEs in the metropolitan area of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Our results, controlled for other location factors, indicate that KIBS are co-agglomerated with MNEs and that the presence of a MNE significantly influences the birth of KIBS nearby, but the effect on such start-ups is considerably smaller than the positive effect of the presence of already established KIBS.

The current research compares four different types of FOP formats to assess consumer response. Results from two studies suggest that all FOP disclosure formats tested produce significantly more positive consumer responses than packages without any FOP nutrition information at all. Study 1 finds that levels of consumer nutrition knowledge moderate the FOP-ease of use relationship, while Study 2 reveals that an educational prime also moderates this same relationship. Additional exploratory thought analysis indicates that packages with FOP disclosures generally produce more nutrition-related thoughts than packages without any FOP nutrition information.

Such systems require privileged access to publicly-controlled street space, and in order to prepare suitably for negotiations regarding the price and terms of such access, transport planners require techniques to analyze their usage and impacts. In contrast to previous methods, this study employs activity/mobility behavior as the quantity under study rather than aggregate travel distance. A stated-response method is presented to predict the impacts of one-way carsharing. The survey instrument is based on needs-based theory, in which multiple activity episodes undertaken in service of a broader personal objective are analyzed as a pattern of linked behavior. Food shopping was the activity type employed in the empirical analysis. Substantive findings relating to the impacts of one-way carsharing are discussed, as well as limitations imposed by the survey protocol and limited sample size (n=72). It was found that non-car-owning respondents within our sample would use one-way carsharing to allow them to shop for food less frequently, would visit fewer distinct food shops, and would spend less time traveling for food shopping purposes. Instrument effects specific to this method are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we examine how judicial review requirements, lenders' recourse rights (deficiency judgments), and state assistance programs for distressed borrowers affected the likelihood of default during the recent U. S. housing crisis. We argue that state foreclosure laws should have little effect on the likelihood of liquidity events (for example, shocks to borrowers' ability to make payments) and thus provide a good instrument for identifying borrowers' costs of default. We find that borrowers with negative home equity are significantly more likely to default in states with borrower-friendly foreclosure laws. Finally, we examine how recent state and federal loan foreclosure prevention programs affected the likelihood of default.

We find that less diversified groups are more likely to centralize R&D, while in more diversified groups firms are more likely to be autonomous. We find that controlled companies are more likely to benefit from knowledge spillovers than firms at the head of the group.

The analysis of Lithuanian RSI data revealed differences in KSI development in different regions which negatively affect Lithuania's competitiveness and territorial social cohesion. While the articles notes that there have been some positive changes in the use of investment projects over the last couple of years, it also indicates that management of RSI availability and accessibility with respect to locations and sectors is not optimal.

Secondly, the model predictions regarding loans' size are tested using a disequilibrium model and data from a developed country with a growing market. It is found that banks actively adjust loan amount to client and macroeconomic risks, and that credit rationing was high, even though declining as the market developed.

The conception of analysis is based on the convergence theory which states that all industrial systems would converge because of the determinant effects of technological development.

The main findings of the research allow to argue that positively perceived trend of actual declining of economic performance's interregional variation within the new EU countries is not the consequence of joining the EU.

The influence of natural gas price on heating prices in Lithuania and the influence of oil prices on the fuel retail prices, as well as the impact of oil and natural gas price changes on Lithuania's real GDP is assessed in this article. Theoretical analysis has shown that there are three main ways through which macroeconomics is influenced within sudden energy price shocks - supply, demand and monetary policy.

This paper examines how BI is perceived or understood and establishes that, firstly, BI is inherently grounded in Goods-Dominant (G-D) logic and secondly, that this can be linked to the challenges that are experienced within BI. A recommendation is made for a shift to Service-Dominant (S-D) logic as a new avenue of exploration to assist in overcoming BI's prevailing challenges. Identifying the inherent G-D logic in BI provides the first step necessary in making this shift.

We also incorporate adjacency constraints to limit the maximum contiguous area where clear-cutting can be applied. The model proposed is applied to a timber production plantation in Cuba located in the region of Pinar del Rio. One factor to be taken into account in Cuban plantations is that the forest has a highly unbalanced age distribution. Therefore, in addition to the classical objectives of forest planning, we have the objective of rebalancing age distribution by the end of the planning horizon. Explicitly, the four objectives considered in the model are: (a) obtaining a balance-aged forest; (b) minimizing the area with trees older than the rotation age; (c) maximizing the NPV of the forest over the planning horizon; and (d) maximizing total carbon sequestration over the whole planning horizon. The solution to the proposed model provides a set of efficient management plans that are of assistance in analysing the tradeoffs between the economic and ecological objectives. The model is also applied to randomly generated simulated forests to compare its performance in other contexts. As the problem is a multiobjective binary nonlinear model, a metaheuristic procedure is used in order to solve it.

The external economic relations depend directly to the theories of economic growth, in sense of the classical growth theory, inspired by two great economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo, which has considered internationalization and opening of the economies as one of the core growth factors. According to the survey of economic experts, implementation of Europe 2020 strategy will depend in equal parts, both from internal, but also from the external polices of EU. In this regard, external economic relations provide for very good framework continuous, as EU external trade grew over the years 2011-2012 significantly, the export increased by 71% and import - by 74%. Related to the EU external trade policies in general, they are manifold, starting from the negotiations of the international trade conditions within frames of World Trade Organization, stretching to the framework EU initiatives of Generalizes system of preferences (Everything but arms/EBA, GSP+) and bilateral trade agreements, which, as from year 2006 became the preferred international trade policy of EU. Recently, the free trade agreement between EU and USA are about to be negotiated, which will establish unique Trans-Atlantic free trade area, boosting the economic growth by at least 0,5% annually, thus, it will add significantly to implementation of Europe 2020 strategy.

The reality is that their survival is being threatened by the weakness of their brand power compared to that of large businesses and global enterprises. As the brand has become a key method for identifying products and guaranteeing quality owing to the spread of the Internet, the position of medium and small traders and manufacturers with relatively weak brand power has become tenuous. Accordingly, securing the brand marketing function is becoming a crucial factor for those medium and small traders and manufacturers who wish to leap into the middle ranks through sales increases and business stabilization achieved by market extension. Therefore, this study presents a model that clarifies the effect of the Co-Brand Marketing Mix Strategy when used by medium and small traders and manufacturers on customer satisfaction and loyalty and offers hypotheses to clarify the relationship among variables by examining previous studies on co-brand, the Marketing Mix Strategy, customer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty. The fact that customer satisfaction increases loyalty, thus triggering repurchase intentions and recommendation intentions, will also be verified. This paper is, therefore, clearly different from existing studies targeting large, medium, and small businesses since it focuses on medium and small traders and manufacturers. The significance of this study is in its assertion that the co-brand strategy can become a method for medium and small traders and manufacturers to secure their competitiveness.","[Kim, Ki-Pyeong] Daejeon Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taejon, South Korea; [Youn, Myoung-Kil] Eulji Univ, Sch Hlth Ind, Dept Med IT & Mkt, Songnam, South Korea",Daejeon University; Eulji University,"Kim, KP (通讯作者)，Daejeon Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taejon, South Korea.",gpkim2970@hanmail.net; birch65@hanmail.net; lmk62@hanmail.net; retail@eulji.ac.kr,"Youn, Myoung-Kil/X-8048-2019","Youn, Myoung-Kil/0000-0001-8524-5012",,,,,13,6,6,2,44,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The aim of this paper was to analyse whether the development of the use of payment cards have a positive impact on the efficiency of the EU banking sector measured by DEA models. The starting point was the status of selected variables (number of ATM and EFTPOS terminals, total assets to a credit institution, the value of payments made via ATM and EFTPOS terminals per capita, the value of deposits and loans) in the banking sectors of the 27 EU countries in 2001 and 2011. Considered variables in these years became the basis for evaluating the effectiveness by CCR and BCC input oriented model. Calculation of the efficiency score was found to Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Italy, Malta, Poland and Slovakia were positively influenced by the use of credit cards. For these countries, the percentage increase in the number of ATMs and terminals exceeded the percentage increase in the value of payments made, which resulted in the growth of efficiency score in those countries. On the other hand, in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, there is a decrease in efficiency due to higher growth in the number of ATM and terminals, compared with the growth rate of the value of payments made by them. In the group of analysed countries, there were the countries with such a structure of input and output parameters in both years were able to maintain the effectiveness (Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and United Kingdom). DEA analysis results confirm the assumption that if an increasing number of devices aren't supported by the use of the clients, it will have the negative impact of the banking sector in the form of lost efficiency. The results of the correlation and regression analysis confirmed a significant impact of parameters (number of ATM and terminals; values of payments) to achieved efficiency.","Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva & Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Kocisová, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva & Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia.",kristina.kocisova@tuke.sk,"Kocisova, Kristina/AAA-5401-2020","Kocisova, Kristina/0000-0003-0784-441X",,,,,23,3,3,0,22,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This article seeks to urge high levels of rigor in South African research in this area, notably empirical research, proposing several aspirational research principles. First, the article considers claims of uniqueness versus the practical value of embedding research as a replication in a well-considered wider body of knowledge. Second is the desirability of conforming to sufficiently high norms of model fit and effect size and accuracy. Third is empirical comparison of South African studies with previous findings, with attendant possibilities for new theory development. Fourth is proper tests for and treatment of common method bias. Fifth is specification of appropriate sets of constructs. Finally, this article proposes specification of alternate models that will add substantial rigor to such research. In advocating these possibilities, the current article contrasts these aspirational principles to a recent SAJEMS article. This critique serves an exclusively illustrative purpose, showing some pitfalls of not conforming to the aspirational principles, the benefits of explicitly including certain easy to achieve solutions, and the ease with which greater rigor can sometimes be achieved.

Two types of multi-output cost functions were estimated: a translog form and a hybrid form with output variables transformed by Box-Cox metrics. The hybrid model performs statistically better and is the preferable model for the application in this paper. Both approaches derive a decreasing cost elasticity curve and marginal cost curve.

When first conceived in 1916, protected areas in Russia were considered as sancta of nature. In post-Soviet times, however, the fortunes of protected areas have undergone swift change: from a period of liberalisation and a conservation bonanza in the 1990s to increasing exploitation in the 2000s and cornmodification in the 2010s. Against the historical background of the Soviet period, this contribution traces reserves' trajectory from sacred cows to cash cows. It concludes that the neoliberal impetus of introducing market principles into conservation is in danger of going off course in Russia: instead of making the market work for conservation, it makes conservation work for the market.","Univ Zurich, Geog Inst, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Müller, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Geog Inst, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin@martin-muller.net,"Muller, Martin/F-7045-2011","Muller, Martin/0000-0002-0734-4311",,,,,44,7,9,1,16,BUCHENVERLAG,BAD SODEN,"POSTFACH 1128, BAD SODEN, 65796, GERMANY",0044-3751,,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

The evolution of informational systems demand that the management of organizations focus mostly on developing human resources and especially developing new abilities, an increased attention being dedicated to increasing the cohesion and to developing a team spirit.

The economic recession in Western countries has impacted upon business in China, and Chinese manufacturers are being impelled to move from labour-intensive production to high-tech innovation to maintain competitiveness. In addition, high Chinese domestic economic growth has been at the expense of growing regional and personal income inequalities. Now emphasised is a shift from investment to consumption, with innovation and labour productivity gains seen as the key to the avoidance of the ` middle income trap'. A pacesetter in innovation is private enterprise, stimulating consumer demand by raising personal income. Increases in state social welfare and the institution of the statutory minimum wage will also release income for consumption.

The development gaps deepened after the last two waves of enlargement to Eastern Europe, this fact generating serious challenges concerning the convergence process. The recovery of disparities is a necessity, especially given that the statistics on convergence indicators emphasize that the taken measures are often poor, they are not produced in accordance with the socio-economic and institutional framework of each state and obviously there is no potentiation of the synergy effects between all Community policies. Starting from these, in this article we intend to analyze in dynamics (the year 2000 compared to the year 2012) the convergence process in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs), in terms of three indices: Macroeconomic Stability Index (MSI), Governance Index (GI) and Entrepreneurial Climate Index (ECI), which have in their structure different indicators that define them. Resorting to an empirical analysis, the research results will highlight which constituent elements from each index contribute the most to the development process, and which is the interconditionality degree between the three indices. Based on determinative relations among the considered variables, we will draw up, in the conclusions, several measures that some CEECs should take in order to recover the development gaps.","[Tiganasu, Ramona; Pascariu, Gabriela Carmen] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Ctr European Studies, Iasi 700506, Romania; [Baciu, Livia] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Tiganasu, R (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Ctr European Studies, Bvd Carol I 19, Iasi 700506, Romania.",ramona.frunza@uaic.ro; gcpas@uaic.ro; baciu_livia@yahoo.com,"Pascariu, Gabriela Carmen/O-4976-2015; Tiganasu, Ramona/AAG-8631-2021","Pascariu, Gabriela Carmen/0000-0002-8169-0124; Tiganasu, Ramona/0000-0002-5921-7023; Baciu, Livia Loredana Codruta/0000-0001-5952-8377",,,,,41,2,2,0,40,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The field research of an organizational routine in the context of purposive changes revealed that the change of workflow and communication networks within routine has occurred. However, the more detailed analysis indicates that change of the networks was structure reinforcing.

In this article, we study the effects of an explicit reward in the context of blood donation. Specifically, we analyze the effects of a legislative provision that grants a one-day paid leave of absence to blood donors who are employees in Italy, using a unique data set with the complete donation histories of the blood donors in an Italian town. The across-donor variation in employment status, and within-donor changes over time are the sources of variation that we employ to study whether the paid-day-off incentive affects the frequency of their donations. Our analysis indicates that the day-off privilege leads donors who are employees to make, on average, one extra donation per year, which represents an increase of around 40%. We also find that the provision has persistent effects, with donors maintaining higher donation frequencies even when they cease to be eligible for the incentive. We discuss the implications of our findings for policies aimed at reducing the shortages in the supply of blood and, more generally, for organizations that try to motivate voluntary contributors.

The outward foreign direct investment from India has been continuously increasing until 2008 or so when the global financial crisis seems to have reduced the rate of increase. In the context, the study looks at the experiences of three leading domestic automotive firms, Tata and Mahindra which have gone abroad and taken over both vehicle manufacturers and input suppliers. The main motive has been the desire of these enterprises to become important automotive manufacturers not just in India, but also in the world.

We find that institutional aspects of the political system, executive characteristics, demographic variables, economic growth, and economic trade variables are all very important for predicting leadership turnover in the following year. Financial crises are not robustly useful for this purpose, but a vulnerability to currency crises in times of low economic growth implies very high conditional probabilities of job losses for democratic leaders in non-election years.

Under this theory, the share of productivity-enhancing activities (PEAs), such as R&D investment or on-the-job training, relative to production activities should increase during downturns because of the fall in their relative cost in terms of forgone output. This would imply that business cycles may have a (positive) long-term impact on firms' productivity growth. In the spirit of Aghion et al. (2008), we allow the impact of the cycle on PEA to vary between firms with different access to external funding. We find that, in accordance with the opportunity-cost approach, the share of R&D investment and training expenditures on total investment outlays follow a countercyclical pattern, which in the case of R&D may be reversed by the presence of credit constraints. However, the share of investment in other non-R&D-related intangible investments is found to be acyclical, which could suggest some kind of substitution across different PEAs over the cycle.","[Lopez-Garcia, Paloma] European Cent Bank, DG Res Monetary Policy Res Div, Frankfurt, Germany; [Manuel Montero, Jose; Moral-Benito, Enrique] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain",European Central Bank; Banco de Espana,"López-García, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, DG Res Monetary Policy Res Div, Neue Mainzer Str 66-6860311, Frankfurt, Germany.",Paloma.Lopez-garcia@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,36,22,23,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

In the first case, equilibrium prices are computed as if all MAS drugs were produced by a single profit-maximizing firm, while in the latter two counterfactuals, I compute equilibrium prices as if either an immediate-release generic or an extended-release branded drug were not available in the market. The simulations show that the average percentage increase in drug prices is 4 to 4.5 times larger in the latter two cases (when one of the drugs is not available in the market) compared with a simple joint profit maximization of the same products. In this respect, the challenges by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the so called pay-to-delay deals and the recent legislations introduced into the Congress to ban such deals are justified.","[Bokhari, Farasat A.

Under these circumstances, the demand for alternative vehicle-sharing transportation modes, such as carsharing or bikesharing, increases. Companies and authorities planning to develop such schemes need to know the factors driving their adoption, so that they can optimally position these services in a cost-effective way that will maximize their use. In this paper, the results of an on-line survey that was conducted in Greece, a country where carsharing is effectively non-existent and bikesharing is just emerging, are presented and analyzed. Given the nature of the survey and the fact that younger people are the most likely target audience for these services, the analysis focuses on data from the age group 18-35 years old. A factor analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of car and bike-ownership is performed, so as to reveal any latent correlation between the different variables, while the factors affecting the adoption of carsharing and bikesharing schemes are analyzed descriptively. Ordered logit models capturing the willingness of the respondents to progressively join these schemes are also estimated. The model results suggest that respondents with annual income between 15 K and 25 K Euros are more likely to join carsharing or bikesharing systems when they become available in Greece. Carsharing is also expected to mainly attract people that use bus, trolley or tram for their commute, while bikesharing is more likely to attract those who go on foot. Age is also a significant determinant of joining bikesharing, with respondents in the 26-35 years age group being more reluctant than younger ones. Finally, the more environmentally conscious the respondent declares that (s)he is, the more possible it is that (s)he will join one of the two schemes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, considering that service performance analyses are based on stakeholders' judgments, they can be characterized by possible uncertainties related to incompleteness for partial ignorance, imprecision for subjectivity and even vagueness. Therefore, under these conditions, unreliable results can be obtained by widely used service analysis methodologies. In the present paper, a methodology based on a recent extension of the SERVQUAL model, and that uses in combined manner the fuzzy set theory and the analytic hierarchy process method is proposed to effectively handle uncertainty in service performance analyses. In particular, the fuzzy set theory is considered to deal with such uncertainty, whereas the AHP method is adopted as tool to estimate the importance weights of the strategic service attributes. Subsequently, the Italian public transport service sector is strategically analysed, and its overall service quality structure is described and, finally, the strategic analysis of the public urban transport service delivered in Palermo (Italy) is performed by means of the proposed methodology. The performed service analysis allows the most influencing service factors to be captured and commented upon. The obtained results show that the management's perception of service quality meaningfully influences the overall service performance level. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In a neoclassical economic world this would correspond to setting prices according to marginal social costs. The neoclassical world is far from reality, however, and therefore workable instruments have to be developed with respect to technology, transaction costs and social acceptance. From this follows that the appropriate lever point for public intervention has to be identified for every type of externality of transport. This results in a strategy bundle for which every instrument should be optimised according to economic rules. While the principle appears simple its implementation leads to rather complex follow-up problems. Some instruments have only partial effects and should be complemented by further instruments (e.g.: emission trading in the case of climate change). Other instruments have various side impacts and influence some external effects in the desired direction but others in a counterproductive way (e.g.: emission standards for NOx and PM and their impacts on CO2). In this paper we give a brief outline of the theoretical foundation of the problem, which can be formulated as a multi-objective programming problem. Based on this we suggest a heuristic solution, which translates essential objectives into constraints in form of safe minimum requirements for objective achievement. The problem reduces then to find least cost solutions for the design of instruments, which are employed to achieve the safe minimum requirements. In this approach the right prices for external effects come out as by-products of the optimal solution (shadow prices) and can be compared with the results of direct marginal external cost estimations. We give examples for the quantification of external costs of noise and of climate change, based on this approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using docket-level federal district court data, we find a number of strong effects regarding how motions can influence this process: including that the filing of a motion significantly speeds case settlement; that granted motions are more immediately critical to settlement timing than motions denied; and that plaintiff victories have a stronger effect than defendant victories.

Such detailed and alternative modeling approach helps to assess the sensitivity of empirical inferences to the choice of these models. The empirical analysis revealed that detailed road user characteristics such as crime history of drivers and momentary activities of road users at the time of the accident provide an interesting insight in injury severity analysis. Likewise, the alternative analytical specification of the models reveals that some of the conventionally employed fixed-parameters injury severity models could underestimate the effect of some important behavioral attributes of the accidents. For instance, the standard ordered logit model underestimated the marginal effects of some of the variables considered, and forced some important variable effects to be statistically insignificant, while they remain significant predictors in the other relatively flexible models.

Using collaborative research grants between universities and business firms awarded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), in this article we disentangle some of the conditions under which different kinds of proximity contribute to the formation of U-I research collaborations, focussing in particular on clustering and technological complementarity among the firms participating in such partnerships.","[D'Este, Pablo] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, INGENIO, E-46071 Valencia, Spain; [Guy, Frederick] Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Dept Management, London, England; [Iammarino, Simona] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of London; Birkbeck University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Iammarino, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.iammarino@lse.ac.uk,,"Iammarino, Simona/0000-0001-9450-1700; D'Este, Pablo/0000-0002-4040-8209",ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,105,215,223,14,150,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Estimates on a large, Finnish data panel indicate very low transmission from parental earnings, suggesting that the parameter of inherited earning ability is tiny. Family income, particularly during the phase of educating children, is shown to be much more important in shaping children's lifetime earnings. This influence of parental incomes on children's earnings rises as the children age because the returns to education rise. Despite Finland's well-developed welfare state, persistence in economic status across generations is much higher than previously thought.","[Lucas, Robert E.

The candidate exchange rate predictors are drawn from (i) macroeconomic 'fundamentals', (ii) returns/volatility of asset markets, and (iii) cyclical and confidence indices. The proposed forecasting strategy exploits information from many dimensions, since it generates alternative exchange rate forecasts at various horizons from each of the potential predictors using single market, mean group and pooled estimates by means of rolling window and recursive forecasting schemes. The capabilities of single predictors and of alternative adaptive techniques for combining the generated exchange rate forecasts are evaluated robustly by means of statistical and economic performance measures. The results show that combining exchange rate forecasts generated from a wide range of information sets reduces ex-ante uncertainty, improves forecasting precision and leads to better market timing than most single predictors.

The behavioral mechanisms that affect transport safety are typically not considered in safety modeling. These issues are discussed in the context of trade-offs between risk-taking, as perceived by travelers, and other mobility objectives and the attributes associated with them. This is an extension of other theoretical frameworks, such as risk compensation, and attempts to integrate some of the previous frameworks developed over the years. Various examples of behavioral adaptation to specific policies are discussed and linked to the framework. These issues are then discussed in the context of improvements to empirical work in this area and the linkage of theoretical frameworks to crash modeling, in particular the estimation and use of Crash Modification Factors. Conclusions suggest that there are many deficiencies in practice, from estimation of models to choice of effective policies. Progress is being made on the former, while the publication of practical guidance seems to have substantial lags in knowledge. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This scenario has been dramatically disrupted by terrorist attacks with strong implications also in terms of policy. The importance of maritime transport security is determined by the high vulnerability of this mode of transport to terrorist attacks, given the extremely diversified routes and the enormous volume and wide range of shipped goods, whose origin, description and ownership are not always perfectly traceable. In addition, any interruption of the maritime transport chain due to international hostile actions may greatly affect the global economy. For all the above mentioned reasons, maritime security regulation has been moved to the top of the policy agenda. Throughout the world, international organisations, governments, customs and the private sector have shifted their efforts towards managing the newly required security issues, trying at the same time to safeguard operational effectiveness. However, the heterogeneous regulatory schemes that have been introduced, have sometimes overlapped or even contradicted each other. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it will analyse and discuss the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) approaches on maritime transport and port security, in a comparative way. The need for enhancing security standards has apparently generated heterogeneous policies. In this respect, the prompt response of the US to the increased terrorist threat has resulted in a series of initiatives oriented towards maximisation of internal security while the EU has adopted a strategy aiming at balancing security needs with other targets (e.g. privacy safeguard and trade defence). Lastly, the efforts made by international organisations towards the development of a coordinated maritime transport security regulation worldwide will be considered alongside the possibility of identifying a competent international organisation which could act as regulatory authority for maritime security at international level.

We develop and test a three-phase structural model for regional systems of entrepreneurship after introducing a systems approach to entrepreneurship. The model is built upon the absorptive capacity theory of knowledge spillover entrepreneurship that identifies new knowledge as one source of entrepreneurial opportunities and human capital as the major source of entrepreneurial absorptive capacity. Based on data of US metropolitan areas, we find that entrepreneurial absorptive capacity is a critical driving force for knowledge-based entrepreneurial activity.

This study introduces an agent-based approach to model yard cranes for the analysis of truck turn time. The objective of the model is to solve the yard crane scheduling problem (i.e. determining the sequence of drayage trucks to serve to minimize their waiting time). It is accomplished by modeling the yard crane operators as agents that employ reinforcement learning; specifically, q-learning. The proposed agent-based, q-learning model is developed using Netlogo. Experimental results show that the q-learning model is very effective in assisting the yard crane operator to select the next best move. Thus, the proposed q-learning model could potentially be integrated into existing yard management systems to automate the truck selection process and thereby improve yard operations.

This study takes a New Institutional Economic-perspective, supported by a variety of case studies, to identify firms' choices of when to engage corrupt intermediaries (buy) and how to approach reform. It argues that firms should be held unbendingly liable for the operation of their intermediaries. Reform may also focus on certifying good intermediaries and holding the certifier liable for the performance of its agents. Prohibiting intermediaries is not advisable, as intermediation can be either arranged in-house (make) or mixed with legal services. Registration and auditing of intermediaries provides a more promising avenue for reform. Legislators should balance the additional regulatory burden by granting a wage premium to registered intermediaries and denying legal recourse to unregistered competitors.","Univ Passau, D-94032 Passau, Germany",University of Passau,"Lambsdorff, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Passau, D-94032 Passau, Germany.",jlambsd@uni-passau.de,,"Graf Lambsdorff, Johann/0000-0002-5713-6991",,,,,33,20,20,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The main idea is to temporarily swap toxic assets for government bonds with an open maturity date. This approach not only leaves total losses with the banks, but also avoids the problem of evaluating the toxic assets in advance.

On the Zimbabwean-South African border, white farmers guard against risk by investing in portfolios of estates and emphasizing their mobility. But the farms rely on core black workforces of resident general workers', known as mapermanent. The lives of mapermanent embody temporal contradictions in South African agriculture. Work regimes depend on arrangements established through long-term residence in labour compounds, a stability threatened by employers' pragmatism in a volatile sector. Here, short-term permanence' coexists with longer-term insecurity. Moreover, what I call provisional permanence is built on others' transience: mapermanent draw on the domestic labour of temporary contract workers and the order enforcement of rotating border garrisons. Tensions between temporalities characterize workers' assertions of permanence', and their limitations, in an economy of flexibility and shifting investments.","Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Bolt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.bolt@bham.ac.uk,,"Bolt, Maxim/0000-0003-0739-8018",,,,,44,21,21,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Most research so far has focused on different forms of proximity between organizations, namely geographical, cognitive, social, institutional and organizational proximity, which are all factors at the dyad level. However, recently, factors at the node and structural network levels have been highlighted as well. To identify the relative importance of factors at these three different levels for the structure of inter-organizational networks that are observable at only one point in time, we propose the use of exponential random graph models. Their usefulness is exemplified by an analysis of the structure of the knowledge network in the Dutch aviation industry in 2008, for which we find factors at all different levels to matter. Out of different forms of proximity, only institutional and geographical proximity remains significant once we account for factors at the node and structural levels.","[Broekel, Tom] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, Hannover, Germany; [Hartog, Matte] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Sect Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Leibniz University Hannover; Utrecht University,"Broekel, T (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, Hannover, Germany.",broekel@wigeo.uni-hannover.de,"Broekel, Tom/K-7048-2014","Broekel, Tom/0000-0003-4516-4626",,,,,48,44,54,3,71,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Ten different neighbourhoods have been carefully selected to characterise the two different types of traditional and suburban neighbourhood street layouts. A self-administered questionnaire has been delivered to 2200 households to capture neighbourhood design, travel patterns, travel attitudes and socio-economic characteristics. Multivariate analysis of cross-sectional data shows that some socio-economic variables as well as travel attitudes and neighbourhood design preferences can explain the differences in travel patterns between the two distinct neighbourhood designs. The results show additionally that the traditional neighbourhood group is more sensitive to factors of perception and attitudes in relation to neighbourhood design that lead to walking, cycling and public transport use travel patterns, suggesting that land-use policy designed to accommodate lower carbon-based travel together with measures to encourage active travel will have greater impact on the traditional group than the suburban group. This finding suggests that generic measures imposed by many governments, and certainly implied by current UK land-use policy, to promote sustainable mobility should be selectively targeted.

I propose an opt-in time-varying residential pricing plan that would be equitable to both customers who opt in and those who don't. Low-income households would, on average, see almost no change in their bills under time-varying pricing, while low-consumption households would see their bills decline somewhat and high-consumption households would see their bills rise. Most importantly, I show that the opt-in approach is unlikely to increase the flat rate charged to other customers by more than a few percentage points.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Borenstein, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",borenste@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,24,59,67,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Laws regarding commercial sex influence the profitability of trafficking and may thus affect the inflow of trafficking to a country. Using two recent sources of European cross country data we show that trafficking of persons for commercial sexual exploitation (as proxied by the data sets we are using) is least prevalent in countries where prostitution is illegal, most prevalent in countries where prostitution is legalized, and in between in those countries where prostitution is legal but procuring illegal. Case studies of two countries (Norway and Sweden) that have criminalized buying sex support the possibility of a causal link from harsher prostitution laws to reduced trafficking. Although the data do not allow us to infer robust causal inference, the results suggest that criminalizing procuring, or going further and criminalizing buying and/or selling sex, may reduce the amount of trafficking to a country.","[Jakobsson, Niklas] Norwegian Social Res NOVA, N-0208 Oslo, Norway; [Kotsadam, Andreas] Univ Gothenburg, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Kotsadam, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",andreas.kotsadam@economics.gu.se,"Jakobsson, Niklas/F-8194-2013; Jakobsson, Niklas/AAD-3660-2022","Jakobsson, Niklas/0000-0002-7143-8793",,,,,52,66,69,1,140,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Prior to containerisation the general cargo for export moved to ports invariably on road in break bulk form. Growth of containerisation led to development of inland terminals enabling an exporter to obtain export clearance at the inland points. This process facilitated an exporter to move cargo either in break bulk or in containerised form, and as inland terminals facilitated aggregation an exporter could move cargo either by road or rail. Thus containerisation increased the inland transport options for an exporter from one to three. The paper develops discrete choice models in the Indian context for inland movement of containerised export cargo. Primary data was collected from 124 export firms through a structured questionnaire. This data is supplemented with data from transport firms and terminal operators. Using the above data, a nested logit model with rail container and road truck in one branch was found to predict the mode choice behaviour best. Amongst the transport attributes, total cost and total transit time were found to be influencing the mode choices significantly. The study however did not find the effect of reliability and loss and damage significant. In addition, the model also predicts that non transport attributes - like the percentage of letters of credit that materialise with inland way bills and the value of export benefits that materialise after export - are important in the mode choice decision.

The results state three important conclusions that are, in turn, three veins for further research: create a register that makes it possible to know about the activity in detail; the impact of legalization for this activity; and the social risks to which, not only the pimpineros, but also their relatives may be exposed by such changes.","[Egea Jimenez, Carmen] Univ Granada, Dept Geog Humana, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Egea Jimenez, Carmen] Univ Granada, Inst Paz & Conflictos, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Soledad Suescun, Javier Ivan] Univ Pamplona, Programa Econ, Pamplona, Spain; [Soledad Suescun, Javier Ivan] Univ Pamplona, GICEE, Pamplona, Spain",University of Granada; University of Granada,"Jiménez, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Geog Humana, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",cegea@ugr.es; jasosu72@yahoo.com,"Egea, Carmen/G-2186-2016",,,,,,29,1,1,0,5,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

The challenge to transfer the idea of corporate governance to nonprofitorganizations is their distinctive features. The chosen research field in this paper to transfer the idea is Alpine Clubs in Europe. These clubs face the challenges of the legal framework as associations. Alpine Clubs consist of an umbrella associations as well as a certain number of legally independent branches, called sections. All organizations are guided by voluntary boards. The empirical research is designed as qualitative explorative study. The main results are to find out the specialties of the governing systems of Alpine Clubs. Within this paper the research results are concentrated on the umbrella associations. Their governance system consists of voluntary boards and installed head offices providing paid staff to come across with the number of tasks. Communication and distribution of power between these two bodies are the challenges. The importance of stakeholders and their integration within the system will also be discussed within this paper.

It is heavily invaded by alien vegetation that infringes upon the sustainable supply of ecosystem goods and services provided by the native fynbos vegetation. Alien clearing and natural capital restoration is expected to recover these ecosystem goods and services and in particular to increase water availability. The study conducts cost-benefit analyses to assess whether alien clearing and natural capital restoration would add value to the Agulhas Plain through sufficiently increasing the supply of marketable ecosystem goods and services. The results indicate that the costs of alien clearing and restoration cannot be justified in the absence of water as a valued commodity.

But under the present circumstances, many English learners find it difficult to calm down and read the original literature. The reasons are as follows; First of all, due to utilitarian learning psychology, people are more inclined to choose the quick way to read the writings of a simplified version. Secondly, for the lack of a full understanding of the English language and culture, background knowledge and literary theory, readers emotionally have fear of difficulty, assuming they do not understand and thus there is no sense in reading original literature. Another reason is the lack of critical thinking and so literary works can only be passively accepted without critical thinking skills. Western theory of literary criticism is a generalization of the practice of literary creation. It is a summary of the predecessors of the Western literary nature, characteristics, function and creation, appreciation and development. It not only can offer a literary appreciation reading perspectives and methods to improve students' capacity of reading, appreciation and understanding of the original works, but also help develop students' critical thinking skills.","[Han, Guojun] Anyang Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Anyang 455002, Henan, Peoples R China",Anyang Normal University,,,"HAN, GUOJUN/H-5968-2012",,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,17.0,,,,,,440,444,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4DW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335444300085,0

Significantly less attention has been paid to the ways in which space informs workers' ability to develop the attributes that would make them more employable. In this article, we address this gap through an examination of how immigrant workers use the relative spatial organization of residence and production to cultivate the skills that enable them to shift out of low-wage occupations. We also argue that workers' spatial job market strategies have an important, but often overlooked, temporal aspect: workers use space over time not only to shape their access to jobs but also to create breathing room for learning skills that enable them to improve their employment trajectories over the long term. Drawing on a multiyear ethnographic study of Mexican immigrants in downtown Philadelphia, we show that immigrant workers used the functional proximity among the restaurant industry, small-scale residential construction work pertaining to housing renovation, and the neighborhoods where they lived to develop skill sets that enabled them to shift into higher-wage construction jobs. In essence, these workers knitted together two seemingly separate industries, such that they could use their employment time in one for learning in and about the other. Our study suggests that interventions that curtail immigrants' mobility may have implications that are far more serious than limiting immediate access to jobs: these measures may undercut immigrants' strategies for developing the skills required for long-term occupational mobility and advancement.","[Iskander, Natasha] NYU, Wagner Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Riordan, Christine] Natl Employment Law Project, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Lowe, Nichola] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",New York University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Iskander, N (通讯作者)，NYU, Wagner Sch Publ Serv, 295 Lafayette St,3043, New York, NY 10012 USA.",natasha.iskander@nyu.edu; christineariordan@gmail.com; nlowe@unc.edu,,,,,,,77,11,13,1,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Hypotheses were tested using data from a sample of chief executive officers in 51 private sector organizations in the United States, 141 private sector organizations in Slovenia and 134 public sector state and semi-state enterprises in Ireland. Data was analyzed using hierarchical regression analysis. The results show that dynamism and munificence effects on performance are mediated by an organization's corporate entrepreneurship in the private sector and munificence effects on performance are mediated by an organization's renewal in the public sector and that renewal must be in place to maximize the effect of munificence on performance. The results support a model that incorporates an extensive and diverse literature into a single model and helps illuminate similarities and differences of corporate entrepreneurship between the private sector and the public sector. The study shows that an integrative model and the interplay among the constructs yields new insights unavailable to single and focused approaches. It offers new insights about corporate entrepreneurship, not only as a discrete pursuit, but also as a construct that shapes and extends organizational performance.","[Kearney, Claudine] Univ Coll Dublin, Michael Smurfit Grad Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Hisrich, Robert D.] TSGM, Glendale, AZ 85306 USA; [Antoncic, Bostjan] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, UL EF, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",University College Dublin; University of Ljubljana,"Antoncic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, UL EF, Kardeljeva Pl 17, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",Claudine.Kearney@thunderbird.edu; robert.hisrich@thunderbird.edu; b.antoncic@gmail.com,"Antoncic, Bostjan/H-4223-2011","Antoncic, Bostjan/0000-0003-1030-6567",,,,,89,17,21,1,61,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Although the bad effects of the international financial crisis and the decline in export demand, China's private enterprises are still maintained a steady growth trend, and made important contributions to China's economy against crisis, maintain steady growth of the national economy. In this situation, in order to improve the performance furtherly, to improve their own competitiveness, to participate in the international competition effectiviely, and to adapt to the characteristics of knowledge economy in 21 Century, intellectual capital should replace currency capital, labor and land as one of the most important strategic resources in private enterprises, so that enterprise can create value through combination of their own intellectual capital and other factors of production. This paper selects the intellectual capital of private enterprises as an example and explore the management mode and strategy of intellectual capital, so that it can provide some helps in allocation of resources reasonably and development of intellectual capital effectively of private enterprises.","[Meng Jianfeng; Hou Jing] LangFang Teachers Univ, Sch Management, Langfang 065000, Peoples R China",Langfang Normal University,,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,17.0,,,,,,174,179,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4DW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335444300033,0

The class of transformations that is considered is the Box-Cox power transformation, which applies to series measured on a ratio scale. We propose a nonparametric approach for estimating the optimal transformation parameter based on the frequency domain estimation of the prediction error variance, and also conduct an extensive recursive forecast experiment on a large set of seasonal monthly macroeconomic time series related to industrial production and retail turnover. In about a fifth of the series considered, the Box-Cox transformation produces forecasts which are significantly better than the untransformed data at the one-step-ahead horizon; in most cases, the logarithmic transformation is the relevant one. As the forecast horizon increases, the evidence in favour of a transformation becomes less strong. Typically, the naive predictor that just reverses the transformation leads to a lower mean square error than the optimal predictor at short forecast lead times. We also discuss whether the preliminary in-sample frequency domain assessment conducted here provides reliable guidance as to which series should be transformed in order to improve the predictive performance significantly.

We employed ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares regressions to analyze the effects of state ownership on firm performance. We go beyond existing research on state ownership by carefully disentangle investment objectives of state-controlled financial institutions. Such state ownership can be classified as profit-oriented and non-profit-oriented, in which the former consider return on investment to be the primary investment objective, whereas the latter prioritizes socio-economic development. We found that profit-oriented state ownership is an effective corporate governance mechanism and provides political patronage to the firm in the form of firm's specific resources and credit financing. Although non-profit-oriented state ownership firms also receive similar political patronage, they tend to be associated with inefficiencies such as the free-rider problems, bureaucracies and political intervention in firm management. We conclude that state ownership consists of heterogeneous entities with respect to corporate governance and firm performance.","[Rasli, Amran; Goh, Chin Fei; Khan, Saif-Ur-Rehman] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Goh, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",m-amran@utm.my; cfgoh2@live.utm.my; saif@utm.my,"Goh, Chin Fei/J-1193-2016","Goh, Chin Fei/0000-0003-3193-7122",,,,,47,3,4,3,21,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The main tasks of the paper are: to develop the multi criteria framework for comparative assessment of energy technologies in road transport and to apply MCDM methods for the transport technologies assessment. The interval TOPSIS method is employed in order to tackle the uncertain criteria. The assessment framework allows comparing road transport technologies in terms of their environmental and economic impacts and facilitates decision making process in transport sector. The main indicators selected for technologies assessment are: private costs and life cycle GHG emissions. The ranking of road transport technologies based on private costs and GHG emissions allowed prioritizingthese technologies thus mitigating GHG emissions at the lowest costs. However the extent, capacity, and quality of road infrastructure affects the overall level of transportation activity, which in turn affects how much energy is consumed by vehicles and the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted.

A growing interest in the role of institutions in economic processes of the systems in transformation results from: 1. ambiguities as for the reasons for differences between the countries that start with the same initial position (that is difficult to explain in categories of traditional models of growth); 2. differences in economic reforms, processes that accompany them and their consequences. In the transforming countries the awareness of the influence of institutions on economic development is common.

In 1994, Australian Federal Ministry of Tourism, in the process of making national tourism strategy, defined ecological tourism as an ecologically sustainable tourism on the basis of the nature and involving the education, interpretation and management of the natural environment. The International Ecological Tourism Association defined ecological tourism as a type of tourism activities responsible for the natural world for the purpose of improving the quality of local people's life under the premise of protecting the ecological environment of the natural tourist destinations. In the meantime, Chinese scholars also made a definition to the ecological tourism from different angles, thinking it is a form of tourism with the purpose of increasingly the economic benefits of the local people, actively promoting the protection of the natural resources and local cultural integrity, and enhancing the awareness of the tourists in the protection of the natural world and cultural resources through using the natural sceneries and the folk customs with special local characteristics as the major attractions. Combined with the actual development situation of the ecological tourism in Gansu province, ecological tourism can be defined as a type of tourism activities using the natural ecology and original regional characteristic cultures as the major attractions and based on ecological environment protection and sustainable development.","[Zhu, Bolin; Wang, Nai'ang] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Resources & Environm, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University,,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,17.0,,,,,,590,593,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4DW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335444300117,0

J,"O'Dolan, C; Rye, T",,,,"O'Dolan, Catriona; Rye, Tom",,,An insight into policy transfer processes within an EU project and implications for future project design,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Policy transfer; Multi-national; Project design; Walking; Cycling,,"Policy transfer is the process of applying a policy, or knowledge that informs a policy, from one setting to another. It is considered to be an effective way for cities, municipalities or countries to learn from one another, and is documented by many (e.g. Evans, 2009; Common, 2001) as a process that is being used with increasing frequency. The European Union (EU) provides the ideal platform for knowledge exchange between member states and its various funding streams for multi-national projects, especially so. To date there has been little research into the effectiveness of EU-funded projects for facilitating such policy transfer and in particular which particular processes within them were most effective at delivering the transfer. This paper examines five different processes used within the EU-funded Active Access project, which aimed to encourage cycling and especially walking for short trips, walking audits, stakeholder exchange workshop, shadowing, analysis of best practice and overall participation within the project. The processes are analysed under a framework for policy transfer (Dolowitz and Marsh, 2000). Quantitative and qualitative analysis of questionnaires completed by the project partners focuses on how effective those involved perceived the different methods of transfer. The results presented in the paper illustrate that some methods of policy transfer are perceived to be more effective in delivering the same message than others. Insight is also given with regard to the cultural barriers that exist for such knowledge transfer. The implications for the design of future multi-national projects in order to maximise effective policy transfer, is discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a dataset of health plans representing over 10 million Americans annually between 1998 and 2006, we find that the most common set of tort reforms during this period reduces premiums of employer-sponsored self-insured health plans by 2.1%. Of the four individual reforms comprising this set, caps on noneconomic damages and collateral source reforms have the greatest impact. We do not find reductions in premiums for fully insured plans, which in our sample are almost entirely Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Further analysis reveals that self-insured HMOs are also unresponsive to reforms. Taken together, these findings suggest that HMOs reduce defensive medicine, even absent reform. The results are the first direct evidence that tort reform reduces healthcare costs in aggregate; prior research has largely focused on particular medical conditions.

It is only by viewing both man's dignity and his social nature that we include the full nature of the human being. In CST wealth is understood based on its role in promoting authentic human development. Wealth is a gift from God, with humans participating in its creation, and its creation, distribution, and its use must be carried out in a manner that respects God's law (justice and charity). Furthermore, man should never place wealth above God or above humans. Those who control wealth have special responsibilities with regards to their use of it; thus the right of private property is always restricted by the social responsibility to use it towards the common good. The goal must be the development of the whole person and all people. Wealth is socially created and thus must be distributed, at least partially, among the entire community. Economic development needs to be grounded in social justice and its two co-principles, charity and justice. Grounding economic development in the authentic development of the person means placing the people of the poor countries at the center of their development drama, both as the leading actors and as the directors.","[Clark, Charles M.

However, our results also show that the improved performance of specific inventors in a multinational corporation subsidiary does not translate to broader subsidiary-level capabilities at innovation.

First, the user learns about the internal spatial code of the system to achieve white-box-transparency.

Then, a dominance principle is often invoked whenever applicable: whenever an option x is better than an option y in terms of some attribute and no worse than y in terms of any other attributes, x is judged to be better than y. If, however, this dominance principle is not applicable, then the decision maker determines the relative importance between the identified evaluative attributes, consults with contextual features of the options under consideration, and makes a decision.

A number of companies have launched new products touting fiber. Critics express concern that the increased interest in fiber as a marketing claim is not necessarily a good thing for consumers because many companies are using isolated fiber that does not have all the health benefits as naturally occurring fiber. This research examines whether consumers understand information related to fiber claims by specifically examining their perceptions of the nutrition level and health benefits of products with these claims. Additionally, consumption frequency of these products and consumer knowledge about fiber is assessed.

In January 2006, the Victorian Government introduced a 'congestion levy' on long-stay, off-street car parking spaces within inner Melbourne, as a means of reducing peak-hour traffic congestion. This study provides an overview of the congestion levy and examines how the levy was passed onto users in the period immediately following its introduction. Specifically, it asks the question do long stay parkers pay the Melbourne Congestion Levy since if they do not pay the levy it is unlikely to achieve the stated levy aims. The paper finds that between December 2005 and June 2008, early-bird parking prices in commercial off-street car parks increased in real terms by 11%-17% above their pre-levy level. This increase covered only 40%-60% of the total cost of the levy. Further data collected in 2009 suggests that between June 2008 and April 2009, early-bird parking prices dropped, such that by April 2009, early-bird parking prices may have increased by as little as 8% above December 2005 prices-representing just 30% of the full levy. Therefore, the study finds that although long-stay parking charges in commercial car parks have increased in real terms since the introduction of the levy, the scale of the increase suggests that some of the cost of the levy is being borne by short-stay users and the parking operators themselves. The paper also finds that across all off-street parking facilities within inner Melbourne, a majority of drivers have their parking fees paid for by their employers. These findings suggest that the way in which the levy is being implemented by parking providers is undermining the stated purpose of the levy and may be limiting its effectiveness in changing travel behaviour. The key recommendation of the paper is therefore to develop a closer link between the levy and its intended target in order to obtain the required policy outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The Case of the 1990 Redistricting,JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PARTISAN BIAS; MINORITY; LEGISLATORS,"Conventional wisdom and empirical academic research conclude that creating majority-black districts decreases black representation by increasing conservatism in Congress. However, this research generally suffers from three limitations: too low a level of aggregation, lack of a counterfactual, and failure to account for the endogeneity of the creation of majority-minority districts. I compare congressional delegations from states that during the 1990 redistricting were under greater pressure to create majority-minority districts with those under lesser pressure using a difference-in-differences framework. I find no evidence that the creation of majority-minority districts leads to more conservative House delegations. In fact, point estimates, although largely statistically insignificant, indicate that states that increased their shares of majority-black districts saw their delegations grow increasingly liberal. I find similar results for majority-Latino districts in the Southwest. Thus, I find no evidence for the common view that majority-minority districts decrease minority representation in Congress.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Washington, E (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0955098] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,34,10,19,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

CLV measures give an indication of the profit-generating potential of customers, and provide a key business tool for the customer management process. The performances of existing approaches are unsatisfactory in multi-service financial environments because of the high degree of heterogeneity in customer behaviour. We propose an adaptive segmentation approach which involves the identification of neighbourhoods using a similarity measure defined over a predictive variable space. The set of predictive variables is determined during a cross-validation procedure through the optimisation of rank correlations between the observed and predicted revenues. The future revenue is forecast for each customer using a predictive probability distribution based on customers exhibiting behavioural characteristics similar to previous periods. The model is developed and implemented for a UK retail bank, and is shown to perform well in comparison to other benchmark models. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.

The characteristics of the new economic structure and the changes in demand for labour are important in the dispersal of the benefits of competitiveness among the different social groups. Several issues that shape the labour markets, such as education, gender, division of labour and the social organisation of work, are important in redefining the impacts of economic restructuring on the income and well-being of the different social groups. The aim of this paper is to discuss the role of social capital in the adaptation of individuals to the conditions imposed by the recent economic changes and restructuring while also revealing other impacts of this process on the people.

Within this framework, the judge excludes evidence in order to incentivize the jury to focus on other, more probative evidence.

The recent, and ongoing, economic crisis brings new questions and urgency to these debates. This paper examines whether and how the economic crisis might be understood as a crisis of neoliberalism and what the implications might be for environmental quality and the dominance of neoliberal approaches to environmental governance. The paper attempts to delineate some of the major potential relationships between neoliberalism and environmental governance through this crisis. It argues that although such relationships are contingent and subject to political action, in the US context at least the ongoing economic crisis has resulted in a weakening of support for environmental protections, in a manner that does not fit with current claims of the post-political condition. The paper concludes by outlining several positive contributions critical geographers and other analysts of nature-society relations could make to challenging the current dominance of neoliberal policies in environmental management.","Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"McCarthy, J (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",JaMcCarthy@clarku.edu,,,,,,,62,39,44,0,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Such systems may approximately accord with economically efficient pricing. The reason is that zones can vary with size and location so that prices can approximately reflect the social marginal costs of journeys.

In this paper we hope to be able to demonstrate that such a complicated zone systems can be substantially simplified while maintaining or even improving economic efficiency. We describe how the zone fare structure in the Oslo region can be improved, but also implementation difficulties including distribution issues, etc. in the political process.

Specifically, we calculate the rate of return and the volatility of return for two markets and estimate the serial correlation and co-movement of the two markets. We find that the average rate of return in Shanghai is much higher than that in New York while Shanghai stock prices are more volatile than New York stock prices. Further, we find that Shanghai stock prices are positively serially correlated while New York stock prices are negatively serially correlated in terms of auto regression of the rate of return. In the multivariate regressions, we find that there is little evidence to show that either the rate of return in Shanghai would affect the rate of return in New York or the rate of return in New York would affect the rate of return in Shanghai. It suggests that the two markets are not integrated.

Different authors evaluate and interpret factors affecting creativity differently. Consequently, the problem how to identify and evaluate which of the approaches fully reflects the situation arises. The present article deals with these problems by combining the approaches of different authors from the aspects of identification and evaluation of factors affecting creativity. The aim of the article is to develop an evaluation system for factors affecting creativity in the Lithuanian Armed Forces. In an attempt to identify and evaluate factors affecting creativity, expert and multi-criteria methods for evaluation were applied. A multi-level system for the evaluation of factors affecting creativity, that creates preconditions favourable for the identification of factors affecting creativity (by means of the method of determination of the significance of criteria), more objective evaluation of factors affecting creativity and development of suggestions for the stimulation of creativity, was suggested.","[Raudeliuniene, Jurgita; Meidute, Ieva] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Business Technol, Fac Business Management, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Martinaitis, Giedrius] Gen Jonas Zemaitis Mil Acad Lithuania, Master Management & Business Adm, LT-10322 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,"Raudeliuniene, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Business Technol, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",ljurgita.raudeliuniene@vgtu.lt; ieva.meidute@vgtu.lt; giedrius.martinaitis@mil.lt,"du, guanglei/A-9003-2014; Raudeliuniene, Jurgita/E-7844-2017; Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva/AAD-6877-2019","Raudeliuniene, Jurgita/0000-0003-4003-0856; Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva/0000-0003-0435-7632",,,,,60,11,12,0,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Data and information on the variation of innovation sources in the firm's innovation process are analysed by using the sectoral innovation system (SIS) framework. The resource of innovation for the automotive industry in Indonesia diverged from individual to organizational actors both from internal and external resources. First, the innovation resource mostly came from the internal organization of the firm. Second, the external resource of innovation in the Indonesian automotive industry mainly came from competitors that stimulated the creation of new products in sharp market competition. Third, the role of university and public research institutions as external resources of innovation in the Indonesian automotive industry was small. Fourth, the innovative public research institutions have shown the potential to become external resources of innovation for local automotive firms. Fifth, innovation cooperation between industry and public research institutions was linked by research and development (R&D) matching grants provided by the government. Sixth, support by the public research institution to the innovative industry occurred in the form of technical assistance. For the future development of the automotive industry in Indonesia, the study has drawn two policy implications: first, concrete steps are needed to encourage universities and public research institutions to help the development of the local automotive industry in Indonesia; and, second, attractive stimulations are needed to spur innovation through R&D activity inside the local automotive industry.","[Aminullah, Erman] Indonesian Inst Sci LIPI, Ctr Sci & Technol Dev Studies, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Adnan, Ricardi S.] Univ Indonesia, Fac Social Sci & Polit, Jakarta, Indonesia",National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI); University of Indonesia,"Aminullah, E (通讯作者)，Indonesian Inst Sci LIPI, Ctr Sci & Technol Dev Studies, Jakarta, Indonesia.",aminullahe@yahoo.com,"adnan, ricardi/HII-6569-2022",,,,,,14,10,10,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The results reveal that the average estimated value was 12.6 percent, which on average is below the average registered unemployment rate. The dynamics of the estimated NAIRU points to the ability of the NAIRU to reveal underlying structural misbalances in a national economy. Specifically, the approaching crises effect has been detected, as well as previously documented inflationary pressures, thereby confirming the potential usefulness of the NAIRU estimation for economic policy decision making process in Croatia.","Inst Econ Zagreb, Dept Econ Growth Econ Policy & Convergence, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Botric, V (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Zagreb, Dept Econ Growth Econ Policy & Convergence, Trg JF Kennedy 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",vbotric@eizg.hr,,"Botric, Valerija/0000-0001-5482-7490",,,,,64,6,6,0,11,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

We use a difference-in-differences approach, exploiting the fact that the reforms were targeted at low-income households. The reforms were likely to differentially affect the fertility of women in couples and single women because of the opportunity cost effects of the welfare-to-work element.

International transit services forms approximately a half of the services export in Latvia. For more accurate and complete assessment of the international transit services export contribution to the national economy, is necessary to develop the methodology for calculating this contribution. The objective of the paper is to identify which theoretical models of transit services assessment can be used to assess the impact of international transit services export on Latvian GDP. This analysis can be useful in the development and planning of transit-related projects, as well as in the transport sector development in general. International transit is the part of transport and communications sector in Latvia that was 12.5% of Latvian GDP in 2010. Latvian international transit services consists of seaports, railways, road transport, warehousing and customs brokerage, logistics centers, as well as shipping agents, forwarding agents and petroleum and petroleum product pipeline operator services. The turnover of Latvia's seaports is made approximately 90% of transit freight. Approximately 85% of all transported freight carried by railway through Latvia territory is transit freight, mainly from Russia and Belarus to the ports of Latvia (East - West transit corridor).

According to a long-standing literature on clusters, industrial districts, local production systems and regional innovation systems, geographical proximity between innovation partners is considered a precondition for inter-organizational collaborations: proximity is said to facilitate trust, the transfer of tacit knowledge and the intensity of interactions. This article investigates the importance of geographical proximity for R&D collaborations between biotech firms and their innovation partners. Are geographically close innovation partners likely to collaborate more intensely? Studies of the Flemish biotech industry shed light on this question. Regression analyses combined with qualitative interview data reveal that geographical proximity has become less important for inter-organizational collaborations. Owing to lower communication and transportation costs, innovation partners can easily collaborate even when they are not situated close to each other. This leads us to conclude that globalization transforms inter-organizational collaborations.","[Herrmann, Andrea Monika; Moors, Ellen] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Herrmann, Andrea Monika] Columbia Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res & Policy, New York, NY USA; [Taks, Janne Louise] Agr & Innovat, The Hague, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Columbia University,"Herrmann, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.m.herrmann@uu.nl,"Herrmann, Andrea M./M-9267-2013; Moors, Ellen H.M./N-1785-2013",,,,,,43,21,21,0,102,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Regulation of legal representation of an entrepreneur is very vague and therefore it enables variety of legal and illegal applications. The same stands for a cumulation of posts of statutar body and a legal representative (for example a member of a board of representatives carrying out a post of general director of the same share company) or for carrying out a post of a member of a statutar body in labor relation.

Its main goal is to find answers to the following question: 'how can low-income economies in the world today be set on the track to sustained economic development for the immediate goal of reducing poverty and the long-run goal of catching up on the wealth of developed economies?' (Hayami and Godo, 2005: 2 [1]). Many answers to this fundamental question have been presented. We survey the central elements that characterize four important theoretical approaches in Development Economics, namely: (i) modernization theories; (ii) dependency theories; (iii) world-system theory; (iv) neoclassical counter-revolution. However, the old notion of economic development, which considers as its main goal the reduction of inequality in terms of per capita income, seems to be insufficient to cover the amplitude and complexity of development problems. Therefore, it is not surprising that the notion of development has been expanded through the consideration of new dimensions, with the adding of many adjectives to the word development - human, local and sustainable development being the most frequently mentioned. The main objective of this paper is to produce a concise survey of this range of contributions frequently analyzed separately. Together with the contributions of traditional development economics, these new development concepts - human, local and sustainable offer a theoretical wealth which, in their globality, allow a more appropriate understanding of the complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon of development.","[Moreira, Sandrina B.] Polytech Inst Setubal, ESCE IPS, Dept Econ & Management, Setubal, Portugal; [Moreira, Sandrina B.; Crespo, Nuno] BRU UNIDE Econ Res Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal; [Crespo, Nuno] Lisbon Univ Inst, ISCTE IUL, Dept Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico de Setubal; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,,sandrina.moreira@esce.ips.pt; nuno.crespo@iscte.pt,"Moreira, Sandrina B/C-5584-2011; Crespo, Nuno/AAG-9679-2019","Moreira, Sandrina B/0000-0003-2124-8366; Crespo, Nuno/0000-0002-6546-6325",,,,,44,0,0,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,428,440,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100040,0

Thus, the production of innovations becomes vital for national and regional economies. In 2011 Latvia ranked 27th in the EU in terms of innovation and this gives cause for concern. A Triple Helix (TH) model of interaction among universities (U), industry (I) and government (G) was worked out by H. Etzkowitz and L. Leydesdorff in mid 1990s. According to this model an innovation is an outcome of interaction among social coordination mechanisms: markets, knowledge production, and (public or private) governance. Three environments or functions are specified in the model: (1) wealth generation (industry), (2) novelty production (academia), and (3) public control (government). A single indicator of economic effect of TH model has not yet been created, therefore, currently the components are investigated and measured separately and then compared to identify the linear and nonlinear interaction and patterns. To measure the U-component the principles of bibliometrics and scientometrics are applied with related metering parameters - citation analysis, number of publications, citation indices, number of patents granted, etc. To measure the I-component (understood as a technology business that focuses on the introduction of high technology products in the industry) economic indicators are used, such as the number of high-tech enterprises, the volume of output of their new products, etc. At the junction of U and I components the performance of high-tech enterprises and start-ups, including university spin-offs, are measured and compared with economic indicators. The G-component makes decisions on national and local levels that affect the statistics of the first two components. The aim of the paper is to define the current status of Latvian local G-component in TH triadic structure and to find the points affecting the growth of regional competitiveness that can bring the maximum synergistic effect with minimum investment.","[Ozols, Andris; Ozola, Elena] Daugavpils Univ, Vienibas iela 13, LV-5400 Daugavpils, Latvia; [Eglitis, Janis] Rector Ventspils Univ Coll, LV-3601 Ventspils, Latvia",University of Daugavpils,,andris.a.ozols@gmail.com; janise@venta.lv; ozolaelena@inbox.lv,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,467,476,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100043,0

Furthermore, the evolvement of pension structure to PPP-based rests on the evolutive process of its financial structure.

However, in the long run, the introduction of leniency increases the cartel dissolution rate and decreases cartel duration. As a consequence of the leniency program, the Korea Fair Trade Commission's enforcement on cartels has become more effective.

This issue becomes progressively more relevant, as reinforced transport infrastructure investment, albeit being recognized as an important condition for economic growth, may drive public finance into dire straits. Therefore, after consolidating a concept of FS for infrastructure investment and its evaluation parameters (solvency, liquidity and robustness), they are tested in a case study (Metropolitan System in Brasilia). The execution of this project and of the Aguas Claras neighborhood took place simultaneously. The study shows that the potential revenue from real estate would be enough to cover the public expenditures for the rail project and for the urban infrastructures of the township, meeting the solvency condition. However, it could not comply with the liquidity and the robustness conditions, due to incidents and management problems in its execution, which suffered several interruptions. The paper finishes with some lessons for the policy, requiring the mandatory and thorough analysis of economic and fiscal impacts of infrastructure investment projects, but also suggesting that they should be put together with other private and public investment projects which foster directly growth, so that their joint effect would result fiscally sustainable.

Recent research mainly focuses on two directions: one is the functional data analysis (FDA) approach, in which the price-time relationship is modeled by a smooth curve, and the other is the point process approach, which directly models the arrival process of bidders and bids. In this paper, a novel model for the bid arrival process using a self-exciting point process (SEPP) is proposed and applied to forecast auction prices. The FDA and point process approaches are linked together by using functional data analysis technique to describe the intensity of the bid arrival point process. Using the SEPP to model the bid arrival process, many stylized facts in online auction data can be captured. We also develop a simulation-based forecasting procedure using the estimated SEPP intensity and historical bidding increment. In particular, prediction interval for the terminal price of merchandise can be constructed. Applications to eBay auction data of Harry Potter books and Microsoft Xbox show that the SEPP model provides more accurate and more informative forecasting results than traditional methods.

With increasing attention to the negative sides of integration, an emergent issue is the role of disengagement from, and operation outside of, the GPNs of lead firms. Through the case of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where a selective and short-term strategic decoupling and subsequent recoupling has played a crucial role in the development of what is now the largest such industry in the Global South, this article explores how decoupling from GPNs may lead to positive development outcomes. The experience of India and the pharmaceutical industry shows that a sequence of decoupling and recoupling can be an alternative to strategic coupling as a route to economic development.","Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Horner, R (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",rhorner@clarku.edu,,"Horner, Rory/0000-0002-8730-2014",,,,,88,105,118,5,88,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We base the analyses on the supply of crime model in the human capital literature which emphasizes the importance of employment prospects in the legal and illegal labor markets. We find suggestive evidence that welfare reform decreased female arrests for property crimes (by 4-5%), but that it did not affect arrests for other types of crimes. The effects appear to be stronger in states with larger welfare caseload declines. As welfare reform policies are targeted to females, it is empirically validating that we do not find any substantively or statistically significant effects of welfare reform on crime among males. The findings point to broad-based work incentives and, by inference, employment as an important determinant of female property crime. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Focusing on components of welfare provisions and tax payments with noticeable differences across age and household status, we show that, based on a point forecast, the fiscal impact of changes in household structures amounts to an annual negative effect of 0.5% of GDP, and the effect of changes in age structures is forecast to worsen the public budget by 3.7% of GDP per year. While being subject to a considerable amount of uncertainty, the prospect of such a dramatic weakening of public finances is likely to trigger demands for welfare reforms characterized by a more individualized system of public transfer and tax payments, in addition to the measures that have already been taken to address the fiscal effects of population ageing.

Compared to advancement in travel demand modeling for passenger travel, however, current freight demand modeling methods are not yet in the adequate levels to assess increasingly complex and important planning and policy issues. Three most important players in freight demand modeling are (a) shippers, (b) planners, and (c) policy (decision) makers who have different objectives. Past research is limited in proposing a unified methodology to address the objective of each player and to assess performance of transportation networks under conditions to achieve such objectives. In this paper, freight demand modeling is designed to address each objective of the three players in a multimodal transportation network. A freight transportation model that combines three geographic scales national, state, and local is proposed and developed to capture different characteristics of short- and long-distance freight flows with a focus on state-level modeling in Maryland. Data for the model include freight flows by commodity and by Freight Analysis Framework (FAF) zones, which are further disaggregated to Statewide Modeling Zones in Maryland; a transportation network with detailed link level attributes; user costs in addition to all details needed for the travel demand model. In the modeling framework autos are simulated simultaneously with trucks in a multi-class user equilibrium traffic assignment. The results demonstrate the network performance and key information on travel characteristics for each player. The proposed tool can be used for freight travel demand modeling for analyzing impacts of policies at state, county and local levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Reasons why researchers continue to neglect complex sample-based variance are proposed and discussed, and example SAS and Stata code is offered to encourage adoption by the consumer research community.","[Nielsen, Robert B.] Univ Georgia, Dept Financial Planning Housing & Consumer Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Seay, Martin C.] Kansas State Univ, Sch Family Studies & Human Serv, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Kansas State University,"Nielsen, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Financial Planning Housing & Consumer Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",rnielsen@uga.edu; mseay@ksu.edu,"Nielsen, Robert B/F-4996-2010","Seay, Martin/0000-0003-1630-9056; Nielsen, Robert/0000-0003-2282-4900",,,,,29,13,21,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

To explain the antecedents of such differential access, we first argue that clustering gives rise to three knowledge-creation benefits: easier identification of potential knowledge partners with complementary knowledge, easier initiation of knowledge partnerships and increased effectiveness of knowledge partnerships. Subsequently, we develop a conceptual model and propositions that focus on a cluster firm's awareness of knowledge assets inside the cluster, attractiveness as a knowledge partner and ability to benefit from knowledge partnerships to explain differential access by firms to these three knowledge-creation benefits that clustering provides. This study highlights the theoretical significance of distinguishing externality-type benefits of technology clustering from benefits that firms need to actively pursue, and discusses implications for firms' location decisions.","[Arikan, Andac T.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Dept Management Programs, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Knoben, Joris] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Econ & Business Econ, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Arikan, AT (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Dept Management Programs, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",aarikan@fau.edu,"Knoben, Joris/ABB-4605-2020","Knoben, Joris/0000-0001-8603-8066",,,,,69,7,7,1,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Key economic variables are modeled jointly with principal components from a large time series panel of macroeconomic indicators using a multivariate unobserved components time series model. When the key economic variables are observed at a low frequency and the panel of macroeconomic variables is at a high frequency, we can use our approach for both nowcasting and forecasting purposes. Given a dynamic factor model as the data generation process, we provide Monte Carlo evidence of the finite-sample justification of our parsimonious and feasible approach. We also provide empirical evidence for a US macroeconomic dataset. The unbalanced panel contains quarterly and monthly variables. The forecasting accuracy is measured against a set of benchmark models. We conclude that our dynamic factor state space analysis can lead to higher levels of forecasting precision when the panel size and time series dimensions are moderate.

HOT lanes generally allow carpools to travel on the lane for free while charging a toll for single occupant vehicles (SOVs) to use the lane. In most cases these lanes were previously high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes where carpools traveled for free and SOVs were not allowed. Note that clean fueled SOVs were allowed in some cases. Thus carpoolers could now switch to being a SOV and still access the benefits of the HOT lane - for a toll. This may cause some carpools to break up and become SOVs, thus adding to the amount of traffic and emissions on the roadway. Carpooling on eight roadways with HOT lanes was examined. As best as possible, data on the number of carpools on the facility in the year before and the year after converting from HOV lanes to HOT lanes was examined. Overall, carpooling decreased on most of the corridors, stayed the same on a couple of corridors, and on the one corridor that added the HOT lanes (SR-91) carpooling increased. Despite these results it is still difficult to draw definitive conclusions as (a) carpool preference tends to vary by facility, (b) there were many exogenous factors also playing a role in the amount of carpooling, (c) there is inherent difficulty obtaining occupancy counts and those counts can fluctuate a great deal day to day and month to month. Overall though, it does appear that carpooling is often negatively impacted by converting a HOV lane to a HOT lane. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

After conducting an empirical analysis of different investment portfolios, e.g. Bank deposit, Treasury bond, and Equity in China, this paper reaches the following conclusions. Observing the strict limitation on quantity, the public equity ratio in portfolios of pension funds should be controlled below 20 %. To alleviate the Home Bias in investment, as well as to avoid the systematic risks intrinsic of the investing within a single country as China, some part of pension funds investment should be allowed to be invested into overseas markets. The constraints on public equity investment may be liberalized and the prudential person rule of pension investment in Common Law could be imported into pension legislation amendments when the Chinese stock market and legal system is more developed and going mature.","China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Ctr Law & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Political Science & Law,"Hu, JY (通讯作者)，China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Ctr Law & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jiyeh@cupl.edu.cn,,,,,,,28,3,3,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Understanding why some children are driven to school when walking is an option is important for future intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate demographic characteristics, parent/family level factors, attitudinal and psychosocial factors, route features, access to vehicles, and environmental factors which appear to influence the decision to drive children who live within a walkable distance from school in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), Canada. Computer-aided telephone interviews were conducted in 2009 with 1001 parents of children attending elementary school in the GTHA, Canada's largest urbanized region. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the household demographics, parent/family factors, attitudinal and psychosocial factors, route features, access to vehicles, and environmental factors (qualities of urban design) that predict driving among households less than 2 km away from school (n=529). In the GTHA, attitudes and psychosocial factors have a stronger role to play than the built environment in influencing driving behavior within close proximity to school. The introduction of built environment characteristics in the final regression model only explained an additional 4% of the variance in driving to school. To promote AST among drivers living within a walkable distance from school, non-infrastructure programs that provide adult supervision, such as Walking School Bus Schemes, may be a more powerful strategy to alleviate safety concerns while potentially reducing the parental time costs of escorting the child, than capital projects targeting changes to the built environment.

Accurate forecasts of demand at the individual household-level, or of small aggregations of households, can improve the peak demand reduction brought about through such devices by helping to plan the most appropriate charging and discharging cycles. However, before such methods can be developed, validation measures which can assess the accuracy and usefulness of forecasts of the volatile and noisy household-level demand are required. In this paper we introduce a new forecast verification error measure that reduces the so-called double penalty effect, incurred by forecasts whose features are displaced in space or time, compared to traditional point-wise metrics, such as the Mean Absolute Error, and p-norms in general. The measure that we propose is based on finding a restricted permutation of the original forecast that minimises the point-wise error, according to a given metric. We illustrate the advantages of our error measure using half-hourly domestic household electrical energy usage data recorded by smart meters, and discuss the effect of the permutation restriction.

We propose a novel algorithm that aims to mitigate the importance of model selection, while increasing the accuracy. Multiple time series are constructed from the original time series, using temporal aggregation. These derivative series highlight different aspects of the original data, as temporal aggregation helps in strengthening or attenuating the signals of different time series components. In each series, the appropriate exponential smoothing method is fitted and its respective time series components are forecast. Subsequently, the time series components from each aggregation level are combined, then used to construct the final forecast. This approach achieves a better estimation of the different time series components, through temporal aggregation, and reduces the importance of model selection through forecast combination. An empirical evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, especially for long-term forecasts. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters.

This article explores these high-pressure selling techniques in the context of the invited in-home selling (IIHS) of educational software and the consequences in terms of consumer vulnerability and consumer protection policy. We conclude by drawing upon earlier discourse in this field to argue that policy-makers, consumer advocates and businesses consider a holistic, multi-dimensional contextualization of consumer vulnerability as a means to consider consumer protection in this, and other contexts.","[Harrison, Paul; Massi, Marta; Chalmers, Kathryn] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia; [Massi, Marta] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Deakin University; Carleton University,"Harrison, P (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia.",paul.harrison@deakin.edu.au; martamassi@yahoo.it; kjchalmers@gmail.com,,,,,,,75,4,4,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

In 2001, Morocco replaced a company law from 19th-century France with modern standards of corporate accountability; this reform was very similar to reforms implemented in many developing countries at about the same time. I evaluate the impact of that reform upon manufacturing firms' access to bank credit, using panel data to test the effect upon bank overdraft provision of a firm's legal obligations (i.e., the firm's choice of the more onerous SA status rather than the less onerous SARL). I find that the reform induced many SA firms to switch to SARL, and that-relative to firms remaining in the SA status-this caused a significant and substantial withdrawal of overdraft facilities. I show that this result is robust to firm's fixed effects and to the choice of explanatory variables, and I consider heterogeneous effects across different firms. I conclude that the reform may have been counterproductive in several important respects.

It is a sensitive indicator to changes in environmental, social and economical conditions and is commonly used to express the degree of overall development of a society or a country's quality of life. In CEE countries, infant mortality, although it decreased in the past 20 years, is still high compared to other EU countries, since there are groups of countries with specific issues and for which it reflects the state of their economic and social development. One of EU goals is to reduce the level of this indicator and GEE countries must make a concerted effort in this regard The paper's objective is the empirical evaluation of the relationship between infant mortality and socio-economic conditions for 8 EU countries from CEE which have an infant mortality rate (IMR) larger that the EU27 average. We use econometric modelling for panel data to identify the main determinants of infant mortality for these countries and to test if the decrease of IMR is determined not only by economic growth but also by social and health factors. The results support, on one hand, the assumption of a negative impact of the level of economic development, and on the other hand it indicates the presence of specific determinant factors for this group of European countries, such as abortion rate, unemployment or average age of female at first birth.","[Asandului, Mircea; Pintilescu, Carmen; Jemna, Danut; Viorica, Daniela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Asandului, M (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Carol I Bld 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",mircea.asandului@uaic.ro; carmen.pintilescu@uaic.ro; danut.jemna@uaic.ro; dana.viorica@gmail.com,"Viorica, Daniela/AAE-9954-2019; Viorica, Elena-Daniela/HZM-3650-2023; Asandului, Mircea/A-2845-2017","Viorica, Elena-Daniela/0000-0002-5301-7776;",,,,,18,4,4,0,39,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

How a family can influence its own business and what is meant by satisfaction with financial performance has been examined on the basis of the extant literature. Questionnaires have been created regarding the influence of family and satisfaction with financial performance. Afterwards, the relationship between influence and satisfaction was examined within the scope of a proposed model. Data were collected from the family businesses located in the organized industrial zones of Istanbul, Turkey. The influence of family and the satisfaction of the top manager family member with financial performance were found to be based on five and two key factors, respectively. In view of the findings, although spouses of the family members within the family business did not influence satisfaction with profit or debt, they did cause a decrease in satisfaction with sales and operations. The involvement of family in the financial decisions along with the business successor also negatively affected satisfaction with debt, profit, sales, and operations. Although the founder of the business did not have a significant influence on the factors that affected satisfaction with financial performance, family members' loyalty to and harmony with the business positively affected satisfaction with financial performance. In conclusion, the influence of family has a weak inverse relationship with top manager family member's financial performance satisfaction.","Istanbul AREL Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Arel University,"Ayranci, E (通讯作者)，Istanbul AREL Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey.",xonox@mynet.com,"AYRANCI, Evren/AAI-1304-2019",,,,,,59,4,4,3,24,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Based on comparison of progress of the precedence of transport infrastructure at various time intervals and development of precedence in the infrastructure funding are sought consensus and disproportion in the precedence. Development of transport is determined by the state inspection infrastructure concepts and strategies for transport policy. These concepts are continually updated. Based on changes in the design there can be determined another precedence. Precedence in transport infrastructure may be affected by various combinations of selected segments of transport routes. For this reason, different precedence may exist. To determine the precedence it is important do correct choice of threshold values of important qualitative and quantitative attributes. Based on combination of values for these attributes are compared development of the precedence in the past and there are searched consensus in the precedence of development infrastructure, in the precedence of concepts changes and in the precedence infrastructure funding. Setting appropriate thresholds and mutual functional dependencies among individual attributes are predicted requirements for infrastructure funding.

This implies that an employee simultaneously has multiple memberships in these project teams, a phenomenon known as multiple team membership (MTM). Previous, predominantly theoretical studies have acknowledged the impacts that MTM has on performance but very scarce empirical evidence exists. The aim of this study is to provide empirical support for some of these theoretical claims using data collected from 435 team members in 85 engineering project teams in South Africa. Results show that MTM has an inverted-U shaped relationship with individual performance and a positive linear relationship with team performance. When a person is working in multiple project teams simultaneously, he/she may encounter more diverse sources of ideas across all teams and thus enhances his/her innovative performance. However, as the number of MTM increases, the negative effect of task switching and fragmented attention will negatively impact on individual performance. At the project team level, a large number of MTM in a focal team allows the team members to integrate diverse sources of knowledge and resources into the focal team. This study also found that individuals' emotional skills and cognitive skills impact on individual performance. It is recommended to programme and project portfolio managers, who often are involved in scheduling human resources to multiple projects, to acknowledge both the positive and negative impacts of MTM on performance. Moreover, in high MTM situations, project team members with high emotional and cognitive skills should be selected.","Univ Pretoria, Grad Sch Technol Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Chan, KY (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Grad Sch Technol Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"Chan, Kai-Ying/0000-0001-5809-5215",,,,,67,9,14,5,91,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The framework incorporates certain characteristics of national business systems, particular inter-organizational ties developed with transnational or local carriers, and the potential absorptive capacity of the local organizations. By this way, it includes the effects of temporal interactions between different adoption decisions. The components of the framework are operationalized and tested within the Turkish setting by using the adoption data of three different management innovations: TQM, six sigma and lean production. The data is collected from a sample of 375 large-sized firms using a telephone-based interview protocol. While the findings provide satisfactory support for the framework as a whole, they also call attention to the relative differences in the explanatory power of each factor in accounting for the adoption of particular innovations. Variations among the explanatory factors can be attributed to the differences between the life-cycles of TQM, six sigma and lean production as well as to the relative divergence of their conceptual framing.","Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Engn Management, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Erçek, M (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Engn Management, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",ercekme@itu.edu.tr,"Ercek, Mehmet/X-9275-2019","Ercek, Mehmet/0000-0002-5212-7121",,,,,66,4,4,1,30,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Families that are relatively large compensate for reduced per-child resources by increasing maternal labour supply.","[Fitzsimons, Emla; Malde, Bansi] Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E 7AE, England; [Malde, Bansi] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"Fitzsimons, E (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, 7 Ridgmount St, London WC1E 7AE, England.",emla_f@ifs.org.uk,,"Malde, Bansi/0000-0003-1323-3383","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G040923/1, ES/F042825/1, ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1, ES/F042825/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,51,19,20,2,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Do system-level features like the economic situation or quality of governance matter? Our findings from a multilevel analysis indicate that, paradoxically, a political system's effectiveness and legitimacy undermine the very norms on which it depends for both effectiveness and legitimation. In well-functioning states, citizens' attachment to civic norms declines. As for the effect of welfare policies, there is no crowding-out effect in the sense that if the state provides for citizens who are less well off, solidarity among citizens was reduced.

Conclusions are as follows: R&D investment is non-significantly pro-cyclical without financial constraint variable, but is significantly pro-cyclical once introducing financial constraint variable. Financial constraint dummy variable plays a positive role in adjusting the relation of R&D investment and operating income growth.

The findings from the contingency analyses reveal some interesting trends. The results show that social capital can be divided into two dimensions: commercial relation capital and institutional social capital. Under the influence of different combinations of social capital and governance objects, governance subjects have different selections of relation governance and power governance in terms of channel governance. In addition, the impact of social capital on organizational performance differs between relation governance and power governance.

Compare to Western Europe, entrepreneurial behavior in new EU states considerably differs in many ways. In spite of almost 20 years of political and economic transformation, there are big groups of entrepreneurs involved in rent seeking, semi-legal and shadow activities (Aidis, Van Praag, 2007), or as it is argued by Baumol (Baumol, 1990; Griffiths et al., 2012), they are unproductive entrepreneurs. The case study of Land Use Change Business reveals some unique aspects of unproductive entrepreneurial behavior in post-transition Lithuania. The findings suggest that turbulent transition period (1990-2004) created new path dependences and situations when new post-Soviet and old Soviet institutional settings were melted into a unique context. The paper analyses how in spite of formal institutions improvement and attempts to change entrepreneurial culture, new unproductive entrepreneurial opportunities persist to emerge. The findings prove that land use change entrepreneurs creatively adapt to the situation after Lithuania joined EU, and immediately identify the gray area where two different institutional settings join together to produce unique entrepreneurial opportunity.","Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Policy & Management, Inst Publ Adm, LT-10101 Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University,"Zidonis, Z (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Policy & Management, Inst Publ Adm, Valakupiu Str 5, LT-10101 Vilnius, Lithuania.",zzidonis@mruni.eu,,"Zidonis, Zilvinas/0000-0001-7884-8894",,,,,44,1,1,0,13,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

They also have a common interest in maximizing corporate profits, as this determines the resources available to the firm as a whole. Both goals are powerful motivators but can at times conflict: while the amount of resources available to the firm depends on corporate performance, divisional funding depends upon the division's performance relative to the rest. We propose a model in which organizational form is endogenous, divisions compete for corporate resources, and managers have implicit incentives. We show that organizational design can help companies influence their divisional managers' potentially conflicting goals. Our analysis relates the firm's organizational structure to the source of incentives (external vs. internal), the nature of the incentives (competition vs. cooperation), the level of corporate diversification, the development of the capital market, and to industry and firm characteristics.","[de Motta, Adolfo] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada; [Ortega, Jaime] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, E-28903 Getafe, Madrid, Spain",McGill University; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"de Motta, A (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada.",adolfo.demotta@mcgill.ca; jaime.ortega@uc3m.es,"Ortega, Jaime/G-3103-2012","Ortega, Jaime/0000-0001-5434-0949",,,,,51,2,3,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Private sector participation in infrastructure investment has gained popularity in recent times because of scarcity of resources at the public sector, and because of the ability of the private sector to build, operate, maintain such facilities, and share future uncertainties. In such cases, there are multiple entities each with different objectives in the project. Traditional techniques used to determine feasibility of such projects and do not consider two critical elements. These are the need (1) to identify major entities involved in these projects and their individual objectives, and (2) the importance of analyzing measures of effectiveness of each entity in a multi-objective context. A framework is proposed to address these issues along with a set of relaxation policies to reflect the nature and level of participation by the entities. First, the feasibility of each single entity perspective is determined and next, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) is proposed reflecting the perspectives of all entities. The MOO results in pareto-optimal solutions to serve as tradeoff between the participation levels of the multiple entities. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used as a tool to narrow down number of options for decision makers for further consideration. AFIP and MOO are integrated to determine the feasibility of strategies from multi-entity perspectives. The framework is examined on the proposed multibillion dollar international river crossing connecting the city of Detroit in the U.S. and the city of Windsor in Canada. This methodology provides a decision making process tool for large-scale transportation infrastructure investment consisting of multiple entities.

To define parking policy properly, its effects must be estimated and predicted. In this paper, based on stated preference data and using a logistic regression, a model to predict the effects of introducing or changing the parking price and time limitation was developed. The results show that parking prices affect car usage, while time limitations determine the type of parking used (on-street or off-street). A positive finding for policy makers is that users with work are more sensitive to parking measures than are other users, so parking measures can be used to manage user categories. Although there is a concern that parking policy can jeopardise the attractiveness and efficiency of a zone, the results show that a very small number of users would give up travelling into the zone.

Available data show that the gap between supply and demand in parking has enlarged, while most city governments have little experience and are institutionally unprepared for the proper planning, regulation, and management of parking.

The method is first to simulate the effects on labour supply over the adult lifecycle using a calibrated dynamic utility maximisation model of a representative couple, using data drawn from waves of a longitudinal survey for Australia. Then using the same data, the effect of family benefits and the child care subsidy on couples' hours worked is econometrically estimated. The 50% child care subsidy was found to increase the average couple's labour supply by the equivalent of 0.75 to 1 h per week whilst children are of pre-school age, and less on average over the couple's working lifetime. The cash benefit changes were found to have a negligible effect on labour supply.","[Guest, Ross] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Econ Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Qld 4111, Australia; [Parr, Nick] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Ctr Workforce Futures, Dept Mkt & Management, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Macquarie University,"Guest, R (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Econ Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Qld 4111, Australia.",r.guest@griffith.edu.au,"Parr, Nicholas/G-3985-2012","Parr, Nicholas/0000-0002-7539-912X; Guest, Ross/0000-0002-7171-3054",,,,,72,13,14,1,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Recently, outcome tests based on economic models have contributed to the legal discourse. However, it is not readily obvious if and to what extent they also pertain to European jurisdiction, where racial profiling has only as of late stirred up controversy.

The models are tailored to identify racial prejudice but are unfit to provide evidence of statistical discrimination, reflecting their adaption to the current US legal approach.

Most of the underlying mechanisms take place within firms, but only a handful of organization-level studies have been conducted. We contribute to this underexplored literature by using a unique sample of 7,600 firms to investigate links among cultural diversity, innovation, entrepreneurship, and sales strategies in London businesses between 2005 and 2007. London is one of the world's major cities, with a rich cultural diversity that is widely seen as a social and economic asset. Our data allowed us to distinguish owner/partner and wider workforce characteristics, identify migrant/minority-headed firms, and differentiate firms along multiple dimensions. The results, which are robust to most challenges, suggest a small but significant diversity bonus for all types of London firms. First, companies with diverse management are more likely to introduce new product innovations than are those with homogeneous top teams. Second, diversity is particularly important for reaching international markets and serving London's cosmopolitan population. Third, migrant status has positive links to entrepreneurship. Overall, the results provide some support for claims that diversity is an economic asset, as well as a social benefit.","[Nathan, Max] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Nathan, Max] Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Lee, Neil] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Lancaster University,"Nathan, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.a.nathan@lse.ac.uk; n.lee1@lancs.ac.uk,,"Nathan, Max/0000-0002-4617-4300","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1, ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,98,145,172,3,165,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

While the classical view was that firms will have an incentive to unshroud, Gabaix and Laibson (2006) show that there exist constellations in which firms prefer to leave the market shrouded. Building on that model I introduce a more strategic and long-term dimension of unshrouding which turns out to fundamentally alter the underlying incentives to unshroud. In particular, I show that there exists an incentive to unshroud that stems from differences in add-on profitability and that it is dependent on parameter constellations whether a more profitable or a less profitable firm will want to unshroud.","Univ Bonn, Bonn Grad Sch Econ, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Dahremöller, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Bonn Grad Sch Econ, Kaiserstr 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",dahremoeller@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,12,16,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Firms can be asymmetric: they may differ in the product's intrinsic value and may also differ in their chosen level of greenness. We examine the choice of greenness and the implications of various policy interventions. We show that (i) the choices of product greenness are strategic substitutes, (ii) the high-intrinsic quality firm produces the greener product, (iii) the low-quality firm's greenness may increase with the cost of its provision or decrease with consumer willingness to pay for it, (iv) a minimum quality standard (MQS) leads the greener firm to lower its environmental quality and can even reduce average quality, (v) greenness is underprovided even if consumers fully internalize the externality, and (v) an MQS can reduce welfare if the greenness of the high-quality firm exceeds the MQS, even when environmental quality is underprovided. The effects of policy interventions on profits differ qualitatively across polices and firms: A firm that lobbies for one type of intervention may lobby against another similar one, and a firm may lobby for an intervention while its competitor may lobby against it.

Some argue that antitrust law merely serves the purpose of economic growth, while others have a broader perspective on the function of antitrust, maintaining that the prevention of economic concentration is an important means to promote democratization and democratic stability. This article seeks to test the empirical assumptions of this debate. Using panel data of 154 states from 1960 to 2005, it analyzes whether antitrust law actually has a positive effect on democracy and economic growth. The article finds that antitrust law has a positive effect on the level of GDP per capita and economic growth after ten years. However, there is no significant positive effect on the level of democracy. It is suggested that these results might be due to the current structure of existing antitrust laws, which are designed to promote economic efficiency rather than to prevent economic concentration.","[Petersen, Niels] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Petersen, Niels] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",New York University; Max Planck Society,"Petersen, N (通讯作者)，NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA.",petersen@coll.mpg.de,,,,,,,71,20,21,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The decision about the extent of airport regulation is based on an economic analysis of market power, which is done in two steps. The first step involves defining the relevant markets the airport is operating on. This in turn is based on an economic analysis of the particular circumstances of the airport, and must be compatible with competition law. The second step consists of the evaluation of the airport's competitive position in all identified markets. Due to industry particularities, many diverse issues must be taken into account in this process, such as questions of upstream and downstream market interaction, airport congestion, peak-load pricing, or offsetting bargaining power. Many of these questions have been theoretically analyzed in the industrial organization literature, but have only rarely been applied in practical competition analysis with respect to airports. This paper builds a bridge between the theoretical insights and their practical application to airport regulation policy. We derive the principles for a sound economic analysis of the market power of airports, given the time and data constraints encountered in practice by the regulatory authorities and other involved parties, and propose a general framework for the analysis of market power of airports. We focus on hub airports, as the analysis of these gateways covers all the relevant issues, including countervailing power of the hub operator. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Mindful of a political threat from the labouring poor, successive governments have offered India's surplus populations' guaranteed work, first through the Employment Assurance Scheme (EAS) and more recently under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). This paper uses ethnographic and large-n datasets to examine how the EAS worked in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh; it also utilizes a preliminary dataset for NREGA in Madhya Pradesh. We show that understandings of the EAS were poor among intended beneficiaries in both states. We also show that the EAS did not work better for the rural poor in Madhya Pradesh than in Bihar, notwithstanding the existence of functioning panchayati Raj institutions in the former. Importantly, this calls into question aspects of a conventional decentralization agenda. Most significantly, the paper suggests that geographies of EAS fund flows illuminate the nature and workings of the local state. Distribution of EAS funds within districts and blocks is most uneven where allocative power is effectively monopolized by a regional political boss and/or is unchallenged by bureaucratic oversight mechanisms. We discuss how far the same problems might affect NREGA schemes notwithstanding the more effective information flows and accountability mechanisms that surround them.","[Corbridge, Stuart] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev ID, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Srivastava, Manoj] Govt Bihar, Patna 800001, Bihar, India",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Corbridge, S (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev ID, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.e.corbridge@lse.ac.uk; srivastm11@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,12,14,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We tested whether consumer investors' limited processing abilities account for biased return perceptions, as reported in the literature. Consumer investors' processing abilities were manipulated by varying the duration of information exposure time to a mutual fund advertisement. Experimental results suggest that a longer time spent by consumer investors learning about mutual fund characteristics resulted in reduced reliance on prior fund performance as a heuristic cue, which in turn resulted in an unbiased processing of mutual fund characteristics. In contrast, when consumer investors spent less time learning about mutual fund characteristics, prior fund performance significantly affected subsequent return expectations and argument persuasiveness of the mutual fund advertisement. These findings suggest that disclaimers warning that past performance does not guarantee future results are ineffective when consumer investors have limited attention and lower processing abilities.","[Huesser, Andreas; Wirth, Werner] Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Hüsser, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",a.huesser@ipmz.uzh.ch; w.wirth@ipmz.uzh.ch,,,,,,,65,9,10,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

This model assumes that the lifespan of a hurricane can be described as a semi-Markov process and also it allows the more realistic assumption of time event dependence to be taken into consideration. The elapsed time between two consecutive events (waiting time distributions) is modeled through a best-fitting procedure on empirical data. We then determine the transition probabilities and so-called crossing states probabilities.

One unexplored mechanism involves the possibility that the disutility of punishment is affected by both the actual punishment an offender receives and the sentence that he thinks could have been given, a psychological effect known as framing. We test for framing effects in punishment by exploiting a legal change in Maryland that altered recommended, but not actual, sentences for a subset of offenders. Using an individual-level data set of convictions, incarceration, and arrests, we find that longer recommended sentences are associated with higher rates of recidivism, conditional on actual punishment. Our results suggest that large discrepancies between the bark and bite of the criminal justice system may make incarceration less effective at reducing crime. They're not seeing that at a time when I spent twenty-six and a half years in [some] of the world's worst penitentiaries ... I only did one-third of every sentence I ever had.

Relocating firms increased the likelihood of incumbent failure in destination regions, a pattern that differs sharply from new entrants.

All other attributes being equal, rational consumers expect to recover this price premium in fuel savings over the vehicle lifetime. Since many owners sell their vehicle after three to five years, resale prices should also reflect fuel savings. Here, we employ data from used vehicle auctions in 2008-2009 for paired alternative and conventional vehicles to compare the difference in resale prices to the expected fuel savings and the five-year cost of ownership expressed as the net present value (NPV). To estimate resale prices,we group the auction data by season and by year. We then correct for accumulated odometer mileage, which accounts for most of the variability in prices. At five years, higher fuel economy vehicles retain a higher proportion of their initial price than conventional options. The ratio of the resale value to the initial purchase price increases at higher fuel prices. For the paired HEV - conventional passenger vehicles, the difference in resale prices approximates the expected future fuel savings. The price difference for TDI diesel-gasoline pairs exceeds the fuel savings; other attributes such as performance or prestige may account for this difference. Regardless of the mechanism, the fuel savings and higher resale values compensate for the price premium for the TDI diesel and HEV options. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a model that formalizes certain previously neglected elements of Galbraith's argument, and shows that upstream price concessions may lead to lower downstream prices. In this model, a large retail chain store with countervailing power plays one large supplier off against another to win lower prices. An indirect effect of these interactions is that small retailers also pay lower prices, although not as low as the chain. Finally, competition among the retailers drives retail prices lower. The retail-price-restraining effect of the chain is stronger than the effect that is produced by the entry of an additional supplier.","Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Mills, DE (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",mills@virginia.edu,"Mills, David/GXF-1821-2022",,,,,,33,0,0,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Recent trends in electronic music have been based on both the valorization of global tastes and of local specialities in performance and production. Depending on musical styles and market niches, local scenes have become important forces behind heterogeneous globalocal markets. At the same time, technological change and the virtualization of music production and distribution contribute to increasingly differentiated configurations of value creation. It is therefore necessary to reconstruct theoretically and empirically the new interplay among the local music production, digital media markets, and virtual communities that are involved. On the basis of empirical explorations in a German hot spot of electronic club-music production (the city of Berlin), the article indentifies local interaction practice and constellations of stakeholders. The findings show that value creation in these rapidly changing production scenes has moved away from the large-scale distribution of producer-induced media to audience-induced live performance and interactive soundtrack production. This change involves the rising importance of cultural embeddings such as taste building, reputation building among artists and producers, and local community building. Starting from an open theoretical problematization of value creation with regard to fluid scenes and shifting modes of production, the results of first empirical reconstructions are taken as inputs to an evolving discussion on the configurations of value creation in consumer-based strands of music production.","[Lange, Bastian] Humboldt Univ, Georg Simmel Ctr Metropolitan Studies, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Buerkner, Hans-Joachim] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geog, D-14476 Golm, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Potsdam,"Lange, B (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Georg Simmel Ctr Metropolitan Studies, Unter der Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",Bastian.Lange@berlin.de; buerkner@uni-potsdam.de,"Lange, Bastian/AAM-9061-2020",,,,,,100,33,41,6,97,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The next year, fewer candidates ran for municipal office in the Kentucky suburbs most reliant on the Post, incumbents became more likely to win reelection, and voter turnout and campaign spending fell. These changes happened even though the Enquirer at least temporarily increased its coverage of the Post's former strongholds. Voter turnout remained depressed through 2010, nearly three years after the Post closed, but the other effects diminished with time. The authors exploited a difference-in-differences strategy and the fact that the Post's closing date was fixed 30 years in advance to rule out some noncausal explanations for their results.

The findings reveal that there is evidence of an OFDI-led trade hypothesis, particularly with regard to merchandise exports and imports, which is an indication OFDI opens important channels for intra-firm trade activities, home country sourcing and backward integration. However, there is no evidence of causality relationships between Singapore's OFDI and services trade because the purpose of such services is mainly to provide a market presence in the consuming country. As such, Singaporean multinationals are likely to outsource their services either from the host country services sector or from their own services-supporting subsidiaries that have been relocated abroad.

The enforcing party sets up a pre-committed fund and offers it as reward to another party to refrain from violation. If the violator turns down the reward, the enforcer can use the money in the fund for one purpose only to pay for punishment of the violator. The article shows that this scheme doubles the effect of funds invested in enforcement and allows the enforcer to stop violations that would otherwise be too costly to deter. It argues that reversible rewards could be used to bolster the enforcement of rights in selective areas of private and international law and could also be applied strategically in litigation in contexts where compliance incentives are otherwise weak.

The multinomial logit model is employed to estimate the relative influences of facility attributes on bicycle route choice behaviour, while the latent class model is adopted in order to better understand the differences in preferences. Preference heterogeneity is characterized by cyclist recreation specialization level. Using data collected from 232 recreational cyclists in Taiwan, the results indicate that bicycle facility attributes, such as basic facilities and, maintenance equipment, tourist information centers, and attractions exhibit significant effects on recreational cyclists' preferences. Cyclists with high levels of recreation specialization appear to be more likely to choose challenge and endurance routes than those with low recreational specialization.

An original analysis of the decision-making environment faced by telecommunications consumers identifies four specific properties of the market, of which rapid technological change is just one. The core argument is that this combination of properties, which is unique to telecommunications, is likely to foment decision-making biases established by behavioral economics. This central insight is used to address two issues of concern from a pro-consumer perspective: low levels of switching between providers and failure to select optimum tariffs. Competing explanations for low switching and accumulating evidence of consumer detriment in tariff choice are outlined. The commentary concludes by considering ways that consumers might be helped to meet the challenges identified.","[Lunn, Peter D.] Econ & Social Res Inst ESRI Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; [Lunn, Peter D.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Lunn, PD (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst ESRI Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",pete.lunn@esri.ie,,"Lunn, Peter/0000-0002-7174-5320",,,,,53,19,21,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Cutting against mainstream accounts of judicial empowerment that highlight electoral competition, I conclude that increasing competition, while a necessary precondition for the emergence of new political actors, has mixed results after a minimum, threshold level. Ideological motivations, especially on the left, enhance court budgets, and these motivations surmount the dampening, Downsian effect of competition. Further, the reduced effect of the PAN (National Action Party, former opposition party) and the increased positive effect of the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party, former national hegemon) since 2000 suggest ways in which former opposition parties can become less ideological (or more pro-regime), whereas former dominant parties can become more ideological (or more anti-regime). The results not only identify clear relationships but also highlight the complex electoral and partisan sources of policy change in authoritarian and emerging democratic regimes.

The question of L-moments presents a general theory covering the summarization and description of sample data sets, the summarization and description of theoretical distributions, but also the estimation of parameters of probability distributions and hypothesis testing for parameters of probability distributions. L-moments can be defined for any random variable in the case that its mean exists. Within the scope of modelling of wage distributions we currently use the method of conventional moments, the quantile method or the maximum likelihood method. The theory of L-moments parallels the other theories and the main advantage of the method of L-moments over these methods is that L-moments suffer less from impact of sampling variability L-moments are more robust and they provide more secure results in the case of small samples. The three-parametric lognormal distribution is one from the most frequent used distributions within the frame of modelling wage and income distribution. In the case of wage distributions we usually work with very large data sets and in such cases the method of L-moments provides say about alike accurate results as for example the method of moment or quantile method. The question of fitness of concrete parametric distribution for model of wage distribution tends to rejection of tested hypothesis about supposed form distribution practically always in the cases of such large samples. In this connection we can see close relationship between sample size and the value of criterion chi(2), too. The forecasts of wage distributions were constructed based on the observance of previous development. Within the frame of the financilal crisis were set free the employees with very low wages above all. The effect of this truth to forecasts of wage distribution will be exactly known in the autumn of this year.",,,,bilkova@vse.cz,"Bilkova, Diana/G-3694-2017",,,,,,16,9,9,0,6,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This is done by allowing the owners and managers of six vineyards to give voice to their concerns about the past, present, and future. The findings suggest that family businesses in the South African wine industry are subject to a process of institutionalisation in which entrepreneurial activities, which are part of this process, may not be as entrepreneurial as they appear at first. It is found that the two forms of logic behind the institutionalisation of the family firm and entrepreneurial activities in the context of the post-apartheid era can be successfully merged.

The most obvious consequence of the exercise of expertise is the tendency to generate in the time a smoothing in the estimated value. This is the first experimental application of the appraisal smoothing theory in Italy. The general spread of real estate valuations, based on prices and average prices refer to a single commercial parameter (usually the surface), generates the natural suspicion that the smoothing effect could be widely disseminated and the practical certainty of his presence. The study aims to measure this effect through an experimental case using a sample of urban real estate sales for the period of five years. The research applies deterministic and econometric models to counteract the appraisal smoothing based on the results of the statistical analysis of the data, on the basis of literature and direct observation of the phenomenon.","[Ciuna, Marina] Univ Palermo, Dipertimento DICAM, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [D'Amato, Maurizio] Politecn Bari, Dipartimento DAU, Bari, Italy; [Salvo, Francesca] Univ Calabria, Dipartimento DIPITER, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Palermo; Politecnico di Bari; University of Calabria,"Ciuna, M (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipertimento DICAM, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",marina.ciuna@unipa.it,"Salvo, Francesca/AAD-7215-2019; D'amato, Maurizio/Q-8590-2018; Ciuna, Marina/L-7695-2014","Ciuna, Marina/0000-0002-5024-3516",,,,,7,0,0,0,0,MEDIMOND S R L,40128 BOLOGNA,"VIA MASERATI 5, 40128 BOLOGNA, 00000, ITALY",,,978-88-7587-690-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,73,83,,,,,,11,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BA8IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338155900007,0

The promotion and implementation of the product (hydrogen in energetics (power industry)) is one of the most important topics for marketing theory and practice development. Product introduction to the world is encouraged by adapting various marketing strategies, depending on target audience and/or country energy sector specifics and other. Hydrogen in power industry from a scientific point of view in Latvia is being studied mostly by exact sciences and the need for marketing has not been evaluated yet, thus the research in this area has been relatively low. From previous studies of authors, it has been shown that the Latvian society knowledge about hydrogen energy is weak (Dimants et. al. 2011, Sloka et. al. 2012) and it is one of the reasons why the necessity of the marketing concept for hydrogen in power industry implementation has emerged. By using theoretical framework and the practical experience of other countries, authors have developed a marketing concept which is prepared as a basis for marketing strategy for the implementation of hydrogen in power industry in Latvia. The concept consists of four elements: introduction, research, communication and cooperation. The most important aspects of hydrogen energy introduction are the development of technology, infrastructure adaptation and construction. Most important aspects of the research are social studies and technology (incl. materials) research. Most important aspects of the communication are science communication with society and public education issues. Collaboration is recognized as one of the most important elements - this element currently gains increasing attention. Key aspects of that include partnership development between the various levels of legal persons.","[Dimants, Justs; Sloka, Biruta] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,justs.dimants@lu.lv,"Sloka, Biruta/K-5043-2017",,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,196,201,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100020,0

Different pooling methods are applied to exploit the survey information. Forecasts are based on mixed data sampling (MIDAS) and bridge equations. While the CCI does not outperform the autoregressive benchmark, the new indicators are able to raise forecasting performance. The best performing indicator should be built upon pre-selection methods. Data-driven aggregation methods should be preferred to determine the weights of the individual ingredients.
