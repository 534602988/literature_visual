We develop a new class of generalized Cramer-von Mises (GCM) specification tests for time series conditional distribution models using a novel approach, which embeds the empirical distribution function in a spectral framework. Our tests check a large number of lags and are therefore expected to be powerful against neglected dynamics at higher order lags, which is particularly useful for non-Markovian processes. Despite using a large number of lags, our tests do not suffer much from loss of a large number of degrees of freedom, because our approach naturally downweights higher order lags, which is consistent with the stylized fact that economic or financial markets are more affected by recent past events than by remote past events. Unlike the existing methods in the literature, the proposed GCM tests cover both univariate and multivariate conditional distribution models in a unified framework. They exploit the information in the joint conditional distribution of underlying economic processes. Moreover, a class of easy-to-interpret diagnostic procedures are supplemented to gauge possible sources of model misspecifications. Distinct from conventional CM and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests, which are also based on the empirical distribution function, our GCM test statistics follow a convenient asymptotic N(0, 1) distribution and enjoy the appealing nuisance parameter free property that parameter estimation uncertainty has no impact on the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics. Simulation studies show that the tests provide reliable inference for sample sizes often encountered in economics and finance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives of this study were to critically evaluate how published cost-effectiveness studies have conceptualized and valued health states associated with chlamydia and to examine the primary evidence available to inform health state utility values (HSUVs). Methods: A systematic review was conducted, with searches of six electronic databases up to December 2012. Data on study characteristics, methods, and main results were extracted by using a standard template. Results: Nineteen economic evaluations of relevant interventions were included. Individual studies considered different health states and assigned different values and durations. Eleven studies cited the same source for HSUVs. Only five primary studies valued relevant health states. The methods and viewpoints adopted varied, and different values for health states were generated. Conclusions: Limitations in the information available about HSUVs associated with chlamydia and its complications have implications for the robustness of economic evaluations in this area. None of the primary studies could be used without reservation to inform cost-effectiveness analyses in the United Kingdom. Future debate should consider appropriate methods for valuing health states for infectious diseases, because recommended approaches may not be suitable. Unless we adequately tackle the challenges associated with measuring and valuing health-related quality of life for patients with chlamydia and other infectious diseases, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions in this area will remain problematic.","[Jackson, Louise J.; Roberts, Tracy E.] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Auguste, Peter] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Low, Nicola] Univ Bern, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Bern, Switzerland",University of Birmingham; University of Warwick; University of Bern,"Roberts, TE (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",t.e.roberts@bham.ac.uk,"Roberts, Tracy/AAO-4610-2021; Low, Nicola/H-4718-2019","Roberts, Tracy/0000-0002-0624-0537; Low, Nicola/0000-0003-4817-8986; Auguste, Peter/0000-0001-5143-3218; Jackson, Louise J/0000-0001-8492-0020",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [RP-PG-0707-10208]; HTA [07/42/02]; Higher Education Funding Council for England; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [RP-PG-0707-10208] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); HTA; Higher Education Funding Council for England(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),"Louise J.

This semiparametric framework includes series with short, long and negative memory. We consider the consistency of the popular log-periodogram memory estimate that, conventionally but wrongly, assumes the spectral density obeys a pure power law. The local-to zero misspecification leads to increased bias, such that the usual central limit theorem may only hold for bandwidths entailing considerable imprecision. The order of the bias is calculated for several slowly-varying factors, and some discussion of mean squared error and bandwidth choice is included. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

New specifications of TTO, known as lead time' TTO and lag time' TTO, have been developed to overcome methodological issues of the classic' TTO. In the lead time TTO, ill-health is explicitly placed in the future, after a period of good health, whereas in lag time TTO, a health state starts immediately and is followed by a lag time' of good health. In this study, we take advantage of these timing properties of lead and lag time TTO. In particular, we use data from a previous study that employed lead and lag time TTO to estimate their implied discounting parameters. We show that individuals prefer being ill later, rather than now, with larger per-period discount rates for longer durations of the health states.

We develop an extension of the standard formula for the optimal Pigouvian corrective tax to incorporate the possibility that consumers avoid the tax by making purchases in nearby lower tax jurisdictions. To provide a key parameter for our formula, we estimate a structural endogenous switching regression model of border-crossing and cigarette prices. In illustrative calculations, we find that for many states, after taking into account tax avoidance the optimal tax is at least 20% smaller than the standard Pigouvian tax that simply internalizes external costs. Our empirical estimate that tax avoidance strongly responds to the price differential is the main reason for this result. We also use our results to examine the benefits of replacing avoidable state excise taxes with a harder-to-avoid federal excise tax on cigarettes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The results establish that the rise in life expectancy was behind a significant part of the increase in human capital over this period. According to the baseline estimate, for one additional year of life expectancy, years of schooling increase by 0.17 year. Moreover, the evidence suggests that declines in pneumonia mortality are the underlying cause of this finding, indicating that improved childhood health increases human capital investments.

We establish an equivalence between the agent's precautionary effort motive and the signs of successive cross-derivatives of the bivariate utility function. We show that the introduction (or deterioration) of an independent background risk induces more prevention to protect against wealth loss provided the individual exhibits correlation aversion of some given order. The conditions on the individual's risk preferences are given to generate some specific prevention behaviors in the univariate framework with multiplicative risks. Our conclusion also indicates that an increase in the correlation between wealth risk and background risk leads to a reduction in optimal prevention. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Having a moving average component, however, means that the errors in the measurement equation are no longer serially independent, and estimation becomes more difficult. We develop a posterior simulator that builds upon recent advances in precision-based algorithms for estimating these new models. In an empirical application involving US inflation we find that these moving average stochastic volatility models provide better in-sample fitness and out-of-sample forecast performance than the standard variants with only stochastic volatility.

This paper proposes an efficient simulation-based parameter learning method. First, the approach breaks up the interdependence of the hidden states and the static parameters by marginalizing out the states using a particle filter. Second, it applies a Bayesian resample-move approach to this marginalized system. The methodology is generic and needs little design effort. Different from batch estimation methods, it provides posterior quantities necessary for full sequential inference and recursive model monitoring. The algorithm is implemented both on simulated data in a linear Gaussian model for illustration and comparison and on real data in a Levy jump stochastic volatility model and a structural credit risk model.

We used data from a sample of 471 caring and 431 noncaring employees in Austria and split the analyses by gender. We found different aspects of informal caregiving to be associated with the intention to change jobs and with the anticipated labor market withdrawal of male and female workers. A time-based conflict between informal eldercare and paid work was significantly and positively related to the intended job change of female workers but not of their male counterparts. Flexible work arrangements were found to facilitate the attachment of female workers to their jobs and the labor market. Intentions to exit the labor market of male workers appeared to be triggered by a physical care burden rather than time demands. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. HIGHLIGHTS We studied the effects of providing informal eldercare on the turnover intention of men and women in a group of workers who were also the main carers providing support to a dependent older person with substantial care needs. The intention of male and female workers to change jobs and exit the labor market is shaped by the different characteristics of informal caregiving. Time-based conflicts between informal care and paid work are associated with a higher relative risk of anticipating job changes for female workers. Flextime facilitates the job and labor market attachment of female workers with eldercare responsibilities. The intensity of personal care provided to an older relative is significantly positively related to male workers' relative risk of anticipated labor market exit. Care to an older person in need of supervision makes the labor market exit of female workers less likely, lending thus support to the idea of the respite effect of work.","[Schneider, Ulrike; Trukeschitz, Birgit] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Social Policy, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schneider, Ulrike; Trukeschitz, Birgit; Muehlmann, Richard] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Res Inst Econ Aging, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Ponocny, Ivo] MODUL Univ Vienna, Dept Appl Stat & Econ, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Schneider, U (通讯作者)，WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Social Policy, Nordbergstr 15, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",ulrike.schneider@wu.ac.at,"Ponocny, Ivo/AAC-8817-2020","Ponocny, Ivo/0000-0002-0827-5346",Wiener Gesundheitsforderung (Vienna Health Promotion),Wiener Gesundheitsforderung (Vienna Health Promotion),This research was funded by the Wiener Gesundheitsforderung (Vienna Health Promotion).,,71,50,54,0,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,OCT,2013,22,10.0,,,,,1230,1249,,10.1002/hec.2880,0.0,,,20,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,217SQ,23225741.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324381500004,0

This paper draws attention to certain pathologies that arise in the use of FDML that have gone unnoticed in the literature and that affect both finite sample performance and asymptotics. FDML uses the Gaussian likelihood function for first differenced data and parameter estimation is based on the whole domain over which the log-likelihood is defined. However, extending the domain of the likelihood beyond the stationary region has certain consequences that have a major effect on finite sample and asymptotic performance. First, the extended likelihood is not the true likelihood even in the Gaussian case and it has a finite upper bound of definition. Second, it is often bimodal, and one of its peaks can be so peculiar that numerical maximization of the extended likelihood frequently fails to locate the global maximum. As a result of these pathologies, the FDML estimator is a restricted estimator, numerical implementation is not straightforward and asymptotics are hard to derive in cases where the peculiarity occurs with non-negligible probabilities. The peculiarities in the likelihood are found to be particularly marked in time series with a unit root. In this case, the asymptotic distribution of the FDMLE has bounded support and its density is infinite at the upper bound when the time series sample size T --> infinity. As the panel width n --> infinity the pathology is removed and the limit theory is normal. This result applies even for T fixed and we present an expression for the asymptotic distribution which does not depend on the time dimension. We also show how this limit theory depends on the form of the extended likelihood. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Han, Chirok] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Phillips, Peter C.

These substantial investments have typically been justified by an assumed link between shorter response times and improved health outcomes. However, current medical research does not generally show a relationship between response time and mortality. In this study, we explain the discrepancy between conventional wisdom and mortality; existing medical research fails to account for the endogeneity of incident severity and response times. Analyzing detailed call-level information from the state of Utah's Bureau of Emergency Medical Services, we measure the impact of response time on mortality and hospital utilization using the distance of the incident from the nearest EMS agency headquarters as an instrument for response time. We find that response times significantly affect mortality and the likelihood of being admitted to the hospital, but not procedures or utilization within the hospital.

Difference-in-differences (DD) estimates show a substantial increase in alcohol-related hospitalizations among those newly eligible to purchase liquor, around 24.6% (s.e. = 5.5%) for males and 22% (s.e. = 8.1%) for females. There is less evidence of an effect among ineligible younger cohorts. There is little evidence of alcohol either complementing or substituting for drugs. We do not find evidence that earlier access to alcohol is associated with learning from experience. We also present regression discontinuity estimates, but emphasize DD estimates since in a simulation of a rational addiction model DD estimates are closer than regression discontinuity estimates to the policy's true effect.

Such protocols, when designed with taste-based motives, would be productively inefficient in that the expected returns to treatment for a marginal treatment recipient would vary across covariates and be larger for discriminated groups. This cannot be directly tested if assignment is based on more covariates than the researcher observes, because then the marginal treatment recipient is not identified. We present (i) a partial identification approach to detecting such inefficiency which is robust to selection on unobservables and (ii) a novel way of point-identifying the necessary counterfactual distributions by combining observational datasets with experimental estimates. These methods can also be used to (partially) infer risk-preferences which may rationalize the observed treatment allocations. Specifically, existing healthcare datasets can be analyzed with the proposed tools to test the allocational efficiency of medical treatments. Using our methodology on data from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study in the US, which combined experimental and observational components, we find that after controlling for age, smokers in the observational dataset had to overcome a higher threshold of expected survival relative to nonsmokers in order to qualify for surgery.

This paper explores the possibility of extending this approach to the measurement of socioeconomic inequality of health. It assumes a social evaluation function that depends upon two variables: socioeconomic status as well as health status. With a general form of this function, an Atkinson measure is derived, which gives exactly the same result when applied to the socioeconomic variable and when applied to the health variable. The paper examines the properties of the index and suggests various extensions.

Methods: Three patient cohorts were identified: the patients included in the infliximab trial (ATTRACT), patients initially treated with infliximab from a Swedish registry (STURE), a subset of these registry patients meeting inclusion criteria for the ATTRACT trial was the third patient cohort; two sets of assumptions in relation to the efficacy data were evaluated: ATTRACT (efficacy data over the duration of the trial) and STURE (effectiveness data over 10 years). In addition, the impact of including the placebo effect for the comparator was evaluated as a basis for the calculation of cost-effectiveness by using a modeling approach. A health economic model was utilized to estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Results: The results for the three patient cohorts ranged from cost saving to a cost per QALY gained of (sic)2,400 and (sic)24,900 to (sic)26,000 when the ATTRACT and STURE assumptions were used, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the inclusion of placebo effect had the largest effect on the results, increasing the cost per QALY gained to approximately (sic)50,000 for all patient cohorts. Conclusions: The treatment effect of infliximab measured in clinical trials and clinical practice results in comparable cost-effectiveness ratios, as calculated by using a modeling approach, whereas the assumptions made in relation to the effectiveness data and the chosen comparator have a large impact on the results. This reinforces the value of early modeling studies based on randomized clinical trial data, but assumptions made need to be carefully assessed.","[Lekander, Ingrid; Borgstrom, Fredrik] I3 Innovus, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lekander, Ingrid; Borgstrom, Fredrik] Karolinska Inst, LIME MMC, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kobelt, Gisela] Lund Univ, Dept Orthoped, Lund, Sweden; [Svarvar, Patrick; Ljung, Tryggve] MSD Schering Plough AB, Stockholm, Sweden; [van Vollenhoven, Ronald] Karolinska Inst, Unit Clin Therapeut Res, Stockholm, Sweden",i3 Innovus; Karolinska Institutet; Lund University; Karolinska Institutet,"Lekander, I (通讯作者)，Rostvingevagen 33, S-14137 Huddinge, Sweden.",ingrid.lekander@ki.se,"van Vollenhoven, Ronald/ABE-1244-2021",,Schering-Plough AB (MSD),Schering-Plough AB (MSD),The study was supported by a grant from Schering-Plough AB (MSD).,,13,5,5,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2013,16,2.0,,,,,251,258,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.11.002,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,144AC,23538176.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318910400004,0
J,"Payne, K; Mcallister, M; Davies, LM",,,,"Payne, Katherine; Mcallister, Marion; Davies, Linda M.",,,VALUING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS: WHEN MAXIMISING HEALTH IS NOT SUFFICIENT,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,QALYs; economic evaluation; benefits; complex interventions; genetics,,"Complex interventions, involving interlinked packages of care, challenge the application of current methods of economic evaluation that focus on measuring only health gain. Complex interventions may be problematic on two levels. The complexity means the intervention may not fit into one of the current appraisal systems, and/or maximising health is not the only objective. This paper discusses the implications of a programme of work that focused on clinical genetics services, as an example of a complex intervention, and aimed to identify the following: the attributes that comprise both health and non-health aspects of benefits and whether it is possible to evaluate such an intervention using current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence appraisal processes. Genetic services and tests are a good example of a complex intervention and have broader objectives than just health gain, which may usefully be measured using the concept related to capability, which we have called empowerment'. Further methodological work is required to identify the trade-off between non-health (empowerment) and health benefits for other complex interventions. We do not advocate a move away from QALY maximisation but do suggest that there is a need for a more considered approach that can take account of the perceived value for non-health attributes for some complex interventions.

Within a welfarist framework QALYs are consistent with people's preferences under stringent assumptions. Several authors have argued that QALYs are a valid measure of health within an extra-welfarist framework. This paper studies the applicability of QALYs within the best-known extra-welfarist framework, Sen's capability approach. We propose a procedure to value capability sets and provide a foundation for QALYs within Sen's capability approach. We show that, under appropriate conditions, the ranking of capabilities can be represented locally by a QALY measure and that a willingness to pay for QALYs can be defined. The validity of QALYs as a general measure of health requires the same stringent conditions as in a welfarist framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis is the main tool used by payers to prioritize coverage of new therapies. We argue that reimbursement based on CE is subject to a form of the Lucas critique; the goals of CE policies may not materialize when firms affected by the policies respond optimally to them. For instance, because 'costs' in CE analysis reflect prices set optimally by firms rather than production costs, observed CE levels will depend on how firm pricing responds to CE policies. Observed CE is therefore endogenous. When CE is endogenously determined, policies aimed at lowering spending and improving overall CE may paradoxically raise spending and lead to the adoption of more resource-costly treatments. We empirically illustrate whether this may occur using data on public coverage decisions in the United Kingdom. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Regardless of whether this strong association is truly causal, little is known about the factors contributing to it. This study begins to unpack the black box of the bereavement-mortality puzzle by investigating the extent to which heath behaviors and health care utilization patterns vary among chronically ill elderly males living with a spouse and those who are widowed, and by asking whether these differences contribute to the well-documented correlation between widowhood and health deterioration. In order to separate the effect of health care utilization from other potential channels it uses a unique dataset of doctor-patient encounters that allows in-depth analysis of the organization and effectiveness of medical care. Changes in health care utilization attributable to bereavement have a negative effect on survival but account for a small part of the overall negative effect of widowhood on longevity.

Furthermore, this paper evaluates the effects of longevity on the LOS, thus revisiting the debate on the validity of the competing theories of compression or expansion of morbidity in LTC. The analysis finds significant effects on the LOS when AGE is controlled for, albeit do not confirm the time-to-death hypothesis. However, controlling for ASSESSMENT LEVEL suggests an improved health status of LTCDs over time, thus supporting the time-to-death hypothesis. An analysis of the mortality rates of LTCDs is to give insight into the opposing results. But the regression of mortality shows a divergence in the development of mortality rates for different disability levels. This is evidence to suggest that the improved health status in LTC is not only due to actual changes in the health status, but also a consequence of political intervention.

Suggestions for Ways Forward,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,access to health care; orphan drugs; pricing and value assessment; rare diseases; regulatory,,"We argue that orphan drug policies have been useful in incentivizing socially desirable R&D and that in their absence it is unlikely that treatments of any kind would have emerged. Weaknesses in the current policy framework need to be addressed by refining this framework rather than altogether replacing or dismissing it as inefficient. Improvements can be made in data collection, and efforts are already under way at the European Union level with initiatives concerning registries. Similarly, the legislative framework can be refined to define when an orphan treatment is sufficiently profitable, at what stage should profits be considered excessive, and, consequently, whether any favorable conditions offered to manufacturers should be removed. Concerns about availability and accessibility of orphan drugs, which are valid in many instances, do not imply that the current orphan drug policy framework is deficient but that the means of assessment need to be improved upon for realistic and affordable prices for payers to become the norm. This implies better data quality, the possible extension of the criteria for value assessment to take explicitly into account the peculiarities of rare diseases, and the availability of appropriate benchmarks around rare disease cost and quality of life to conduct meaningful value assessments.","[Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ, Dept Social Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ, LSE Hlth, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kanavos, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",p.g.kanavos@lse.a.c.uk,,"Nicod, Elena/0000-0001-6798-9923",,,,,19,29,29,0,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1182,1184,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.08.2202,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244822.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300024,0

Up to 25% of the results from an FNAB, however, may not be diagnostic or may be indeterminate, leading to a subsequent diagnostic thyroid surgery. A new molecularly based diagnostic test could potentially reduce indeterminate cytological results and, with high accuracy, provide a definitive diagnosis for cancer in thyroid nodules. The aim of the study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of utilizing a molecular diagnostic (DX) test as an adjunct to FNAB, compared with NoDX, to improve the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Methods: We constructed a patient-level simulation model to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of using a DX test compared with current practice (NoDX) for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules. By using a cost-effectiveness framework, we measured incremental clinical benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years and incremental costs over a 10-year time horizon. Results: Assuming 95% sensitivity and specificity of the Dx test when used as an adjunct to FNAB, the utilization of the DX test resulted in a gain of 0.046 quality-adjusted life-years (95% confidence interval 0.019-0.078) and a saving of $1087 (95% confidence interval $691-$1533) in direct costs per patient. If the cost of the Dx test is less than $1087 per test, we expect to save quality-adjusted life-years and reduce costs when it is utilized. Sensitivity of the DX test, compared with specificity, had a larger influence on the overall outcomes.","[Wiseman, Sam M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Surg, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y63, Canada; [Wiseman, Sam M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Surg, St Pauls Hosp, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y63, Canada; [Najafzadeh, Mehdi] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Mongan Inst Hlth Policy, Harvard MGH Ctr Genom Vulnerable Populat & Hlth D, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Marra, Carlo A.; Lynd, Larry D.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y63, Canada; [Marra, Carlo A.; Lynd, Larry D.] St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada",University of British Columbia; St. Paul's Hospital; University of British Columbia; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; University of British Columbia; St. Paul's Hospital,"Wiseman, SM (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Surg, St Pauls Hosp, C303-1081 Burrard St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y63, Canada.",smwiseman@providencehealth.bc.ca,"Marra, Carlo/AAE-4904-2021","Marra, Carlo/0000-0002-2625-2121; Lynd, Larry/0000-0002-7622-3919",National Research Council; Canadian Institute for Health Research Canada (CIHR),National Research Council; Canadian Institute for Health Research Canada (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),Source of financial support: This study was supported by the National Research Council Industrial Assistance Program (to Dr. Lesley Esford).

The testing problem is addressed by a misspecification-type approach in which the overidentifying restrictions test obtained from the estimation of the system of Euler equations of the LRE model through the generalized method of moments is combined with a likelihood-based test for the cross-equation restrictions that the model places on its reduced form solution under determinacy. The resulting test has no power against a particular class of indeterminate equilibria, hence the non rejection of the null hypothesis can not be interpreted conclusively as evidence of determinacy. On the other hand, this test (i) circumvents the nonstandard inferential problem generated by the presence of the auxiliary parameters that appear under indeterminacy and that are not identifiable under determinacy, (ii) does not involve inequality parametric restrictions and hence the use of nonstandard inference, (iii) is consistent against the dynamic misspecification of the LRE model, and (iv) is computationally simple. Monte Carlo simulations show that the suggested testing strategy delivers reasonable size coverage and power against dynamic misspecification in finite samples. An empirical illustration focuses on the determinacy/indeterminacy of a New Keynesian monetary business cycle model of the US economy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Further, several prior studies use microdata to show that as state unemployment rates rise, physical health improves, unhealthy behaviors decrease, and medical care use declines. We use data on elderly mortality rates and data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey from a time period that encompasses the start of the Great Recession. We find that elderly mortality is countercyclical during most of the 1994-2008 period. Further, as unemployment rates rise, seniors report worse mental health and are no more likely to engage in healthier behaviors. We find suggestive evidence that inpatient utilization increases perhaps because of an increased physician willingness to accept Medicare patients. Our findings suggest that either elderly individuals respond differently to recessions than do working age adults, or that the relationship between unemployment and health has changed.

This study evaluates the ability of ten European diagnosis-related group (DRG) systems to explain variations in costs or in length of stay for knee replacements. We assessed three different models in predicting variation of cost and length of stay. The first model, MD, included only DRG groups as explanatory variables; the second, MP, used a set of patient-level variables; and the third, MF, included all variables from both MD and MP. The total number of DRGs used to group knee replacement is low, ranging from two to six. All DRG systems except one differentiate between primary knee replacement and revision surgery. Considerable differences exist in the rate of revision surgery. There is also high variation in mean cost (from epsilon 3809 to epsilon 8158) and in mean length of stay (LoS) (from 4.2 to 13.6 days). The explanatory power of DRGs varies from 21.5 to 72.5% with values of around 40% in most countries of the study. Findings suggest that DRG systems could be enhanced either by the inclusion of patient-level variables, by the use of measures of clinical outcome or by improving cost and administrative information.

Using a two-stage approach to control for variation within and between hospitals, we examine the ability of the diverse DRG systems in 10 European countries to explain variability in resource utilisation (costs or length of stay, LoS) for hospital patients undergoing surgical repair of inguinal hernia. Our national regression results suggest that DRGs are statistically significant in explaining cost/LoS variation in the absence of any other regressors and generally remain so in most countries when patient-level characteristics are added to the model. However patient-level characteristics, including those used in DRG assignment, are usually also statistically significant. In nine countries, where the number of relevant DRGs ranges from two (Poland) to seven (France), the inclusion of patient-level characteristics substantially improves model goodness-of-fit compared with that attained with DRGs alone. Only in Sweden is the converse true. If our analysis raises some concerns over the adequacy of DRGs to explain cost/LoS variation in inguinal hernia repair in nine of the 10 European countries, further research is required to consider whether future enhancements may be necessary.

We estimated the savings that could be obtained from a hypothetical switch in medicine consumption from originator brands to lowest-priced generic equivalents for a selection of medicines in 17 countries. Methods: In this cost minimization analysis, the prices of originator brands and their lowest-priced generic equivalents were obtained from facility-based surveys conducted by using a standard methodology. Fourteen medicines most commonly included in the surveys, plus three statins, were included in the analysis. For each medicine, the volume of private sector consumption of the originator brand product was obtained from IMS Health, Inc. Volumes were applied to the median unit prices for both originator brands and their lowest-priced generics to estimate cost savings. Prices were adjusted to 2008 by using consumer price index data and were adjusted for purchasing power parity. Results: For the medicines studied, an average of 9% to 89% could be saved by an individual country from a switch in private sector purchases from originator brands to lowest-priced generics. In public hospitals in China, US $370 million could be saved from switching only four medicines, saving an average of 65%. Across individual medicines, average potential savings ranged from 11% for beclometasone inhaler to 73% for ceftriaxone injection. Conclusions: Substantial savings could be achieved by switching private sector purchases from originator brand medicines to lowest-priced generic equivalents. Strategies to promote generic uptake, such as generic substitution by pharmacists and increasing confidence in generics by professionals and the public, should be included in national medicines policies.","[Cameron, Alexandra; Laing, Richard Ogilvie] WHO, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Cameron, Alexandra; Mantel-Teeuwisse, Aukje K.; Leufkens, Hubert G.

We explored major stakeholders' views toward the potential implementation of a financial risk-sharing mechanism regarding budget-impact estimates for adding new technologies to the Israeli National List of Health Services. According to our proposed scheme, health plans will be partially compensated by technology sponsors if the actual use of a technology is substantially higher than what was projected and health plans will refund the government for budgets that were not fully utilized. Methods: By using a semi-structured protocol, we interviewed major stakeholders involved in the process of updating the National List of Health Services (N = 31). We inquired into participants' views toward our proposed risk-sharing mechanism, whether the proposed scheme would achieve its purpose, its feasibility of implementation, and their opinion on the other stakeholders' incentives. Results: Participants' considerations were classified into four main areas: financial, administrative/managerial, impact on patients' health, and influence on public image. Most participants agreed that the conceptual risk-sharing scheme will improve the accuracy of early budget estimates and were in favor of the proposed scheme, although Ministry of Finance officials tended to object to it. Conclusions: The successful implementation of risk-sharing schemes depends mainly on their perception as a win-win situation by all stakeholders. The perception exposed by our participants that risk-sharing can be a tool for improving the accuracy of early budget-impact estimates and the challenges pointed by them are relevant to other health care systems also and should be considered when implementing similar schemes.","[Hammerman, Ariel] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Fac Hlth Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University,"Hammerman, A (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Fac Hlth Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",arielha@clalit.org.il,"Feder-Bubis, Paula/AAP-8767-2021; Hammerman, Ariel/AAG-4399-2020","Feder-Bubis, Paula/0000-0002-3724-3810; Hammerman, Ariel/0000-0002-4396-5246; Greenberg, Dan/0000-0002-6759-3985",Israel National Institute for Health Policy and Health Services Research,Israel National Institute for Health Policy and Health Services Research,The study was partially supported by a research scholarship from The Israel National Institute for Health Policy and Health Services Research.,,25,8,8,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15,5.0,,,,,737,742,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.01.007,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867784.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100018,0

Real per capita provincial government health expenditures (GHE) over the period 2002-2006 are examined using panel regression analysis. Key determinants of real per capita provincial GHE are real provincial per capita general budget revenue, real provincial per capita transfers from the central government, the proportion of provincial population under age 15, urban employee basic health insurance coverage, and proportion of urban population. Roughly equal and relatively low elasticities of budget revenue and transfers imply that the GHE is a necessity rather than a luxury good, and transfers have yet to become efficient instruments for the fair allocation of health resources by policy makers. Moreover, severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak has increased the GHE, but we find no statistical evidence that provincial GHE have fluctuated according to the public health status.

Reasons given range from the lack of anticipated survival benefit from treatment to the inappropriateness of death as an anchor for valuing health states, or the increased value of time to the individual at the end of life. The Palliative Care Yardstick, has been proposed as an alternative. In this paper, I argue that the QALY should not be abandoned as an outcome measure in end of life and palliative care populations and suggest possible methods for generating empirical data to support or refute this. I show why the arguments made for replacement of the QALY are not supported by current evidence and how in some cases the abandonment of the QALY framework would lead to an unjustifiable inequitable distribution of resources.

The objective of the current study was to assess feasibility and evaluation of the construct validity of PROMIS item banks versus legacy measures in an observational study in systemic sclerosis (SSc). We hypothesized that the PROMIS item banks can be administered in a clinical setting if there is adequate staff support without disrupting the flow of clinic. Methods: Patients with SSc in a single academic center completed computerized adaptive test (CAT) administered PROMIS item banks during the clinic visit and legacy measures (using paper and pencil). The construct validity of PROMIS items was evaluated by examining correlations with corresponding legacy measures using multitrait-multimethod analysis. Results: Participants consisted of 143 SSc patients with an average age of 51.5 years; 71% were female and 68% were white. The average number of items completed for each CAT-administered item bank ranged from 5 to 8 (69 CAT items per patient), and the average time to complete each CAT-administered item bank ranged from 48 seconds to 1.9 minutes per patient (average time similar to 11.9 minutes/ per patient for 11 banks). All correlations between PROMIS domains and respective legacy measures were large and in the hypothesized direction (ranged from 0.61 to 0.82). Conclusion: Our study supports the construct validity of the CAT-administered PROMIS item banks and shows that they can be administered successfully in a clinic with support staff. Future studies should assess the feasibility of PROMIS item banks in a busy clinical practice.","[Khanna, Dinesh] Univ Michigan, Scleroderma Program, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA; [Maranian, Paul; Furst, Daniel E.; Clements, Phil J.; Bechtel, Amber] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Div Rheumatol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Rothrock, Nan; Cella, David; Gershon, Richard] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med Social Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Spiegel, Brennan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Div Digest Dis, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Spiegel, Brennan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Syst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hays, Ron D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Hlth Serv Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hays, Ron D.] RAND, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; RAND Corporation,"Khanna, D (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Scleroderma Program, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, 24 Frank Lloyd Wright Dr,Lobby M,Suite 2500,SPC 5, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA.",khannad@med.umich.edu,"Hays, Ron D./D-5629-2013; Khanna, Puja P./AAE-5697-2021","Hays, Ron D./0000-0001-6697-907X;","National Institutes of Health (NIH/ NIAMS) [U01 AR057936A]; National Institutes of Health through NIH [AR052177]; NIAMS [K23 AR053858-05]; Scleroderma Foundation; National Institutes of Health [T32 AR 053463]; UCLA Resource Center for Minority Aging Research/Center for Health Improvement in Minority Elderly (RCMAR/CHIME); NIH/NIA [P30AG021684]; UCLA/ Drew, EXPORT, NCMHD [2P20MD000182]","National Institutes of Health (NIH/ NIAMS)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS)); National Institutes of Health through NIH; NIAMS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS)); Scleroderma Foundation; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); UCLA Resource Center for Minority Aging Research/Center for Health Improvement in Minority Elderly (RCMAR/CHIME); NIH/NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); UCLA/ Drew, EXPORT, NCMHD","D.

Methods: TTO and VAS valuations were obtained from face-to-face surveys of a convenience sample of patients, caregivers, and health professionals conducted at nine government hospitals in 2004 and 2005. Forty-five EQ-5D questionnaire health states were valued, divided into five sets of 15 health states. Analysis was conducted by using linear additive regression models applying N3 and D1 specifications. Model selection was based on criteria of coefficient properties, statistical significance, and goodness of fit. Results: One hundred fifty-two respondents were interviewed, yielding 2174 TTO and 2265 VAS valuations. Respondents found TTO valuations to be more difficult than VAS valuations, and there were more inconsistencies in TTO valuations. All the independent variables in the models were statistically significant and consistent with expected signs and magnitude, except for the D1 specification modeled on TTO valuations. The N3 model provided the best fit for the VAS valuation data, with a mean absolute error of 0.032. Conclusion: This study provides a Malaysian EQ-5D questionnaire value set that can be used for cost-utility studies despite survey limitations.","[Goh, Adrian; Azmi, Soraya] Azmi Burhani Consulting Sdn Bhd, Petaling Jaya 47301, Selangor, Malaysia; [Yusof, Faridah Aryani Md] Minist Hlth, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia",Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia,"Goh, A (通讯作者)，Azmi Burhani Consulting Sdn Bhd, 6-2,Jalan SS 7-16, Petaling Jaya 47301, Selangor, Malaysia.",adrian.goh@azmi-burhani.com,,"Goh, Adrian/0000-0003-4951-7759",National Renal Registry,National Renal Registry,"We thank the Director General of Health, Malaysia, for permission to publish this article.

Because these benefits are negotiated through the political process, relevant labor market institutions deviate significantly from the competitive, private-sector benchmark. Empirically, we find that roughly 15 percent of the cost of recent benefit growth was passed onto school district employees through reductions in wages and salaries. Strong teachers' unions were associated with relatively strong linkages between benefit growth and growth in total compensation. Our analysis is consistent with the view that the costs of public workers' benefits are difficult to monitor, contributing to benefit oriented, and often under-funded, compensation schemes.

Positive effects of hyperbolic discounting on smoking are salient for naive people, who are not aware of their self-control problem. By estimating smoking participation and smokers' cigarette consumption in Cragg's two-part model, we find that the two smoking decisions depend on different sets of time-discounting variables. Particularly, smoking participation is affected by being a naive hyperbolic discounter, whereas the discount rate, the presence of the sign effect, and a hyperbolic discounting proxy constructed from procrastination behavior vis-a-vis doing homework assignments affect both types of decision making. The panel data enable us to analyze the over-time instability of elicited discount rates. The instability is shown to come from measurement errors, rather than preference shocks on time preference. Several evidences indicate that the detected associations between time preferences and smoking behavior are interpersonal one, rather than within-personal one.

Our new minimum distance estimator is consistent, asymptotically normal, robust to semi-strong identification, and does not rely on the choice of a user-chosen parameter, such as the number of instruments or some smoothing parameter. Heteroskedasticity-robust inference is possible through Wald testing without prior knowledge of the identification pattern. Simulations show that our estimator is competitive with alternative estimators based on many instruments, being well-centered with better coverage rates for confidence intervals.

For example, rank sum scoring is employed in cross country team competition, the Putnam Mathematics Team Competition, snowboard cross team competition, snowboard half-pipe team competition, and snowboard slopestyle team competition. It also forms the basis for non-parametric statistical tests (the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the related Mann Whitney U test) that serve as an ordinal substitute for the two-sample t-test. Moreover, a close variant of rank sum scoring is used in team rowing competitions, alpine ski competitions, as well as in multiple event cross-fit contests. Given its applicability, we formally define rank sum scoring, derive conditions under which the methodology leads to violations of major social choice principles (ranking cycles and violations of independence from irrelevant groups), and calculate the probability that an outcome sequence leads to a given social choice violation. These probability calculations provide sizable corrections to prior calculations on the topic and alter our view as to the social choice properties of rank sum scoring. Contrary to prior results on the topic, we find that the two violations considered are not mutually inclusive under rank sum scoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In line with empirical regularities, skill-biased technological change induces a decline in population growth and a transitory increase in the depletion rate of natural resources. In the long-run, the depletion rate also declines in the skill intensity. A decline in population growth is harmful for long-run productivity growth, if R&D is subject to diminishing technological opportunities. The effectiveness of economic policies aimed at sustained economic growth thus hinges on its impact on long-run population growth given the sign of intertemporal spillovers in R&D with respect to existing technological knowledge. We demonstrate that an increase in relative research productivities or an education subsidy enhances long-run growth, if R&D is subject to diminishing technological opportunities, while an increase in the teacher student ratio is preferable in terms of positive intertemporal knowledge spillovers.

Utilizing insurance claims for 11 863 individuals who died during 2005-2007, we trace their hospital expenditures over the last 24 months of their lives. We find that end-of-life patients who are treated by private hospitals in general are associated with higher inpatient expenditures than those treated by public hospitals, while there is no significant difference in days of hospital stay. This finding is consistent with the difference in financial incentives between public and private hospitals in Taiwan. Nevertheless, we also find that the public-private differences vary across accreditation levels.

Under these regimes, patients co-pay a fraction of the difference between a drug's pharmacy retail price and a reference price that is set by the government. Reference prices are either externally (based on drug prices in other countries) or internally (based on domestic drug prices) determined. We study the effects of a change from external to internal reference pricing in Denmark in 2005. We find that the reform led to substantial reductions in retail prices, reference prices and patient co-payments as well as to sizable decreases in overall producer revenues and health care expenditures. The reform induced consumers to substitute away from branded drugs for which we estimate strong preferences. The increase in consumer welfare due to the reform therefore depends on whether or not we take perceived quality differences into account in its calculation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We conducted an economic analysis of 1) traditional pretest/post-test counseling; 2) counseling and a new clinical reminders system; and 3) only clinical reminder in the veterans' health care system. A payer perspective decision model was conducted to calculate the 1-year budget impact of three HIV testing strategies. Parameter values were obtained from the literature, including patients' probability of accepting test, and costs associated with HIV testing procedures. Deidentified patient data, including total population screened and number of new HIV cases, were collected from one clinic in Los Angeles, California, from August 2004 to December 2011. Annual total costs and costs per new case were calculated on the basis of parameter values and patient data Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the critical variable on costs. Results: The total cost of the clinical reminder system with pretest counseling was $81,726 over 1 year compared with $109,208 for traditional HIV testing. Under a clinical reminder system with no pretest counseling, the number of HIV tests performed and the number of new diagnoses increased for that year. In addition, cost per new diagnoses was the lowest. Conclusions: The clinical reminder system can reduce the cost per cases identified and promote better performance of HIV testing compared with traditional HIV testing. The fundamental decision model can be used for hospital facilities outside the Veteran Affairs adopting a similar program for improving the HIV testing rate.","[Chan, Kee; Hernandez, Leilani; Yang, Heidi] Boston Univ, Sargent Coll, Coll Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Chan, Kee] Ctr Hlth Qual & Econ Res, Bedford, MA USA; [Goetz, Matthew Bidwell] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Med, Infect Dis Sect, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Goetz, Matthew Bidwell] VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Syst, Dept Med, Infect Dis Sect, Los Angeles, CA USA",Boston University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System,"Chan, K (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Sargent Coll, Coll Hlth & Rehabil Sci, 635 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",keechan@bu.edu,"Goetz, Matthew Bidwell/GPX-4090-2022","Goetz, Matthew/0000-0003-4542-992X",,,,,14,3,3,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,334,339,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.03.001,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24968992.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900005,0

This paper argues that the increasing availability of prescription opioids may threaten heroin sellers' profit margin and force them to find alternative methods to compensate buyers in the event of a supply shock. We investigate the 2006 fentanyl overdose episode in New Jersey and argue that the introduction of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl, its spatial distribution, and the timing of overdose deaths may have been related to trends in heroin purity. Using medical examiner data, as well as data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, Office of Diversion Control on retail sales of prescription opioids in a negative binomial specification, we show that month-to-month fluctuations in heroin purity have a significant effect on fentanyl-related overdoses, particularly in those areas where prescription opioids are highly available.

Successive passage times of one latent Brownian component relative to random boundaries define durations. The other, correlated, Brownian components generate the marks. Our model embeds the class of stochastic conditional (SCD) and autoregressive conditional (ACD) duration models, which impose testable restrictions on the relation between the conditional expectation and conditional volatility of durations. We strongly reject the SCD and ACD specifications for both a very liquid and less liquid NYSE-traded stock, and characterize causality relations between volatilities and durations.

This health insurance tax credit (HITC) existed during tax years 1991, 1992, and 1993, and was then rescinded. A difference-in-differences estimator applied to Current Population Survey data suggests that adoption of the HITC, along with accompanying increases in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), was associated with a relative increase of about 4.7 percentage points in the private health insurance coverage of working single mothers with high school or less education. Also, a difference-in-difference-in-differences estimator, which attempts to net out the possible influence of the EITC increases but which requires strong assumptions, suggests that the HITC was responsible for about three-quarters (3.6 percentage points) of the total increase. The latter estimate implies a price elasticity of health insurance take-up of -0.42.

The proposed convergent series are derived using the Hermite polynomial approach. Departing from the usual option pricing routine in the literature, our model assumptions have no requirements for affine dynamics or explicit characteristic functions. Moreover, convergent expansions provide a distinct insight into how and on which order the model parameters affect option prices, in contrast with small-time asymptotic expansions in the literature. With closed-form expansions, we explicitly translate model features into option prices, such as mean-reverting drift and self-exciting or skewed jumps. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of this approach and its advantage over alternative expansion methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A number of recent papers studying such allocation problems have shown various interesting equivalences between randomized mechanisms based on trading and randomized mechanisms based on serial dictatorship. We prove a very general equivalence theorem from which many previous equivalence results immediately follow, and we give several new applications. Our general result sheds some light on why these equivalences hold by presenting the existing serial-dictatorship-based mechanisms as randomizations of a general mechanism which we call serial dictatorship in groups. Our proof technique also streamlines the bijective methods used in previous proofs, showing that it is enough to assemble a bijection from smaller pieces, without needing to construct the pieces explicitly.

They have not generally been used to assess social preferences with respect to options for health care delivery, although the need for quantifying these preferences is arguably just as important. Policy makers are increasingly faced with decisions about how much to invest in, and how much to incentivize, particular modes of health care delivery, generally with little evidence about user preferences. Methods: This study draws on long-term care (LTC) delivery modes as an example. Focus groups were conducted to approach this issue both qualitatively and quantitatively. In a qualitative pilot study, two focus groups discussed issues of the LTC decision-making process and preferences among different LTC options. The TTO was then used to assess QOL for each LTC option, conditional on a specific health state, and then quantified user's LTC preferences by differential QOL between the two options. Results: This study found that the TTO-elicited utilities and their differences are consistent with the LTC preferences revealed from focus group discussions. These preferences depend on levels of disability and education. Conclusions: The modified TTO technique seems a feasible method to quantify preferences over LTC delivery options. These methods may be applicable to various health care alternatives in which better evidence is needed to guide funding policy.","[Guo, Jing] Amer Inst Res, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Konetzka, R.

We compared three statistical techniques to estimate patients' EQ-5D questionnaire index scores determined by using the UK tariff: 1) generalized estimating equations, 2) two-part model combining logistic regression and generalized estimating equation, and 3) separate mapping algorithms for patients with poor health defined as a FACT-P score of 76 or less (group-specific model). Four different sets of explanatory variables were compared. The models were cross-validated by using a 10-fold in-sample cross-validation. Results: Values for both instruments were available for 236 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The group-specific model including the FACT-P subscale scores and baseline variables had the best predictive performance with R-2 0.718, root mean square error 0.162, and mean absolute error 0.117. The two-part model and the generalized estimating equation model including the FACT-P subdomain scores and baseline variables also had good predictive performance. Conclusions: The developed algorithms for mapping the FACT-P instrument to the EQ-5D questionnaire enable the estimation of preference-based health-related quality-of-life scores for use in cost-effectiveness analyses when directly elicited EQ-5D questionnaire data are missing.","[Skaltsa, Konstantina] Quintiles, Barcelona, Spain; [Skaltsa, Konstantina] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med, Barcelona 7, Spain; [Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Ivanescu, Cristina] Quintiles, Hoofddorp, Netherlands; [De Phung; Holmstrom, Stefan] Astellas Pharma Global Dev, Leiden, Netherlands",IQVIA; University of Barcelona; Brunel University; IQVIA; Astellas Pharmaceuticals,"Skaltsa, K (通讯作者)，C Sardenya 537 Bajos, Barcelona 08024, Spain.",konstantina.skaltsa@quintiles.com,,"Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862","Medivation, Inc.; Astellas Pharma, Inc.","Medivation, Inc.; Astellas Pharma, Inc.(Astellas Pharmaceuticals)","This research was funded by Medivation, Inc., and Astellas Pharma, Inc.

A core discrete event simulation model was developed to estimate health and cost outcomes associated with alternative treatment strategies. Methods: This model simulated short- and long-term clinical events (partial response, remission, relapse, recovery, and recurrence), adverse events, and treatment changes (titration, switch, addition, and discontinuation) over up to 5 years. Several treatment pathways were defined on the basis of fictitious antidepressants with three levels of efficacy, tolerability, and price (low, medium, and high) from first line to third line. The model was populated with input data from the literature for the UK setting. Model outputs include time in different health states, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs from National Health Service and societal perspectives. The codes are open source. Results: Predicted costs and QALYs from this model are within the range of results from previous economic evaluations. The largest cost components from the payer perspective were physician visits and hospitalizations. Key parameters driving the predicted costs and QALYs were utility values, effectiveness, and frequency of physician visits. Differences in QALYs and costs between two strategies with different effectiveness increased approximately twofold when the time horizon increased from 1 to 5 years. Conclusion: The discrete event simulation model can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of different therapeutic options in MDD, compared with existing Markov models, and can be used to compare a wide range of health care technologies in various groups of patients with MUD.","[Vataire, Anne-Lise; Aballea, Samuel] Creat Ceut, F-75008 Paris, France; [Antonanzas, Fernando] Univ La Rioja, Logrono, Spain; [Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Lam, Raymond W.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [McCrone, Paul] Kings Coll London, London, England; [Persson, Ulf] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Toumi, Mondher] Univ Lyon, Lyon, France",Universidad de La Rioja; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of British Columbia; University of London; King's College London,"Vataire, AL (通讯作者)，Creat Ceut, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 215 Rue Faubourg St Honore, F-75008 Paris, France.",ava@creativ-ceutical.com,"Lam, Raymond W/D-2529-2013; Antonanzas, Fernando/F-4610-2016","Lam, Raymond W/0000-0001-7142-4669; Antonanzas, Fernando/0000-0001-6122-9130; McCrone, Paul/0000-0001-7001-4502; Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona/0000-0003-0635-7388",,,,,28,9,11,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2014,17,2.0,,,,,183,195,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.11.012,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AD6EB,24636376.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333346600005,0

Because healthcare policies involve strategic interactions between different layers of governments in many different countries, we focus on a particular dimension of well-being, namely citizens' health. We model fiscal discipline by considering government expectations of future deficit bailouts from the central government. We then study how these bailout expectations affect the expenditure for healthcare policies carried out by decentralized governments. To investigate this issue, we separate efficient health spending from inefficiencies by estimating an input requirement frontier. This allows us to assess the effects of bailout expectations on both the structural component of health expenditure and its deviations from the best practice'. The evidence from the 15 Italian ordinary statute regions (observed from 1993 to 2006) points out that bailout expectations do not significantly influence the position of the frontier, thus not affecting citizens' health.

It is possible to evaluate the existence of clusters in the regions from two points of view: in terms of identification of the regional potential, which forms the basis for the successful clusters' operations and also in terms of evaluation the potential of clusters that contribute to the regional development. The main purpose of the paper is to find out the aspects of cluster potential in the regional development from these points of view. The partial aims of this paper are: an application of selected quantitative method - the locational Gini coefficient (LG(e,1)) to investigate the cluster potential in Slovak regions, and by means of Pearson correlation quotient to emphasize the independent relations between indicators, to which the existence of a cluster in region has an influence. The next ambitions are to evaluate the possibility of various quantitative methods using in the Slovak republic conditions and to purpose the indicators that present the influence of cluster in the Slovak regions. The results of the paper show, that clustering occurs in the economy of Slovak regions. We found out, that 26 clusters have been already officially established in Slovak regions in the last ten years. They were establish based approach bottom up without adequate cluster policy. Despite this fact, the clusters play an important role in the competitiveness of Slovak regions. Although the processes of clustering often redistributed forces and factors affecting the competitiveness of local enterprises or regions, these processes are important for the ability of smaller regions and countries to develop new manufacturing departments or programs and improve their competitiveness. The novelty of paper is to pointing on the indicators that could refer how the potential of the clusters contribute to the regional development.","[Betakova, Janka] Dubnica Inst Technol Dubnica Vahom, Dubnica Nad Vahom 01841, Slovakia; [Haviernikova, Katarina] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Trencin 91150, Slovakia; [Dvorsky, Jan] Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin; University of Zilina,"Betakova, J (通讯作者)，Dubnica Inst Technol Dubnica Vahom, Ul Sladkovicova 533-20, Dubnica Nad Vahom 01841, Slovakia.",betakova@dti.sk; katarina.haviernikova@tnuni.sk; jan.dvorsky@fbi.uniza.sk,"Havierniková, Katarína/P-1414-2019; Dvorsky, Jan/C-9213-2018","Havierniková, Katarína/0000-0002-9019-8684; Dvorsky, Jan/0000-0002-6078-2636",,,,,14,4,4,0,6,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-1685-5,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2014,44,,,,,,122,127,,10.5729/lnms.vol44.122,0.0,,,6,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC9DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356316000019,0

Recently, Sun et al. (2011) propose using a semiparametric varying coefficient approach to capture correlations between integrated but non cointegrated variables. Due to the complication arising from the integrated disturbance term and the semiparametric functional form, consistent estimation of such a semiparametric model requires stronger conditions than usually needed for consistent estimation for a linear (spurious) regression model, or a semiparametric varying coefficient model with a stationary disturbance. Therefore, it is important to develop a testing procedure to examine for a given data set, whether linear relationship holds or not, while allowing for the disturbance being an integrated process. In this paper we propose two test statistics for detecting linearity against semiparametric varying coefficient alternative specification. Monte Carlo simulations are used to examine the finite sample performances of the proposed tests.

These scores are calculated by using preference weights derived from general population samples. We recruited persons with AD and their primary informal caregivers and examined differences in health utility scores calculated by using two sets of published preference weights. Methods: We recruited participants from nine clinics across Canada and administered the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire HRQOL instrument. We converted participants' EQ-5D questionnaire responses into two sets of health utility scores by using US and Canadian preference weights. We assessed agreement between sets by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Bland-Altman plots depicted individual-level differences between sets. Results: For 216 persons with AD and their caregivers, mean health utility scores were higher when calculated with US instead of Canadian preference weights (P < 0.0001). The intraclass correlation coefficient (95% CI) was 0.79 (0.05-0.93) in the persons with AD group and 0.83 (0.30-0.94) in the caregiver group. Ninety-five percent of the individual differences in utility score fell between -0.16 and 0.03 for persons with AD and -0.15 and 0.05 for caregivers. Forty-three percent of these differences exceeded a minimum clinically important threshold of 0.074. Conclusions: In AD studies, researchers should calculate health utility scores by using preference weights obtained in the general population of their country of interest. Using weights from other countries' populations could bias the utilities and adversely affect the results of economic evaluations of AD treatments.","[Oremus, Mark; Tarride, Jean-Eric; Clayton, Natasha; Raina, Parminder; Canadian Willingness-to-Pay Study] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada",McMaster University,"Oremus, M (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, 1280 Main St West DTC 308, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",oremusm@mcmaster.ca,"Hogan, David Bryan/I-4360-2013","Hogan, David Bryan/0000-0002-9462-5460",Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care,"Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care(Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario)",Mark Oremus holds the McLaughlin Foundation Professorship in Population and Public Health.

In the experiment, medical students in the role of physicians decide on the provision of medical services. The experimental setup allows us to identify the influence of profits and patients' health benefit on the choice of medical treatment. We estimate physician altruism, the weight individuals attach to patients' health benefit, by fitting mixed logit and multinomial logit regression models to the experimental data. Estimation results provide evidence for physician altruism. We find, however, substantial variation in the degree of physician altruism. We also discuss some implications of our results for the design of physician payment schemes in the light of the theoretical literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM.

To do so it uses the relative amounts spent per beneficiary with those characteristics in Traditional Medicare (TM). For multiple reasons one might expect relative amounts in MA to differ from TM, thereby making some beneficiaries more profitable to treat than others. Much of the difference comes from differences in how TM and MA treat different diseases or diagnoses. Using data on actual medical spending from two MAHMO plans, we show that the weights calculated from MA costs do indeed differ from those calculated using TM spending. One of the two plans (Plan 1) is more typical of MA-HMO plans in that it contracts with independent community providers, while the other (Plan 2) is vertically integrated with care delivery. We calculate margins, or average revenue/average cost, for Medicare beneficiaries in the two plans who have one of 48 different combinations of medical conditions. The two plans' margins for these 48 conditions are correlated (r= 0.39, p <0.01). Both plans have margins that are more positive for persons with conditions that are managed by primary care physicians and where medical management can be effective. Conversely they have lower margins for persons with conditions that tend to be treated by specialists with greater market power than primary care physicians and for acute conditions where little medical management is possible. The two plan's margins among beneficiaries with different observable characteristics vary over a range of 160 and 98 percentage points, respectively, and thus would appear to offer substantial incentive for selection by HCC. Nonetheless, we find no evidence of overrepresentation of beneficiaries in high margin HCC's in either plan. Nor, using the margins from Plan 1, the more typical plan, do we find evidence of overrepresentation of high margin HCC's in Medicare more generally. These results do not permit a conclusion on overall social efficiency, but we note that selection according to margin could be socially efficient. In addition, our findings suggest there are omitted interaction terms in the risk adjustment model that Medicare currently uses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Within this framework we can model problems in which, when the time t approaches to the final time, the valuation of the final function increases compared with previous valuations. We study a consumption and portfolio rules problem for CRRA and CARA utility functions for time-consistent agents, and we compare the different equilibria with the time-inconsistent solutions. The introduction of random terminal time is also discussed. Differences with both the mathematical treatment and agent's behavior in the case of hyperbolic discounting are stressed.

Estimates of an original dynamic panel data model of disability, labour market and housing tenure transitions in England indicate that up to one-quarter of the lower employment probability of the disabled can be attributed to the effect of qualifying for social housing. Short-lived disabilities can result in long spells in social housing that reduce incentives to participate in the labour market. This suggests that authorities should reform the welfare system and the allocation of social housing to limit the persistent and unfavourable consequences of allocating social housing to the disabled.

To add to prior work on the validity of the TMI classification, responsiveness of a summated scale version was evaluated in 71 colonoscopy patients. Further data on construct validity were also obtained. Methods: Patients enrolled in the study when scheduling colonoscopy days to weeks beforehand. The baseline survey included the EuroQol five dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire with five levels in each attribute (EQ-5D-5L questionnaire) and its visual analogue scale (VAS) assessment (EQ-VAS), the Short Form 12 version 2 (SF-12v2) component summary scores and six dimensional health state short form (derived from the short-form 12v2 health survey [SF-6D) utilities), and an original construct-specific VAS (CS-VAS) for usual HRQOL using utility scale anchors. The TMI's highest possible summated score (all best levels) served as its baseline. Survey data were generally obtained by telephone interview. A postprocedure survey was given to patients after colonoscopy and interviews conducted as soon as possible after the day of the procedure. The postprocedure survey included the SF-12v2/SF-6D, EQ-5D questionnaire instruments, TMI items, and a CS-VAS incorporating the overall HRQOL effects of colonoscopy. Results: Standardized response means showed greatest responsiveness by the TMI ( -1.52) followed by the CS-VAS instruments ( -0.42). The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, the EQ-VAS, and the SF-12 component summaries were unresponsive, and the SF-6D was minimally responsive (-0.05). Correlation of the post-CS-VAS with the TMI was substantial (r = -0.52), suggesting TMI construct validity. Moderate to strong correlation of the baseline CS VAS with standard indexes was observed (r = 0.54-0.81). Conclusion: The TMI appears responsive and exhibits further evidence of construct validity.

The results allow for the data to be cross sectionally dependent, while at the same time allowing the regressors to be only sequentially rather than strictly exogenous. The setup is sufficiently general to accommodate situations where cross sectional dependence stems from spatial interactions and/or from the presence of common factors. The latter leads to the need for random norming. The limit theorem for sample moments is derived by showing that the moment conditions can be recast such that a martingale difference array central limit theorem can be applied. We prove such a central limit theorem by first extending results for stable convergence in Hall and Heyde (1980) to non-nested martingale arrays relevant for our applications. We illustrate our result by establishing a generalized estimation theory for GMM estimators of a fixed effect panel model without imposing i.i.d. or strict exogeneity conditions. We also discuss a class of Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators that can be analyzed using our CLT. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: In this study, we performed a Web-based, large-sample survey to address the issue of double counting. To determine the influence of income reduction on utility scores, we obtained utility scores of eight health states with three instruction types: a) no instruction, b) instructed to consider income reduction, and c) instructed not to consider income reduction (compensated). Respondents were randomly sampled from the online panel and asked to evaluate 1 of 24 patterns by both standard gamble and time trade-off methods. Results: A total of 6551 respondents completed the questionnaire. First, despite the lack of instruction on income reduction, many respondents spontaneously assumed lost income. The proportion tended to be higher when considering more severe health states. Second, the degree of assumed income reduction was related to utility scores. For a 10% income reduction, respondents assumed a 0.02- to 0.04-decrease in utility score (both standard gamble and time trade-off methods). Third, utility scores did not change significantly when instruction was given not to consider income reduction (compensated) compared with when no instruction was given. Conclusions: An assumed income reduction clearly influenced utility scores; however, compensation for lost income failed to sufficiently improve utility scores. In our view, the effect of income on utility scores does not only reflect wage loss. Our results suggest that the impact of double counting is negligible.","[Shiroiwa, Takeru; Fukuda, Takashi] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Publ Hlth Informat, Wako, Saitama 3510197, Japan; [Ikeda, Shunya] Int Univ Hlth & Welf, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Saitama, Japan; [Shimozuma, Kojiro] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Biomed Sci, Saitama, Japan",National Institute of Public Health - Japan; International University of Health & Welfare; Ritsumeikan University,"Shiroiwa, T (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Publ Hlth Informat, 2-3-6 Minami, Wako, Saitama 3510197, Japan.",t.shiroiwa@gmail.com,,"Shiroiwa, Takeru/0000-0003-3055-9932",,,,,26,27,31,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,581,587,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.02.009,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796292.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900017,0

The model is complemented with a set of assumptions that allow the dynamics of the private sector to be separated from monetary policy. The monetary policy regimes cannot be estimated if the yield curve is ignored during estimation. Counterfactual analysis evaluates importance of regimes in policy and shocks for the great moderation. The low-volatility regime of exogenous shocks plays an important role. Monetary policy contributes by trading off asymmetric responses of output and inflation under different regimes.

Methods: Lung function outcomes and drug prices were observed for a UK COPD population over the period from 2001 to 2010. Cost-effectiveness was assessed at regular intervals on the basis of an established cost-effectiveness model, and the maximum price a technology providing cure could achieve under the current cost-effectiveness rules was estimated. Results: The results of this study show that although the scope for clinical improvement in COPD was still considerable, during the 10 years studied, the potential for cost-effectiveness at each point in time was dependent on momentary market characteristics, such as the changing price of comparators and improvements in clinical effectiveness. As a result, the analysis demonstrates that the future cost-effectiveness of a technology in development depends on the manner pricing and clinical effectiveness evolve throughout time. Conclusions: Because any predictions will be short-lived and dependent on a number of uncertain factors, we conclude that producing accurate forecasts on the potential for cost-effectiveness of new therapies earlier during the development process is especially difficult under the current static cost-effectiveness framework.","[Camejo, Rodrigo Refoios; Rutten, Frans] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McGrath, Clare] AstraZeneca, Alderley Pk, Cheshire, England; [Herings, Ron] Erasmus Univ, Dept Med Informat, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Herings, Ron] PHARMO Inst Drug Outcomes Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Starkie, Helen] Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH & Co KG, Bracknell, Berks, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; AstraZeneca; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Boehringer Ingelheim,"Camejo, RR (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",rodrigo.refoioscamejo@gmail.com,"Herings, Ron/AAE-4096-2021","Herings, Ron/0000-0002-2561-8734; Refoios Camejo, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5507-4857",Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT),Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"While conducting this study, Rodrigo Refoios Camejo was supported by the Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), Clare McGrath was an employee of Pfizer, and Helen Starkie was an employee of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).

Cultural theory argues that how we govern and manage health services depends on what we think about the nature of government organizations and the legitimacy of their scope of action. The values that are implied by universal health coverage underlie choices about how health systems are governed and their organizations are managed. We draw two main conclusions. First, the translation of principles and goals into practice requires exceptional efforts to design adequate decision-making arrangements (the essence of governance) and management practices. Management and governance, or how policies are decided and conducted, are not secondary to the selection of the best policy solutions (the what). Second, governance and management solutions are not independent of the values that they are expected to serve. Instead, they should be designed to be consonant with these values. Cultural theory suggests-and experience supports-the idea that group identity is favorable for shaping different forms of social life and public administrations. This approach should thus be a starting point for those who strive to obtain universal health coverage. Copyright (C) 2013 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

Our preferred approach identifies the effect through changes in one's performance after gaining legal access to alcohol, controlling flexibly for the expected evolution of grades as one makes progress towards their degree. We also report RD-based estimates but argue that an RD design is not well suited to the research question in our setting. We find that students' grades fall below their expected levels upon being able to drink legally, but by less than previously documented. We also show that there are effects on women and that the effects are persistent. Using the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we show that students drink more often after legal access but do not consume more drinks on days on which they drink. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although an example in which CPO implies CGRO is presented, it is shown that such a situation is avoidable under strictly convex preferences. Under such preferences, both CPO and CGRO are characterized by the conditions on the dominant root for the agents' common matrix of marginal rates of substitution. We demonstrate that CGRO requires the dominant root being exactly equal to one, whereas CPO allows it to be less than one.

We consider a discrete double auction model in which the seller's valuation is either (v) under bar (s) or (v) over bar (s) and the buyer's valuation is either (v) under bar (b) or (v) over bar (b) with 0 = (v) under bar (s) < <(v)under bar>(b) < <(v)over bar>(s) < <(v)over bar>(b) = 1. The buyer's valuation and the seller's valuation are private information. We further assume that the buyer's belief about the seller's valuation is also private information (i.e., there is second-order uncertainty). We show that if (v) over bar (b) - (v) over bar (s) and (v) over bar (b) - (v) over bar (s) are sufficiently small, then the efficiency of the 0.5-double auction model with second-order uncertainty is higher than the efficiency of the 0.5-double auction model with first-order uncertainty. Our result thus serves as an example in which the introduction of higher-order uncertainty results in reducing, instead of increasing, the inefficiency of a bargaining model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using more recent and more accurate mortality data of the same group of elderly, this note re-estimates the NHI effect on mortality and finds that the mortality hazard of the previously uninsured elderly in the post-NHI period was on average 24% lower than it would have been in the absence of NHI. However, the NHI effect on the mortality hazard is only evident in the first 6 years following the enactment of NHI, suggesting that it may be difficult to undo the damage caused by the lack of insurance in early life.

In this setting, we provide consistent estimation of the structural parameters. In addition, we define a convenient rotation in the parameter space (or reparametrization) to disentangle the different rates of convergence. More precisely, we identify special linear combinations of the structural parameters associated with a specific rate of convergence. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of usual inference procedures, like the overidentification test and Wald test, with standard formulas. It is important to stress that both estimation and testing work without requiring the knowledge of the various rates. However, the assessment of these rates is crucial for (asymptotic) power considerations. Possible applications include econometric problems with two dimensions of asymptotics, due to trimming, tail estimation, infill asymptotic, social interactions, kernel smoothing or any kind of regularization.

The methods used to incorporate HSUVs in models, however, are often methodologically poor and lack consistency. Inconsistencies in the methodologies used will produce discrepancies in results, undermining policy decisions informed by cost per quality-adjusted life-years. Objective: To provide an overview of the current evidence base relating to populating decision-analytic models with HSUVs. Findings: Research exploring suitable methods to accurately reflect the baseline or counterfactual HSUVs in decision-analytic models is limited, and while one study suggested that general population data may be appropriate, guidance in this area is poor. Literature describing the appropriateness of different methods used to estimate HSUVs for combined conditions is growing, but there is currently no consensus on the most appropriate methodology. While exploratory analyses suggest that a statistical regression model might improve accuracy in predicted values, the models require validation and testing in external data sets. Until additional research has been conducted in this area, the current evidence suggests that the multiplicative method is the most appropriate technique. Uncertainty in the HSUVs used in decision-analytic models is rarely fully characterized in decision-analytic models and is generally poorly reported. Conclusions: A substantial volume of research is required before definitive detailed evidence-based practical advice can be provided. As the methodologies used can make a substantial difference to the results generated from decision-analytic models, the differences and lack of clarity and guidance will continue to lead to inconsistencies in policy decision making.","[Ara, Roberta] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Ara, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",r.m.ara@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617",National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,Source of financial support: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.,,39,44,45,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15,6.0,,,,,971,974,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.05.003,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999149.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800025,0

The regulator uses two instruments: a prospective payment per patient and a cost reimbursement rate. When the regulator can only use a prospective payment, the optimal price involves a trade-off between the level of quality provision and the level of horizontal differentiation. If this pure prospective payment leads to underprovision of quality and overdifferentiation, a mixed reimbursement scheme allows the regulator to improve the allocation efficiency. This is true for a relatively low level of patients' transportation costs. We also show that if the regulator cannot commit to the level of the cost reimbursement rate, the resulting allocation can dominate the one with full commitment. This occurs when the transportation cost is low or high enough, and the full commitment solution either implies full or zero cost reimbursement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, CRTs may show systematic differences in individual and cluster-level covariates between the treatment groups. This paper presents three methods to adjust for imbalances in observed covariates: seemingly unrelated regression with a robust standard error, a two-stage bootstrap approach combined with seemingly unrelated regression and multilevel models. We consider the methods in a cost-effectiveness analysis of a CRT with covariate imbalance, unequal cluster sizes and a prognostic relationship that varied by treatment group. The cost-effectiveness results differed according to the approach for covariate adjustment. A simulation study then assessed the relative performance of methods for addressing systematic imbalance in baseline covariates. The simulations extended the case study and considered scenarios with different levels of confounding, cluster size variation and few clusters. Performance was reported as bias, root mean squared error and CI coverage of the incremental net benefit. Even with low levels of confounding, unadjusted methods were biased, but all adjusted methods were unbiased. Multilevel models performed well across all settings, and unlike the other methods, reported CI coverage close to nominal levels even with few clusters of unequal sizes.

In total, 195?810 cases clustered in 712 hospitals were analyzed using OLS fixed effects models for cost data (n?=?125?698) and negative binominal models for length-of-stay data (n?=?70?112). The number of DRGs differs widely across the 10 European countries (range: 214). Underlying this wide range is a different use of classification variables, especially secondary diagnoses and treatment options are considered to a different extent. In six countries, a standard set of patient characteristics and treatment variables explain the variation in costs or length of stay better than the DRG variables. This raises questions about the adequacy of the countries' DRG system or the lack of specific criteria, which could be used as classification variables.

Stroke severity and the given care may vary substantially between patients, and there is remarkable variation in both the costs and length of stay (LoS) of stroke patients. Using patient level data from 10 European countries on costs and LoS, we explored the ability of the diagnosis-related group (DRG) systems to explain variance in the costs and length of stay of stroke patients. In addition, we evaluated whether the existing DRGs for stroke patients would benefit from additional patient-related and treatment-related factors that are commonly found in the administrative databases across countries. Cost analyses were run using OLS fixed effects models, and LoS analyses with negative binomial models. The descriptive statistics showed that the stroke patients differ remarkably across countries. Large variations in the classification of stroke patients raise concerns about whether all systems rely on the most appropriate classification variables. In all the countries, the DRG classifications' performance could be improved with the introduction of the patient characteristics analysed here.

The classical Hajek-Le Cam optimality theory is adapted to cover this situation. We show that the expectation of certain monotone bowl-shaped functions of the squared estimation error are minimized by the ML estimator in locally asymptotically quadratic situations, which often occur in nonstationary time series analysis when the LAN property fails. Moreover, we demonstrate a direct connection between the (Bayesian property of) asymptotic normality of the posterior and the classical optimality properties of ML estimators. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Against economic intuition, the simulation result shows that, even if past information has no predictive power, buy or sell signals based on the difference between the short-period and long-period moving averages of past asset prices can be statistically significant when the forecast horizon is relatively long. The theoretical analysis reveals that both 'momentum' and 'contrarian' strategies can be falsely supported, while the probability of obtaining each result depends on the type of the test statistics employed.

Specifically, we analyzed two types of contract: a restricted contract and an incentive contract. The restricted contract did not allow the purchase of unhealthy foods with program benefits, but compensated participants by increasing total benefits. The incentive contract provided increased benefits that varied according to the percentage of healthy foods purchased with program benefits. The theoretical results revealed the mechanisms for the two alternative contracts, the conditions under which each would be effective, and the key empirical questions to be examined for future policy analysis.

In this paper, we obtain two expressions to approximate the bias of the least squares/maximum likelihood estimator of the mean reversion parameter in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with a known long run mean when discretely sampled data are available. The first expression mimics the bias formula of Marriott and Pope (1954) for the discrete time model. Simulations show that this expression does not work satisfactorily when the speed of mean reversion is slow. Slow mean reversion corresponds to the near unit root situation and is empirically realistic for financial time series. An improvement is made in the second expression where a nonlinear correction term is included into the bias formula. It is shown that the nonlinear term is important in the near unit root situation. Simulations indicate that the second expression captures the magnitude, the curvature and the non-monotonicity of the actual bias better than the first expression. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It can also reduce youths' expected returns to education and lower their motivation to go to school, where smoking is forbidden. Using rich household survey data from rural China, this study investigates the effect of youth smoking on educational outcomes. Youth smoking is clearly an endogenous variable; to obtain consistent estimates of its impact, we use counts of registered alcohol vendors and a food price index as instrumental variables. Since the variable that measures smoking behavior is censored for non-smoking adolescents, we implement a two-step estimation strategy to account for the censored nature of this endogenous regressor. The estimates indicate that smoking one cigarette per day during adolescence can lower students' scores on mathematics tests by about 0.08 standard deviations. However, we find no significant effect of youth smoking on either Chinese test scores or total years of schooling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Independently of brand loyalty, which some studies rely upon to explain the paradox, we show that heterogeneity in insurance coverage may result in higher prices of brand-name drugs following generic entry. With market segmentation based on insurance coverage present in both the pre- and post-entry stages, the paradox can arise when the two types of drugs are highly substitutable and the market is quite profitable but does not have to arise when the two types of drugs are highly differentiated. However, with market segmentation occurring only after generic entry, the paradox can arise when the two types of drugs are weakly substitutable, provided, however, that the industry is not very profitable. In both cases, that is, when market segmentation is present in the pre-entry stage and when it is not, the paradox becomes more likely to arise as the market expands and/or insurance companies decrease deductibles applied on the purchase of generic drugs.

Our method can handle any simulable model without latent dynamics. Using simulated observations, we nonparametrically estimate the unknown density by kernel methods, and then construct a likelihood function that can be maximized. We prove that this nonparametric simulated maximum likelihood (NPSML) estimator is consistent and asymptotically efficient. The higher-order impact of simulations and kernel smoothing on the resulting estimator is also analyzed: in particular, it is shown that the NPSML does not suffer from the usual curse of dimensionality associated with kernel estimators. A simulation study shows good performance of the method when employed in the estimation of jump-diffusion models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a new test for measuring independence of utility of life duration from quality of life in a riskless setting. We use a large representative sample of Dutch citizens and include two health states generally considered better than dead (BTD) and one health state considered worse than dead (WTD). Independence cannot be rejected when comparing the BID health states, but is rejected when comparing the BTD states with the WTD state. In particular, utility of life duration becomes more concave for the WTD state. This may suggest that independence holds only for BID health states. This has implications for the QALY model and would require using sign-dependent utility of life duration functions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate this claim by adding a number of participation constraints to the household allocation problem. Short-run constraints ensure that each spouse obtains a utility level at least equal to what they would realize under (inefficient) Nash equilibrium. Long-run constraints ensure that each spouse obtains a utility level at least equal to what they would realize by cheating on the efficient allocation and receiving Nash equilibrium payoffs in all successive periods. Given household characteristics and the (common) discount factor of the spouses, not all households may be able to attain payoffs on the Pareto frontier. We estimate these models using a Method of Simulated Moments estimator and data from one wave of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find that both short- and long-run constraints are binding for sizable proportions of households in the sample. We conclude that it is important to carefully model the constraint sets household members face when modeling household allocation decisions, and to allow for the possibility that efficient outcomes may not be implementable for some households.

Methods: We obtained input on the most important symptoms to monitor during treatment for stage III or IV breast cancer from 52 patients recruited from National Comprehensive Cancer Network institutions as well as support service organizations. Participating patients shared their top-priority symptoms/concerns through open-ended interviews and symptom checklists. To ensure adequate content coverage, we evaluated results alongside the original version of the FBSI, which was created on the basis of a survey of oncology clinicians at National Comprehensive Cancer Network institutions and items in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy measurement system. We also obtained input from 10 National Comprehensive Cancer Network oncologists regarding whether symptoms were primarily related to disease or treatment. Results: We selected breast cancer-related symptoms and concerns endorsed as high priority by both oncology patients and clinicians for inclusion in the new National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer Symptom Index-16 (NFBSI-16), which includes all eight items from the original FBSI and eight additional items from Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy measures. The NFBSI-16 is formatted by subscale: Disease-Related Symptom, Treatment Side-Effect, and General Function and Well-Being. Results provide preliminary support for NFBSI-16's internal consistency reliability (alpha = 0.87) and validity as evidenced by moderate-tostrong relationships with expected criteria. Conclusions: Reflecting the priority symptoms of breast cancer patients and clinicians, the NFBSI-16 can be used to help evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for advanced breast cancer in clinical practice and research.","[Garcia, Sofia F.; Rosenbloom, Sarah K.; Beaumont, Jennifer L.; Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med Social Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Garcia, Sofia F.; Rosenbloom, Sarah K.; Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Garcia, Sofia F.; Von Roenn, Jamie H.; Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Robert H Lurie Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Merkel, Douglas] NorthShore Univ Hlth Syst, Kellogg Canc Ctr, Evanston, IL USA; [Merkel, Douglas] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, Hematol Oncol Sect, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Von Roenn, Jamie H.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Div Hematol Oncol, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Rao, Deepa] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Inst Healthcare Studies, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Ann & Robert H.

Methods: A retrospective cost analysis of ICU patients was performed from the hospital's perspective. The standardized costing methodology was developed on the basis of the availability of data at the seven ICU departments. It entailed the application of the bottom-up approach for hotel and nutrition and the top-down approach for diagnostics, consumables, and  labor. Results: Direct costs per ICU day ranged from (sic)1168 to (sic)2025. Even though the distribution of costs varied by cost component, labor was the most important cost driver at all departments. The costs for labor amounted to (sic)1629 at department G but were fairly similar at the other departments ((sic)711 +/- 115). Conclusions: Direct costs of ICU days vary widely between the seven departments. Our standardized costing methodology could serve as a valuable instrument to compare actual cost differences, such as those resulting from differences in patient case-mix.","[Tan, Siok Swan; Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bakker, Jan] Erasmus MC Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Intens Care, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Hoogendoorn, Marga E.] Isala Clin, Dept Intens Care, Zwolle, Netherlands; [Kapila, Atul] Royal Berkshire NHS Trust Hosp, Dept Intens Care, Reading, Berks, England; [Martin, Joerg] Kliniken Landkreises Goppingen GmbH, Dept Intens Care, Goppingen, Germany; [Pezzi, Angelo] Univ Milan, Dept Intens Care, Milan, Italy; [Pittoni, Giovanni] Azienda Osped Univ, Dept Intens Care, Padua, Italy; [Spronk, Peter E.] Gelre Hosp Lukas Site, Dept Intens Care Med, Apeldoorn, Netherlands; [Welte, Robert] GlaxoSmithKline, New Prod & Hlth Outcomes, Munich, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Isala Clinics; Royal Berkshire Hospital; University of Milan; University of Padua; Azienda Ospedaliera - Universita di Padova; Gelre Hospitals; GlaxoSmithKline,"Tan, SS (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",tan@bmg.eur.nl,"Kapila, Atul/AFP-1824-2022; Bakker, Jan/A-4011-2009; Perez, Angel/AAU-9972-2020","Bakker, Jan/0000-0003-2236-7391; Perez, Angel/0000-0003-1451-1445; Tan, Siok Swan/0000-0002-9522-2321; Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona/0000-0003-0635-7388",GlaxoSmithKline; Goppingen (Germany); San Paolo Hospital in Milan (Italy); Azienda Ospedaliera in Padova (Italy); Erasmus MC University Medical Center in Rotterdam (the Netherlands); Gelre Hospitals in Apeldoorn (the Netherlands); Isala Clinics in Zwolle (the Netherlands),GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Goppingen (Germany); San Paolo Hospital in Milan (Italy); Azienda Ospedaliera in Padova (Italy); Erasmus MC University Medical Center in Rotterdam (the Netherlands)(Netherlands Government); Gelre Hospitals in Apeldoorn (the Netherlands); Isala Clinics in Zwolle (the Netherlands),"This study was supported by GlaxoSmithKline.; The authors thank the employees of the clinical and financial departments of the Klinik am Eichert in Goppingen (Germany), the San Paolo Hospital in Milan (Italy), the Azienda Ospedaliera in Padova (Italy), the Erasmus MC University Medical Center in Rotterdam (the Netherlands), the Gelre Hospitals in Apeldoorn (the Netherlands), the Isala Clinics in Zwolle (the Netherlands), and the Royal Berkshire NHS Trust Hospital in Reading (the United Kingdom) who provided resource-use and cost data for the study.

I extend previous work started by Manski (2004) that applied the minimax regret criterion to treatment choice problems by considering decision criteria that asymmetrically treat Type I regret (due to mistakenly choosing an inferior new treatment) and Type II regret (due to mistakenly rejecting a superior innovation) and derive exact finite sample solutions to these problems for experiments with normal.

One simple way of resolving such trade-offs is to aggregate multiple attributes into one real-valued index, known as weighted or separable utility. Applications of weighted utility can be found in choice under risk (expected utility) and uncertainty (subjective expected utility), intertemporal choice (discounted utility) and welfare economics (utilitarian social welfare function). This paper presents an alternative behavioral characterization (preference axiomatization) of weighted utility. It is shown that necessary and sufficient conditions for weighted utility are completeness, continuity, hi-separable transitivity (and transitivity if none of the attributes is null, or inessential).

Many applications in the recent literature on partially identified problems have this feature, including dynamic games, set-identified IV models, and parameters defined by a continuum of moment inequalities, in particular conditional moment inequalities. We provide a generic consistency result for criterion-based estimators using an increasing number of unconditional moment inequalities. We then develop more specific results for set estimation subject to conditional moment inequalities: we first derive the fastest possible rate for estimating the sharp identification region under smoothness conditions on the conditional moment functions. We also give rate conditions for inference under local alternatives. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find an optimal consumption rule for ratchet consumers by maximizing an expected utility that eschews spending declines, yet permits a range of choices for felicity and time preference functions. This solution can be tailored to fit both retirees with finite planning horizons and endowments with infinite planning horizons.

By exploiting two independent measures of qualifications, we identify the extent of misclassification in administrative and self-reported data on educational attainment. The availability of multiple self-reported educational measures additionally allows us to identify the temporal patterns of individual misreporting errors across survey waves. We provide the first reliable estimate of a highly policy relevant parameter for the UK, namely the return from attaining any academic qualification compared to leaving school at the minimum age without any formal qualification. We identify returns to qualifications under two alternative settings: a strong ignorability assumption and an exclusion restriction. All these results are obtained by casting the identification problem in terms of a mixture model, and using a semi-parametric estimation approach based on balancing scores, which allows for arbitrarily heterogeneous individual returns.

Health shocks are more common than most other shocks, more concentrated among the poor, more idiosyncratic, more costly, trigger more coping strategies, and highly likely to lead to a cut in consumption. Household members experiencing a health shock lost, on average, 0.6 point on a five-point health scale; the wealthier are better able to limit the health impacts of a health shock.

The method combines two techniques recently proposed in the literature in two separate steps. In the first step, the closed form approach of Ait-Sahalia (2008) is used to obtain a highly accurate approximation to the joint transition probability density of the latent and the observed states. In the second step, the efficient importance sampling technique of Richard and Zhang (2007) is used to integrate out the latent states, thereby yielding the likelihood function. Using both simulated and real data, we show that the proposed ML method works better than alternative methods. The new method does not require the underlying diffusion to have an affine structure and does not involve infill simulations. Therefore, the method has a wide range of applicability and its computational cost is moderate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Simon and Zame (1990) introduce the concept of sharing rules as a means for endogenously resolving such indeterminacy when the player set is finite. We extend the Simon and Zame methodology to environments including large players whose individual actions may be felt economy-wide as well as infinitesimal players whose actions impact others only through the aggregate behavior of the demographic groups to which they belong. In effect, our analysis endogenizes the equilibrium actions of economic agents as well as the social conventions and personal beliefs that prevail. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Rowat, C; Kerber, M",,,,"Rowat, Colin; Kerber, Manfred",,,Sufficient conditions for unique stable sets in three agent pillage games,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EQUILIBRIUM; POWER,"Pillage games (Jordan, 2006a) have two features that make them richer than cooperative games in either characteristic or partition function form: they allow power externalities between coalitions; they allow resources to contribute to coalitions' power as well as to their utility. Extending von Neumann and Morgenstern's analysis of three agent games in characteristic function form to anonymous pillage games, we characterise the core for any number of agents; for three agents, all anonymous pillage games with an empty core represent the same dominance relation. When a stable set exists, and the game also satisfies a continuity and a responsiveness axiom, it is unique and contains no more than 15 elements, a tight bound. By contrast, stable sets in three agent games in characteristic or partition function form may not be unique, and may contain continua. Finally, we provide an algorithm for computing the stable set, and can easily decide non-existence. Thus, in addition to offering attractive modelling possibilities, pillage games seem well behaved and analytically tractable, overcoming a difficulty that has long impeded use of cooperative game theory's flexibility.

We find no differences in employment rates following rehabilitation between individuals who received rehabilitation by private and public providers. Also the average cost of rehabilitation was essentially equal for the two types of providers. This suggests that there are no large efficiency gains from privatising vocational rehabilitation.

In this paper we consider the time homogeneous first order Markov (HFOM) model that allows for maximal heterogeneity. That is, the modeling of the heterogeneity does not impose anything on the data (except the HFOM assumption for each agent) and it allows for any theory model (that gives a HFOM process for an individual observable variable). 'Maximal' means that the joint distribution of initial values and the transition probabilities is unrestricted. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for generic local point identification of our heterogeneity structure that are very easy to check, and we show how it depends on the length of the panel. We apply our techniques to a long panel of Danish workers who are very homogeneous in terms of observables. We show that individual unemployment dynamics are very heterogeneous, even for such a homogeneous group. We also show that the impact of cyclical variables on individual unemployment probabilities differs widely across workers. Some workers have unemployment dynamics that are independent of the cycle whereas others are highly-sensitive to macro shocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We propose the concept of summability (a re-scaled partial sum of the process being O-p(1)) to handle non-linearities. The paper shows that this new concept, S (delta): (i) generalizes I (delta); (ii) measures the degree of persistence as well as of the evolution of the variance; (iii) controls the balancedness of non-linear relationships; (iv) opens the door to the concept of co-summability which represents a generalization of co-integration for non-linear processes. To make this concept empirically applicable, an estimator for delta and its asymptotic properties are provided. The finite sample performance of subsampling confidence intervals is analyzed via a Monte Carlo experiment. The paper finishes with the estimation of the degree of summability of the macroeconomic variables in an extended version of the Nelson-Plosser database. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

But it is possible that low-income recipients are unable to cut back on utilization wisely and that, as a result, higher cost-sharing will lead to worse health and higher downstream costs through increased use of inpatient and outpatient care. We use exogenous variation in the copayments faced by low-income enrollees in the Massachusetts Commonwealth Care program to study these effects. We estimate separate price elasticities of demand by type of service. Overall, we find price elasticities of about -0.16 for this low-income population - similar to elasticities calculated for higher-income populations in other settings. These elasticities are somewhat smaller for the chronically sick, especially for those with asthma, diabetes, and high cholesterol. These lower elasticities are attributable to lower responsiveness to prices across all categories of service, and to some statistically insignificant increases in inpatient care.

The reverse-lottery contest model determines winners by selecting losers based on contestants' one-shot effort through a hypothetical sequence of lotteries. We provide a microfoundation for the reverse-lottery contest from a perspective of (simultaneous) noisy performance ranking and establish that the model is underpinned by a unique performance evaluation rule. We further demonstrate that the noisy-ranking model can be interpreted intuitively as a worst-shot contest, in which contestants' performances are evaluated based on their most severe mistakes. The reverse-lottery contest model thus depicts a great variety of widely observed competitive activities of this nature. A handy closed-form solution for a symmetric equilibrium of the reverse-lottery contest is obtained. We show that the winner-take-all principle continues to hold in reverse-lottery contests. Moreover, we find that a reverse-lottery contest elicits more effort than a conventional lottery contest whenever the prizes available to contestants are relatively scarce. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Using survival and logistic regression models, we reanalyzed data from three US cohorts: the Medical Outcomes Study (N = 3,445; 541 patients with DM), the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (N = 78,183; 16,388 patients with DM), and the Quality Metric 2009 Norming Study (N = 4,040; 580 patients with DM). Outcome variables were mortality, hospitalization, current inability to work, and loss of ability to work. Results: Benchmarks were robust across disease groups, but varied according to age and score level. A 1-point lower score on the Physical Function, General Health, and Physical Component Summary scales was associated with a 1.05 to 1.09 relative risk (RR) of mortality for the typical patient with DM, with stronger associations in the younger age groups. For several scales (Physical Function, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Function, and Role Emotional), the associations with mortality also depended on score level, with stronger associations in the lower score ranges (i.e., patients in worse health). A 1-point lower score on the Physical Function, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Function, and Physical Component Summary scales implied a 1.02 to 1.04 RR of hospitalization, a 1.07 to 1.12 RR of being unable to work, and a 1.04 to 1.07 RR of losing the ability to work. Conclusions: A 1-point lower score on selected Short Form 36 Health Survey scales is associated with an excess risk of up to 9% for mortality and 12% for inability to work.","[Bjorner, Jakob B.; Miller, Kate A.] QualityMetr OptumInsight, Lincoln, RI 02865 USA; [Bjorner, Jakob B.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Publ Hlth, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wolden, Michael Lyng; Gundgaard, Jens] Novo Nordisk AS, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Novo Nordisk,"Bjorner, JB (通讯作者)，QualityMetr OptumInsight, 24 Alb Rd,Bldg 400, Lincoln, RI 02865 USA.",jbjorner@qualitymetric.com,,,Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),"Source of financial support: This study was supported by Novo Nordisk.

The purpose of this research was to compare the SF-6D index values generated from the SF 36 (SF-6D(SF-36)) with those obtained from the SF-6D administered as an independent instrument (SF-6D(Ind)). The goal was to assess the consistency of respondents answers to these two methods of deriving the SF-6D. Methods: Data were obtained from a sample of the Portuguese population (n = 414). Agreement between the instruments was assessed on the basis of a descriptive system and their indexes. The analysis of the descriptive system was performed by using a global consistency index and an identically classified index. Agreement was also explored by using correlation coefficients. Parametric tests were used to identify differences between the indexes. Regression models were estimated to understand the relationship between them. Results: The SF-6D(Ind) generates higher values than does the SF-6D(SF-36), There were significant differences between the indexes across sociodemographic groups. There was a significant ceiling effect in the SF-6D(Ind) a but not in the SF-6D(SF-36). The correlation between the indexes was high but less than what was anticipated. The global consistency index identified the dimensions with larger differences. Considerable differences were found in two dimensions, possibly as a result of different item contexts. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of the different layouts and the length of the questionnaires in the respondents' answers. Conclusions: The results show that as the SF-6D was designed to derive utilities from the SF-36 it should be used in this way and not as an independent instrument.","[Ferreira, Lara N.; Pereira, Luis N.] Univ Algarve, Escola Super Gestao Hotelaria & Turismo, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Ferreira, Lara N.; Ferreira, Pedro L.] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Hlth Studies & Res, Coimbra, Portugal; [Ferreira, Pedro L.] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Coimbra, Portugal; [Pereira, Luis N.] Univ Algarve, Res Ctr Spatial & Org Dynam, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Rowen, Donna; Brazier, John E.] Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci Sect, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Universidade do Algarve; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade do Algarve; University of Sheffield,"Ferreira, LN (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Escola Super Gestao Hotelaria & Turismo, Campus Penha, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.",Lnferrei@ualg.pt,"Ferreira, Pedro/JXY-5442-2024; Ferreira, Pedro/AAF-4891-2021; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Ferreira, Pedro/HDO-1346-2022; Ferreira, Lara/JJC-2264-2023; Pereira, Luis Nobre/M-8322-2016; Ferreira, Lara/B-7575-2019","Ferreira, Pedro/0000-0002-9448-9542; Pereira, Luis Nobre/0000-0003-0917-7163; Ferreira, Lara/0000-0003-2378-7750; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT),Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank the editor and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions, which have considerably improved an earlier version of the article.

This article presents an analytical framework to illustrate how a disease splits our life expectancy into 1) past health (age), 2) prognosis untreated, 3) gain from treatment, and 4) incurable loss. A Norwegian population sample was asked to make pairwise choices and prioritize hypothetical patients who differed in terms of age (30, 50, and 70 years old), remaining lifetime without treatment (1, 3, and 10 years), and increase in remaining lifetime with treatment (1 month, 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years).

The article starts by describing types of perspectives that are possible (general public, patient, payer, provider, service commissioner, and policymaker). The description of perspectives also explains the importance of understanding the different possible decision criteria and processes from the various perspectives by taking into account budget constraints. The article then focuses on an example of personalized medicine, namely, the use of companion diagnostic-medicine combinations, to describe the role of reimbursement/payer agencies across the European Union to control the introduction and coverage of such companion diagnostic medicine technologies. The article touches on the strategic challenges and the use of economic evidence to introduce personalized medicine from a health policy perspective. The article also draws on empirical studies that have explored patients' and clinicians' views of examples of personalized medicine to illustrate the challenges for developing patient-centered and timely health care services.","[Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Annemans, Lieven] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",University of Manchester; Ghent University,"Payne, K (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, 4th Floor,Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",katherine.payne@manchester.ac.uk,"Payne, Katherine/AAJ-3728-2020","Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350",,,,,22,30,33,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,S,,,S32,S38,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.010,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CS,24034310.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325467800007,0

In this article, we compare, contrast, and endeavor to find areas of alignment across the perspectives of three such stakeholders regulators, the biopharmaceutical and device industry, and U.S. payers. First, we discuss how evidence of HTE is generated and could be improved upon. For pharmaceuticals, much of the initial research is conducted by the pharmaceutical industry, guided by basic science but also delimited by potential markets, regulatory approval requirements, trial size considerations, and payer expectations for evidence of value. Once a drug is marketed, further evidence can be generated via combining trial data, conducting meta analysis, and analyzing real world results through observational research designs; we explore how these efforts can benefit from cooperation across these stakeholders. Second, we discuss the equally important utilization of HTE evidence so that physicians and patients have access to and can benefit from the learnings from this research. Research findings must be translated into actionable information and guidelines that can be incorporated into everyday practice. Doing so requires interaction and collaboration among all involved, based on facilitated communication as well as further evaluation research. We provide examples of several cross-sectorial initiatives that are under way in this area Finally, we explore some economic aspects of HUE research as part of the drug development, marketing, and treatment process. Understanding the economic incentives present is fundamental to aligning those incentives to improve the availability and utilization of HTE evidence. Clear understandings among regulators, pharma, and payers about high-value targets, methods to efficiently generate and communicate information, and value propositions can lead to win-win scenarios for patients, individual payers, the health care system overall, and the future of drug development in producing new medicines.

Due to the potential lack of concavity and the differentiability of the value functions associated with each agent's problem, we employ the theory of monotone comparative statics and supermodular games based on order and monotonicity properties on lattices. In particular, we provide the sufficient conditions of supermodularity for dynamic games with open-loop strategies based on two fundamental elements: the ability to order elements in the strategy space of the agents and the strategic complementarity which implies upward sloping best responses. The supermodular game structure of the model lets us provide the existence and the monotonicity results on the greatest and the least equilibria. We sharpen these results by showing the differentiability of the value function and the uniqueness of the best response correspondences almost everywhere and show that the stationary state Nash equilibria tend to be symmetric. Finally, we numerically analyze to what extent the strategic complementarity inherent in agents' strategies can alter the convergence results that could have emerged under a single agent optimal growth model. In particular, we show that the initially rich can pull the poor out of the poverty trap even when sustaining a higher level of steady state capital stock for itself. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, healthcare reform provisions and proposals to cover the uninsured can be interpreted as an attempt to correct this market failure.

An empirical application to six-variate VAR models shows that the bias of a fully computational estimator is sufficiently large to distort the implied model rankings.

Methods: We performed a cost-utility analysis to compare eight gastroprotective strategies including NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine-2 receptor antagonists, misoprostol, and single-tablet formulations. We derived estimates for outcomes and costs from medical literature. The primary outcome was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of GI complications, compliance rates, and drug costs. Results: For average-risk patients, NSAID + PPI cotherapy was most cost-effective. The NSAID/PPI single-tablet formulation became cost-effective only when its price decreased from (sic)0.78 to (sic)0.56 per tablet, or when PPI compliance fell below 51% in the NSAID + PPI strategy. All other strategies were more costly and less effective. The model was highly sensitive to the GI complication risk, costs of PPI and NSAID/PPI single-tablet formulation, and compliance to PPI. In patients with a threefold higher risk of GI complications, both NSAID + PPI cotherapy and single-tablet formulation were cost-effective. Conclusions: NSAID + PPI cotherapy is the most cost-effective strategy in all patients with chronic arthritis irrespective of their risk for GI complications. For patients with increased GI risk, the NSAID/PPI single-tablet formulation is also cost-effective.","[de Groot, N. L.; van Haalen, H. G. M.; Siersema, P. D.; van Oijen, M. G.

The purpose of this study was to illustrate how this quantity can be captured probabilistically by combining probability elicitation with early health economic modeling. The technology considered was a novel point-of-care testing device in heart failure disease management. Methods: First, we developed a continuous-time Markov model to represent the patients' disease progression under the current care setting. Next, we identified the model parameters that are likely to change after the introduction of the new device and interviewed three cardiologists to capture the probability distributions of these parameters. Finally, we obtained the probability distribution of the commercial headroom available per measurement by propagating the uncertainty in the model inputs to uncertainty in modeled outcomes. Results: For a willingness-to-pay value of (sic)10,000 per life-year, the median headroom available per measurement was (sic)1.64 (interquartile range (sic)0.05-(sic)3.16) when the measurement frequency was assumed to be daily. In the subsequently conducted sensitivity analysis, this median value increased to a maximum of (sic)57.70 for different combinations of the willingness-to-pay threshold and the measurement frequency. Conclusions: Probability elicitation can successfully be combined with early health economic modeling to obtain the probability distribution of the headroom available to a new medical technology. Subsequently feeding this distribution into a product investment evaluation method enables stakeholders to make more informed decisions regarding to which markets a currently available product prototype should be targeted.","[Cao, Qi; Postmus, Douwe; Hillege, Hans L.; Buskens, Erik] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [Hillege, Hans L.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Cardiol, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Cao, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, POB 30001, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands.",q.cao@umcg.nl,"Postmus, Douwe/AAF-5454-2021","Postmus, Douwe/0000-0002-9458-7038; buskens, erik/0000-0002-6463-1106",Center for Translational Molecular Medicine [01C-103]; Dutch Heart Foundation,Center for Translational Molecular Medicine; Dutch Heart Foundation(Netherlands Heart Foundation),"This research was performed within the framework of the Center for Translational Molecular Medicine (www.ctmm.nl), project TRIUMPH (grant no. 01C-103), and supported by the Dutch Heart Foundation.",,29,20,20,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,529,535,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.02.008,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796286.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900011,0

But, the effect of this migration on other dimensions of well-being such as health are less clear and existing evidence is ambiguous because of potential for self-selection bias. In this paper, we use a natural experiment, comparing successful and unsuccessful applicants to a migration lottery to experimentally estimate the impact of migration on measured blood pressure and hypertension. Hypertension is a leading global health problem, as well as being an important health measure that responds quickly to migration. We use various econometric estimators to form bounds on the treatment effects because there appears to be selective non-compliance in the natural experiment. Even with these bounds, the results suggest significant and persistent increases in blood pressure and hypertension, which are likely to have implications for future health budgets given recent increases in developing to developed country migration.
